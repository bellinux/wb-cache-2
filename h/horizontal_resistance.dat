50|$|In genetics, {{the term}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> {{was first used}} by J.E. Vanderplank to {{describe}} many-gene resistance, which is sometimes also called generalized resistance. This contrasts with the term vertical resistance which was used to describe single-gene resistance. Raoul A. Robinson further refined the definition of <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance.</b> Unlike vertical resistance and parasitic ability, <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> and horizontal parasitic ability are entirely independent {{of each other in}} genetic terms.|$|E

40|$|Undoubtedly, modern geoelectric {{technologies}} {{emerge in}} {{the result of the}} development of traditional approaches and techniques. However of more interest is the appearance of completely new technologies based on new effects and new models of interaction of geological medium and electromagnetic field. The author does not commit to indicate principally new directions, but only wants to discuss some poorly known facts from the theory and practice of geoelectrics. The outcome of this study could be considered attracting the attention of experts to non-traditional signals in geoelectrics. The reviewed phenomena of interest, not fully implemented in practice in the author’s opinion, are field split into two polarizations: transverse electric (the ТЕ-field) and transverse magnetic (the ТМ-field), then some poorly known properties of ТМ-field, the role of bias currents, the anisotropy of <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistances,</b> the role of geomagnetic field in geoelectric sounding, the unique resolution of CSEM (Controlled Source Electro-Magnetic) techniques at sea...|$|R
40|$|While the {{extruded}} cement {{panel has}} many advantages compared to drywall, it has limited applicability in buildings {{due to its}} low fire resistance. However, an extruded panel in which the fire resistance has been dramatically enhanced through the addition of a-hemihydrate gypsum is expected to become widely applied as a partition wall or interior material for buildings. To ensure its applicability, certain safety requirements for use, such as the leaning load by residents, the impact by indoor articles, and the fire, {{need to be taken}} into consideration. The {{purpose of this study is}} to review the impact load <b>resistance,</b> <b>horizontal</b> load <b>resistance,</b> and fire resistance as required safety properties for the partition wall and interior materials of the extruded panel that includes a-hemihydrate gypsum. The results of this study show that the impact load resistance of the extruded panel that includes a-hemihydrate gypsum achieves SD grade for industrial buildings, and the <b>horizontal</b> impact load <b>resistance</b> achieves HD grade for public buildings. In addition, it provides fire-resistance for approximately 7 minutes longer than the existing extruded cement panel. Based on this result, it is confirmed the extruded panel incorporating a-hemihydrate gypsum has adequate safety properties for use as partition wall or interior material...|$|R
30|$|Mohan et al. ([2005]) have {{presented}} a simplified approach {{for the design}} of composite slabs. This approach utilizes the results of the slip block test with a simple calculation model to obtain the moment of resistance based on the partial interaction method of composite slab governed by <b>horizontal</b> shear <b>resistance.</b> It is observed that the moment of resistance predicted by the slip block and m-k tests shows good agreement in quantitative terms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>{{resistance}}</b> is {{the resistance}} that invariably remains after a matching allo-infection has occurred. To postulate that <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> {{does not occur}} would be to postulate an absolute susceptibility. Such a level of susceptibility is experimentally unproved, and is theoretically impossible. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> is polygenically inherited {{and it can be}} exhibited at any level between its minimum and its maximum. Its maximum level should provide a virtually complete control of a parasite under conditions of maximum epidemiological competence. Breeding for comprehensive <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> will require simultaneous quantitative improvements and will eventually control all the parasites that have epidemiological competence in a particular agro-ecosystem. (5). However, because epidemiological competence is so variable, a cultivar that is in balance with one agro-ecosystem, is likely to be unbalanced in another agro-ecosystem, having too much resistance to some parasites and too little to others.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} importance {{is the concept}} of parasite interference, first defined by Vanderplank, who called it the cryptic error in field trials. Parasite interference does not affect the demonstration of vertical resistance, but it can totally destroy the evidence for high levels of <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance.</b> This factor, which has only recently been recognised, largely explains the almost total neglect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> during the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater the}} area of a uniform host {{population}} with a single vertical resistance, the more dangerous that resistance becomes. This is because of an increased selection pressure for the matching parasite, and an increased loss when the matching does occur. The greater {{the area of}} uniformity of vertical resistance, therefore, the greater the danger. Conversely, the greater the area of a uniform host population with high horizontal resistances, the more effective the <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> becomes. This is because parasite interference declines as the area of a horizontally resistant host population increases, and it is least when the entire crop of a region has {{a high level of}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> in all of its cultivars. The greater the area of uniformity of <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance,</b> therefore, the greater the security.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTIn this study, {{the model}} tests were {{conducted}} on the short piles installed in sands under a horizontal pullout load to investigate their behavior characteristics. From the horizontal loading tests where dimensions of the pile diameter and length, and loading point were varied, the <b>horizontal</b> pullout <b>resistance</b> and the rotational and translational movement pattern of the pile were investigated. As a result, the <b>horizontal</b> pullout <b>resistance</b> of the pile embedded in sands was dependent on the pile length, diameter, loading point, etc. The ultimate horizontal pullout load tended to increase as the loading point (h/L) moved to the bottom {{from the top of}} the pile, regardless of the ratio between the pile length and diameter (L/D), reached the maximum value at the point of h/L = 0. 75, and decreased afterwards. When the horizontal pullout load acted on the upper part above the middle of the pile, the pile rotated clockwise and moved to the pullout direction, and the pivot point of the pile was located at 150 – 360 mm depth below the ground surface. On the other hand, when the horizontal pullout load acted on the lower part of the pile, the pile rotated counterclockwise and travelled horizontally, and the rotational angle was very small...|$|R

The first step of the {{experiment was}} to prepare pure culture ofStaphylococcus aureus and Coagulase Negative Staphylococci. Milk samples were collected from mastitic cases at the afternoonmilking time. Preparation of pure culture of isolates were confirmed by MS agar, hemolytic activity, catalase and coagulase test.

The result showed that the both isolates of Staphylococcus aureus andCoagulase Negative Staphylococci from Surabaya dairy herd were resistant against erythromycin antibiotic.

5000|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>{{resistance}}</b> {{does not}} involve a gene-for-gene relationship. It is the resistance that invariably remains after vertical resistance has been matched.

40|$|Multispecies {{bacterial}} communities {{such as the}} microbiota of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} can be remarkably stable and resilient even though they consist of cells and species that compete for resources and also produce {{a large number of}} antimicrobial agents. Computational modeling suggests that <b>horizontal</b> transfer of <b>resistance</b> genes may greatly contribute to the formation of stable and diverse communities capable of protecting themselves with a battery of antimicrobial agents while preserving a varied metabolic repertoire of the constituent species. In other words <b>horizontal</b> transfer of <b>resistance</b> genes makes a community compatible in terms of exoproducts and capable to maintain a varied and mature metagenome. The same property may allow microbiota to protect a host organism, or if used as a microbial therapy, to purge pathogens and restore a protective environment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} find the {{relationship}} between the cone resistances measured in horizontally and vertically aligned cone penetration tests, a test series has been performed in a 2 m. diameter rigid wall calibration chamber using a 36 mm. cone. This calibration chamber contains an unsaturated uniform sand, which can be prepared at different densities. It is found that the <b>horizontal</b> cone <b>resistance</b> is higher than the vertical cone resistance at a given point, whilst the side friction is lower horizontally than vertically. A simple cavity expansion model is used to explain the ratio of horizontal over vertical cone resistance. ...|$|R

5000|$|Auto-infection {{means that}} the {{parasite}} originates on, or in, the host that it is infecting. Auto-infection and all {{the consequences of a}} matching allo-infection, can be controlled only by <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance.</b> This is because the parasite individual reproduces asexually to produce a clone (or else reproduces sexually and quickly reaches homogeneity of matching individuals) and auto-infection is thus matching infection.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{vertical}} resistance {{was first used}} by J.E. Vanderplank to describe single-gene resistance.

50|$|In {{the first}} round of {{breeding}} for <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance,</b> plants are exposed to pathogens and selected for partial resistance. Those with no resistance die, and plants unaffected by the pathogen have vertical resistance and are removed. The remaining plants have partial resistance and their seed is stored and bred back up to sufficient volume for further testing. The hope is that in these remaining plants are multiple types of partial-resistance genes, and by crossbreeding this pool back on itself, multiple partial resistance genes will come together and provide resistance to a larger variety of pathogens.|$|E
50|$|One way {{in which}} the {{expression}} of certain genes has been found to combat P. coronata avenae is through the production of avenalumins. Avenalumins are antimicrobial compounds which inhibit hyphal growth, thus preventing P. coronata from spreading. Avenalumins are only found in infected areas of plants and nowhere else. The production of avenalumins is regulated by some of the same genes that have been found to confer resistance in certain lines of oats, thus indicating their importance in resistance. In addition to total resistance to specific races, in such cases as the production avenalumins, partial or <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> provides a way to reduce the effect of P. coronata.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} a design method for improving the ground around piles using the vacuum consolidation method, one of various ground improvement methods, and using the increased ground strength to reflect onto the <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> of piles. This is a rational design method that can reduce construction costs for site conditions with soft ground, where <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> determines pile specifications. In this design method, the range of influence of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance,</b> or the range of ground improvement requiring the vacuum consolidation method, is set from 1 /β (the characteristic length of piles: β= 4 √(KD) /(4 EyI)) to the range of passive earth pressure,θ= 45 °+φ/ 2. The horizontal subgrade reaction of piles is determined by converting the shear strength C of ground, increased by consolidation, to the modulus of deformation E. The validity of the design method was empirically verified by applying it to an actual site and conducting horizontal loading tests on actual piles. The seismic behavior of the piles in the improved ground was examined using the conventional earthquake-resistant design method...|$|E

5000|$|Resistance is termed durable if it {{continues}} to be effective over multiple years of widespread use as pathogen populations evolve.

40|$|Monitoring {{the genetic}} {{variation}} for <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> to late blight {{in the most}} advanced sources of <b>horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> to late blight—population B group three cycle one (B 3 C 1) —has been carried out at CIP by assessing the amount of genetic variance for resistance and tuber yield. A random sample of resistant clones from B 3 C 1 were used to obtain progenies according to mating designs NC Design I and Line x Tester. Resulting progenies were evaluated for resistance to late blight and total tuber yield in the field under high disease pressure at Comas, Peru. Three independent estimates of herita-bility, including parent-offspring regression for area under the disease progress curve (taken as a parameter for resistance), were high and reason-ably close (h 2 = 0. 48, h 2 = 0. 53, and h 2 = 0. 40). Additive genetic variance and heritability for resistance in this population are large enough to ensure further progress from selection. In 1990, CIP began a program to improve potato populations by increasing gene frequencies for quantitative (<b>horizontal)</b> <b>resistance</b> to late blight. This program also aimed to more systematically upgrade and maintain desirable characteristics of economic importance, such as tuber yield, dry matter content, early tuberization, and bulking. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>resistance</b> to late blight {{was considered to be}} the major crop-protection trait needed in new varieties to face the increasing threat of a re-emergent potato disease.

40|$|In {{many cases}} the {{capacity}} of composite slabs with profiled steel sheeting depends on the shear resistance at the sheet-concrete interface. This shear resistance {{is essential to the}} interaction between the steel sheeting and the concrete. Besides this, other factors also affect the behaviour of composite slabs. The first aim {{of this study is to}} find an effective method to measure the shear resistance at the concrete-sheet interface. Secondly, it aims to study the influence of different parameters on the load bearing capacity and behaviour of composite slabs without performing a large number of full-scale tests. The behaviour of composite slabs was investigated experimentally. A small-scale test, the concrete block bending test, was developed to measure the shear resistance at the concrete-sheet interface. The obtained shear flow-slip relation was then used in a numerical simulation using the finite element method. Moreover, six full-scale composite slabs with profiled steel sheet PEVA 45 were tested to determine the shear capacity of the slabs. The test results were evaluated according to the Swedish code and were used for comparison with the results from numerical simulations. A two-dimensional finite element model was used to study the behaviour of one-way composite slabs. It was found that the concrete strength only slightly affected the capacity of the slabs. The <b>horizontal</b> shear <b>resistance</b> at the sheet-concrete interface and the strength of the steel sheet were the most important factors. It was also found that the actual influence of <b>horizontal</b> shear <b>resistance</b> and the strength of the steel sheet depended on the failure modes of the slabs. Comparatively, the resistance for vertical separation had little effect and the influence can be neglected in the analysis. The behaviour of two-way composite slabs which were simply supported at four edges were investigated by a three-dimensional finite element model. It was found that the load transferred in two directions depended on a span to span ratio of the slabs. Compared with one-way slabs, two-way composite slabs had the advantages of a small deflection, a small end-slip and a high capacity...|$|R
