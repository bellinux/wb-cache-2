However, 25 % to 30 % of imatinib-treated patients develop <b>drug</b> resistance or <b>intolerance,</b> increasing the risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. In 2006, the European LeukemiaNet proposed criteria to identify patients with a suboptimal response to, or failure associated with, imatinib; these recom-mendations were updated in 2009. Suboptimal responders represent a unique treatment challenge. Although they may respond to continued imatinib therapy, their long-term outcomes may not be as favorable as those for optimally responding patients. Validation studies demonstrated that suboptimal responders are a heterogeneous group, and that the prognostic implications of suboptimal response vary by time point. There are few data derived from clinical trials to guide therapeutic decisions for these patients. Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this setting. Identification of suboptimal responders or patients failing treatment using hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular techniques allows physicians to alter therapy earlier in the treatment course to improve long-term outcomes.

In the present report, we analyse the value, safety and possible indications for preresective SETA in cases of large toxic goitres. Patients and method the study group comprised 10 patients with large toxic goitre (thyroid volume 254 ± 50 mL), including one patient with cervicomediastinal goitre and one patient with anti-thyroid <b>drug</b> <b>intolerance</b> in state of overt thyrotoxicosis. All the patients underwent SETA of the superior and/or inferior thyroid arteries, followed by thyroidectomy, performed up to thirty-six hours after SETA (23. 1 ± 11 h). After embolization, selective angiographies of thyroid arteries were performed to ensure that the targeted arteries had been completely occluded. Results and conclusion in all the patients, SETA decreased blood flow through the thyroid. Preresective SETA reduced blood loss during and after thyroidectomy and decreased the operating time, but the differences were too small to justify routine applications of preresective SETA as an adjunct to surgical treatment of toxic goitre. On the other hand, SETA is a safe and minimally-invasive technique, which may become an attractive option for quick preparation to surgery in selected patients with toxic goitre, who present anti-thyroid <b>drug</b> <b>intolerance</b> or refuse radioactive iodine treatment. </p...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of combination therapy in recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with dose adjustments determined by response, in a clinic setting over 3 years. METHODS: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) -naive patients with RA of median duration of 12 weeks (n = 61) attending an early arthritis clinic were treated with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and fish oil. Dosage adjustments and additions of further DMARDs were contingent on response to therapy and tolerance. Outcome measures for efficacy were Disease Activity Score (DAS 28), clinical remission, and modified Sharp radiographic score and for safety, adverse events, and DMARD withdrawal. RESULTS: At baseline, subjects had at least moderately active disease (mean +/- SD DAS 28 was 5. 3 +/- 1. 1), impaired function {{as measured by the}} modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) (0. 9 +/- 0. 5), and 37 % had bone erosions. By 3 months, 29 % were in remission; this increased to 54 % at 3 years. The greatest fall in DAS 28 and improvement in mHAQ scores occurred in the first 12 months. Erosions were detected in 62 % at 3 years. The mean dose of parenteral glucocorticoid was equivalent to 0. 1 mg/d of prednisolone. After 3 years, 48 % remained on triple therapy; fish oil was consumed by 75 % of patients, and 21 % used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <b>drugs.</b> Gastrointestinal <b>intolerance</b> was the most frequent unwanted event (leading to DMARD withdrawal in 17 patients). Sulfasalazine was most frequently withdrawn (30 %). CONCLUSION: This implementation study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of combination therapy with inexpensive DMARDs, fish oil, and minimal glucocorticoid use, in routine clinical practice using predefined rules for dosage adjustment.

40|$|Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) causes chronic {{lung disease}} in immunocompetent people and disseminated {{infection}} {{in patients with}} AIDS. MAC is intrinsically resistant to many conventional antimycobacterial agents, it develops drug resistance rapidly to macrolide antibiotics, and patients with MAC infection experience frequent relapses or the inability to completely eradicate the infection with current treatment. Treatment regimens are prolonged and complicated by <b>drug</b> toxicity or <b>intolerances.</b> We sought to identify biochemical pathways in MAC that can serve as targets for novel antimycobacterial treatment. The cytochrome P 450 enzyme, CYP 51, catalyzes an essential early step in sterol metabolism, removing a methyl group from lanosterol in animals and fungi, or from obtusifoliol in plants. Azoles inhibit CYP 51 function, leading to an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This perturbation of normal sterol metabolism compromises cell membrane integrity, resulting in growth inhibition or cell death. We have cloned and characterized a CYP 51 from MAC that functions as a lanosterol 14 α-demethylase. We show the direct interactions of azoles with purified MAC-CYP 51 by absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of econazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole against MAC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that econazole has a MIC of 4 μg/ml and a minimum bacteriocidal concentration of 4 μg/ml, whereas ketoconazole has a MIC of 8 μg/ml and a minimum bacteriocidal concentration of 16 μg/ml.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{approach to}} JIA is sometimes very troublesome and progression to erosive polyarthritis may occur in all JIA categories. Only Methotrexate has shown efficacy and safety {{in a large}} controlled trial. Nevertheless, in many cases, <b>drug</b> resistance or <b>intolerance</b> has led to try other therapeutic options, with still debatable results. Therefore, there has been space, {{in the last few}} years, for new therapies as the TNF-inhibitors. This therapeutic approach has shown a dramatic clinical benefit in active polyarticular refractory JIA: the rate and rapidity of response have exceeded those of all other studied DMARDs. Preliminary data show that they are efficacious also for other pediatric rheumatic disease (spondyloarthropathies, autoimmune uveitis, dermatomyositis, Kawasaki syndrome and some auto- inflammatory diseases). TNF-inhibitors in JIA have demonstrated a favourable benefit-to-risk profile. However, as their use has increased worldwide, some unusual, usually not serious, adverse events have emerged. Severe infections, including TB, and deaths have been reported. Long-lasting active disease, systemic disease, concurrent and previous immunosuppressive therapies, all contribute to risk of infection and other serious AEs. Given the evidence that TNF has a primary role in the pathogenesis of JIA, particularly in joint destruction, neutralizing this cytokine early, within the window of opportunity, could halt or delay progression of joint damage and debilitating consequences of the disease. Thus, for JIA patients whose disease is not quickly controlled with MTX, TNF blockers may be considered as first-line treatment, although long-term safety data still need to be established...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The goal of {{personalized}} medicine {{is to provide}} patients optimal drug screening and treatment based on individual genomic or proteomic profiles. Reverse-Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology offers proteomic information of cancer patients which may be directly related to drug sensitivity. For cancer patients with different drug sensitivity, the proteomic profiling reveals important pathophysiologic information {{which can be used}} to predict chemotherapy responses. Results The goal {{of this paper is to}} present a framework for {{personalized medicine}} using both RPPA and drug sensitivity (<b>drug</b> resistance or <b>intolerance).</b> In the proposed personalized medicine system, the prediction of drug sensitivity is obtained by a proposed augmented naive Bayesian classifier (ANBC) whose edges between attributes are augmented in the network structure of naive Bayesian classifier. For discriminative structure learning of ANBC, local classification rate (LCR) is used to score augmented edges, and greedy search algorithm is used to find the discriminative structure that maximizes classification rate (CR). Once a classifier is trained by RPPA and drug sensitivity using cancer patient samples, the classifier is able to predict the drug sensitivity given RPPA information from a patient. Conclusion In this paper we proposed a framework for personalized medicine where a patient is profiled by RPPA and drug sensitivity is predicted by ANBC and LCR. Experimental results with lung cancer data demonstrate that RPPA can be used to profile patients for drug sensitivity prediction by Bayesian network classifier, and the proposed ANBC for personalized cancer medicine achieves better prediction accuracy than naive Bayes classifier in small sample size data on average and outperforms other the state-of-the-art classifier methods in terms of classification accuracy. </p...|$|R
