5|$|Although the {{official}} NASA flight {{plan called for}} a crew rest period before <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity,</b> Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened and Armstrong {{made his way down}} the ladder first.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1994, NASA {{declared}} the mission a complete success {{and showed the}} first sharper images. The mission {{was one of the}} most complex performed up until that date, involving five long <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity</b> periods. Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-30 was {{the first}} privately funded manned space {{expedition}} but several other firsts were also achieved, including the first privately funded <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity,</b> and the first privately funded unmanned resupply mission to a space station, utilizing the Progress-M1 spacecraft. Soyuz TM-30 also managed to delay the de-orbit of Mir, which was originally scheduled to occur some time in 2000, but ultimately occurred in March 2001.|$|E

5|$|When workers leave a {{pressurized}} caisson or a {{mine that}} has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience {{a significant reduction in}} ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity,</b> where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As of May 12, 2017, {{there have}} been 200 spacewalks devoted to {{assembly}} and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1247 hours and 55 minutes. As of March 2, 2011, a total time of 973 hours and fifty-three minutes has been spent in <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity</b> (EVA), with 127 of these EVAs performed from station airlocks, totaling 787 hours and twenty-eight minutes in spacewalk time from the station itself. Twenty-eight spacewalks have been performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint Airlock, thirty-two from the Pirs docking compartment, and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda Service Module.|$|E
5|$|The mission's only <b>Extra-Vehicular</b> <b>Activity,</b> or spacewalk, {{took place}} on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary {{objectives}} of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir's exterior components and record panoramas of the station's hull in order for experts on Earth to analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station. They discovered that a burnt-through wire connecting the array with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. The array was subsequently deemed a loss.|$|E

50|$|In May 1993, Fuglesang {{and fellow}} ESA {{astronaut}} Thomas Reiter {{were selected for}} the Euromir 95 mission and commenced training at TsPK (Moscow) in preparation for their onboard engineer tasks, <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activities</b> (spacewalks) and operation of the Soyuz spacecraft. The Euromir 95 experiment training was organized and mainly carried out at EAC.|$|R
5|$|The crew {{assignments}} for Gemini8 {{were announced}} on September 20, 1965, with Armstrong as Command Pilot and David Scott as Pilot. Scott {{was the first}} member of the third group of astronauts to receive a prime crew assignment. The mission launched on March 16, 1966; it was to be the most complex yet, with a rendezvous and docking with the unmanned Agena target vehicle, the second American <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity</b> (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10a.m. EST, the Titan II carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02am EST, putting them into an orbit from where they would chase the Agena.|$|E
5|$|The crew of EO-19 {{conducted}} {{their first}} <b>Extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity,</b> or spacewalk, on July 14. Before the mission, {{the crew had}} trained to use special tools in order to release a stuck solar array on {{the exterior of the}} Spektr module. During the spacewalk, the pair cut a problematic restraint from the solar array. All but one section of the array deployed successfully. They then proceeded to inspect a docking mechanism in preparation for the relocation of the Kristall module. The final task of the spacewalk was to inspect a solar array on Kristall that was not tracking the Sun properly. The excursion ended after five hours and thirty-four minutes outside the station.|$|E
5|$|The studies {{looked at}} {{minimizing}} required {{modifications to the}} Gemini spacecraft. Three docking methods were considered. The first was use of the existing docking system used on Gemini-Agena missions. This would have allowed the mission to be accomplished with little modification to the Gemini spacecraft needed, however crew transfer {{could only have been}} accomplished by means of an <b>Extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity</b> (EVA). Changes that would have been required included strengthening the nose, installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn, adding the necessary equipment to perform the transfer EVA, and providing provisions for flight to and from the station. The number of retro-rockets would have been increased from four to six. A second method would have seen the spacecraft dock in the same way, but after docking, the spacecraft would be swung round and attached {{to the side of the}} space station. A tunnel would then have been placed over the Gemini's hatches, allowing the crew to transfer to the station without performing an EVA. Some modifications to the hatches would have been required. The final proposed docking method was to use a port mounted on the rear of the equipment module, which would have allowed the crew to transfer directly between the spacecraft and space station, through the docking port.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{triplicate}} planning for telerobotics applicable to space stations is needed.

25|$|Gemini's {{objective}} was {{the development of}} space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon.

25|$|After {{launching}} {{aboard the}} Shuttle Discovery, Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to Locks of Love. Fellow astronaut Joan Higginbotham cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was {{brought back to}} Earth by the STS-116 crew. Williams performed her first <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activity</b> on the eighth day of the STS-116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with Michael López-Alegría. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.|$|E

50|$|In space, astronauts use a space suit, {{essentially}} a self-contained individual spacecraft, to do spacewalks, or <b>extra-vehicular</b> <b>activities</b> (EVAs).
