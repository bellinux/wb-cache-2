50|$|An {{inspection}} is, most generally, {{an organized}} examination or formal evaluation exercise.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the impacts of aquatic {{invasive}} species preventative measures on recreation displacement of bass fishermen from Central Coast lakes. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to participants at a local bass fishing tournament. Thirty-six respondents completed the questionnaire. The results indicated that boat <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> do not necessarily cause bass fishermen to displace. This study found that fishermen are likely to avoid recreating at a Central Coast lake in fishing practice conditions rather than in tournament conditions, and are likely to avoid tournaments at their least favorite lake if boat <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> take too long. It is recommended that Central Coast lake counties assess why the boat inspection process is not consistent in duration among these lakes, and land management agencies should consider implementing uniform <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> at all three lake counties...|$|R

The aircraft returned to Varadero, Cuba, where they made a safe landing. The crew made no unusual rudder inputs during the flight nor was the rudder being manipulated when it failed; there was no obvious fault in the rudder or yaw-damper system. Subsequent investigation determined that Airbus' <b>inspection</b> <b>procedure</b> for the composite rudder was inadequate; inspection procedures for composite structures on airliners were changed following this accident.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} PAR flight <b>inspection</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is performed}} without a navigation signal available to compare {{directly to a}} truth reference. A traditional PAR is flight inspected by comparing written notes between two observers, one taking notes at a truth reference system such as a theodolite and the other observer taking notes while observing the radar console, see ICAO Document 8071. The Transponder Landing System (TLS) non-traditional PAR can transmit an ILS signal that corresponds to the aircraft position relative to the precision approach. Therefore, the graphical depiction can be directly verified using Instrument Landing System (ILS) flight inspection techniques. This direct measurement removes some ambiguity from the PAR flight inspection process.|$|E

The EVA <b>inspection</b> <b>procedure</b> was implemented following STS-116, when a cut was found on Robert Curbeam's glove following an EVA. The EVA suit comprises five layers of material, and the second layer, called vectran, is a high strength material resistant to tearing. Mastracchio's tear was into the vectran layer. Prior to the next EVA, video analysis will be done of the path Mastracchio took during the spacewalk {{in an attempt to}} discover where the tear may have occurred. An analysis of Mastracchio's glove during the previous two EVAs will also be performed.|$|E

The right-hand horizontal stabiliser — including the elevator assembly — detached during the approach as a result of metal fatigue, causing loss of pitch control. Other factors included the rear spar structure's inadequate fail-safe design, the safety regulator's design assessment and certification process as well as the <b>inspection</b> <b>procedure</b> adopted by the aircraft's operator.
