500|$|In a {{surprising}} choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, {{who was not}} a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, [...] "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve [...] [...] [...] If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't know if I would <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> the player I was and played in the NFL." [...] In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed [...] "Quarterback U" [...] as a result.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, however, celebrity gossip site TMZ {{reported}} {{that according to}} multiple sources that the reason Muhney was allegedly let go from the soap was because Muhney had sexually harassed co-star Hunter King (who portrays Summer Newman).

She went to higher-ups and complained recently Muhney had fondled her breasts on 2 occasions — and she said both were unsolicited and unwanted." [...] The rumor generated significant negative publicity for the soap opera; Margaret Eby of the New York Daily News wrote, [...] "The set of [...] "The Young and the Restless" [...] may <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a real life soap opera thanks to star Michael Muhney, who was allegedly fired for groping one of his co-workers." [...] Fox News {{reported that}} several viewers were upset by Muhney's firing and the sexual harassment allegations, writing: [...] "Many Y fans were none too pleased to find out Muhney was leaving, and several blasted the allegations." [...] TMZ later reported that angered viewers had paid US$785 to have an airplane fly over CBS Studios in Los Angeles with a banner to have Muhney rehired, and the plane flew three days later. Muhney made his final appearance on January 30, 2014. In August 2014, Muhney claimed on his Twitter page that the allegations were indeed false {{and it was only}} a salacious rumor.|$|E
