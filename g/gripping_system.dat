40|$|Typical {{gripping}} kinematics {{for industrial}} robots have a fixed geometry which {{is suitable for}} only one specific part. So the reutilisation for other parts is restricted and associated with high effort for manual changeover. The presented poster shows a flexible <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> {{with the possibility of}} self-adaptation to different workpieces. The adaptation is based on a robot-guided <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> having a large number of passive joints without motion drives. These passive joints are normally fixed during operation and can be released in case of reconfiguration. The robot trajectory to reconfigure the <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> is calculated using the 3 D CAD data of the part. Restraints during the robot reconfiguration will be compensated with a sensor-controlled algorithm...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} match a {{predicted}} production ramp-up in aircraft production, {{state of the}} art manufacturing techniques have to be optimized regarding productivity and efficiency. Especially vacuum infusion techniques for large CFRP structures still involve a high amount of manual work. In detail, the vacuum bagging depends on manual lay-up processes of auxiliary materials. A first approach of automation concepts for robot-based vacuum bagging will be discussed in this paper. In a research project at the Center for Leigtweight Production Technology in Augsburg, automated manufacturing of a single-curved CFRP fuselage demonstrator has been investigated. A rigid <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> with needle grippers has been developed and validated for the application of auxiliary materials as peel ply, release film and airweave {{on the top of a}} dry fiber preform. Alongside the process chain, handling and positioning procedures have been analyzed both analytically and in experimental test series. According to the rigidity of the <b>gripping</b> <b>system,</b> an adequate motion concept for the fuselage demonstrator has been found. The <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> allows pick-up, transportation and positioning of auxiliary material packages on a single-curved preform with high accuracy. Based on these results conclusions for future vacuum bagging processes can be drawn...|$|E

The method involves compression of grit-blasted laminate between grit-blasted metal to give a non-slipping interface for load transfer. Tensile testing at both 316 C and room temperature indicated that deformation was elastic to fracture and that the variation in tensile properties for one laminate {{is the same as}} that for several panels. In addition, the tensile properties for uniaxial PMR 15 /Celion 6000 are identical at 316 C and room temperature. For nominally 51 volume percent fiber, the elastic modulus is 119. 6 GPa, the fracture stress is 1370 MPa, and the strain to fracture is about 1. 15 percent. In addition, data are presented which indicate that the <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> can be used for long term, elevated temperature testing of composite materials...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper investigates robotic {{assembly}} {{by focusing}} on the manipulation of microparts. This task is formalized through the notion of basic tasks which are organized in a logical sequence represented by a function chart and interpreted as the model of the behavior of the experimental setup. The latter includes a robotic system, a <b>gripping</b> <b>system,</b> an imaging system, and a clean environment. The imaging system is a photon videomicroscope able to work at multiple scales. It is modelled by a linear projective model where the relation between the scale factor and the magnification or zoom is explicitly established. So, the usual visual control law is modified in order to take into account this relation. The manipulation of some silicon microparts (400 μm× 400 μm× 100 μm) by means of a distributed robotic system (xyθ system, ϕz system), a two-finger <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> and a controllable zoom and focus videomicroscope shows the relevance of the concepts.

40|$|The {{final results}} are {{reported}} {{for a study}} to identify and correct the causes of nongage-section failures (notably button-head failures) in ceramic tensile specimens observed in several laboratories. Numerical modeling of several candidate specimen <b>gripping</b> <b>systems</b> has shown inherent stress concentrations near the specimen button head at which the maximum stress may approach 75 to 100 % of the gage-section stress for certain grip conditions. Empirical comparisons of both tapered- and straight-collet <b>gripping</b> <b>systems</b> revealed compromises in both systems. The straight-collet system, with deformable collets, is simpler to use but produces statistically significant greater average percent bending for all tests than those produced for the tapered-collet system, which is slightly more difficult to use. Empirical tensile tests of {approx} 50 aluminium oxide and {approx} 50 silicon nitride specimens were conducted to evaluate the loading capability of both <b>gripping</b> <b>systems,</b> the percent bending in each system, and the potential of consistently producing successful test results. These tests revealed that, due to variations in individual specimens or the individual specimen/grip interfaces, neither of the <b>gripping</b> <b>systems</b> can consistently produce bending of less than 3 to 4 % at failure although occasional values of {approx} 0. 5 % bending were attained. Refinements of grinding procedures and dimensional measurement techniques have shown critical details in both the practices and consistency of machining necessary for achieving the dimensional tolerances while minimizing subsurface damage. Numerical integration techniques indicate that up to a consistent 5. 0 % bending during fast-fracture tests can be tolerated before large influences are detected in {{the determination of the}} Weibull modulus and the Weibull characteristic strength...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a concept and presents the experimental results for robotic end-effector operation for handling product {{items that are}} flexible or variable in physical properties such as size, shape or firmness and also {{describes a}} scheme by which a manipulator can use dynamic tactile sensing to detect when it is about to lose hold of a grasped object and take preventive measures before gross sliding occurs. This paper also elaborates the mechanical, sensing and control issues of such a system and presents results on a novel modular <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> developed for this purpose. By detecting localized slips on the gripping surface which precede gross slip, the controller can modify the grasp force to prevent the object from slipping. Accurate knowledge of slip is essential when grasping fragile objects or manipulations with sliding. A tactile sensor enables a robot, cybernetic device or other appropriate automatic mechanism to sense an object, to measure the force of contact, and to determine the force required to seize an object. The tactile sensor used in this experiment predicts the partial slip of a tactile surface by sensing micro vibrations in tangential forces which are caused by {{the expansion of the}} slip regions within the contact area. Finally a summary of contributions is listed and the advantages of using this intelligent <b>gripping</b> <b>system</b> is elaborated...|$|E
