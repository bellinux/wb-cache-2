40|$|Individuals with {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} (BPD) fre-quently present to hospital emergency services with sui-cidal ideation or behaviour (1). Although threats of suicide outnumber actual suicide attempts, these patients are prob-lematic {{for mental health}} professionals because the risk of sui-cide is high, with rates approaching those found in other major psychiatric disorders. Davis and colleagues estimated that pa-tients with BPD have about a 10 % lifetime risk of suicide (2). Clinicians are often troubled when hospitalizing patients with BPD, not knowing whether this course of action will benefit or worsen the patient’s crisis. Clinical lore has long suggested that patients with BPD regress during hospitalization, and an inpatient stay {{may be associated with}} disruptive behaviour, including self-harm behaviours, aggression, and noncompli-ance with ward routine (3). Little empirical evidence is avail-able to guide the clinician <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> whether <b>hospitalization</b> will improve or worsen these behaviours. Two recent studies provide some empirical evidence on this issue. Faulkner and colleagues compared hospitalized adoles-cents with and without BPD regarding the occurrence of restraints, seclusions, incidents of self-abuse and aggression...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} which available information at an Emergency Room (ER) consultation {{is associated with}} hospitalization or death among children with pneumonia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The ER of one university and one private hospital. MEASUREMENT: Using stepwise logistic regression we analyzed factors that showed a univariate association. MAIN RESULTS: Of 2, 970 cases, the median age was 1. 83 years (range 2 days to 14. 5 yrs, mean 2. 76 + 2. 72 yrs); 25. 8 % were hospitalized and 0. 8 % died. Age (2 - 11 mos, OR 0. 4 [0. 2 - 0. 6]; 12 - 59 mos, OR 0. 2 [0. 1 - 0. 4]; &sup 3; 5 yrs, OR 0. 1 [0. 08 - 0. 3]), malnutrition (OR 2. 0 [1. 4 - 2. 7]), underlying chronic illness (OR 1. 4 [1. 1 - 1. 8]), tachypnea (OR 1. 8 [1. 4 - 2. 4]), chest indrawing (OR 1. 7 [1. 4 - 2. 2]), and somnolence (OR 1. 8 [1. 4 - 2. 4]) were associated with hospitalization and age (2 - 11 mos, OR 0. 3 [0. 08 - 0. 8]; &sup 3; 12 mos, OR 0. 06 [0. 02 - 0. 2]), malnutrition (OR 3. 1 [1. 2 - 7. 7]) and underlying chronic illness (OR 4. 3 [1. 6 - 11. 0]) were associated with death in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Several clinical aspects may be used <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> need for <b>hospitalization</b> (i. e. young age, malnutrition, underlying chronic illness, tachypnea, chest indrawing and somnolence) for children with pneumonia seen at the ER. Individual intrinsic factors such as age, malnutrition and underlying chronic illness were independently associated with death.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived health one year after hospitalization (T 2) and SOC at baseline (T 1) among persons aged 65 years or more without cognitive impairment. Patients at a public general hospital in Norway were followed up 1 year after inclusion. At T 1, SOC, depression and anxiety, physical health and functional status were <b>assessed.</b> <b>Hospitalizations</b> between T 1 and T 2 were recorded.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{presence}} of a prospective association between cognition and functional outcome in first episode patients with schizophrenia is much debated.

However, assessing associations between cognitive measures <b>assessed</b> at first <b>hospitalization</b> and subsequent functional outcome, can give inconclusive results due to non-uniform intellectual deterioration from premorbid level in the period preceding the first hospitalization. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide a detailed comparative microcosting analysis for two cancer treatment pathways to contribute evidence for resource allocation and operational decision-making in a Canadian cancer care context. MethodsWe estimated direct medical costs (in 2004 CAN$) of the entire pathway of care for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in a large Canadian cancer treatment center. Patient samples were defined as those who received R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; n = 85) or CHOP (i. e., without rituximab; n = 86) as first-line treatment. All subsequent treatments including palliative care for these patient samples were <b>assessed.</b> <b>Hospitalization</b> costs and unit costs of medical resources were collected from integrated medical organizations. Individual patient resource consumption was assessed via medical chart review. ResultsFor first-line treatment, drug cost was the largest contributor to total cost, followed by hospitalization cost. Rituximab was the largest contributor to mean cost differences between R-CHOP and CHOP treatments. For treatments subsequent to first-line treatment, no significant cost differences were found. Hospitalization and transplantation costs were the two largest constituents of total costs subsequent to first-line treatment, followed by drug cost. Patients with advanced stage disease cost significantly more than patients with limited stage disease. ConclusionThis is the first detailed microcosting study that has employed consistent local data to estimate total medical costs for DLBCL patients in Canada. This information is useful for resource allocation planning and operational decisions, because it provides more substantive, relevant evidence as compared to aggregated, literature or extrapolated information...|$|R
