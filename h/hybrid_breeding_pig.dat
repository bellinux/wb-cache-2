All <b>pigs</b> {{were taken from the}} routine testing scheme. The analysis of carcass traits showed that pigs of line 03 were clearly leaner than those of line 01. Only in backfat thickness no significant difference could be observed. For the belly, a clear difference of 7 % was found in percentage of lean. Lean content of the belly was also estimated by means of various multiple regressions using carcass traits. Percentage of lean predicted by the official equation used in German performance testing {{on the one hand and}} by means of MRI on the other hand was different particularly in line 03. A correlation of r = 0. 67 and r = 0. 82 between lean content determined by means of MRI and multiple regression was found for line 01 and line 03, respectively. To study the Variation between sires, variance components were estimated. Differences between sires were higher in lean content of the belly compared to backfat thickness, a trait which has been used in selection for a long time...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{characterize}} the farrowing process in gilts and multiparous sows in terms of duration of farrowing, birth intervals, birth weight, piglets born alive, stillbirth, mummified and dystocia by comparing means in terms of parities, and to establish criteria for a method to automatically detect the first birth and dystocia in <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for a selected farm in South Korea. One hundred nine Yorkshire x Landrace; YL, Landrace x Yorkshire; LY which were mainly raised in South Korea were used for this study (31 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for parity 1; 48 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for parity 2 to 6; 30 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for parity 7 to 12). Though the results varied from one another, we didn 2 ̆ 7 t find any statistical significant differences within the observed parameters from the different parities studied. Given that our findings were still within the range values of the previously published works therefore our results can be a useful tool to establish a criterion to characterize the process of parturition. In this present study, we were able to established a criteria about the onset of birth by the observation that if a first discharged object is detected from a sow that weighs more than 400 g, it can be confirm that she is already been undergoing the process of farrowing and the good criterion to consider that a sow is undergoing dystocia is an interval of more than 30 min. Moreover, we believe that the parity of <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> is not necessarily required in establishing criterion in detecting the onset of farrowing and dystocia because we found no significant difference results among the different parities studied. In this paper we just aimed to establish a criteria for a method to automatically detect the onset of parturition and dystocia in <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> with an specific breed, location and season, therefore, we acknowledge that our findings may not be considered as the general criteria to a method to detect the onset of birth and dystocia in <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs,</b> to all type of parturition and to all breeds however we believed that it can be a useful tool to evaluate our newly developed automatic parturition detecting device which is now currently on progress and which will be tested on the same experimental farm and during the specified seasons...|$|R

The survey was carried out from 1 January to 31 December 2008 according to a study design prescribed by the EU. It covered at least 80 % of <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> in each Member State. The individual studies were preferably carried out at holdings with at least 50 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs.</b> Representative holdings were selected in each Member State.

40|$|Prediction of single-cross {{performance}} {{has been a}} major goal of plant breeders since the beginning of <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding.</b> Recently, genomic prediction has shown to be a promising approach, but only limited studies have examined the accuracy of predicting single-cross performance. Moreover, no studies have examined the potential of predicting single crosses among random inbreds derived from a series of biparental families, which resembles the structure of germplasm comprising the initial stages of a <b>hybrid</b> maize <b>breeding</b> pipeline. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential of genomic prediction for identifying superior single crosses early in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding</b> pipeline and optimize its application. To accomplish these objectives, we designed and analyzed a novel population of single crosses representing the Iowa Stiff Stalk synthetic/non-Stiff Stalk heterotic pattern commonly used in the development of North American commercial maize hybrids. The performance of single crosses was predicted using parental combining ability and covariance among single crosses. Prediction accuracies were estimated using cross-validation and ranged from 0. 28 to 0. 77 for grain yield, 0. 53 to 0. 91 for plant height, and 0. 49 to 0. 94 for staygreen, depending on the number of tested parents of the single cross and genomic prediction method used. The genomic estimated general and specific combining abilities showed an advantage over genomic covariances among single crosses when one or both parents of the single cross were untested. Overall, our results suggest that genomic prediction of single crosses {{in the early stages of}} a <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding</b> pipeline holds great potential to redesign <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding</b> and increase its efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent {{selection}} {{methods were}} designed to improve the agronomic value of populations by gradually increasing the frequency of favorable alleles, while maintaining genetic variability. To realize these objectives, progenies are developed, evaluated, selected and recombined in a repetitive manner. Populations improved by recurrent selection are excepted to be agronomically superior to unimproved versions and have enough genetic variability for the traits under selection to allow these populations be used for medium or long-term selection. The performance of hybrids {{is associated with the}} level of heterosis, i. e., to the superiority of hybrids over their inbred parents. To exploit heterosis efficiently, populations are grouped into heterotic groups, where population crosses within and among groups produce low and high levels of heterosis, respectively. Hybrids are then produced by crossing inbred lines from different heterotic group. Recurrent selection programs should be integrated with <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding</b> programs so that improved populations can be used as sources of inbred lines not related to that ones developed from recycled lines via pedigree breeding. The objectives of this paper are to present the effects of recurrent selection on <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding</b> programs; to present the changes in heterosis following recurrent selection; and to compare intra- and inter population recurrent selection. Testcross half-sib recurrent selection (TCHSRS) is for <b>hybrid</b> <b>breeding</b> programs, improvement of population crosses as well as the populations per se should be as efficient as possible, because their rates of improvement are approximately the same as for as the derived hybrids and inbred lines per se, respectively.
