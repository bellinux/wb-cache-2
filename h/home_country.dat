5|$|Michael Schumacher, {{driving for}} Ferrari, {{had led the}} {{championship}} by a single point ahead of Villeneuve going into the race. During the race Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher's car forced him to retire. The blame for the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport's governing body, the FIA, and he was stripped of his second-place finish in the championship. Schumacher's tactics were widely criticised by the media, including publications based in his <b>home</b> <b>country</b> of Germany, and in Ferrari's <b>home</b> <b>country</b> of Italy.|$|E

30|$|One {{prominent}} {{feature of}} international migration {{today is that}} {{a vast majority of}} migrants return to their country of origin after taking up employment or spending time in a host country for a certain period (Gibson and McKenzie 2011). Frequently cited economic reasons for returning include (1) higher returns in <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> to human capital accumulated in host countries (Dustmann, Fadlon and Weiss, 2007, 2011); (2) higher returns to self-employment activities in <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> relative to host countries (Dustmann and Kirchkamp 2002); (3) higher preferences for consumption in <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> (Dustmann and Weiss 2007); (4) a high purchasing power in <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> relative to host countries (Dustmann and Weiss 2007); (5) an increase in wage differentials between host and <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> (Dustmann 2003); (6) a fulfilment of a saving target that allows migrants to become entrepreneurs in <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> (McCormick and Wahba 2001; Wahba 2015; Mesnard 2004); and (7) worsening economic outlook in host <b>countries</b> relative to <b>home</b> <b>countries.</b> Non-financial factors such as personal preferences, social ties, and lifestyles are also found to be strong determinants of return migration (Gibson and McKenzie 2011).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{institutional}} distance on FDI infl ows in a  specifi c country, the Czech Republic. This study {{contributes to the literature}} on the importance of institutional distance between <b>home</b> and host <b>country</b> among the factors able to infl uence FDI. The novelty of our paper is that (1) we consider whether institutional distance matters also when the host country is already endowed with institutional standards relatively close to those of the main <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> of MNEs, and (2) we run separate investigations of home-host countries’ institutional distance, distinguishing between institutionally safer and less safe <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> in comparison with the host ones. The Czech Republic has been chosen in view of these perspectives, as (1) it has traditionally been considered {{as one of the most}} developed markets among those emerged from the socialist experience, its level of institutional development is close to that of the various <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> of MNEs, and (2) besides hosting MNEs from <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> endowed with safer institutions, it receives a  certain amount of FDI also from countries with a  relatively less safe institutional environment. Our results challenge the previous literature, in the sense that institutional distance may actually be perceived as an opportunity, especially by MNEs from <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> with higher levels of institutional development. Indeed, MNEs from <b>home</b> <b>countries</b> with less safe institutions than Czech ones follow a more ambiguous pattern...|$|R

McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its <b>home</b> <b>country</b> by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, {{many of which were}} failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.|$|E

The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's <b>home</b> <b>country.</b> Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
