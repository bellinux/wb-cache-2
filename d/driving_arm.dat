50|$|Founder Alvin Ailey {{created more}} than 79 dances {{for his company}} during his tenure; he also maintained, however, {{that the company was}} not solely a {{repository}} for his choreography. Hence AAADT has a repertory of more than 200 works by more than 70 choreographers, including such choreographers as Ulysses Dove, Karole Armitage, George Faison, Uri Sands, Elisa Monte, Talley Beatty, Katherine Dunham and Twyla Tharp (whose work The Golden Section, excerpted from her larger ballet, The Catherine Wheel, entered AAADT's repertory in 2006). The company's popularity comes from its theatrical, extroverted style of dancers with strong personalities and muscular skill. Yet the majority of AAADT's pieces have not held the stage {{for more than a few}} seasons, and comparatively few have managed to reach critical acclaim. However, the company keeps Alvin Ailey's works, including Revelations (1960), Night Creature (1974) and Cry (1971), in continuous performance. Memoria was one of Alvin Ailey's balletic pieces, with long lines and a clear technical style different from his usual jazz character style of swirling patters, strong, <b>driving</b> <b>arm</b> movements, huge jumps, and thrusting steps. This dance was later adopted into the repertory of the Royal Danish Ballet. Cry is a three-part, 20-minute solo created for Judith Jamison. It was meant to pay homage to all Black women, and can be seen as a journey from degradation to pride, defiance, and survival. Cry has great physical and emotional demands on both performer and audience.|$|E

In addition, they have characteristics of omni-directional and instantaneous control capabilities to yield high thrusts from small input power.

40|$|A {{neck brace}} was {{developed}} aimed {{to improve the}} peripherals of patients with neck paralysis and to supply safe support during the rehabilitation process of patients suffering from surgeries or accidents. The brace allows the patient to manipulate their head in a vertical fashion via pressure switches or a toggle controllable by hand. The increased motion allows patients with neck paralysis to better view obstacles and reduces daily fatigue on their eyes in many cases due to being wheel chair bound. Whereas the implementation for patients {{that have come out}} of stationary braces from surgeries or accidents allows them to reduce the reoccurrence of damage from accidental movements that strain the repairing tissue and or the skeletal structure. The brace has adjustable stops allowing the doctor to ensure the travel length does not exceed the desired travel thus harming the condition of the patient. Furthermore built in fail safes prevent endangerment issues such as back driving, energy loss, and over traveling. The basis of the design was on a human head weighing approximately ten pounds. The <b>driving</b> <b>arm</b> was coupled to the chin support of the neck brace allowing natural rotating motion of the head to occur. A breast plate coupled to a back plate would distribute the load of the head as well as mounting for the mechanical components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Considering {{the special}} {{characteristics}} of the redundant parallel manipulator, with emphasis on the variable of structure, relatively small workspace and the strong coupling relationship among arms ， a synchronization control strategy is presented in this paper. Since in the feedforward,the inertial and the coriolis matrix are designed constant according to relatively small workspace, position measurement of the endeffector in plane is ignored. Synchronization error and coupling error are introduced to reject the model errors of inertial and coriolis matrix as stated above. Using the method, the errors of <b>driving</b> <b>arms</b> may be reduced, as well as synchronization performance among axes improves. The stability of the controllers was proved by Lyapunov. Finally, experimental results show the feasibility...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{an extended}} laboratory study on the potential to apply the acoustic emission (AE) technique for in-situ rail-wheel interaction monitoring using rail-mounted sensors. The essential monitoring principle is that {{the intensity of the}} rail?wheel contact will affect the intensity of the AE that is generated during rolling. The current paper is confined to situations of 'normal' rolling, investigating the effects of wheel load, speed and lateral rattling of the generated AE, although the wider study includes the effects of rail and wheel irregularities on the AE generated. Rail-wheel contact was simulated on a scaled test rig consisting of a single wheel rolled round a circular track using a motor mounted at the centre of the track attached to a <b>driving</b> <b>arm.</b> AE was recorded at a fixed point on the track while the wheel was rolled around the track at a range of speeds with varying axle load. Wheel slip was found to be insignificant and tests using a simulated source confirmed that the energy recorded with a source at a given position on the track was repeatable. In one set of experiments, measures were taken to eliminate lateral rattling of the wheel and eccentricity of the wheel arc relative to the track arc. In a second set of experiments, some lateral float of the wheel along the axle was allowed and a limited amount of eccentricity was built into the track. The energy per wheel rotation for normal rolling was found to increase in a linear fashion with increasing axle load and centrifugal force, as would be expected due to the increasing rolling resistance with axle load and increasing lateral force with angular speed. The frictional instability associated with the lateral rattling was clearly detectible at low axle loads and lower speeds, and both natural and eccentricity (flange rubbing) rail abnormalities were detectible in the AE record. It is concluded that, with appropriate calibration, contact stresses between wheel and rail on straight or curved track can be monitored using track-mounted sensors so that cumulative contact stress can potentially be monitored...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWhat drives economically buoyant Southeast Asian nations, enjoying post–Cold War peace, to procure {{arms in a}} manner that has observers concerned about a regional arms race? Are these acquisitions driven by threats from within the region or from potential hegemons like China? Alternatively, are the purchases actually driven by domestic factors? This thesis investigates the following four factors to determine which are most powerful in <b>driving</b> <b>arms</b> procurements in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore: availability of resources, domestic politics, external threats, and force modernization. By comparing these three countries, selected for their track record of being the largest defense spenders in Southeast Asia, this research finds that domestic factors (the availability of resources and domestic politics) were the strongest drivers. Consequently, the paucity of externally triggered instances of arms procurements undermines existing assertions of a regional arms race. As such, using Buzan and Herring’s arms dynamics model, the situation among the three countries is best characterized as being arms maintenance, with occasional excursions to arms competitions for prestige reasons. Looking toward the future, the worrying trajectories of domestic politics in these countries could supply the conditions that could incite more frequent excursions toward competitive arms dynamics.

40|$|Recently, high angular {{resolution}} imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI have discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered light images of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations {{have suggested that}} these arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a quantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet mass is still missing. Using 3 D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in disks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast (δ_ max) {{as a function of}} planet mass (M_ p) and disk aspect ratio (h/r) : δ_ max≈((M_ p/M_ J) /(h/r) ^ 1. 38) ^ 0. 22. With current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum planet mass for <b>driving</b> detectable <b>arms</b> in a disk around a 1 Myr 1 M_ star at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more massive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in observed disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates from a different planet. We also find only massive perturbers with at least multi-Jupiter masses are capable of <b>driving</b> bright <b>arms</b> with δ_ max≳ 2 as found in SAO 206462, MWC 758, and LkHα 330, and these arms do not follow linear wave propagation theory. Additionally, we find the morphology and contrast of the primary and secondary arms are largely unaffected by a modest level of viscosity with α≲ 0. 01. Finally, the contrast of the arms in the SAO 206462 disk suggests that the perturber SAO 206462 b at ∼ 100 AU is about 5 - 10 M_ J in mass. Comment: 37 pages, 14 figures, 1 table; ApJ publishe...|$|R
