This research analyzes the German experience in promoting renewable energy over the past decade to identify the ex post cost of reducing CO 2 emissions through the promotion of renewable energy, specifically, wind and solar. To this propose, we calculated the annual CO 2 abatement cost for the years 2006 - 2010 as the ratio of the net cost over the CO 2 emission reductions resulting from the use of renewable energy. The net cost is the sum of the costs and cost savings due to the injection of renewable energy into the electric power system. Results show that CO 2 abatement cost of wind are relatively low, of the order of tens of <b>Euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2, while CO 2 abatement cost of solar are very high, of the order of hundreds of <b>Euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the Italian {{collective}} {{system for the}} management of household Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and its evolution over time, following the European Directives on WEEE, which include the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). The analysis focuses on the technical and economic performance of WEEE compliance organisations (consortia), as they are the key players in the Italian EPR regime. Economic results have not usually been provided in previous studies, {{due to the lack of}} available data. This study overcomes this problem by accessing the financial statements for the years 2009 - 2014 of all consortia. The main conclusions of the study are: The Italian EPR system barely exceeded the technical target of the first WEEE Directive (4 kg per capita). Improvements are necessary to achieve the target set for 2019 by the Recast Directive. The economic performance of the Italian EPR regime improved significantly over time. The fees charged per tonne of WEEE collected decreased by almost 43 % from 652 <b>Euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> in 2009 to 374 <b>Euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> in 2014, while the fees per tonne put on the market (P 0 M) were 134 Euro in 2009 and 104 Euro in 2014. The results prove the theory which states that, competing consortia use the learning effects to reduce the contribution fees for producers rather than to increase the quantity collected. Municipalities remain the most important actor in WEEE collection operations. Consortia compensate municipalities with a reimbursement that ranges between 28 and 38 Euros per tonne collected. These repayments cover only partially their costs. Additional studies should investigate their role...|$|E

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of plastic}} recycling {{is compared to}} energy recovery from plastic incineration in a waste-to-energy plant using data for the Netherlands. Both options have specific benefits and costs. The benefits of recycling are the avoidance of both CO 2 that otherwise would be emitted during incineration {{and the production of}} virgin (new) material. There are significant costs, such as collection costs and recycling costs involved for plastic recycling by municipalities. The benefits of energy recovery from plastic are heat and electricity production leading to fewer emissions in the regular energy production sector, but this requires a waste-to-energy plant with the associated capital investments. Summing all the costs and benefits results in an implicit CO 2 abatement price of 172 <b>Euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2 in case of plastic recycling.

40|$|The German {{electricity}} {{market is}} facing two major challenges: competition and climate protection. The liberalization {{of the electricity}} sector in Europe following the directive on the single internal market is increasing competition between suppliers of electricity, while the trading in emissions certificates, which started in January 2005, aims at reducing emission of carbon dioxide.

As conventional power stations retire and have to be shut down there will be a need for major replacement of generation capacities in the next two decades.

If emissions certificates cost more than 30 <b>euros</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of carbon dioxide electricity generation both in coal-fired power stations with CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) and from renewable energy sources - especially in more advanced wind power plants - could become economical.

In this paper, an overall analysis of four different separation technologies is presented. The four technologies are Decanter, Funki Manura 2000, Green Farm Energy and Staring. These technologies are all implemented on a full scale in Denmark. In this paper both the economic and environmental aspects are considered, looking at the entire chain from stable to the field. The total investments range from 50, 000 to 4 million Euros and the total net costs are from 1 to 7 <b>Euros</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> for the four different technologies. One of the clear environmental benefits is a better utilisation of phosphorus, but using phytase in feeding is a cheaper first step when reducing phosphorus surplus. Improved nitrogen utilisation is only apparent with the Staring and Green Farm Energy concepts. The conclusion is that the Funki Manura 2000 system is too expensive and the Decanter system a fairly cheap way to reduce phosphorus levels, but other benefits are limited.

This paper quantifies the potentials of energy efficiency technologies and CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) for seven Dutch industry sectors between 2008 and 2040. Economically viable energy efficiency technologies offer carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission reduction potentials of 25 ± 8 % in 2040 compared to 1990 levels. Economically viable CCS options can raise the industry’s total emission reductions to 39 – 47 %.

While economically viable potentials of improving energy efficiency may exist in all sectors (energy efficiency improvements of 2 % per annum (p. a.)), attractive CCS potentials exist in the fertilizer, basic metal and refinery sectors with abatement costs estimated at 25 – 120 D /t CO 2 for 2040. Implementing CCS in these sectors would reduce total industry’s primary energy efficiency improvement rates from 2 % to 1. 6 % p. a. and would increase total industrial energy use by at least 10 %.

The SiteChar project funded by 7 th Framework Programme of European Commission gives the opportunity to evaluate the most influential parameters of techno-economic evaluations of four feasible European projects for CO 2 geological storage located onshore and offshore and related to aquifer storage or oil and gas reservoirs, at different stages of characterization. 				Four potential CO 2 storage sites have been assessed in terms of storage costs per tonne of CO 2 permanently stored (equivalent cost based).

The results demonstrate that the structure of costs for a project is heterogeneous and the storage cost is consequently site dependent. The strategy of the site development is fundamental, the technical choices such as the timing, rate and duration of injection are also important. The way monitoring is managed, using observation wells and logging has a strong impact on the estimated monitoring costs. Options to lower monitoring costs, such as permanent surveys, exist and should be further investigated. 				Table 1 below summarizes the cost range in <b>Euro</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> (Discount Rate (DR) at 8 %) for the different sites, which illustrates the various orders of magnitude due to the specificities of each site. These figures have how to be considered with care. In particular the Italian and Norwegian sites present very specific features that explain the high estimated costs. For the Italian site, the short duration of CO 2 injection associated with a low injection rate makes the CO 2 project comparable to a demo project. The Norwegian site is an offshore site located in a virgin area with high infrastructure costs and a combination of injection duration and injection rate that makes the derived costs very sensitive to the discount rate.

The main uncertainties in the costs are linked both to the choice of economic parameters (e. g. injected quantities, contingencies) and to the technical choice of operations. This has been studied by sensitivity analyses: for example, if an injection rate is halved and the injection duration is doubled, the Equivalent Storage Cost (ESC) increases by 23 % (UK case at 8 % DR). Introducing a water production well and water treatment facilities also increases the ESC by 23 %, at least on an onshore site. Techno-economic assessments were basically carried out using an 8 % discount rate. For projects of long lifetime such a rate severely discounts the late cash flow, especially after 40 years, so that a discount rate of around 4 % more in logic of public investment. Compared to other studies, it has to be noted that the scope of the SiteChar analysis does not consider compression and pumping cost, nor transportation cost. This simplifies the techno-economic evaluation but it may not adequately reflect the specific conditions of the individual developments and, hence, distort the comparison between different cases. 				Lastly, techno-economic evaluation poses questions to policy makers about the real lifetime of a CO 2 storage project: what should be the abandon phase and the associated cost and what is the real value of the liability transfer after 20 years of storage? This issue is still an open question, which has been addressed in SiteChar assuming the same approach as ZEP (2011). 				To counterbalance these CO 2 storage costs, policy makers have to set up incentives, either through ETS (Emission Trading System) credits, tax credits or public funding.

We assume that the Kyoto Protocol Annex B countries (except the USA and Australia), create a CO 2 tax at 15 <b>euros</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne.</b> This policy entails significant emissions reductions (around 20 %) in these countries.

However, compared to business-as-usual, non-Annex B price-competitiveness and production decrease a little and these countries loose some market shares, so they could attack this system as distorting competition in favour of Annex B countries.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have the}} potential to reduce transportation sector CO₂ emissions in São Miguel, an island in the Azores, while simultaneously reducing mobility operating costs. This thesis attempts to quantify the cost and environmental impacts of using EVs on São Miguel, using an economic dispatch and unit commitment model. The number of EVs and the ways that they charge are varied. The composition of São Miguel's electric power generation portfolio is varied from its current composition to one that incorporates higher levels of renewable generation. Emissions reductions stemming from EVs vary according to how the vehicles are charged and when renewable generation, which is less expensive and less CO 2 - intensive than thermal generation, is available. Charging "optimally" can save hundreds of thousands of Euros in system mobility costs per week and, in some cases, halve transportation CO₂ emissions. Optimal charging results also show that, in certain cases, charging during periods of high electric demand is acceptable. This result is contrary to previous literature on vehicle charging, and is due primarily to the limited number of generators on S~ao Miguel. CO₂ abatement costs stemming from the use of EVs vary from 26 to 160 <b>Euros</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO₂. Portugal's tax on gasoline and subsidization of EVs make calculating the exact cost of EVs in São Miguel difficult, but a simple discounted cash flow shows that, for a 950 electric vehicle fleet, the internal rate of return over a ten year period is 8. 24 %. Other costs associated with EVs, including the installation of new grid infrastructure and charging stations, are also considered. by Maximilian Parness. Thesis (S.

In this case, damage can amount to over 30, 000 €. Adoption of disposable micro-knives may avoid such severe damage and mitigate its consequences. The simpler replacement procedure also allows a 15 % reduction of knife replacement time, compared with the standard knife option. On the other hand, these same benefits are also obtained with other measures, such as the adoption of a swing-away counter-knife and the use of a pneumatic wrench for knife replacement. However, disposable micro-knives do offer a significant reduction of knife-related cost, due to an extended sharpness retention.
