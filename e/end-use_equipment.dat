40|$|Focusing on supply-side energy policies, like {{supporting}} large renewable electricity plants, without simultaneously {{looking for}} {{opportunities in the}} demand-side, may generate avoidable costs. Reducing demand by increasing energy efficiency may have advantages in reducing fossil dependency and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. This paper addresses interactions between energy supply and demand side policies, by estimating the impact of end-use energy-efficiency & renewables applications in terms of (i) avoided electricity generation capacity, (ii) final energy consumption, (iii) share of renewables in final energy and, (iv) reduction of GHG emissions. The Portuguese energy system {{is used as a}} case-study. The bottom-up model TIMES_PT was used generate four scenarios till 2020 corresponding to different levels of efficiency of equipment in buildings, transport and industry. In the current policy scenario, the deployment of <b>end-use</b> <b>equipments</b> follows the 2000 - 2005 trends and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan targets. In the efficient scenarios, all equipments can be replaced with more efficient ones. Results show that aggressive industry and buildings demand-side measures can make the increase in renewable electricity capacity with approximately 4. 7 GW as discussed by policy-makers superfluous. These measures reduce only 0 - 2 % of total final energy, but this represents reduction of 11 - 14 % in the commercial sector, with savings in total energy system costs of approximately 3000 M€ 2000 - roughly the equivalent to 2 % of the 2010 GDP. The cost-effectiveness of policy measures should guide choices between supply shifts and demand reduction. Such balanced policy development can lead to substantial cost reductions in climate and energy policy. JRC. F. 6 -Energy Technology Policy Outloo...|$|R

However, current software is limited in modeling distributed generation (DG), including DG with heat recovery applied to building end-use, i. e. {{combined heat and power}} (CHP). Concurrently, DG investment and dispatch optimization software has been developed, yet has not been linked to a building energy simulation program for accurate assessment of DG designs, particularly under uncertainty in future <b>end-use</b> loads and <b>equipment</b> availability. CHP is a proven approach to cost effective reductions in primary fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. Integrating DG system design and controls into building energy simulation is an important step towards popular DG acceptance. We propose to extend the existing building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus (E+), to enable the simulation of various DG modules and associated control strategies in order to achieve more accurate and holistic analysis of DG technologies. Extension of EnergyPlus is conveniently facilitated by SPARK, a program capable of modeling building equipment and controls as individual modules. These modules can be automatically integrated with EnergyPlus building models. Candidate DG systems can be selected from the DG investment optimization program, Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM). The dispatch of the modeled DG system can be determined by a novel dispatch optimization algorithm, the Energy Manager, that accounts for uncertainty in future load and DG availability, as well as curtailment options. DG equipment and controls can modeled in SPARK and integrated into EnergyPlus building models. The way to this holistic approach will be described in this paper...|$|R

A walk-through energy audit of these industries was undertaken to identify the major sources of energy in use, identifying the lapses in energy usage, identifying areas to improve energy usage, determining the level of consumption of the energy sources and recommending policy measures that will enhance energy savings in the industries and Nigerian industries at large. The study observed that among a wide variation of <b>end-use</b> electricity consuming <b>equipment,</b> electric motors were the major consumer of electrical energy, accounting for 40 - 47 % of total electric energy. Also from the identified energy use sources in the two industries, {{it was observed that}} fuel energy expended in operating the generating set, boilers or heaters in the industries had the highest value of energy use accounting for more than 65 % of the total energy used. It was observed that none of the companies under review sufficiently utilized their energy as they all have their energy used ratio far below 1. This was as a result of some factors that contributed to energy waste and energy use inefficiency in the companies. Among these factors are: Poor in housekeeping of air- condition and refrigeration equipments and electric motors that dissipate much heat, use of electric motors that are weak and generate excessive noise because they have been rewound more than twice, improper lagging of boilers that lead to losing much heat, switching on of the lighting points in the day time and generation of electrical energy more than needed in the industry by some electri...|$|R
40|$|During the 1990 s {{there was}} great {{attention}} and debate in the European Union (EU) and in OECD countries outside the EU {{on the use of}} voluntary agreements to attain environmental and sustainable energy policy goals. At the time {{there was a lot of}} theoretical analysis and discussions on this policy instrument and in particular on its effectiveness and cost efficiency. Before the debate was over, a number of important voluntary agreements to improve energy efficiency or reduce CO 2 emissions were implemented in Europe both at national and European levels. These voluntary agreements cover <b>end-use</b> <b>equipment</b> and appliances (e. g. cars, electric motors, residential appliances, etc.), industrial processes, and industrial energy management policies and practices. The paper classifies and analyses the different types of voluntary agreements aiming at improving energy efficiency in Europe, and reviews voluntary agreements and other initiatives of similar nature (voluntary programmes, unilateral commitments, self-regulation) in industrial sectors in a number of Member States of the European Union. The paper also examines some successful European initiatives of voluntary nature, including unilateral agreements for improved energy efficiency of <b>end-use</b> <b>equipment,</b> such as the European agreement on energy consumption of washing machines, and the European agreement on power consumption in standby mode of televisions and video cassette recorders (VCRs).

The intent of this report is to assist policy-makers faced with decisions about changes to traditional utility regulation and planning. This report is not a consensus document, rather it is staff written summary of two years of discussion on the issues.

Tar condensation creates problems like fouling and plugging of after-treatment, conversion and <b>end-use</b> <b>equipment.</b> Gasification tars consist mainly of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Former research has shown the possibilities and difficulties of tar conversion by partial combustion.

Modeling detailed PAH chemistry requires the employment of large reaction mechanisms which lead to expensive numerical calculations. The application of a reduction technique like FGM leads to a considerable decrease (up to two orders) in the required computation time. A 1 D numerical validation shows that the improvements achieved by implementing a varying Lewis number for the progress variable Y are significant for PAH species with a large Lewis number, such as C 10 H 8. Considerable improvements are found near the flame front and on the fuel side of the flame. A comparison has been made of FGM results with qualitative Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) measurements. A laminar CH 4 /N 2 –air co-flow flame has been doped with two dopants, benzene and toluene, at three different concentrations. A set of filters was used in order to qualitatively distinguish the small (1 – 2 rings) and large (3 or more rings) aromatic species. The results show that the model is able to capture the major flame characteristics typical for PAH formation in multi-dimensional laminar non-premixed flames...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} of <b>end-use</b> <b>equipment</b> in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors can reduce air pollution emissions {{and greenhouse gases}} significantly. Because energy efficiency is {{an effective means of}} reducing multi-pollutant emissions, it is important to ensure that energy efficiency is a fully engaged component of emission-reduction programs. However, while energy-efficiency measures are perceived by many stakeholders to be important options for improving air quality, some members in the air quality community are concerned about the ability of these measures to fit in a regulatory framework-in particular, the ability of emissions reductions from energy-efficiency measures to be real, quantifiable, certifiable, and enforceable. Hence, there are few air quality programs that include energy efficiency as a tool for complying with air quality regulations. This paper describes the connection between energy consumption and air quality, the potential role of energy-efficiency measures to meet air quality regulations, the barriers and challenges to the use of these measures in the air quality regulatory environment, and the potential role that the U. S. Department of Energy's (USDOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Building Technology, State and Community Programs (EERE-Buildings) could play in this area. EERE-Buildings can play a very important role in promoting energy efficiency in the air quality community, in ways that are fully consistent with its overall mission. EERE-Buildings will need to work with other stakeholders to aggressively promote energy efficiency via multiple means: publications, analytical tools, pilot programs, demonstrations, and program and policy analysis and evaluation. EERE-Buildings and state energy officials have considerable experience in implementing and monitoring energy-savings projects, as well as in designing documentation and verification requirements of energy-efficiency improvements. The following lists suggest potential EERE-Buildings activities, grouped by whether EERE-Buildings would play a lead or supporting role...|$|E
40|$|Selina project {{website at}} [URL] PDF {{available}} online at [URL] audienceThis document {{provides an overview of}} the most important results of the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Project SELINA - Standby and Off-Mode Energy Losses In New Appliances Measured in Shops. Standby power is a general term commonly used to describe the low power modes in which many electrical and electronic products are, when not performing their main function. For more than a decade, it has been recognized that the energy consumption in low power modes for electrical and electronic products is an important issue because it represent permanent loads (sometimes up to 24 hours per day) of a huge number of products. With the 1 W standby initiative of the International Energy Agency (IEA), several low power mode measurement campaigns have been led on a regular basis in a number of countries outside and inside Europe Union (EU). Based on these results and on the Energy-using Products Study Lot 6, the EU has prepared new regulation to limit the standby and off-mode power consumption of non-networked household electronic and electrical equipment, which is being applied since January 2010. The IEE project SELINA carried out a large scale monitoring campaign in shops in order to characterise the low power modes of new appliances being sold in the EU market. In order to ensure consistency of the collected data, a common measurement methodology was developed and the same high resolution measurement equipment was used by all partners. This document analyzes the results of more than 6000 different equipments measured in the 12 EU countries involved in the project. Standby and off-mode values by product categories were analysed and compared with data from other regions of the World. The measurements were also benchmarked against the new 2010 / 2013 EU standby and off mode regulation thresholds and the impact of the EU regulation is discussed. It was found that 18. 5 % of the equipments, whose off-mode power was measured, do not respect the EU regulation threshold of 1 W. When the measurements are compared to the 2013 threshold of 0. 5 W, this percentage raises up to 41. 5 %. Regarding standby mode input power, 31 % of the measured products did not comply with EU regulation limit for the 2010 threshold. When the standby measured values are compared to the 2013 limit, the number of products over the EU regulation target increases to 66. 4 %. When comparing the 2009 and 2010 measurements, only a slight decrease of the share of appliances exceeding the EU regulation limits was observed. In parallel with the measurement campaign, an awareness study of the retailers was carried out. This survey helps to understand the customers' buying motivations and the influence of retailers' advice in their choices. The results of the survey show that, despite of retailer's consciousness about the energy consumption and energy labels of the products, other types of sales arguments like the appliance price or functionalities are more frequently used to sell a product. This could be due to lack of visible information in shops related to the equipment energy consumption. Furthermore, the results show that retailers try to adapt their advice to the customers' needs (price and product functionalities). The retailers admitted that publishing more information regarding the energy consumption of products and some kind of cost saving calculator/reference would make the clients to opt for more efficient equipments. Based on the survey results and on the analysis of different existing policies targeting electrical and electronic products in Europe, examples of policies to improve the low power modes situation of the EU market are reviewed. The survey on measures enhancing the market transformation towards more energy-efficient electrical appliances showed a wide range of actions and policy tools in the SELINA partner countries. In national workshops, which mainly took place in the late summer/early autumn 2010, these measures were presented and discussed with all relevant national stakeholders. In most countries, information campaigns (esp. brochures, leaflets, websites, and national labels) are the dominating measure type. In some countries, however, financial subsidies for very energy-efficient appliances, often paid by an energy utility and not by the government, play an important role, too (e. g. in the Czech Republic or Switzerland). In general, the impact of a financial programme is easier to quantify than the single impact of an information campaign, which often serves as an accompanying measure for regulations (labels, minimum efficiency standards) or fiscal and financial measures. International cooperation with key institutions outside the EU, involved in similar efforts, such as the IEA Implementing Agreement 4 E (Efficient Electrical <b>End-use</b> <b>Equipment)</b> with an Annex on Standby, the Energy Star/EPA in USA, the Australia Standby Initiative and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, were used to promote synergies in the definition of common approaches to characterize the market and to define realistic and cost-effective performance targets which can be achieved in a short time frame. Special care is required when promoting low standby consumption products (without consideration of other attributes) to ensure that there are no perverse effects such as the inadvertent promotion of products with low active mode efficiency and high energy consumption. It is desirable to follow a vertical approach to standby, where low power modes are combined with active modes to give total energy consumption. This approach is particularly preferable for products where the total energy consumption is significant. The definition of usage patterns under such a vertical approach is necessarily product specific and this could vary by region or country. The new technologies offer many opportunities for energy savings potential but there are also some threats which need to be recognized and understood. There is a strong need to ensure that energy saving paradigms and strategies become a core consideration in future product designs. It is recognized that equipments connected to networks are of growing importance. It is recommended that increased efforts to compile data and measurements, of networked products, {{from a variety of sources}} in order to obtain better information on networked product characteristics, needs to be made. An online database was created so that everyone can access the input power values, in the different equipment low power modes, of the more than 6000 equipments measured. A Standby Calculator Tool was also developed and can be accessed through the project website. It can be used to calculate the consumed energy, the annual cost and the equivalent CO 2 emissions. In order to compare the results in an easy way, a diagram that shows the energy consumption of the different models is presented. Furthermore, the values for the most efficient device are also showed, in order to have an additional comparison. One of the main objectives of this project was to identify effective market transformation policies initiatives targeted at all the key stakeholders involved in the manufacture, distribution, sales, purchasing and operation of appliances with standby and off-mode losses. As a result of the future policy actions that may appear after the end of the project, considering loads in networked mode, it is expected to achieve very large cost-effective savings of electricity (80 TWh projected by 2020) and carbon emissions (30 MTons of CO 2 by 2020) ...|$|E
