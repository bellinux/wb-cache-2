For a given load, a larger capacitor reduces ripple but costs more and creates higher peak currents in the transformer secondary {{and in the}} supply that feeds it.

This type of interconnection can involve nontrivial engineering, and possibly equipment upgrade costs to keep the <b>distribution</b> <b>circuit</b> properly protected. Such costs may be minimized by limiting distributed generation capacity to less than is locally consumed, and guaranteeing this condition by installing a reverse-power cutoff relay that opens if backfeeding occurs.|$|E

The APC, TPC, and TCUs all connected to a smaller shared memory, the Message <b>Distribution</b> <b>Circuit</b> (MDC).

The MXU, RLU, and RSU were all sufficiently far from the base unit that they could not participate in the shared memory based communication directly. A special circuit pack, the Remote Data Link Controller (RDLC) was installed in the DT-FIU of the remote unit and its host TCU. This allowed a serial communication link over a dedicated timeslot of a DS1 carrier. The host TCU was responsible for forwarding messages from the remote unit through the MDC.|$|E
50|$|High-leg delta {{service is}} {{supplied}} {{in one of}} two ways. One is by a transformer having four wires coming out of the secondary, the three phases, plus a neutral connected as a center-tap on one of the windings. Another method requires two transformers. One transformer is connected to one phase of the overhead primary <b>distribution</b> <b>circuit</b> to provide the 'lighting' side of the circuit (this will be the larger of the two transformers), and a second transformer is connected to another phase on the circuit and its secondary is connected {{to one side of the}} 'lighting' transformer secondary, and the other side of this transformer is brought out as the 'high leg'. The voltages between the three phases are the same in magnitude, however the voltage magnitudes between a particular phase and the neutral vary. The phase-to-neutral voltage of two of the phases will be half of the phase-to-phase voltage. The remaining phase-to-neutral voltage will be √3/2 the phase-to-phase voltage. So if A-B, B-C and C-A are all 240 volts, then A-N and C-N will both be 120 volts, but B-N will be 208 volts.|$|E

In parallel, some loads also have PV generation capability. We postulate that the inverters associated with each PV system are also capable of limited reactive power generation or consumption, and we seek to find the optimal dispatch of each inverter's reactive power to both maintain the voltage within an acceptable range and minimize the resistive losses over the entire circuit.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{interest}} and sales of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have steadily increased. These vehicles, which are powered partially, {{or in some cases}} solely with energy stored in their battery packs, require large amounts of energy to recharge. Recent research has shown that regional transmission and generation has enough excess capacity to handle the additional charging load {{of the majority of the}} U. S light duty vehicle fleet. While upgrades to transmission and generation resources my not be needed, the local <b>distribution</b> <b>circuits</b> maybe vulnerable to the additional load. Of paramount concern are residential <b>distribution</b> <b>circuits</b> which unlike commercial circuits are not sized to handle large loads. The increase penetrations of plug-in electric vehicles has the potential to significantly increase local power demand, possibly creating new demand peaks or exacerbating existing demand peaks which left unaddressed could lead to adverse system impact on residential <b>distribution</b> <b>circuits.</b> Such increase in power demand can be intensified by the fact that initial EV adoption profiles may not be evenly distributed across local electrical distribution networks - phenomenon also known as “clustering. ” This study evaluates the possible impact PEV, PHEVs, and BEVs charging has on residential distribution feeders.
