50|$|After firing, {{the tube}} was discarded, making the Panzerfaust the first {{disposable}} anti-tank weapon. The weapon, when correctly {{fired from the}} crook of the arm, could with <b>its</b> <b>shaped</b> charge warhead penetrate the armour of any armoured fighting vehicle of the period.|$|R
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Gan HaHamisha (Garden of the Five), a {{memorial}} park {{for the five}} residents of Arad {{who were killed in}} action in the Six-Day War. Includes a monument for the soldiers, as well as a stone structure called Amud HaBulbusim (lit. Pillar of the Potatoes, because of <b>its</b> <b>shape),</b> which marks Arad's place in the desert and their residents' control of the territory according to Bedouin tradition – designed by Yona Pitelson.|$|E
5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre. Because all three points of the shape are usable, {{it is easier to}} orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} and lifetime of a shape memory device is characterised by the changes of its transformation temperatures. <b>its</b> cold <b>shape,</b> <b>its</b> hot <b>shape,</b> <b>its</b> global two way <b>shape</b> memory effect, <b>its</b> recovery stress. This global behaviour {{is influenced by}} a complex combination of internal and external parameters. Internal parameters are: the alloy system, the alloy composition, the type of transformation and the lattice structure including defects. External parameters are : the thermomechanical treatments, the way of training, the applied stress, the imposed shape memory strain, the amplitude of temperature cycling, the absolute temperature of the environment. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> is {{strongly}} asymmetrical, {{with one of}} the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It {{is also one of the}} two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.|$|E
5|$|On stardate 5143.3, while patrolling {{near the}} Romulan Neutral Zone, the Federation {{starship}} Enterprise finds a small private ship manned by a Vendorian, an alien species that can transform <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> at will. The alien dupes the crew {{on board the}} Enterprise into thinking that it is actually Carter Winston (voiced by Ted Knight), a Federation citizen and philanthropist who has been missing for five years.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian bow is {{a fairly}} long, {{approximately}} symmetrical, composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. <b>Its</b> <b>shape</b> is known from two graves in which {{the position of the}} bone plates could be reconstructed. Modern Hungarians have attempted to reconstruct the composite bows of their ancestors and have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.|$|E

5|$|The {{circle is}} the only simple closed curve that {{maintains}} <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> under the curve-shortening flow, but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape, including the grim reaper curve, an infinite curve that translates upwards, and spirals that rotate while remaining {{the same size and}} shape.|$|E
5|$|The floral tube {{is formed}} by fusion of the basal {{segments}} of the tepals (proximally connate). <b>Its</b> <b>shape</b> is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to rudimentary (N. cavanillesii).|$|E
5|$|The {{wooden core}} gives the bow <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> and {{dimensional}} stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with animal glue in V-splices, so the wood must accept glue well. Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require, {{and the use}} of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections.|$|E

KLIK likes to {{showcase}} animation in all of <b>its</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes and related art forms, giving a platform to animated feature films, shorts, commercials, video games, music videos, comics, and installations.|$|R
50|$|The peak {{is known}} for <b>its</b> sharp {{pyramidal}} <b>shape</b> and the rocky ridge Treskavec on it western side. It inspires with <b>its</b> proper <b>shape</b> and awes with its sharp edges. It is sometimes dubbed as Tetovo Materhorn.|$|R
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of <b>its</b> <b>shape.</b> Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that <b>its</b> <b>shape,</b> assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> and size.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Nicholas lies in {{the centre}} of Sapareva Banya. Its {{architecture}} is rather simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of equal size. The dome has twelve sides and is of no particular height, though it is rather large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; <b>its</b> <b>shape</b> is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance {{is located on the}} west wall.|$|E
