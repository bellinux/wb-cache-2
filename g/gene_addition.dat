For instance, site-specific <b>gene</b> <b>addition</b> in major crop species can be used for 'trait stacking' whereby several desired traits are physically linked to ensure their co-segregation during the breeding processes. Progress in such cases have been recently reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays. In Arabidopsis thaliana, using ZFN-assisted gene targeting, two herbicide-resistant genes (tobacco acetolactate synthase SuRA and SuRB) were introduced to SuR loci with as high as 2% transformed cells with mutations. In Zea mays, disruption of the target locus was achieved by ZFN-induced DSBs and the resulting NHEJ. ZFN was also used to drive herbicide-tolerance gene expression cassette (PAT) into the targeted endogenous locus IPK1 in this case.

The latter {{process can be}} used to correct a variety of mutations in chromosomal genes with high fidelity and specificity. In this study, we used retroviral vectors to introduce mutant alkaline phosphatase reporter genes into normal human cells and subsequently corrected these mutations with AAV gene targeting vectors. We find that increasing the length of homology between the AAV vector and the target locus improves gene correction rates, as does positioning the mutation to be corrected {{in the center of the}} AAV vector genome. AAV-mediated gene targeting increases with time and multiplicity of infection, similar to AAV-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>addition.</b> However, in contrast to <b>gene</b> <b>addition,</b> genotoxic stress did not affect gene targeting rates, suggesting that different cellular factors are involved.

40|$|Efficient {{incorporation}} of novel DNA sequences into a specific {{site in the}} genome of living human cells remains a challenge despite its potential utility to genetic medicine, biotechnology, and basic research. We find that a precisely placed double-strand break induced by engineered zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) can stimulate integration of long DNA stretches into a predetermined genomic location, resulting in high-efficiency site-specific <b>gene</b> <b>addition.</b> Using an extrachromosomal DNA donor carrying a 12 -bp tag, a 900 -bp ORF, or a 1. 5 -kb promoter-transcription unit flanked by locus-specific homology arms, we find targeted integration frequencies of 15 %, 6 %, and 5 %, respectively, within 72 h of treatment, and with no selection for the desired event. Importantly, {{we find that the}} integration event occurs in a homology-directed manner and leads to the accurate reconstruction of the donor-specified genotype at the endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence presumably results from synthesis-dependent strand annealing repair of the break using the donor DNA as a template. This site-specific <b>gene</b> <b>addition</b> occurs with no measurable increase in the rate of random integration. Remarkably, we also find that ZFNs can drive the addition of an 8 -kb sequence carrying three distinct promoter-transcription units into an endogenous locus at a frequency of 6 %, also {{in the absence of any}} selection. These data reveal the surprising versatility of the specialized polymerase machinery involved in double-strand break repair, illuminate a powerful approach to mammalian cell engineering, and open the possibility of ZFN-driven <b>gene</b> <b>addition</b> therapy for human genetic disease...|$|E

By using pDd 812 as a hybridization probe, we found that addition of cyclic AMP during the first few hours of development inhibited the accumulation of discoidin I mRNA. By measuring the rate of transcription in isolated nuclei, we showed that, at least in part, this inhibition results from a rapid and specific reduction in the rate of transcription of the discoidin I <b>gene.</b> <b>Addition</b> of cyclic AMP during the first few hours of development inhibited the accumulation of discoidin I mRNA.

This natural increase in cAMP concentration occurs at the time during development when transcription of the discoidin I gene ceases. We suggest, therefore, that changes in the intracellular concentration of cAMP act at the level of transcription to control gene expression during development. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that several poly(A) +RNA sequences that normally accumulate after transcription of the discoidin I gene has ceased are synthesized prematurely in cells exposed to exogenous cAMP...|$|E

Such an organization has been considered to facilitate gene deletion and addition events by unequal crossover between the tandem repeats. However, the large size (approximately 30 kb) of the individual CYP 21 + C 4 repeat units together with the difficulty in identifying reliable CYP 21 A- and CYP 21 B-specific markers has prevented direct monitoring of gene organization on individual haplotypes by conventional Southern analyses. In the present investigation we have sought to clarify the CYP 21 and C 4 gene organization in members of 32 British 21 -hydroxylase deficiency families by employing additional experimental approaches, notably a long-range restriction mapping approach, which permits assessment through a VNTR type of analysis, {{of the number of}} CYP 21 and C 4 units on individual haplotypes.
