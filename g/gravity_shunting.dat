When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the Cambrian Railways on the transhipment sidings. Leaving Wharf station, which stands at an elevation of [...] above sea level, the line passes immediately under the A493 Machynlleth to Dolgellau road and enters a long cutting that climbs towards , at a maximum gradient of 1 in 60. On the left (north) side of the cutting {{there was once a}} long siding used for <b>gravity</b> <b>shunting</b> of wagons into the sidings at Wharf station. The railway runs through the cutting for about , before passing under another road bridge and passing the locomotive and carriage sheds and works at Pendre.|$|E
50|$|One unusual {{aspect of}} {{workings}} {{on the line}} was that <b>gravity</b> <b>shunting</b> was permitted at Brymbo on shorter trains even {{as late as the}} 1970s. The gradients here could be problematic: there was an incident in the 1970s in which a train ran out of control on the former Vron Branch, and broke through level crossing gates in Brymbo.|$|E
50|$|The {{yard was}} {{completed}} in 1921 and incorporated two <b>gravity</b> <b>shunting</b> humps and equipped with the latest automated technology including electrically operated points, and widespread use of Track circuits. With its 32 mi of track, (the longest siding being 1662 ft in length and the shortest being 1331 ft), it could handle 2500 wagons a day. These were brought in by 50 down and 26 up trains, and being removed by 18 down and 46 up services. This was, probably, the busiest marshalling yard {{in the country at}} that time. Up to 3390 wagons could be sorted per day and an incoming train of wagons could be sorted in 12 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The new {{yard was}} {{built as a}} hump <b>shunting</b> (<b>gravity)</b> yard capable of {{handling}} 4,000 wagons a day. The reception sidings were built west of the River Calder, the main yard {{was built on the}} extended site of the former sidings. The main control tower was located south of the main line and the Calder Vale Dye Works near to the river. The yard opened in 1963 at a cost of Â£3.5 million. The diesel motive power depot at Healey Mills (Healey Mills Diesel Depot or Healey Mills TMD) opened in 1967.|$|R
