5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the Conservancy {{started the}} Rare Breed Swine Initiative, which, in {{cooperation}} with other organizations, assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market. The three main foci of the initiative are marketing breeding stock and products, conserving bloodlines and supporting breed associations. As of 2010, proposals were <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> funding of a study of porcine genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with the aims of maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November 1939, {{plans were}} put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{restoration}} of passenger services to allow ambulance trains {{to reach the}} hospital, and authorisation was given for their operation. However, the line was never used to transport patients, as although Park House {{was used as a}} hospital by the Canadian Army during the Second World War, patients left ambulance trains at Hellingly station and were transferred to Park House by road.|$|E
5|$|On June1, the American Red Cross set up {{a shelter}} at the Redlands Community College in El Reno for victims of the storm. The {{following}} day, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin toured damaged areas of El Reno. Due to the tornadoes that occurred previously on May20, {{a state of emergency}} was already <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> affected areas, allowing residents to quickly obtain emergency assistance. Residents left homeless were provided with temporary housing constructed from shipping containers. Each container was fitted with a kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom.|$|E
5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
50|$|According to {{one source}} <b>the</b> model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> USS Constellation was an {{off-the-shelf}} AMT Enterprise model painted and torched <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle damage, while other sources {{claim that the}} smallest and least detailed Enterprise professional model was altered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> episode. It has also been stated that the Constellation&apos;s hull ID number of 1017 came from simply switching the digits of an Enterprise model's 1701 hull numbers.|$|R

5|$|The Steelers {{notified}} the Pittsburgh Stadium Authority in December 2010 of {{their intention to}} add up to 4,000 seats to the lower {{southern end of the}} stadium. The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season. Seating was added in that section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, which had an attendance of 68,111.

5|$|The U.S. {{government}} did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level, orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack. The Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the Christmas travel period. The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said {{that there would be}} more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E
5|$|The other French {{ships were}} pursued by British ships {{of the line}} and the chase lasted much longer, into the morning of 11 April when HMS Hannibal caught the frigate Gentille. Hannibal was far larger than its {{opponent}} and the French captain surrendered immediately rather than fight a futile engagement. The third French frigate, Fraternité successfully escaped. After refitting in Portsmouth, Colpoys' ships returned to their station off Brest, the blockade remaining <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the year.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued {{at some point}} during the existence of the cyclone for the west coast of Florida from Key West to Apalachicola. Additionally, a {{tropical storm}} warning was put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> east coast from Vero Beach northward to Fernandina Beach. Before the arrival of Marco, elementary schools were closed on the three barrier islands in Lee County. Florida governor Bob Martinez ordered the closure of state offices in the Tampa Bay area, and also decided not to open the University of South Florida and nearby community colleges. Public schools were not opened on the day of the storm's passage in Manatee and Sarasota counties, though most other schools remained open. As the storm tracked northward, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of Georgia. A flood watch was later issued for western portions of the Carolinas and for high elevations in Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on November27 and {{continuing}} through December3, the National Emergency Management Office in Palau issued {{more than ten}} detailed public announcements warning residents of the approaching storm and how to prepare. In response, numerous families boarded up their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic. On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2. All flights to and from Roman Tmetuchl International Airport were suspended during the morning of December3. A strict curfew was put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city of Koror {{for the duration of}} the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|Boxing was {{introduced}} and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago {{was still a}} Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers of the sugar and coffee plantations, and the objective {{was to determine the}} best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island practiced the sport. During World War I, a championship known as Campeonato Las Casas was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named Los Campeones del Campamento. These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military jurisdictional limits, although prohibitions were put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on the rooftops of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.|$|E
5|$|From 1912, Godley began putting plans <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rapid {{deployment}} of a New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) {{in the event}} of war in Europe. He anticipated that Imperial Germany would be the likely enemy and envisaged deployment to either Europe or possibly Egypt, to counter the likely threat to the Suez Canal in the event Turkey aligned itself with Germany. He envisioned the expected deployment would be co-ordinated with an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and liaised with the Australian Chief of General Staff, Brigadier General Joseph Gordon, and the possibility of a composite division was discussed. The question of Germany's possessions in the South Pacific was also raised, and it was agreed that New Zealand would have responsibility for German Samoa, while Australia dealt with German New Guinea. The arrangements Godley put in place for deployment for the NZEF were soon put to the test, for when the First World War began, a New Zealand occupation force was quickly assembled to occupy German Samoa.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{plans were}} <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Allied forces {{to break out}} of the ANZAC foothold. Key to this was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade {{commenced}} its assault on Chunuk Bair, the crest of the range, along what was known as Rhododendron Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched in daylight rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Infantry Battalion. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. His refusal to advance in daylight meant that by the end of the day, his battalion was the only intact battalion in the brigade.|$|E

5|$|On October15, the {{governor}} of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October16. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.|$|E
5|$|The IRT Pelham Line {{would be}} rebuilt to {{accommodate}} the wider BMT-IND cars to operate via the Second Avenue Line. The connection would provide the Pelham Line with direct service to Sixth Avenue, Second Avenue and Brooklyn. The station platforms, and third rail {{would have had to}} be adjusted as they were put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> narrower IRT trains. However, the line was built with this conversion in mind. Westchester Yard would have been expanded {{to accommodate the}} additional trains added to the line. Since trains to the Pelham Line would no longer use the Lexington Avenue Line, there would be additional capacity for trains to run via the IRT White Plains Road Line and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. Improved service on the Pelham Line was project to stimulate growth in the East Bronx areas served by the line. This area of the East Bronx was seen to have great potential for industrial growth and other areas suitable for development as residential and recreational areas.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{series in}} 2010 was {{executive}} produced by Russell T Davies and Nikki Wilson, and the producers were Brian Minchin and frequent writer Phil Ford. During this series, Cyril Nri was introduced {{as a new}} recurring character called The Shopkeeper. The production team remained <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> completed episodes of Series 5, which were shot concurrently with Series 4. The show's abbreviated fifth and final series introduced a new main character named Sky, played by Sinead Michael. The episode that introduced Sky also featured a return appearance by the Shopkeeper, {{but the fact that}} the second half of the series was never produced left his story arc, as well as other ongoing plot points, unresolved. A special edition of Doctor Who Magazine, The Sarah Jane Companion Volume 3, published in August 2012, detailed the plotlines of the three unfilmed stories.|$|E
