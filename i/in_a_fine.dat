5|$|Diamond's thermal {{conductivity}} is {{made use of}} by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E

During his suspension, he was caught on video playing flag football at a San Diego park, a violation of his contract according to Charger management.|$|E

5|$|Diamond's high thermal {{conductivity}} {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will be fooled by moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar {{thermal conductivity}}.|$|E
5|$|Early diamond {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Since {{free speech}} may be {{exercised}} during assemblies and gatherings, Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly, is relevant. Prior to October 2009, the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ("PEMA") required a licence to {{be obtained from}} the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit (PELU) of the Singapore Police Force before talks, discussions or similar events open to the public were held. Holding an event without a licence would result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> or imprisonment. Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences, and that they had been denied licences without reason. The Workers' Party was fined $800 after a dinner event in 1986, at which the Party's Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech. PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities, a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed. In addition, the Act exempted public entertainments provided by or {{under the auspices of the}} Government, thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors.|$|E

5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
