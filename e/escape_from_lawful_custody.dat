50|$|The Act {{encountered}} further {{controversy in}} the 1970s due to the deployment of the Army in Northern Ireland {{and its role in}} maintaining order and similar policing-style duties. In 1972, the government was forced to amend the Act in order to legalise the detention of internees arrested by soldiers. Martin Meehan had been arrested after <b>escaping</b> <b>from</b> Crumlin Road Jail and charged with <b>escaping</b> <b>from</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>custody.</b> At his trial he successfully argued that under the Special Powers Act a soldier had no power of arrest and, as such, he had the legal right to escape, and was awarded £800 in compensation for being illegally detained for twenty-three days.|$|R
25|$|Meehan {{returned}} to Northern Ireland, {{where he was}} arrested on 9 August 1972. He was charged with <b>escaping</b> <b>from</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>custody,</b> and at his trial successfully argued that under the Special Powers Act a British soldier had no power of arrest and as such he had {{the legal right to}} escape. He was awarded £800 in compensation for being illegally detained for twenty-three days, and the government were forced to amend the Special Powers Act to legalise the detention of others held under the Act. He was charged with membership of the Provisional IRA, and received a three-year sentence when he became the first person to be convicted of the offence. He was imprisoned in Long Kesh, and was released on 4 October 1974. After his release he was immediately interned without trial, and on 5 December 1975 he was the last internee to be released after internment had been abolished.|$|R
40|$|Section 40 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 {{provides}} {{for a number of}} different instances where a peace officer may effect an arrest without an arrest warrant. A perusal of the reported case law pertaining to the lawfulness of arrests without warrant reveals that section 40 (1) (b) of the Act, in particular, has received much attention from the courts. In terms of this subsection a peace officer may arrest without warrant any person whom he reasonably suspects of having committed an offence referred to in Schedule 1, other than the offence of <b>escaping</b> <b>from</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>custody.</b> It is settled law that any deprivation of freedom is regarded as prima facie unlawful. The arrestor therefore bears the onus of proving that the arrest was justified (Minister of Law and Order v Hurley 1986 3 SA 568 (A) 589 E-F; and Ralekwa v Minister of Safety and Security 2004 1 SACR 131 (T) par [9]). The following jurisdictional facts must be present for a peace officer to rely on the defence created by section 40 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Act in cases, where it is alleged that the arrest was unlawful: (i) the arrestor must be a peace officer; (ii) the arrestor must entertain a suspicion; (iii) the suspicion must be that the suspect committed an offence in Schedule 1; and (iv) the suspicion must rest on reasonable grounds (Duncan v Minister of Law and Order 1986 2 SA 805 818 G-H). For a discussion of the different types of jurisdictional facts provided for in section 40 (1) see Watney ("'n Klemverskuiwing by Inhegtenisneming Sonder Lasbrief" 2009 TSAR 734 - 735) ...|$|R

50|$|A constable may search {{a person}} who has been arrested (unless the arrest was at a police station) if the constable has {{reasonable}} grounds for believing that the arrested person may present a danger to himself or others.

50|$|This applies where {{a person}} is arrested in pursuance of a warrant of arrest, {{commitment}} or detention issued in proceedings for or in connection with any criminal offence.

An authorised officer may also search the arrested person for anything which he might use to assist him to <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>custody,</b> {{but only if the}} officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may have concealed on him anything of a kind mentioned in that sub-paragraph; and {{only to the extent that}} it is reasonably required for the purpose of discovering any such thing.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{to detain}} (under {{the meaning of}} the Police Reform Act 2002) is a {{relatively}} new one, but under law, it is considered a temporary arrest (in accordance with Schedule 4, Part 1, Paragraph 2A(2)(b) of the Police Reform Act 2002). As a result, a PCSO may any person arrest someone he or she has reasonable grounds to suspect is attempting to <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>lawful</b> <b>custody</b> when subject to a detention requirement (under Schedule 4, Part 1, Paragraph 2(3) of the Police Reform Act 2002). Section 38 Offences Against the Person Act 1861 also creates the offence of assault with intent to resist arrest, which also covers the [...] "lawful apprehension/detention of himself or another". This is an either-way offence, meaning that the PCSO may also any person arrest for this offence in addition to the original proposed detention.|$|E

It does not actually refer to actual lynching and has been used to charge individuals who have tried to free someone in police custody. There have been several notable cases in the twenty-first century, some controversial, when a black person has attempted to free another black person from custody. [...] In 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation by Senator Holly Mitchell removing the word [...] "lynching" [...] from the state's criminal code without comment after it received unanimous approval in a vote by state lawmakers. Mitchell stated, [...] "It's been said that strong words should be reserved for strong concepts, and 'lynching' has such a painful history for African Americans that the law should only use it for what it is - murder by mob." [...] The law was otherwise unchanged.|$|R
