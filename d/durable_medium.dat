[...] "The effective government of large areas," [...] he writes, [...] "depends to a very important extent on the efficiency of communication." [...] He argues for example, that light and easily transported papyrus enabled Rome to govern a large, centralized empire. For Innis, papyrus is associated with the political and administrative control of space. It, therefore, is a space-biased medium. Parchment, dominant after the breakup of the Roman Empire, was a <b>durable</b> <b>medium</b> used for hand copying manuscripts in medieval monasteries.

50|$|In the {{beginning}} {{half of the}} 20th century {{it became apparent that}} the use of acidic wood-pulp paper, common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the slow fire. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As mass deacidification efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material.

2500|$|In Chapter 6, Innis {{tries to}} show how the medium of {{parchment}} supported the power of churches, clergy and monasteries in medieval Europe after the breakdown of the Roman empire.

Innis notes that parchment, on the other hand, is a <b>durable</b> <b>medium</b> that can be produced wherever farm animals are raised. He argues, therefore, that parchment is suited to the decentralized administration of a wide network of local religious institutions. However, the arrival of paper via China and the Arab world, challenged the power of religion and its preoccupation with time. [...] "A monopoly of knowledge based on parchment," [...] Innis writes, [...] "invited competition from a new medium such as paper which emphasized the significance of space as reflected in the growth of nationalist monarchies."

We tested the feasibility of using a locally harvested artery, the ipsilateral superior thyroid artery (STA), {{as a source of}} patching material following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Materials and methods:Twenty-two consecutive patients (15 male) with a median age of 70 (range 53 – 82) years underwent CEA with an intention to use the STA for patch angioplasty. The STA was harvested via a standard carotid incision and opened longitudinally to fashion a patch. Results:Of the 22 STAs harvested, only two were rejected due to small calibre. Mean harvesting time was 12 min and there were no immediate complications. Duplex scanning has not revealed restenosis (mean peak velocity= 0. 78 [range 0. 45 – 1. 16] m/s) in any patient with a median follow-up of 13 (range 3 – 19) months.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{aneurysm}} morphology, initial {{outcomes and}} mid-term results in patients receiving Talent or Zenith grafts for elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVR). MethodsOver a 6 -year time period ending in 2007, 286 patients underwent elective EVR of infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms using Talent or Zenith devices. Patient demographics, aneurysm morphology and initial outcomes (primary-assisted technical success rates, 30 -day limb occlusion, re-intervention and mortality) were compared using chi-squared tests or Student's t-tests. Kaplan–Meier curves were calculated to compare cumulative rates of freedom from type I or III endoleak, re-intervention, endograft patency and overall survival over mid-term follow-up. ResultsAdverse aneurysm morphology was {{more common in}} patients receiving Zenith stent grafts, with {{a greater proportion of}} shorter neck lengths (60 °, 25. 0 % vs 10. 3 %; p= 0. 002). Equivalent primary-assisted technical success rates were achieved with both Talent and Zenith grafts (94. 0 % vs 96. 1 %; p= 0. 41). A significant number of adjunctive procedures were required in both groups to obtain a proximal endograft seal, with relatively more procedures performed in the Talent group (28. 6 % vs 12. 4 %; p= 0. 003). Early outcomes were similar for 30 -day re-intervention (5. 3 % vs 3. 9 %; p= 0. 91), 30 -day limb occlusion (1. 5 % vs 2. 6 %; p= 0. 51), 30 -day morbidity (6. 8 % vs 11. 8 %; p= 0. 15) and 30 -day mortality (4. 5 % vs 3. 9 %; p= 0. 80). The cumulative incidence of freedom from re-intervention was 88. 3 ± 2. 9 %, 86. 1 ± 3. 3 % and 84. 1 ± 3. 9 % at 1, 2 and 3 years respectively. There {{were no significant differences between}} Talent and Zenith groups for re-intervention, type I or III endoleak or limb occlusion rates over the same time period. Overall patient survival was 88. 4 ± 2. 85 % at 1 year, 83. 7 ± 4. 0 % at 2 years and 78. 9 ± 5. 5 % at 3 years. ConclusionsEquivalent primary-assisted technical success rates can be achieved using either Talent or Zenith endografts for endovascular aneurysm repair, but operating teams should be prepared to perform additional adjunctive procedures to obtain a primary proximal seal with either stent. The Zenith endograft performed well in the context of less favourable pre-operative aneurysm morphology.

5000|$|Case E-04/09 Inconsult {{dealt with}} the {{criteria}} an website had to comply with {{in order to be}} considered a “durable medium”, according to Article 2(12) of Directive 2002/92/EC on insurance mediation. The Court noted that for the purposes of consumer protection, the Directive sets out certain minimum obligations relating to the information which insurance intermediaries must provide to their customers {{and the manner in which}} this is done. By requiring this information to be submitted either on paper or any other <b>durable</b> <b>medium,</b> the Directive facilitates the subsequent verification of the information which an intermediary has provided to his customer. The Court held that a website can constitute a <b>durable</b> <b>medium</b> under Article 2(12) of the Directive, provided that several criteria are met. First, the website must enable the customer to store the information in question. Secondly, the website must enable the customer to store the information in a way which makes it accessible for a period of time adequate to the purposes of the information, that is, for as long as it is relevant for the customer in order to protect his interests stemming from his relations with the insurance intermediary. This might cover the time during which contractual negotiations were conducted even if not resulting in the conclusion of an insurance contract, the period during which an insurance contract is in force and, to the extent necessary e.g. for seeking redress, the period after such a contract has lapsed. Thirdly, the website must allow for the unchanged reproduction of information stored. In this respect, the Court held that the information must be stored in a way that makes it impossible for the insurance intermediary to change it unilaterally. It is for the insurance intermediary to ensure that the methods of electronic communication he employs permit this kind of reproduction. Finally, the Court held that for an website to qualify as a <b>durable</b> <b>medium</b> it is irrelevant whether the customer has expressly consented to the provision of information through the internet.|$|E

5000|$|Canvas {{has become}} the most common support medium for oil painting, {{replacing}} wooden panels. It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. Its use in Saint George and the Dragon by Paolo Uccello in about 1470, and Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus in the 1480s was still unusual for the period. Large paintings for country houses were apparently more likely to be on canvas, and are perhaps less likely to have survived. It was a good deal cheaper than a panel painting, and may sometime indicate a painting regarded as less important. In the Uccello, the armour does not use silver leaf, as other of his paintings do (and the colour therefore remains undegraded).

These inscriptions were written texts that existed outside the world of books and documents and were often publicly displayed before a broad audience in a <b>durable</b> <b>medium</b> such as stone or metal. Inscriptions are a rich and under-used source for the understanding of the diverse literate cultures of the Middle Ages, although they have stimulated much interesting research in recent years. Celticists, Anglo-Saxonists, oghamists, runologists, experts on medieval Latin epigraphy (the science of the study of inscriptions), students of brasses and other specialists have often worked on inscriptions in isolation from each other. This book is new in bringing together recent work on inscriptions in Ireland, Celtic Britain, Anglo-Saxon and medieval England and the Scandinavian or Viking world; and on the continent of Europe. Individual chapters exemplify a range of different approaches to the investigation of inscriptions, drawing on the evidence of archaeological context, of texts, of palaeography, and of linguistic analysis. Some explore methodological questions, including the use of computers. Others throw light on such subjects as the status of women, Insular influence on the Continent, medieval prayers for the dead, or the use of inscriptions to bolster the authority of the powerful.
