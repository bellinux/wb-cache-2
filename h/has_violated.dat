5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> provisions of the constitution is in progress.|$|E

25|$|Infidelity (synonyms include: cheating, {{adultery}} (when married), netorare (NTR), being unfaithful, {{or having}} an affair) {{is a violation}} of a couple's assumed or stated contract regarding emotional and/or sexual exclusivity. Other scholars define infidelity as a violation according to the subjective feeling that one's partner <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> a set of rules or relationship norms; this violation results in feelings of sexual jealousy and rivalry.|$|E
25|$|Others such as {{a number}} of intellectuals and legal experts in Taiwan {{published}} articles calling on the Legislative Yuan to initiate impeachment proceedings against Ma, as they argue the handling of the meeting <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> the requirements of the due Constitutional procedures.

25|$|The Council of Europe's {{most famous}} {{achievement}} is the European Convention on Human Rights, which was adopted in 1950 following {{a report by}} the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and followed on from the United Nations 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights' (UDHR). The Convention created the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> their fundamental rights and freedoms.|$|E

25|$|The NLRB and {{the courts}} provide {{different}} solutions against unions that breached their duty of fair representation. Because the Board does not usually have the jurisdiction to enforce {{the collective bargaining agreement}} or to issue a remedial order against an employer that <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> it, the NLRB often cannot award complete relief to employees. A court, on the other hand, may order an employer to reinstate or pay back pay to an employee if it finds that the employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and may, in some instances, order the union to pay attorneys' fees to a successful plaintiff. These distinctions do not apply to workers covered by the Railway Labor Act since, as noted above, they have no administrative procedures to enforce their rights.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{group of}} 5,000 Freehand graphic {{designers}} convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe. The suit alleged that Adobe <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged {{in a series of}} exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism. Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled. The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.|$|E

Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party's legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, {{who served in the}} party's shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller had been expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.|$|E

25|$|Halakha (Jewish law) {{generally}} {{allows for}} divorce. The document of divorce is termed a get. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the get document into {{the hand of}} the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the get, if he <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do {{what he wants to do}} anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.|$|E

Continued use of the term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against Native men, women, and children".

500|$|In the end, {{none of the}} {{senators}} was charged with any crime. Instead, the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them. [...] Robert S.

[...] After public hearings, McCain was mildly rebuked by the committee for exercising [...] "poor judgment" [...] in intervening with the federal regulators on Keating's behalf, but its 1991 report said that McCain's [...] "actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him....Senator McCain <b>has</b> <b>violated</b> no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate."
