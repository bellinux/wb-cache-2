5|$|The {{security}} and police officials selected {{to run the}} camps of Operation Reinhard were among Heydrich's closest professional contacts. Heydrich {{was said to be}} on particularly good terms with Odilo Globocnik and Christian Wirth. In his other realm of responsibility, that of governor of the Czech Protectorate, Heydrich behaved coldly towards Karl Hermann Frank, whom he did not <b>know</b> <b>well</b> or trust.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens on}} Monday April 14, 2003 at the {{beginning}} of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to <b>know</b> <b>well</b> and help with their individual problems.|$|E

25|$|Teen sexual {{violence}} {{does not always}} equate with date rape, as the term might suggest; the term date rape may describe drug facilitated sexual assault (using drugs and/or alcohol), or a case of acquaintance rape (usually sexual assault by someone the victim doesn't <b>know</b> <b>well,</b> or just met).|$|E
25|$|There {{are times}} when an uninitiated dog owner or a new enthusiast {{mistakes}} the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers <b>know</b> <b>well</b> that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time.|$|E
25|$|Maometto {{and his men}} {{enter the}} city, which he seems to <b>know</b> <b>well.</b> Selim is curious as to why, but his general reveals nothing. Then {{soldiers}} rush in and announce that Erisso and Calbo have been captured. Both men are led in, in chains. Maometto recognizes their gallantry, but demands that they and their men surrender and states that then all will be released. By his silence, Erisso rejects the offer and, as the two {{are about to be}} led away to be tortured, Anna and the women appear from the church.|$|E

25|$|Wherever Lienhard {{happened}} to be during his years of traveling, his full attention was drawn to nature in all its variety, to landscapes, climatic conditions, soil quality, geological details, and plants and animals previously unknown to him, while many passages of his account deal with people, with lasting friendships {{as well as with}} brief, yet unforgettable encounters. With these portraits he created a monument to many of his friends and acquaintances who otherwise would long be forgotten, portraits, which always reflect his own personality, too. This shows itself impressively in his relationship with the founder of New Helvetia John A. Sutter, whom he got to <b>know</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|Translations of sung texts—whether of {{the above}} type meant to be sung or of {{a more or less}} literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a {{language}} not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not <b>know</b> <b>well),</b> and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.|$|E
25|$|The borzoi is a quiet, but {{athletic}} and independent dog. Most borzois are almost silent, barking only very rarely. They {{do not have}} strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. The borzoi is extremely smart and requires patient, experienced handling. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house manners. Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but will turn aggressive if handled roughly. Typically however, they are rather reserved with strangers but affectionate with people they <b>know</b> <b>well.</b> Their sensitivity to invasion of their personal space can make them nervous around children unless they are brought up with them. Despite their size, borzois adapt very well to suburban life, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{cultivated}} a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was shy and retiring {{when not}} performing, particularly around people {{he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>well,</b> and granted very few interviews. Mercury once said of himself: [...] "When I'm performing I'm an extrovert, yet inside I'm a completely different man." [...] While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from his audience; Kurt Cobain's suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury [...] "seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd".|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{idea was}} {{developed}} by head writer and co-executive producer Sally Sussman Morina. For this storyline, the soap opera partnered with the American Heart Association in order to highlight the issue of women's heart health. Executive producer Mal Young felt that the character of Jill was the [...] "perfect choice to show how a woman’s life can dramatically change {{as a result of}} heart disease." [...] He further mentioned that [...] "Along with providing us with some very emotional and dramatic episodes, the subject also gives us the opportunity to educate and highlight a very pertinent issue using characters our viewers <b>know</b> <b>well.</b> As well as seeing how it affects Jill as she comes to terms with her condition, the story will also illustrate how it impacts her family and those closest to her." [...] The producers considered Jill to be the right character to tackle this issue due to her being the show's longest-running character, as well as other factors: her unhealthy lifestyle, age and [...] "bullish personality that would deny anything was wrong". Following the episode where Jill is diagnosed, Walton appeared in a public service announcement urging viewers to visit the American Heart Association website. Young knew that the soap opera had to be [...] "very responsible", stating: [...] "We did not want to sensationalize this. We wanted to get the facts in {{while at the same time}} telling a good, dramatic story." ...|$|E
