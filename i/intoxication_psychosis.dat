50|$|Generally, high-altitude {{pulmonary}} edema (HAPE) or AMS precede HACE. In patients with AMS, {{the onset of}} HACE is usually indicated by vomiting, headache that does not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hallucinations, and stupor. In some situations, however, AMS progresses to HACE without these symptoms. HACE must be distinguished from conditions with similar symptoms, including stroke, <b>intoxication,</b> <b>psychosis,</b> diabetic symptoms, meningitis, or ingestion of toxic substances. It {{should be the first}} diagnosis ruled out when sickness occurs while ascending to a high altitude.|$|E
50|$|Neil Swaab (born 2 January 1978 in Detroit, Michigan) is a New York based artist, designer, writer, and educator. His {{illustrations}} and comics {{have appeared}} in numerous publications in the US as well as abroad in Germany, Prague, and Italy and Russia. Swaab's most famous work is Rehabilitating Mr. Wiggles, which deals with a pill-popping, foul-mouthed teddy bear. The comics frequently deal with sex, addiction, <b>intoxication,</b> <b>psychosis,</b> molestation, cross-dressing, self-hate and misanthropy. This weekly comic strip currently runs online {{as well as in}} The New York Press, Real Detroit Weekly, Internazionale (in Italian), and New Times Broward-Palm Beach.|$|E
40|$|Problems {{that may}} bring {{teenagers}} {{to the family}} physician's office include bizarre behavior such as drug or alcohol <b>intoxication,</b> <b>psychosis,</b> panic or anxiety attacks and stealing; being dangerous to themselves or to others; sexual emergencies including pregnancy, rape and incest; a crisis involving key people such as parents' divorce or illness; school phobia, and anxiety or other reactions to sickness, surgery or death. When evaluating troubled teens and their families, the physician should first see adolescents alone, so he is not biased by parents' complaints that prevent `accused' teens from expressing themselves. An evaluation should end with the teenager and adults together so the physician can summarize {{what happened in the}} interview and give treatment plans. The doctor should anticipate that he will need extra time in counselling teens about their problems, because {{it is also important to}} inform, support and direct parents, teachers and counsellors...|$|E
50|$|Specific harms {{associated}} with cannabis include increased accident-rate while driving under <b>intoxication,</b> dependence, <b>psychosis,</b> detrimental psychosocial outcomes for adolescent users and respiratory disease. Some safer cannabis usage campaigns including the UKCIA (United Kingdom Cannabis Internet Activists) encourage methods of consumption shown to cause less physical {{damage to a}} users body, including oral (eating) consumption, vaporization, the usage of bongs which cool {{and to some extent}} filters the smoke, and smoking the cannabis without mixing it with tobacco.|$|R
50|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug <b>intoxication</b> and drug-induced <b>psychosis.</b> Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizophrenia is complicated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} pure chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia.|$|R
25|$|Aggression can be {{the result}} of both {{internal}} and external factors that create a measurable activation in the autonomic nervous system. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are homicidal in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide. Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute <b>intoxication,</b> acute <b>psychosis,</b> paranoid personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc. Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cannabis {{intoxication}} {{is related}} {{to a number of}} physical and mental health risks with ensuing social costs. However, little attention has been given to the investigation of possible pharmacological interactions in this condition. Objective To review the available scientific literature concerning pharmacological interventions for the treatment of the acute effects of cannabis. Methods A search was performed on the Pubmed, Lilacs, and Scielo online databases by combining the terms cannabis, <b>intoxication,</b> <b>psychosis,</b> anxiety, and treatment. The articles selected from this search had their reference lists checked for additional publications related to the topic of the review. Results The reviewed articles consisted of case reports and controlled clinical trials and are presented according to interventions targeting the physiological, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms provoked by cannabis. The pharmacological interventions reported in these studies include: beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, antagonists of CB- 1 and GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, antipsychotics, and cannabidiol. Conclusion Although scarce, the evidence on pharmacological interventions for the management of cannabis intoxication suggests that propanolol and rimonabant are the most effective compounds currently available to treat the physiological and subjective effects of the drug. Further studies are necessary to establish the real effectiveness of these two medications, as well as the effectiveness of other candidate compounds to counteract the effects of cannabis intoxication, such as cannabidiol and flumazenil. </p...|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug <b>intoxication,</b> and drug-induced <b>psychosis.</b> Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|R
40|$|Aim. Amphetamine and its {{derivates}} can induce, usually {{after many}} <b>intoxications,</b> schizophrenia-like <b>psychosis.</b> These disorders appeared only in part patients with amphetamine dependence. Aim {{of the study}} was to establish prevalence of selective risk factors of schizophrenia development in amphetamine users: 1) with amphetamine – induced schizophrenia – like psychosis, 2) with schizophrenia, and 2) without psychotic symptoms. Material. In the study 3 groups of subjects were included: 30 amphetamine users with amphetamine induced schizophrenia – like psychosis, 30 amphetamine users with schizophrenia and 30 amphetamine users without psychotic symptoms (37 female and 53 male in mean age= 17. 78 years). Methods. Amphetamine dependence, schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis induced amphetamine were diagnosed according to ICD- 10 criteria after at least 1 year of amphetamine abstinence. The next procedure was used: 1) Structured interview with subjects and their mothers/caregivers regarding: a) amphetamines use (duration of abuse, doses of psychoactive substance) b) family history of psychosis (especially schizophrenia) 2) The Questionnaire of Child Development for assessment of prevalence of selected risk factors of schizophrenia development 3) The Premorbid Adjustment Scale (Cannon – Spoor) for assessment of premorbid psychosocial functioning in thelast year before psychosis. Conclusions. Amphetamines users with amphetamine-induced psychosis were more similar in prevalence of selective risk factors of schizophrenia development to subjects with schizophrenia and amphetamine dependence than to amphetamine users without psychosis. Amphetamine-induced psychosis developed more frequently in amphetamine users who used higher amphetamine doses and with familial history of psychosis...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic cannabinoids are {{functionally}} {{similar to}} delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive principle of cannabis, and bind {{to the same}} cannabinoid {{receptors in the brain}} and peripheral organs. From 2008, synthetic cannabinoids were detected in herbal smoking mixtures sold on websites and in "head shops" under the brand name of Spice Gold, Yucatan Fire, Aroma, and others. Although these products (also known as "Spice drugs" or "legal highs") do not contain tobacco or cannabis, when smoked they produce effects similar to THC. <b>Intoxication,</b> withdrawal, <b>psychosis,</b> and death have been recently reported after consumption, posing difficult social, political, and health challenges. More than 140 different Spice products have been identified to date. The ability to induce strong cannabis-like psychoactive effects, along with {{the fact that they are}} readily available on the Internet, still legal in many countries, marketed as natural safe substances, and undetectable by conventional drug screening tests, has rendered these drugs very popular and particularly appealing to young and drug-naive individuals seeking new experiences. An escalating number of compounds with cannabinoid receptor activity are currently being found as ingredients of Spice, of which almost nothing is known in terms of pharmacology, toxicology, and safety. Since legislation started to control the synthetic cannabinoids identified in these herbal mixtures, many new analogs have appeared on the market. New cannabimimetic compounds are likely to be synthesized in the near future to replace banned synthetic cannabinoids, leading to a "dog chasing its tail" situation. Spice smokers are exposed to drugs that are extremely variable in composition and potency, and are at risk of serious, if not lethal, outcomes. Social and health professionals should maintain a high degree of alertness for Spice use and its possible psychiatric effects in vulnerable people...|$|R
40|$|That {{auditory}} hallucinations are voices {{heard in the}} absence of external stimuli implies the existence of endogenous neural activity within the auditory cortex responsible for their perception. Further, {{auditory hallucinations}} occur across a range of healthy and disease states that include reduced arousal, hypnosis, drug <b>intoxication,</b> delirium, and <b>psychosis.</b> This suggests that, even in health, the auditory cortex has a propensity to spontaneously "activate" during silence. Here we report the findings of a functional MRI study, designed to examine baseline activity in speech-sensitive auditory regions. During silence, we show that functionally defined speech-sensitive auditory cortex is characterized by intermittent episodes of significantly increased activity in a large proportion (in some cases > 30 %) of its volume. Bilateral increases in activity are associated with foci of spontaneous activation in the left primary and association auditory cortices and anterior cingulate cortex. We suggest that, within auditory regions, endogenous activity is modulated by anterior cingulate cortex, resulting in spontaneous activation during silence. Hence, an aspect of the brain's "default mode" resembles a (preprepared) substrate for the development of auditory hallucinations. These observations may help explain why such hallucinations are ubiquitous...|$|R
40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the circumstances in}} which a person can lawfully use force in self-defence, in particular how the law should treat mistaken beliefs in the need for self-defence arising from delusions caused by mental illness, heightened perceptions of danger produced by psychological factors, <b>intoxication</b> and drug-induced <b>psychosis.</b> The report also contributes to the current conversation about family violence by considering the operation of the defence where victims of family violence take self-protective action. Background to this Final Report In September 2011, the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the Attorney-General to raise concerns that the current Tasmanian law on self-defence, as contained in s 46 of the Criminal Code (Tas), was too lenient and was out of step with modern standards. In November 2012, the Attorney-General requested that the Tasmania Law Reform Institute conduct a far-reaching examination of the law in Tasmania relating to self-defence and provide advice as to whether the law should be amended. The Institute released an Issues Paper in November 2014, Self-defence, Issues Paper No 20 and a Submission Template, which contained a series of case scenarios, with a call for submissions by 20 February 2015. The Institute received 10 responses to the Issues Paper (see related content link) ...|$|R
