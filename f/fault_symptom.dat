40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{sequential}} fault diagnosis method to handle asynchronous distinct faults using diagnostic hybrid bond graph and composite harmony search. The faults under consideration include fault mode, abrupt fault, and intermittent fault. The faults {{can occur in}} different time instances, which add {{to the difficulty of}} decision making for fault diagnosis. This is because the earlier occurred fault can exhibit <b>fault</b> <b>symptom</b> which masks the <b>fault</b> <b>symptom</b> of latter occurred fault. In order to solve this problem, a sequential identification algorithm is developed in which the identification task is reactivated based on two conditions. The first condition is that the latter occurred fault has at least one inconsistent coherence vector element which is consistent in coherence vector of the earlier occurred fault, and the second condition is that the existing fault coherence vector has the ability to hide other faults and the second-level residual exceeds the threshold. A new composite harmony search which is capable of handling continuous variables and binary variables simultaneously is proposed for identification purpose. Experiments on a mobile robot system are conducted to assess the proposed sequential fault diagnosis algorithm...|$|E

Faults occur frequently in these tough environments {{and the staff}} generally lack professional knowledge and pay a low degree of attention in these areas. Once faults happen, expert personnel must carry out maintenance outdoors. Therefore, this study presents an intelligent method for fault diagnosis based on fault tree analysis and a fuzzy neural network.

Third, the fuzzy neural network is applied to train the relationship mapping between <b>fault</b> <b>symptoms</b> and <b>faults.</b> In the aquaculture IoT, one fault can cause various <b>fault</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and one symptom {{can be caused by}} a variety of faults. Four fault relationships are obtained.

This paper presents an expert-based multivariate decoupling method to enhance the capability of the PCA-based method in fault diagnosis by taking advantage of expert knowledge about the process concerned. The decoupling method develops unique fault patterns of typical sensor faults by analyzing the physical cause-effect relations among variables. Through comparing <b>fault</b> <b>symptoms</b> reflected by the residual vectors of the PCA models with fault patterns, a sensor fault can be successfully isolated. The isolation enhanced PCA method is implemented and validated in a typical air-handling process. The test results show that the joint approach to enhance the fault isolation ability of the PCA-based fault detection and diagnosis method is effective. The robustness of the PCA-based sensor FDD method against component faults is also proved to be improved because the <b>fault</b> <b>symptoms</b> of sensor <b>faults</b> are unique.
