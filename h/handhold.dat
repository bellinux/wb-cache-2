5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a <b>handhold.</b> This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the <b>handhold</b> on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E

500|$|In [...] Star Trek lore, the Klingon Kahless {{created the}} bat'leth around A.D. (C.E.) 625. According to Klingon mythology, he formed the blade by {{dropping}} {{a length of}} his hair into some lava from inside the Kri'stak Volcano, then cooling, shaping, and hardening it in the lake of Lursor. He then united Qo'noS, the Klingon homeworld by killing a tyrant named Molor with the weapon, which became known as “The Sword of Kahless.” The sword was later stolen by a species called the Hur'q during their invasion of Qo'noS. In the Deep Space Nine episode [...] "The Sword of Kahless," [...] Worf and another Klingon named Kor rediscover the artifact, but it is eventually transported into space {{to prevent them from}} using it to attack each other. The Sword of Kahless differs from normal bat'leths as it has five points and one <b>handhold</b> compared to four points and three handholds.|$|E

However, robots that can autonomously find randomly placed <b>handholds,</b> and then plan and climb a route up the walls using those <b>handholds,</b> have not been described.

40|$|Strong social ties {{correspond}} with better health and well being, but the neural mechanisms linking social contact to health remain speculative. This study extends {{work on the}} social regulation of brain activity by supportive <b>handholding</b> in 110 participants (51 female) of diverse racial and socioeconomic origins. In addition to main effects of social regulation by <b>handholding,</b> we assessed the moderating effects of both perceived social support and relationship status (married, cohabiting, dating or platonic friends). Results suggest that, under threat of shock, <b>handholding</b> by familiar relational partners attenuates both subjective distress and activity in a network associated with salience, vigilance and regulatory self-control. Moreover, greater perceived social support corresponded with less brain activity in an extended network associated with similar processes, but only during partner <b>handholding.</b> In contrast, {{we did not observe}} any regulatory effects of <b>handholding</b> by strangers, and relationship status did not moderate the regulatory effects of partner <b>handholding.</b> These findings suggest that contact with a familiar relational partner is likely to attenuate subjective distress and a variety of neural responses associated with the presence of threat. This effect is likely enhanced by an individual's expectation of the availability of support from their wider social network...|$|R
500|$|In 1952, she was {{recruited}} by the traveling rodeo outfit Red River Rodeo as a trick rider, and by the mid-1950s was anticipating an upcoming appearance at with Red River at Madison Square Garden. However, her rodeo career was abruptly cut short in a riding accident during a performance at Olympia Arena in Detroit, Michigan. [...] While performing a trick called the [...] "death drag", she missed a <b>handhold</b> after leaning back too far in her saddle. She fell from her horse and was knocked unconscious when her head hit the arena wall. Her foot was still caught in the stirrup, and she was dragged around the arena, tangled in the horse's legs, until other rodeo personnel were able to stop the horse. She suffered 15 fractures in her left knee. [...] After surgery to repair her knee, she spent several months in recovery encased {{from the waist down}} in a plaster cast. After the cast was removed, she was still able to walk and ride, but not with the facility needed to perform in the rodeo.|$|E
500|$|The Ninja Gaiden games {{gained a}} {{reputation}} throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and attention to detail. Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G's Struan Robertson, wanted a [...] "bloody hard, but also bloody good" [...] challenge, it was feared that casual gamers would find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not [...] "get as much out of this game as others due to [...] incredible difficulty", and Edge commented that [...] "Tecmo’s refusal to extend any kind of <b>handhold</b> to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design, not a badge of hardcore honour" [...] and [...] "it’s impossible to believe they couldn’t {{have found a way}} to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains." [...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually get better at the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace." [...] In 2012, CraveOnline included it on their list of five [...] "badass ninja games", calling it [...] "the pinnacle of action gaming at the time, holding onto that crown for an entire year until God of War released in 2005" [...] and [...] "a true video game classic, and maybe the best ninja game of all time."

2500|$|The usual {{position}} {{that a person}} assumes whilst operating the bow drill is as follows: the right knee {{is placed on the}} ground (assuming a right-handed operator) and the arch of the left foot is on the board, pinning it in place. The left wrist, holding the <b>handhold,</b> is hooked around the left shin and locked in place to keep it steady so it can generate enough downward pressure and speed; achieved by pushing down with the <b>handhold</b> and spinning the drill. The heat of the friction between the hearth and the spindle both creates charred, fuzzy dust and causes it to ignite - forming a coal or ember. The <b>handhold</b> is lubricated and the spindle is carved to about thumb thickness, usually [...] long. Another option to practice is to make the [...] "handhold" [...] into a [...] "mouth-hold" [...] piece, so it's held down by pressure from the chin/mouth, leaving both hands free.|$|E

2500|$|Aid {{climbing}}, climbing using {{equipment that}} acts as artificial <b>handhold</b> or footholds, became popular during the period 1920-1960, leading to ascents in the Alps and in Yosemite Valley that were considered impossible without such means. However, climbing techniques, equipment and ethical considerations have evolved steadily. [...] Today, free climbing, climbing using holds made entirely of natural rock while using gear solely for protection and not for upward movement, {{is the most popular}} form of the sport. Free climbing has since been divided into several sub-styles of climbing dependent on belay configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Camm's {{priority}} {{was to provide}} the pilot with good all-round visibility. To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below {{the trailing edge of}} the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a <b>handhold</b> on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material.|$|E

The {{undertow}} caused by the ship's sinking pulled Gracie down; he freed himself from the ship and rose to the surface near the overturned Collapsible [...] "B". Gracie scrambled onto the overturned lifeboat along with a few dozen other men in the water. His friend Clinch Smith disappeared; his remains were never found. In his memoir, Gracie surmises Smith became entangled with the ropes and other debris on the ship, and could not free himself.|$|E

2500|$|Because pole {{stiffness}} and length are important factors to a vaulter's performance, {{it is not}} uncommon for an elite vaulter to carry as many as ten poles to a competition. The effective properties of a pole can be changed by gripping the pole higher or lower in relation to the top of the pole. The left and right handgrips are typically a bit more than shoulder width apart. Poles are manufactured for people of all skill levels and body sizes, with sizes as short as [...] to as long as , with a wide range of weight ratings. Each manufacturer determines the weight rating for the pole and the location of the maximum <b>handhold</b> band.|$|E
2500|$|The hearth and spindle {{can both}} be {{constructed}} from any medium-soft, dry, non-resinous wood, and work best when both {{are made from}} the same piece of wood; however, with practice almost any wood combination can be used provided the parts contain little or no resin or moisture. The most important factor is whether the wood is dry enough to ignite, as wet wood will not work; yucca, aspen, white cedar, basswood, buckeye and most willows all work very well. Combinations such as hazel and poplar also work well. The bow should be stiff but slightly limber and around {{the distance from the}} users armpit to their fingertips. The bearing block (<b>handhold)</b> can be made of anything that is harder than the spindle. Bone, antler, shell and stone work best, as they can be easily greased, do not create as much friction, and do not burn; however, hard woods such as maple and tulip and red cedar are quite serviceable and often easier to find and work. [...] Some effective materials used to grease the bearing block include sebum, animal and plant oils, or even moist vegetation.|$|E

60|$|There was no instant to waste, {{nor was it}} {{the way of the}} ape-man to fritter away {{precious}} {{moments in}} the uncertainty of belated decision. Before Lu-don or any other could guess what was {{in the mind of the}} condemned, Tarzan with all the force of his great muscles dashed the screaming hierophant in the face of the high priest, and, as though the two actions were one, so quickly did he move, he had leaped to the top of the altar and from there to a <b>handhold</b> upon the summit of the temple wall. As he gained a footing there he turned and looked down upon those beneath. For a moment he stood in silence and then he spoke.|$|E
60|$|The descent, however, must be continued, and {{he began}} to move again, very warily. Presently he found he could not break through the crust with his foot. Clinging hard to his <b>handhold,</b> he lowered himself to feel for a softer spot. His toe went in a little way; he ventured to trust to the slight support; but as he did so the treacherous snow broke beneath him. For a few tense moments his numbed fingers held him to the slope. He tried in terror to kick another hole; the attempt failed, his hands slipped away, {{and he began}} to slide downward, the snow driving up into his face. The pace grew rapidly faster; he could not keep himself straight, but slid on his side; then his pack caught {{something}} that turned him farther round so that his head was lowest. He could see nothing; his pace grew frightful, and he drove on, unable to make the least effort.|$|E

It was quickly evident that its owner had discovered Om-at for immediately he started upward in pursuit. Without a word Tarzan and Ta-den sprang forward toward the foot of the cliff. The pithecanthropus was the first to reach it and the ape-man saw him spring upward for a <b>handhold</b> on the lowest peg above him. Now Tarzan saw other pegs roughly paralleling each other in zigzag rows up the cliff face. He sprang and caught one of these, pulled himself upward by one hand until he could reach a second with his other hand; and when he had ascended far enough to use his feet, discovered that he could make rapid progress. Ta-den was outstripping him, however, for these precarious ladders were no novelty to him and, further, he had an advantage in possessing a tail.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} {{they came to the}} head of a long and furiously-running rapid. Rocks {{encumbered}} its channel; the stream boiled fiercely over sunken ledges, dropping several feet here and there in angry falls; and in one place, where the banks narrowed in, a white stretch of foaming waves ran straight down the middle. Here they unloaded and spent the day laboriously relaying their stores and camp-gear over the boulders and ragged ledges between a wall of rock and the water. It was a remarkably difficult traverse. In places they had to hoist the leader up to some slippery shelf he could not reach unassisted and to which he dragged his companions up in turn; in others deep pools barred their way, and in skirting them they were forced to cling to any indifferent <b>handhold</b> on the rock's fissured side. As they toiled on, badly hampered by their loads, the same thought was in the minds of two of the men--a wonder as to how Gladwyne's exhausted party had crossed that portage, unless the water had been lower. It was not difficult to understand how the famishing leader had fallen and lamed himself.|$|E
60|$|With Fay leading, they {{followed}} the rim toward {{the head of the}} valley. Here the wall had caved in, and there was a slope of jumbled rock a thousand feet wide and more than that in depth. It was easy to descend because there were so many rocks waist-high that afforded a <b>handhold.</b> Shefford marked, however, that Fay never took advantage of these. More than once he paused to watch her. Swiftly she went down; she stepped from rock to rock; lightly she crossed cracks and pits; she ran along the sharp and broken edge of a long ledge; she poised on a pointed stone and, sure-footed as a mountain-sheep, she sprang to another that had scarce surface for a foothold; her moccasins flashed, seemed to hold wondrously on any angle; and when a rock tipped or slipped with her she leaped to a surer stand. Shefford watched her performance, so swift, agile, so perfectly balanced, showing such wonderful accord between eye and foot; and then when he swept his gaze down upon that wild valley where she had roamed alone for twelve years he marveled no more.|$|E
