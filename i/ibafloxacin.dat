50|$|<b>Ibafloxacin</b> (INN) is a Fluoroquinolone {{antibiotic}} drug used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{behavior of}} <b>ibafloxacin</b> was studied after intravenous administration {{of a single}} dose of 15 mg/kg to 6 healthy lactating goats. Plasma concentrations of <b>ibafloxacin</b> were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The data for concentration versus time could best be described by a 2 -compartment model. The mean plasma <b>ibafloxacin</b> clearance (and standard error) was 1. 05 (0. 10) L/h·kg. The mean steady-state volume of distribution was 1. 65 (0. 42) L/kg. The mean elimination half-life was 3. 76 (0. 30) h. <b>Ibafloxacin</b> penetration from the blood to the milk was poor. The ratio between the areas under the concentration–time curve of milk and plasma was 0. 20 (0. 01), indicating scant penetration of <b>ibafloxacin</b> into the milk...|$|E
40|$|A simple, rapid, and {{sensitive}} high-performance liquid chromatographic method is {{developed for the}} determination of <b>ibafloxacin</b> in rabbit plasma. Plasma proteins are precipitated with acetonitrile, and after extraction with methylene chloride followed by desecation, <b>ibafloxacin</b> is determined by reversed-phase chromatography with fluorescence detection exciting at 330 nm and emission at 368 nm. Peaks corresponding to <b>ibafloxacin</b> and the internal standard (salycilic acid) are obtained at 9. 8 and 5. 2 min, respectively. The method is validated for a limit of quantitation of 10 ng/mL. The intraday relative standard deviation ranges from 4. 78 – 7. 15 %, and the interday precision ranges from 1. 32 – 4. 03 %. The method shows linearity for the two calibration curves used (10 – 100 ng/mL and 100 – 2000 ng/mL). The procedure described is applied successfully to a pharmacokinetics study of <b>ibafloxacin</b> in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{intrinsic}} activity of pradofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone developed {{for use in}} veterinary medicine, with other fluoroquinolones, against anaerobic bacteria isolated from dogs and cats. Methods: One hundred and forty-one anaerobes were isolated from dogs and cats and comparative MICs of pradofloxacin, marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin, difloxacin and <b>ibafloxacin</b> were determined accord-ing to standardized agar dilution methodology. Results: Pradofloxacin exerted the greatest antibacterial activity followed by marbofloxacin, enrofloxa-cin, difloxacin and <b>ibafloxacin.</b> Based on the distinctly lower MIC 50, MIC 90 and mode MIC values, prado-floxacin exhibited a higher in vitro activity {{than any of the}} comparator fluoroquinolones. Conclusions: Pradofloxacin, a novel third-generation fluoroquinolone, has broad-spectrum anti-anaerobe activity and offers utility as single-drug therapy for mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections...|$|E
