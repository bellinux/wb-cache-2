Due to this limitation, the TV tuner adapter is now relegated to a collectible for most people although its RCA audio/video input function (albeit very limited with its low screen resolution) will still be operational with the correct cables.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the {{work being done}} {{for the design of}} an <b>external</b> <b>video</b> capture card that is capable of inputting a <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> from a DVD player via component video cables and outputting an IEEE 1394 formatted video stream via an IEEE 1394 cable to a personal computer that is connected to a video projector via a VGA cable. An FPGA development board and a video decoder board were purchased to model the video capture system, by using Verilog programming language, the video capture system. The IEEE 1394 connection was not fully implemented at this time due to time, inexperience, and budget constraints. Extensive testing of the analog to digital conversion was done by connecting a DVD player to the video decoder board and outputting the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> to a computer monitor. The results of testing show that a <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> can be captured, from the DVD player, by the video decoder board and converted using an FPGA to a RGB signal for output to a VGA monitor. We are proposing to upgrade an <b>external</b> <b>video</b> capture card design to include component video inputs and an IEEE 1394 output. These upgrades will allow the user to maintain the quality of the video being captured. It might not be as dramatic as black and white to color television for some but the consumers who have taken note are purchasing HDcapable televisions at a high rate. PC-users- especially Linux-based machine users- are buying or building and installing HDTV tuner cards at a high rate also. The initial work for this <b>external</b> <b>video</b> capture card system, Fig. 1, was begun in April of 2005. A team of three students was formed to attempt the project. The team members skills included: limited experience with a fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA), digital signal processing, electric circuit design, and retail electronic sales...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis is to design a small, stand-alone microcomputer using the MC 68020 CPU and its environment. It is dedicated {{to one of the}} most common jobs of microcomputers: "Video text generation". therefore it is named "VTG (Video-Test Generator). VTG consists of a CPU (MC 68020), CRT Controller (MC 6845), and DUART (MC 68681). The CRT Controller processes and generates the NTSC standard video-synchronization and video-text signals. The DUART accomplished asynchronous serial communication with the Keyboard unit and allows for the parallel communications via its parallel port, with peripherals. The VTG has four 32 KBK of RAM for main memory and one 16 KB of RAM of the CRT Controller Refresh Memory. The system software and the initialization routine is saved in 32 KB of ROM. Memory management and the generation of chip control signals are accomplished by two PALs (Programmable Logic Arrays) and two EPLDs (Erasable Programmable Logic Device). The CPU, PALs, EPLDs, and Memory chips in the VTG work at a speed of 8 MHz, while the CRT Controller works at 2 MHz. In addition, the systems has a "Video Synchronization and Multiplexing Unit" which make it possible to synchronize the VTG's video-text signal with an <b>external</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> Accomplishing this, the system can place its text information into any NTSC standard video picture. To perform these jobs, the system does not need another microcomputer or aid. It can work as a stand-alone system. In this thesis, the whole VTG system has been designed and implemented. Each PAL and EPLD was tested with a Logic Analyzer. Proper simulations were performed and observed to work properly, as they were programmed. [URL] Turkish Air Forc...|$|E
50|$|Atari's 16-bit {{computer}} range utilized a 13-pin DIN connector for its video output; {{this single}} connector could carry the colour RGB <b>signals,</b> a composite <b>video</b> <b>signal,</b> the high-resolution monochrome <b>video</b> <b>signal,</b> {{vertical and horizontal}} sync, ground, mono audio, and later, <b>external</b> <b>video</b> clock input, each on its own dedicated pin. If Pin 4 was connected to ground, the computer would detect this and boot into the high-resolution monochrome video mode that was not user-selectable and only worked with specially designed monitors (the vertical refresh rate being 71 Hz as opposed to 50/60 Hz for colour modes). Atari also used a 14-pin DIN connector for their external floppy disk drives, primarily for space-saving reasons; the port occupies much less of the crowded rear of the computer than on contemporaries such as the Amiga and Macintosh, which used physically larger D-shell connectors with a 20+ pin count.|$|R
50|$|The Amiga chipset can genlock, {{which is}} the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an {{incoming}} NTSC or PAL <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an <b>external</b> <b>video</b> source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do character generation and CGI effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The NewTek Video Toaster was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.|$|R

5000|$|Video {{modulation}} is {{a strategy}} of transmitting <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> {{in the field of}} radio modulation and television technology. This strategy enables the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> to be transmitted more efficiently through long distances. In general, video modulation means that a higher frequency carrier wave is modified according to the original <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> In this way, carrier wave contains the information in the <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> Then, the carrier will [...] "carry" [...] the information in the form of radio frequency (RF) signal. When carrier reaches its destination, the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> is extracted from the carrier by decoding. In other words, the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> is first combined with a higher frequency carrier wave so that carrier wave contains the information in <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> The combined signal is called radio-frequency signal. At the end of this transmitting system, the RF signals stream from a light sensor and hence, the receivers can obtain the initial data in the original <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
