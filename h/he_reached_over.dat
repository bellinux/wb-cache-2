5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E

If the singing blade rips 50 rough {{shingles}} off the block every minute, the sawyer must <b>reach</b> <b>over</b> to its teeth 50 times in 60 seconds; if the automatic carriage feeds the odorous wood 60 times into the hungry teeth, 60 times <b>he</b> must <b>reach</b> <b>over,</b> turn the shingle, trim its edge on the gleaming saw in front of him, cut the narrow strip containing the knot hole with two quick movements of his right hand, and toss the completed board down the chute to the packers, meanwhile keeping eyes and ears open for the sound that asks him to feed a new block into the untiring teeth. Hour after hour the shingle weaver's hands and arms, plain, unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs. Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood, the sawdust cloud thickens, the wet sponge under the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles. [...] "If 'cedar asthma,' the shingle weaver's occupational disease, does not get him, the steel will. Sooner or later <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> a little too far, the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air, and a finger, a hand, or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute." ...|$|R

50|$|Later that night, {{the robbers}} return and send {{one of their}} members in to investigate. He sees the Cat's eyes shining in the {{darkness}} and the robber thinks he is seeing the coals of the fire. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> to light his candle. Things happen in quick succession; the Cat scratches his face with her claws, the Dog bites him on the leg, the Donkey kicks him with his hooves, and the Rooster crows and chases him out the door, screaming. He tells his companions that he was beset by a horrible witch who scratched him with her long fingernails (the Cat), an ogre with a knife (the Dog), a giant who had hit him with his club (the Donkey), and worst of all, the judge who screamed from the rooftop (the Rooster). The robbers abandon the cottage to the strange creatures who have taken it, where the animals live happily {{for the rest of}} their days.|$|R
25|$|Isac was a {{participant}} in civic or political causes, defending the rights of ethnic Romanians in Austria–Hungary from a socialist position, and, during the 1918 union with Romania, served as a community representative. He was however interested in preserving good relations between his ethnic group and the Hungarians. An occasional contributor to Hungarian-language reviews, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> out <b>over</b> political divides, maintaining close contacts with Hungarian intellectuals such as Endre Ady, Oszkár Jászi, János Thorma and Aladár Kuncz.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly Mr. Toad {{remembered that}} he had on his working clothes, which were very old, very dirty and very ragged. For just a minute he didn't know what to do. Then he dived under a cabbage leaf and began to pull off his old suit. But the old suit stuck! He {{was in such a}} hurry and so excited that he couldn't find the buttons. Finally he got his {{trousers}} off. Then <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> and got hold of the back of his coat and tugged and hauled until finally he pulled his old coat off right over his head just {{as if it were a}} shirt.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't allow it. I {{pushed him}} away, {{and when he}} laughed at me I told {{him that if he}} tried it again I would box his ears. Then, just after we had passed this place, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> and caught hold of me and tried to pull me toward him. Then I boxed him, just as I had said I would. That made him furious, and he put on a burst of speed, and the next minute there was a terrible bump and a crash, and both of us were almost thrown out of the car. The wind-shield was broken and also, I think, the front axle, and he was {{scratched}} in several places. Oh, it was awful!" [...] And again Grace hid her face on Sam's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly a great {{volume of}} sound filled the corridor, {{and the band}} burst forth into what many {{supposed}} to be [...] "The Watch on the Rhine." [...] Some people were plainly delighted; the veterans, once recovered from their surprise, shouted their reminiscences above the music, undismayed; Jethro held on to himself until the refrain, {{when he began to}} squirm, {{and as soon as the}} tune was done and the scattering applause had died down, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> and grabbed Mr. Amasa Beard by the knee. Mr. Beard did not immediately respond, being at that moment behind logworks facing a rebel charge; he felt vaguely that some one was trying to distract his attention, and in some lobe of his brain was registered the fact that that particular knee had gout in it. Jethro increased the pressure, and then Mr. Beard abandoned his logworks and swung around with a snort of pain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} season, Sean offers Quentin a limited {{partnership}} after Christian neglects {{to return to}} work after being attacked by the Carver. Initially, Christian refuses to accept having Quentin as an associate, but later changes his mind and supports the decision. A couple of episodes later, he and Sean go to a frat party together. They end up receiving fellatio from two college girls, during which Costa winks at Sean. This bothers Sean and he leaves the room. In the same episode Christian asks Costa to help take Kit McGraw off his hands because he is tired of the three-way relationship with her and Kimber Henry. While in bed with Kit on one side and Christian and Kimber on the other <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>over</b> and touches Christian's buttocks. Costa later explains that he is bisexual, and assumed Christian was as well. After Sean briefly leaves the practice, Costa remains to assist Christian with surgeries. Later Christian believes that Costa is on drugs and calls Sean to assist with the facial transplant surgery they are working on. Sean later returns to the practice.|$|R

60|$|The nest {{was simply}} a great {{platform}} of sticks. When Farmer Brown's boy reached it, he found {{that he could not}} get where he could look into it, so <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> and felt inside. Almost at once his fingers touched something that made him tingle all over. It was an egg, a great big egg! There was no doubt about it. It was just as hard for him to believe as it had been for Blacky the Crow to believe, when he first saw those eggs. Farmer Brown's boy's fingers closed over that egg and took it out of the nest. Mrs. Hooty swooped very close, and Farmer Brown's boy nearly dropped the egg as he struck at her with his stick. Then Mrs. Hooty and Hooty seemed to lose courage and withdrew to a tree near by, where they snapped their bills and hissed.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel, who {{had been}} having a fine time with the {{impatient}} and curious hounds, did not vouchsafe any information on that score. But very shortly we were destined to learn {{the use of this}} incongruous firearm. I was riding in advance of Wallace, and a little behind Jones. The dogs--excepting Jude, {{who had been}} kicked and lamed--were ranging along before their master. Suddenly, right before me, I saw an immense jack-rabbit; and just then Moze and Don caught sight of it. In fact, Moze bumped his blunt nose into the rabbit. When it leaped into scared action, Moze yelped, and Don followed suit. Then they were after it in wild, clamoring pursuit. Jones let out the stentorian blast, now becoming familiar, and spurred after them. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over,</b> pulled the shotgun out of the holster and fired both barrels at the jumping dogs.|$|E
6000|$|I {{did not see}} the {{application}} and told him so. For reply <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said, [...] "The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow. That is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and I wait till the ear begins to swell." [...] He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on gravely, [...] "You were always a careful student, and your case book was ever more full than the rest. And I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practice, {{let me tell you that}} this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} more shots but no further cry. Then {{they heard the}} sound of excited voices and {{immediately}} afterwards rapidly approaching footsteps.
