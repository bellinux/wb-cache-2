500|$|Troy McClure, also {{voiced by}} Hartman, marries Selma {{in the season}} seven episode [...] "A Fish Called Selma". It is a sham {{marriage}} devised to revitalize his career and image. When he tells her this, Selma is devastated to {{have been used by}} yet another terrible husband. For a while, she attempts {{to go along with the}} ruse, if only for the creature comforts she can access. When Troy says they need to have a child to divert public attention from rumors of his fetish involving aquarium fish, Selma <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a line she will not cross, and they divorce.|$|E
500|$|Nearby, the Doctor {{tells the}} TARDIS he <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his last trip in her and offers some parting words {{to a small}} group of children. In the far future, River Song, {{recently}} made a Doctor of Archaeology, reviews eyewitness accounts made by those children when they were adults, and also notes the date and location of the Doctor's death. She is interrupted by Madame Kovarian and agents of the Silence. [...] Kovarian tells River that she is still theirs, and will be the one to kill the Doctor. Against River's will, they place her in an augmented astronaut's suit and submerge her in Lake Silencio to await the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|The others discuss {{who shot}} Ron, and Tom creates a minor panic when he {{suggests}} perhaps an outsider is hunting them. Ann takes Leslie aside {{and says she}} knows who shot Ron, {{and a few minutes}} later Leslie admits to the group that she was the shooter, even though Ann <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not the case. A park ranger (Jay Johnston) arrives and interrogates Leslie, implying that the accident is the result of her femininity. Leslie knows that she is a good hunter, but goes along with the ranger's sexist implications in order to appease him. Later, a bandaged Ron repeatedly berates Leslie, prompting Ann to insist Tom come forward. Tom admits he shot Ron, and that Leslie covered for him because he did not have his hunting license, which could have resulted in a $25,000 fine and prison time. Ron is impressed with Leslie, whom he calls a [...] "stand-up guy". The episode ends with a get well party for Ron, where Ann is unimpressed with Andy's hickey, and the whole party is horrified by Ron's head wound.|$|E

2500|$|Smith {{continues}} to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence, {{coupled with a}} childlike naïveté. [...] When Harshaw tries to explain religion to him, Smith understands the concept of God only as [...] "one who groks", which includes every extant organism. This leads him to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase [...] "Thou art God", although he <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a bad translation. Many other human concepts such as war, clothing, and jealousy are strange to him, while {{the idea of an}} afterlife is a fact he takes for granted because Martian society is directed by [...] "Old Ones", the spirits of Martians who have [...] "discorporated". It is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead, in a rite similar to Holy Communion. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet already inhabited by intelligent life.|$|E

I wonder if you can really conceive me as a politician in this extra-mundane sphere--presiding at public meetings, drafting proclamations, receiving mis-addressed letters that have been carried all night through tropical forests? It seems strange indeed, and to you, who know me really, must seem stranger. I do not say I am free from the itch of meddling, but God <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> no tempting job to meddle in; I smile at picturesque circumstances like the Misi Mea (Monsieur Chose is the exact equivalent) correspondence, but the business as a whole bores and revolts me.

He could see the charcoal-burners huddled in a knot; old Buldeo's {{gun-barrel}} waving, like a banana-leaf, to every point of the compass at once. Then Gray Brother gave the Ya-la-hi! Yalaha! call for the buck-driving, when the Pack drives the nilghai, the big blue cow, before them, and it seemed to come from the very ends of the earth, nearer, and nearer, and nearer, till it ended in a shriek snapped off short. The other three answered, till even Mowgli could have vowed that the full Pack was in full cry, and then they all broke into the magnificent Morning-song in the Jungle, with every turn, and flourish, and grace-note that a deep-mouthed wolf of the Pack <b>knows.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a rough rendering of the song, but you must imagine what it sounds like when it breaks the afternoon hush of the Jungle:-- ...|$|E
