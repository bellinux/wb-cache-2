5|$|The 1971 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was fairly active with several notable storms. Hurricane Edith, the strongest of the season, was a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the highest category on the scale. It struck Nicaragua at peak intensity, killing <b>dozens,</b> <b>and</b> later hit southern Louisiana. Until 2003, Hurricane Ginger held {{the record for}} the longest known duration of a North Atlantic tropical cyclone, lasting 27.25days from early September to early October; it is currently the second longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane. Ginger moved ashore in North Carolina, producing heavy rains and damaging winds. An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other Atlantic hurricane. Between 11 and 12 September five tropical cyclones were active at the same time, {{the record for the}} Atlantic basin.|$|E

25|$|In the 2014 {{election}} the Awami League led alliance won {{a second}} term. With 21 people dead, along with further {{human rights abuses}} and an absence of opposition, {{this was one of}} the controversial general elections in Bangladesh's history. This election was further tainted by arbitrary arrests where <b>dozens</b> <b>and</b> perhaps hundreds of opposition leaders and members were taken into custody before the elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). On December 10, 2015, the UK released a report on Bangladeshi elections where they reported 'exposed high levels of shortcomings' in Bangladesh's elections.|$|E
25|$|Louis XVI and {{his family}} fled Paris on 21 June 1791, but were {{captured}} in Varennes and brought back to Paris on 25 June. Hostility grew within Paris between the liberal aristocrats and merchants, who wanted a constitutional monarchy, and the more radical sans-culottes from the working-class and poor neighbourhoods, who wanted a republic and {{the abolition of the}} Ancien Régime, including the privileged classes: the aristocracy and the Church. Aristocrats continued to leave Paris for safety in the countryside or abroad. On 17 July 1791, the National Guard fired upon a gathering of petitioners on the Champs de Mars, killing <b>dozens</b> <b>and</b> widening the gulf between the more moderate and more radical revolutionaries.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 17 February, {{security}} forces retook control of the roundabout, killing four protesters and injuring over 300 in the process. Manama was subsequently placed under lockdown, with tanks and armed soldiers taking up positions around the capital city. In response, Al Wefaq MPs, then the largest bloc, submitted their resignations from the lower house of the National Assembly of Bahrain. The next morning over 50,000 {{took part in the}} funerals of victims. In the afternoon, hundreds of them marched to Manama. When they neared the Pearl Roundabout, the army opened fire injuring <b>dozens</b> <b>and</b> fatally wounding one. Troops withdrew from the Pearl Roundabout on 19 February, and protesters reestablished their camps there. The crown prince assured protesters that they would be allowed to camp at the roundabout.|$|E
25|$|Socialism was not {{initially}} {{a major part}} of the Neo Destour project, but the government had always held and implemented redistributive policies. A large public works program was launched in 1961. Nonetheless in 1964, Tunisia entered a short lived socialist era. The Neo Destour party became the Socialist Destour (Parti Socialiste Destourien or PSD), and the new minister of planning, Ahmed Ben Salah, formulated a state-led plan for agricultural cooperatives and public-sector industrialization. The socialist experiment raised considerable opposition within Bourguiba's old coalition. Ahmed Ben Salah was eventually dismissed in 1970, and many socialized operations (e.g., the farm cooperatives) were returned to private ownership in the early 1970s. In 1978, a general strike was repressed by the government with its forces killing <b>dozens,</b> <b>and</b> union leaders were jailed.|$|E
500|$|Amazing Stories was {{influential}} {{simply by}} being {{the first of its}} kind. In the words of science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, the magazine was [...] "a snag in the stream of history, from which a V-shape spread out in <b>dozens</b> <b>and</b> then in hundreds of altered lives". Many early fans of the field began {{to communicate with each other}} through the letter column, and to publish fanzines—amateur fan publications that helped establish connections among fans across the country. Many of these fans in turn became successful writers; and the existence of an organized science fiction fandom, and of writers such as Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov, who came to writing directly from fandom, can be dated to the creation of Amazing Stories. After the first few years, when there was little or no competition, Amazing Stories never again led the field in the eyes of critics or fans. Despite its long history, the magazine rarely contributed much to science fiction beyond the initial creation of the genre, though Gernsback himself is commemorated in the name Hugo, which is the almost universally used term for the World Science Fiction Society's annually presented Science Fiction Achievement Awards. Gernsback has also been called the [...] "Father of Science Fiction" [...] for his role in creating Amazing Stories.|$|E

Adams and Fuller (2006) state that, in misogynistic rap, a bitch is a [...] "money-hungry, scandalous, manipulating, and demanding woman". However, the word bitch is also frequently used (by male rappers) towards other men in rap lyrics, usually to describe {{a man who is}} a subordinate or homosexual, or a man who is supposedly unmanly or inferior in some way.|$|E

[...] He also advocates investigating why the various intelligence agencies could not collaborate on information to prevent the attacks while spending $40 billion per year.
