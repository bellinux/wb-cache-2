5|$|Nitrite is also {{a common}} ligand that can {{coordinate}} in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito <b>isomerism</b> is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans <b>isomerism).</b> Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric <b>isomerism,</b> which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
25|$|Structural <b>isomerism</b> {{occurs when}} the bonds are {{themselves}} different. There are four types of structural isomerism: ionisation <b>isomerism,</b> solvate or hydrate <b>isomerism,</b> linkage <b>isomerism</b> and coordination <b>isomerism.</b>|$|E
25|$|There exist {{many kinds}} of <b>isomerism</b> in {{coordination}} complexes, just {{as in many other}} compounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{rigidity}} of cumulenes {{arises from}} the fact that the internal carbon atoms carry two double bonds. Their sp hybridisation results in two π bonds, one to each neighbor, which are perpendicular to each other. This bonding reinforces a linear geometry of the carbon chain. If the number of consecutive double bonds is odd, there is cis–trans <b>isomerism</b> as for alkenes. Cumulenes with non-equivalent substituents on each end exhibit <b>isomerism.</b> If the number of consecutive double bonds is even, there is axial chirality as for allenes.|$|E
25|$|Arachidonic acid (AA), i.e. 5Z, 8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid is ω-6 fatty acid, {{with four}} double bonds in the cis {{configuration}} (see Cis–trans <b>isomerism)</b> each located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11,-12, and 14-15.|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{and most}} of its {{derivatives}} do not exhibit optical <b>isomerism,</b> although some more distant relatives like the morphinan series (levorphanol, dextorphan and the racemic parent chemical dromoran) do, and as noted above stereoselectivity in vivo is an important issue.|$|E
25|$|Ionisation isomerismnbsp&– the isomers give {{different}} ions in solution {{although they}} have the same composition. This type of <b>isomerism</b> occurs when the counter ion of the complex is also a potential ligand. For example, pentaamminebromocobalt(III) sulphate SO4 is red violet and in solution gives a precipitate with barium chloride, confirming the presence of sulphate ion, while pentaamminesulphatecobalt(III) bromide Br is red and tests negative for sulphate ion in solution, but instead gives a precipitate of AgBr with silver nitrate.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{noticed that}} {{crystals}} of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, {{half of the}} crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was levorotatory. Pasteur determined that optical activity related {{to the shape of}} the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light. The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of <b>isomerism.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Isomerism</b> caused much consternation {{to early}} researchers, since isomers have {{exactly the same}} composition, but differ in {{configuration}} (arrangement) of the atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the chemical identity of benzene, until the correct structure was described by Friedrich August Kekulé. Likewise, the idea of stereoisomerism - that atoms have rigid three-dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement - was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances. For example, tartaric acid has three distinct isomers, a pair of diastereomers with one diastereomer forming two enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) {{stereoisomers}} with an approximate ratio of 85:15. When doxepin was developed, no effort was made to separate or balance the mixture following its synthesis, resulting in the asymmetric ratio. (Z)-Doxepin is more active as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake than (E)-doxepin. The selectivity of doxepin for inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake over that of serotonin is likely due to the 85% presence of (E)-doxepin in the mixture. Most other tertiary amine TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine do not exhibit E-Z <b>isomerism</b> or such mixture asymmetry and are comparatively more balanced inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.|$|E
25|$|Arachidonic acid (AA) has double {{bonds between}} carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; these double bonds {{are in the}} cis (see Cis–trans <b>isomerism</b> or Z {{as opposed to the}} trans or E configuration. ALOX15 adds a hydroperoxy residue to AA at carbons 15 {{and to a lesser extent}} 12 to from 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HpETE) and 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E, 15S-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE); the {{purified}} enzyme makes 15(S)-HpETE and 12(S)-HpETE in a product ratio of ~4-9 to 1. Both products may be rapidly reduced by ubiquitous cellular Glutathione peroxidase enzymes to their corresponding hydroxy analogs, 15(S)-HETE (see 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 12(S)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE bind to and activate the Leukotriene B4 receptor 2, activate the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and at high concentrations cause cells to generate toxic reactive oxygen species; one or more of these effects may be at least in part responsible for their ability to promote inflammatory responses, alter the growth of various times of human cancer cell lines, contract various types of blood vessels, and stimulate pathological fibrosis in pulmonary arteries and liver (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE are esterified into membrane phospholipids where they may be stored and subsequently released during cell stimulation. As one aspect of this processing, the two products are progressively esterified in mitochondria membrane phospholipids during the maturation of red blood cells (see erythropoiesis) and thereby may serve to signal for the degradation of the mitochondria and the maturation of these precursors to red blood cells in mice. This pathway operates along with two other mitochondria-removing pathways and therefore does not appear essential for mouse red blood cell maturation.|$|E
