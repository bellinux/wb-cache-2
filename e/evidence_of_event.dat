40|$|In {{this chapter}} I focus on asking and {{answering}} the following questions: (1) What {{is a black}} hole? Answer: There are three types of black holes, namely mathematical black holes, physical black holes and astrophysical black holes. An astrophysical black hole, with mass distributed within its event horizon but not concentrated at the singularity point, is not a mathematical black hole. (2) Can astrophysical black holes be formed in the physical universe? Answer: Yes, at least {{this can be done}} with gravitational collapse. (3) How can we prove that what we call astrophysical black holes are really black holes? Answer: Finding direct <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> horizon {{is not the way to}} go. Instead I propose five criteria which meet the highest standard for recognizing new discoveries in experimental physics and observational astronomy. (4) Do we have sufficient evidence to claim the existence of astrophysical black holes in the physical universe? Answer: Yes, astrophysical black holes have been found at least in some galactic binary systems, at the center of almost every galaxy, and as the central engines of at least some long gamma-ray bursts. (5) Will all matter in the universe eventually fall into black holes? Answer: Probably "no", because "naked" compact objects, if they do exist with radii smaller than the radii of event horizons for their masses but are not enclosed by event horizons, can rescue the universe from an eternal death by re-cycling out the matter previously accreted into astrophysical black holes. Finally I also discuss briefly if we need a quantum theory of gravity in order to further understand astrophysical black holes, and what further astronomical observations and telescopes are needed to make further progress on our understanding of astrophysical black holes.

The effect is named after Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film Rashomon, in which a murder is described in four mutually contradictory ways by its four witnesses.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an event recognition framework, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, that combines <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> from low-level computer vision analytics. The proposed method em-ploying evidential network modelling <b>of</b> composite <b>events,</b> {{is able to}} represent uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>event</b> output from low level video analysis and infer high-level events with semantic meaning along with de-grees of belief. The method has been evaluated on videos taken of subjects entering and leaving a seated area. This has relevance {{to a number of}} transport scenarios, such as onboard buses and trains, and also in train stations and airports. Recognition results of 78 % and 100 % for four composite events are encouraging. ...|$|R

50|$|The City of London {{serves as}} an example, for urban {{excavations}} have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by Boudica in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt.|$|R

However, at the time Uelsmann was considered to have almost [...] "magical skill" [...] with his completely analog tools. At the time Uelsmann's work first came to popular attention, photos were still widely regarded as unfalsifiable documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> However, Uelsmann, along with Lucas Samaras, was considered an avant garde shatterer of this popular mindset and help to expand the artistic boundaries of photography.|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of timelines of computer activity {{is a part}} of many digital investigations. These timelines <b>of</b> <b>events</b> are composed <b>of</b> traces of historical activity drawn from system logs and potentially from <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> found in the computer file system. A potential problem with the use of such information is that some of it may be inconsistent and contradictory thus compromising its value. This work introduces a software tool (CAT Detect) for the detection of inconsistency within timelines of computer activity. We examine the impact of deliberate tampering through experiments conducted with our prototype software tool. Based on the results of these experiments, we discuss techniques which can be employed to deal with such temporal inconsistencies...|$|R

40|$|Beauty Within Decay is {{a series}} of {{sculpture}} that examines and obverts the idea of grotesqueness of decay. This body of work presents three life-sized female figures, along with four smaller sculptures, representing my creative processes.

Drawing inspiration {{from a wide range of}} sources these abstracted female figures are layered with the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> that have shaped them as survivors. Their skin tells a story, reflective of theories about the concept of monstrosity linking decay with the idea of unexpected byproducts of destruction. I hope that my negotiation of complex source materials and layered processes results in a rich tapestry of philosophical meaning within the sculptural forms...|$|R

Matyushin formed a new study group, Zorved (ÐÐ¾ÑÐ²ÐµÐ´, literally see and know) and claimed that it discovered <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>events</b> and object located behind the person, and that humans possess visual centers capable of resolving this rearward [...] "vision".|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, Cassidy's successor, Archbishop Michael Neary, {{established}} a commission of enquiry to investigate claims of supernatural phenomena {{arising from the}} centre.

25|$|The {{inscriptions}} seldom provide solid historical <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> and identifiable {{people but}} instead offer {{insight into the}} development of language and poetry, kinship, and habits of name-giving, settlement, depictions from Norse paganism, place-names and communications, Viking as well as trading expeditions, and, not least, the spread of Christianity. Though the stones offer Scandinavian historians their main resource of information concerning early Scandinavian society, not much can be learned by studying the stones individually. The wealth of information that the stones provide {{can be found in}} the different movements and reasons for erecting the stones, in each region respectively. Approximately ten percent of the known runestones announce the travels and deaths of men abroad. These runic inscriptions coincide with certain Latin sources, such as the Annals of St. Bertin and the writings of Liudprand of Cremona, which contain valuable information on Scandinavians/Rus' who visited Byzantium.|$|R
