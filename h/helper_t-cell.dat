40|$|AbstractWe {{develop and}} analyze {{a model for}} the {{interactions}} of T-cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), and HIV- 1. Our model consists of five components: APCs, resting <b>helper</b> <b>T-cells,</b> activated uninfected <b>helper</b> <b>T-cells,</b> activated and infected <b>helper</b> <b>T-cells,</b> and the free virus. We emphasize the impact of APCs during HIV infection and the cell-to-cell contact manner in the transference of HIV- 1 in vivo. The existence and stability of the uninfected steady state and those of the infected steady states are discussed. The uniform persistence of the system is also obtained. As a novel approach, multiple exposures of HIV- 1 are illustrated and discussed in the paper.

However, macrophages and B cells can only activate memory T cells whereas dendritic cells can activate both memory and naive T cells, and are the most potent of all the antigen-presenting cells. Whereas mature dendritic cells are able to activate antigen-specific naive CD8+ T cells, the formation of CD8+ memory T cells requires the interaction of dendritic cells with CD4+ helper T cells. This help from CD4+ T cells additionally activates the matured dendritic cells and licenses them to efficiently induce CD8+ memory T cells, which are also able to be expanded a second time. For this activation of dendritic cells, concurrent interaction of all three cell types, namely CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, seems to be required.|$|E

50|$|Exposed on {{the surface}} of the viral envelope, the {{glycoprotein}} gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor on any target cell that has such a receptor, particularly the <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell.</b> See HIV tropism and Replication cycle of HIV. Strains of HIV-1 have been isolated that are able to enter host cells that are CD4 negative. This CD4-independence is associated with spontaneous mutation in the env gene. The presence of a co-receptor, CXCR4, is sufficient for this mutant strain to infect human cells. The strain with this phenotype was found to have seven mutations in the sequence coding for gp120 and it is proposed that these mutations induce conformational changes in gp120 that allow the virus to directly interact with the co-receptor.|$|E
50|$|Not only {{do certain}} HLA alleles {{prescribe}} increased or decreased resistance to HIV, but HIV {{is able to}} alter HLA expression, and does so selectively to avoid being eliminated by natural killer cells (NK cells). Research has shown that HIV downregulates Class I MHC expression in infected cells. However, doing so indiscriminately opens up the opportunity for attack by NK cells, because NK cells respond to downregulation of HLA-C and HLA-E. Obviously, this mechanism has put selective pressure on the HIV virus. Thus, HIV has evolved the capability to downregulate HLA-A and HLA-B without significantly disturbing the expression of HLA-C and HLA-E. A protein coded for by the HIV genome, negative regulatory factor (Nef), induces this change by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the Class I MHC while it {{is still in the}} endoplasmic reticulum or occasionally while it is {{in the early stages of}} trafficking through the golgi bodies. This complex of MHC and Nef then causes adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) to direct the MHC to the lysosomes for degradation instead of to the cell membrane where it normally functions. In addition to selective HLA downregulation, negative regulatory factor (Nef) enables HIV to downregulate CD4 and CD8. These glycoproteins are essential for, respectively, <b>helper</b> <b>t-cell</b> and cytotoxic t-cell binding to MHCs. Without these cofactors, both types of t-cells are less likely to bind to HLAs and initiate apoptosis, even if the HLA is expressing an HIV derived (non-self) peptide. Both of these proteins are also targeted at their cytoplasmic tail domain. The combination of these abilities greatly enhances HIV's ability to avoid detection by the immune system.|$|E

We demonstrate that the co-transduced CD 8 αβ co-receptor in HLA-I-TCR transduced CD 4 (+) T-cells behaves as an adhesion molecule, since for optimal antigen-specific HLA class I restricted CD 4 (+) T-cell reactivity the extracellular domains of the CD 8 α and ß subunits are sufficient...|$|R

40|$|A {{battery of}} 19 {{synthetic}} peptides {{was used to}} characterize efficient neutralizing and <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> epitopes on the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) external envelope glycoprotein gp 51. Four of the antipeptide antisera raised in rabbits inhibited the formation of BLV-induced syncytia; these antisera are directed against peptides 64 - 73, 98 - 117, and 177 - 192. Only antisera directed against the 177 - 192 region also neutralized vesicular stomatitis virus-BLV pseudotypes. This study clearly demonstrates that neutralizing properties can be observed with antibodies raised to regions undescribed so far and included in both the amino-terminal and central parts of the antigen. In addition, some <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> determinants were defined from gp 51 -immunized mice and from BLV-infected cattle. Although none of the peptides tested behaved as a universal <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> epitope, peptide 98 - 117 stimulated T-cell proliferation from BALB/c mice and from three infected cows, while peptide 169 - 188 strongly stimulated T-cell proliferation from one infected cow. Further experiments performed with three peptides overlapping the 169 - 188 region (177 - 192, 179 - 192, 181 - 192) demonstrated the particular relevance of residue(s) P- 177 and/or D- 178 in the <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> epitope.

Thus, immunization with transplantation antigen(s) does not always induce both helper and killer T-cell activities in parallel, but a certain antigenic system induces predominantly one type of T-cell response, thus indicating that two distinct subsets of helper and killer T cells against the transplantation antigen(s) can be raised independently without an absolute requirement of collaboration between these different T-cells subsets...|$|E

40|$|Tumor {{cells in}} humans (1) and in {{experimental}} animals (2) possess unique antigens, called tumor-associated transplantation antigens ('rATA) 1, to which tumor-bearing hosts respond. Individuals do not promptly and consistently reject their malignant tumor cells because TATA are relatively weak immunogens. Therefore, methods {{to increase the}} stimulatory capacity are being sought. Previously, it was demonstrated in our laboratory (3) that relatively weak immunogenic syngeneic plasmacytoma X 5563 in C 3 H/He exclusively generated killer T-cell activity without inducing any significant <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity against TATA. The failure to induce significant <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity to TATA of X 5563 in syngeneic system seems to be of vital importance in the following aspects. First, the X 5563 syngeneic tumor system fails to provide double defense mechanisms of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity relating to the killer and <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> generations, {{in sharp contrast to}} the allogeneic transplantation immunity. Furthermore, a failure to induce <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity may have some relation to the lower level of generation of killer T-cell activity to syngeneic tumor cells in general.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{condition was}} established in vivo for selectively eliminating hapten-reactive suppressor T-cell activity generated in mice primed with a para-azobenzoate (PAB) -mouse gamma globulin (MGG) -conjugate and treated with PAB-nonimmunogenic copolymer of D-amino acids (D- glutamic acid and D-lysine; D-GL). The elimination of suppressor T-cell activity with PAB-D-GL treatment from the mixed populations of hapten- reactive suppressor and helper T cells substantially increased apparent <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PAB-reactive suppressor T-cell generation by the pretreatment with PAB-D-GL before the PAB-MGG-priming increased the development of PAB-reactive <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity. The analysis of hapten-specificity of helper T cells revealed that the reactivity of helper cells developed {{in the absence of}} suppressor T cells was more specific for primed PAB-determinants and their cross-reactivities to structurally related determinants such as meta-azobenzoate (MAB) significantly decreased, as compared with the <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> population developed in the presence of suppressor T lymphocytes. In addition, those helper T cells generated in the absence of suppressor T cells were highly susceptible to tolerogenesis by PAB-D- GL. Similarly, the elimination of suppressor T lymphocytes also enhanced <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity in a polyclonal fashion in the T-T cell interactions between benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) -reactive T cells and PAB- reactive T cells after immunization of mice with BPO-MGG-PAB. Thus inhibition of BPO-reactive suppressor T-cell development by the BPO-v-GL- pretreatment resulted in augmented generation of PAB-reactive helper T cells with higher susceptibility of tolerogenesis to PAB-D-GL. Thus, these results support the notion that suppressor T cells eventually suppress <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity and indicate that the function of suppressor T cells related to <b>helper</b> <b>T-cell</b> development is to inhibit the increase in the specificity and apparent affinity of helper T cells in the primary immune response. The hapten-reactive suppressor and helper T lymphocytes are considered as a model system of T cells that regulate the immune response, and the potential applicability of this system to manipulating various T cell-mediated immune responses is discussed in this context...|$|E
