40|$|A recent {{theoretical}} approach concerning the grid-inefficiency (GI) problem in Twin Frisch–Grid Ionization Chambers was validated experimentally. The experimental verification {{focused on the}} induced signal on the anode plate. In this work the investigation was extended by studying the grid signal. The aim was to verify the grid-signal dependency on the grid inefficiency σ. The measurements were made with fission fragments from, using two different grids, with 1 and 2 mm wire distances, leading to the GI values: σ= 0. 031 and σ= 0. 083, respectively. The theoretical grid signal was confirmed because the detected grid pulse-height distribution was smaller for the larger σ. By applying the additive GI correction approach, the two <b>grid</b> <b>pulse</b> heights were consistent. In {{the second part of}} the work, the corrected grid signal was used to deduce emission angles of the fission fragments. It is inconvenient to treat the grid signal by means of conventional analogue electronics, because of its bipolarity. Therefore, the anode and grid signals were summed to create a unipolar, angle-dependent pulse height. Until now the so-called summing method has been the well-established approach to deduce the angle from the grid signal. However, this operation relies strongly on an accurate and stable calibration between the two summed signals. By application of digital-signal processing, the grid signal's bipolarity is no longer an issue. Hence one can bypass the intermediate summation step of the two different pre-amplifier signals, which leads to higher stability. In this work the grid approach was compared to the summing method in three cases:, and. By using the grid directly, the angular resolution was found equally good in the first case but gave 7 % and 20 % improvements, respectively, in the latter cases. JRC. D. 4 -Nuclear physic...|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new control scheme to manage active and {{reactive}} power injections into the distribution grids provided by photovoltaic (PV) generating units. Such scheme is derived by resorting {{to the so-called}} ‘feedback linearisation’ theory, which relies on the central concept to algebraically transform non-linear systems dynamics into fully or partly linear ones, so that linear control techniques can be applied. To do this, a suitable state transformation is required, {{in order to simplify}} the form of the power system to be controlled. The developed scheme receives as input the reference signal for the PV unit voltage (generated by a maximum power point tracker controller) and the one for the desired reactive power and produces as output the modulating signal of the <b>grid</b> interface <b>pulse</b> width modulation inverter.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{in the study of}} glacial {{hydrology}} has always been determining the exact location and interconnections of englacial and subglacial drainage networks. Advances in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology makes this possible. A PulseEKKO IV GPR system was used to survey the accumulation area and the termini of two high arctic glaciers, and a proglacial icing. Near-surface detail was best imaged using a 200 MHz/ 400 V configuration, while the 50 MHz/ 1000 V configuration imaged through thicker ice. While minor variations in ice properties were not imaged, major changes in ice character were detected and large air, water, and sediment inclusions were mapped with <b>gridded</b> surveys. <b>Pulse</b> phase modeling was used to differentiate air-filled from water-filled voids. The low attenuation and decreased directivity of the radar signal in ice resulted in the generation of very long diffraction tails (> 30 m) from point source reflectors within the ice.

As a result, the three dimensional position of drainage tunnels within the ice was mapped. Key words: ground penetrating radar, glaciology, hydrolog...|$|R

40|$|Methods {{to record}} {{chemically}} induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP) spectra that are virtually free from background magnetization {{and avoid the}} sensitivity loss and subtraction artifacts of difference spectroscopy have been developed. Presaturation by a string of composite pi/ 2 pulses, each followed by a defocussing field gradient, is analyzed, and guidelines for the optimization of pulse phases and gradient strengths are derived. Subsequent gated illumination during a <b>grid</b> of pi <b>pulses</b> with a prescribed timing causes the background magnetization to vanish at those moments of a pulse sequence when CIDNP magnetization is to be sampled or transferred.

Martian dust can be transported and deposited by Aeolian processes, including "Dust Devils". Due to the ultra high vacuum (10 e- 12 Torr), transport of dust on the Moon is solely a result of collision/ballistic motion. Dust obscuration of solar cells {{is one of the}} primary factors limiting the duration of Martian missions, including the Mars Exploration Rovers. Dust contamination in vacuum seals is one of the primarily factors that limited lunar excursions during the Apollo missions. Controlled transportation of dust on Mars and the Moon is important for many reasons, including both contamination mitigation and in situ resource utilization (ISRU).

40|$|A low-cost, low-mass, {{electrically}} efficient, modular cathode/electron gun assembly {{has been}} developed by FDE Inc. of Beaverton, Oregon, under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. This new assembly offers significant improvements {{in the design and}} manufacture of microwave and millimeter wave traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) used for radar and communications. It incorporates a novel, low-heater-power, reduced size and mass, high-performance barium dispenser type thermionic cathode and provides for easy integration of the cathode into a large variety of conventional TWT circuits. Among the applications are TWT's for Earth-orbiting communication satellites and for deep space communications, where future missions will require smaller spacecraft, higher data transfer rates (higher frequencies and radiofrequency output power), and greater electrical efficiency. A particularly important TWT application is in the microwave power module (a hybrid microwave/millimeter wave amplifier consisting of a low-noise solid-state driver, a small TWT, and an electronic power conditioner integrated into a single compact package), where electrical efficiency and thermal loading are critical factors and lower cost is needed for successful commercialization. The design and fabrication are based on practices used in producing cathode ray tubes (CRT's), {{which is one of the}} most competitive and efficient manufacturing operations in the world today. The approach used in the design and manufacture of thermionic cathodes and electron guns for CRT's has been optimized for fully automated production, standardization of parts, and minimization of costs. It is applicable to the production of similar components for microwave tubes, with the additional benefits of low mass and significantly lower cathode heater power (less than half that of dispenser cathodes presently used in TWT s). Modular cathode/electron gun assembly. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly consists of four subassemblies the cathode, the focus electrode, the header (including the electrical feedthroughs), and the gun envelope (including the anode) a diagram of which is shown. The modular construction offers a number of significant advantages, including flexibility of design, interchangeability of parts, and a drop-in final assembly procedure for quick and accurate alignment. The gun can accommodate cathodes ranging in size from 0. 050 to 0. 250 -in. in diameter and is applicable to TWT's over a broad range of sizes and operating parameters, requiring the substitution of only a few parts: that is, the cathode, focus electrode, and anode. The die-pressed cathode pellets can be made with either flat or concave (Pierce gun design) emitting surfaces. The gun can be either <b>gridded</b> (<b>pulse</b> operation) or ungridded (continuous operation). Important factors contributing to low cost are the greater use of CRT materials and parts, the standardization of processes (welding and mechanical capture), and tooling amenable to automated production. Examples are the use of simple shapes, drawn or stamped metal parts, and parts joined by welding or mechanical capture. Feasibility was successfully demonstrated in the retrofit and testing of a commercial Kaband (22 -GHz) TWT. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly was computer modeled to replicate the performance of the original electron gun and fabricated largely from existing CRT parts. Significant test results included demonstration of low heater power (1. 5 -W, 1010 C brightness temperature for a 0. 085 -in. -diameter cathode), mechanical ruggedness (100 g shock and vibration tests in accordance with military specifications (MIL specs)), and a very fast warmup. The results of these tests indicate that the low-cost CRT manufacturing approach can be used without sacrificing performance and reliability...|$|R

Using design of experiments and surface fitting techniques, a landscape is generated that graphically depicts these multi-dimensional relationships. Consequently, whilst finely resolved, <b>grid</b> and <b>pulse</b> independent results are traditionally demanded by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community, this strategy demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} efficiently detect the relative impact of different geometry parameters, and to identify good and bad regions of the landscape by only simulating a fraction of a single pulse. Also, whereas in the past comparisons have been made between the distributions of appropriate shear stress metrics, such as average wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index, this strategy requires a figure of merit to compare different geometries. Here, an area-weighted integral of negative time-averaged shear stress,, is used as the principal objective function, although the discussion reveals that the extent as well as the intensity of reverse flow may be important. Five geometry parameters are considered: the sinus bulb width, the angles and the outflow diameters of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA). A survey of the landscape confirms that bulb shape has the dominant effect on with maximum occurring for large bulb widths. Also, it is shown that different sets of geometric parameters can produce low values of by either relatively small intense areas, or by larger areas of less intense reverse flow. <br/...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Airborne {{waveform}} lidar acquires {{high precision}} 3 -D points and records {{a succession of}} the entire backscattered energy. Traditionally, the received waveform was analyzed individually to obtain physical features by waveform decomposition technique. The relationship between neighboring waveforms is usually ignored in waveform analysis. However, the integration of adjacency waveforms may produce 3 -D backscattered energy rather than 1 -D backscattered energy. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the feasibility of waveform stacking technique from airborne waveform lidar data. This study employs several waveform features in land cover identification, for example, echo width, amplitude, intensity, normalized digital surface model, echo ratio, backscattering coefficient and the features analyzed from waveform stacking. The benefit of waveform stacking in land cover identification is also discussed. The proposed scheme contains three major works. First, all the adjacency 1 -D waveforms are stacked into 3 -D <b>grids</b> based on <b>pulse</b> coordinates (X, Y, Z).

The aim of this work was to use the basic Cartesian PRESTO sequence as a framework when developing a novel trajectory using a non-Cartesian <b>grid.</b> Our new <b>pulse</b> sequence, PRESTO CAN, rotates the k-space profiles around the ky-axis in a non-Cartesian manner. This results in a high sampling density close to {{the centre of the}} k-space, {{and at the same time}} it provides sparser data collection of the part of the k-space that contains less useful information. This "can- or cylinder-like" pattern is expected to result in a much faster k-space acquisition without loosing important spatial information. A new reconstruction algorithm was also developed. The purpose was to be able to construct an image volume from data obtained using the novel PRESTO CAN sequence. This reconstruction algorithm was based on the gridding technique, and a Kaiser-Bessel window was also used in order to re-sample the data onto a Cartesian grid. This was required to make 3 -D Fourier transformation possible. In addition, simulations were also performed in order to verify the function of the reconstruction algorithm. Furthermore, in vitro tests showed that the development of the PRESTO CAN sequence and the corresponding reconstruction algorithm were highly successful.

40|$|Rats {{are able}} to sample their {{surroundings}} for tactile discrimination purposes by performing series of whisker deflections. In this perceptual state, called active perception, the animal chooses how to best manipulate its mobile sensors (the whiskers) based on the incoming sensory information it receives via these sensors, so as to perform better at the task at hand. On {{the other end of}} the perceptual spectrum lies passive perception which can be described as a “wake-up” call to investigate the surroundings if a sensation was received which was not expected by the subject. During active perception each deflection leads to a mechanical stress at the base of the whisker. Additionally, the touch of any object which the whisker finds along its path also leads to whisker deflections and hence whisker vibrations. These combined vibrations are termed the vibrotactile signal. The nature of the vibrotactile signal is highly complex and it is still not known which of its physical parameters are used by the animal for discrimination. Moreover, it is not yet clear if the tactile system of the rat integrates over this signal to reduce its complexity or if the animals have access to instantaneous kinematic parameters such as minute details of the whisker trajectory. Some of the possible parameters which the animals could use for performing tactile discrimination include the temporal frequency of the signal (i. e. its spectral information), its intensity (i. e. the mean speed of the signal) or instantaneous kinematic features (such as details of the whisker trajectory). In this work I established a new psychophysical Go/No-Go paradigm for spatial frequency discrimination using actively whisking head fixed rats in a virtual environment where a natural stimulus is replaced by electrical microstimulation of the ascending sensory pathway. The major advantage of replacing natural stimuli such as textures with electrical stimulation is the greater level of stimulus control achieved from trial to trial. The initial goal of the project was to investigate the differences in neuronal activation in the barrel and motor cortex arising in active versus passive perception. For the purpose I wanted to train animals to discriminate sets of virtual grids with defined line spacing first in an active case- where the animal has to sweep its whisker in space and receive an electrical pulse in the primary somatosensory cortex each time a grid line is crossed, and then in a passive case- in which the same animal is retrained to keep its whiskers still and the stimulation patterns from the active case are replayed in the cortex. To my great surprise, even after extensive training none of the experimental animals was able to discriminate between a set of two virtual grids with significantly different spatial frequencies. Thus I was unable to proceed towards my initial goal and show that the motor program of the animal would be changed in order to optimize sensory percept in active versus passive case. Instead, I provided the animals with an additional cue, increasing the amplitude of the electrical stimulation on a No-Go trial as compared to a Go trial, which led to immediate discrimination for all tested animals. This finding speaks against pure frequency discrimination but rather indicates that rats are more able to use instantaneous events such as the electrical pulse amplitude cues. This new knowledge implied that the current working hypothesis that frequency is the most important parameter for rats during active or passive perception had to be revisited. I thus abandoned the pursuit to find the differences between active and passive perception, and concentrated on fleshing out if the instantaneous kinematic events as given by the electrical pulse amplitude were the actual parameter of a surface which the animals use for active discrimination. To thoroughly investigate this question, I varied several parameters of the virtual grids used in the active whisking task described here, including their spatial frequency, the electrical pulse amplitude and the position of the grid along the whisking cycle. I thus investigated an additional set of stimuli in which the electrical microstimulation amplitude in a Go trial was increased in even steps until it reached the value set for a No-Go stimulus. The stimuli providing an electrical pulse amplitude cue were easily discriminated by the animals whereas the stimuli differing only in spatial frequency were more challenging for the animals, leading to an increased amount of false responses. An experiment in which the virtual grids varied only in spatial frequency and starting position along the whisking cycle, thus blurring position information, proved the behaviorally most difficult one for the animals. The performance improved in a control experiment which kept the virtual grid arrangement same as in this experiment but provided the No-Go <b>grids</b> with electrical <b>pulse</b> amplitude cue. These results show that the rats were able to use the position information given by the virtual grids for discrimination. Altogether, one can conclude that the rats were not using the temporal frequency cues but used the electrical amplitude and grid position cue when available...|$|R
