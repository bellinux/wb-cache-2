The Green Propellant Infusion Mission seeks to improve overall propellant efficiency while reducing the toxic handling concerns associated with the highly toxic propellant hydrazine. The new propellant is an energetic ionic liquid. Ionic liquids are salt compounds in a liquid form whose molecules have either a positive or negative charge, which bonds them together more tightly and makes the liquid more stable.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical {{propulsion}} systems use a chemical reaction {{to produce a}} high-pressure, high-temperature gas that accelerates out of a nozzle. Chemical propellant can be liquid, solid or a hybrid of both. Liquid propellants can be a monopropellant passed through a catalyst, or bipropellant which combusts an oxidizer and a fuel. The benefits of monopropellants are relatively low-complexity/high-thrust output, low power requirements, and high reliability. Monopropellant motors tend to have high thrust while remaining comparatively simple, which also provides high reliability. These motors are practical for CubeSats due to their low power requirements and because their simplicity allows them to be very small. Small hydrazine fueled motors have been developed, but may require a waiver to fly due to restrictions on hazardous chemicals {{set forth in the}} CubeSat Design Specification. Safer chemical propellants which would not require hazardous chemical waivers are being developed, such as AF-M315 (<b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>nitrate)</b> for which motors are being or have been designed.

We find that the HAN molecule binds both the Pd(100) and Ir(100) surfaces molecularly in different orientations with respect to the surface. The HONO elimination is found to possess the lowest activation energy on the Pd(100) surface; whereas, NO 2 elimination is predicted to show the lowest activation energy on the Ir(100) surface. Exothermicities associated with different reaction steps are also discussed.

Pyrotechnic igniters were used in both the closed chamber and gun tests. The propellants tested at EMI-AFB were isopropyl nitrate, nitro-methane, and three <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (HAN) based liquid monopropellants, NOS- 365, LGP 1845, and LGP 1846, a variation of LGP 1845.

This propellant has advantages in terms of insensitivity to impact and fire, low vapor pressure and environmentally benign reaction products. One office concerns with HAN-TEAN is its stability and shelf-life, especially when contaminated with trace metals. Stabilizer systems, consisting of anti-oxidants and/or chealating agents were investigated {{for their ability to}} control the decomposition of HAN-TEAN. Isothermal microcalorimetry, an ultrasensitive heat measurement technique, was used to monitor the decomposition of HANTEAN at near ambient temperatures. Isothermal microcalorimetry measures the heat flow from a reaction vessel into a surrounding heat sink. Microcalorimetry is approximately 1, 000 times more sensitive than accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for measuring heat flow. Samples of HAN-TEAN containing the stabilizers were spiked with 50 ppm iron and the heat evolution monitored for a period of at least 30 days.

40|$|Propellants {{based on}} <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (HAN) have shown promise as a {{hydrazine}} replacement {{because of their}} comparably low toxicity, low vapor pressure, high specific impulse and high density. Herein, {{the recent history of}} advanced monopropellant research is explored, and new experimental techniques are presented to investigate the combustion behavior of a potential hydrazine replacement propellant. Nitromethane, a widely available monopropellant with a recent resurgence in research, is utilized in the current study as a proof of concept for the newly designed equipment and as a step towards investigating more-advanced, HAN-based monopropellants. A strand bomb facility capable of supporting testing at up to 340 atm was employed, and experiments were performed between 28 atm and 130 atm. Burning rate data for nitromethane are calculated from experiments and a power correlation is established as r(mm/s) = 0. 33 [P(MPa) ]^ 1. 02. A comparison with available literature reveals this correlation to be very much in agreement to other studies of nitromethane. Other physical characteristics of nitromethane combustion are presented.

Drop size, liquid mass flow rate, and liquid mass flux distributions were measured for pressure-atomized sprays in the atomization breakup regime, burning within a combustion gas environment at pressures of 4. 5 - 5. 0 MPa. Two separated-flow models were evaluated {{using the new}} measurements: a deterministic separated-flow model where drop-turbulence interactions were ignored, and a stochastic separated-flow model where drop-turbulence interactions were considered using random-walk computations for drop motion. When based on burning rates found from earlier single-drop experiments, both models were in reasonably good agreement with the measurements. Separated-flow effects are quite important for these sprays, with {{the length of the}} liquid-containing region being relatively independent of injector diameter and extending roughly 300 mm from the injector exit for injector exit velocities of roughly 70 m/s and injector diameters of 0. 3 and 0. 6 mm.

The alkyl substituents strengthen the hydrogen bonding in both the neutral- and ion-pair complexes, but the ion-pair forms are stabilized to a greater extent, which results in {{a decrease in the}} barrier to proton transfer and exchange.

The alkyl substitution reduces the proton-transfer barrier, and the dialkyl substitution reduces it even further. A similar trend holds for HAN and methylhydroxylammonium nitrate (MeHAN); the barrier to proton transfer from the most stable neutral-pair HAN to the lowest-energy ion-pair configuration is 13. 6 kcal/mol, whereas this barrier decreases to 9. 5 kcal/mol in the corresponding MeHAN complex.
