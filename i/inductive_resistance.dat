40|$|In {{this article}} by {{the method of}} {{equations}} of steady horizontal flight the impact of AT winglets wingtips on the inductive reactance of the wing is explored. The total aerodynamic force, created by all four parts of the wingtips is determined. The vector of the total aerodynamic force of the wingtips is represented {{in the form of}} components of a linked coordinate system. Equilibrium equations for the steady motion of an aircraft with AT winglets wingtips in a horizontal flight are recorded. From these equations it is obtained that, in the direction of motion, the longitudinal component of the vector of the total aerodynamic force of the tips reduces the inductive drag of the wing, the vertical component is added to the lifting force of the wing, and the lateral component, due to symmetry, is zero. It is shown that the lifting force created by the AT winglets wingtips is larger compared to the same ones created by the upper tips. An important consequence is that the distribution of the lifting force over the wing span with double tips is more even in comparison with the wing without a tip or with a wing with the upper wingtip. The expression for the effective aspect ratio of the wing with the tips is determined, which is greater than the inductive drag of the wing without the tip. An interesting result is obtained: for identical aircraft weights, the product of effective aspect ratio of the wings with double and only upper wingtips on their coefficients of <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance</b> is equal to the product of the wing aspect ratio without a tip on its coefficient of <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance.</b> This law can also be formulated as follows: at the constant weight of the aircraft, the effective aspect ratio of the wing with the tips by its coefficient of <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance</b> is a constant value, independent of the form of wingtips...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{three-phase}} voltage-type {{pulse width}} modulation (PWM) inverter system, the steady DC-bus voltage is significant for normal operation of PWM converter. With traditional control method, DC-bus voltage has poor anti-disturbance performance and large steady-state error generated by parametric uncertainties of <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance</b> and switching devices ’ equivalent resistance.

The mathematical model of aircraft synchronous generator, electricity distribution, three-phase static active-inductive load are considered. When making a mathematical description the author used the equations for the voltages of windings and flux linkages cir- cuits of the stator and rotor of the generator in a stationary system phase coordinates "ABC". When considering the mathe- matical model of the distribution system, the equations that took into account the drop of the voltages on the active and <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance</b> of the distribution system power wires were used. When considering the mathematical models of three- phase static loads connected on a "wye with neutral" and "delta", the equations that took into account the drop of the volt- ages on the active and <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance</b> loads were used. The matrix equations system of channel PSS AC when running on a generalized three-phase static active-inductive load was obtained. The three phase static loads scheme connected ac- cording to the "delta" scheme was converted to "wye" to simplify the solution of channel PSS AC circuit matrix equations system. The choice of the phase coordinates system "ABC" for the mathematical description of the generator, distribution system and the static load was made due to its advantage over the coordinate system "dq", because the equation written in phase coordinates are valid for symmetric and asymmetric modes of the generator, while the equations written in the coor- dinate system "dq" will be valid only for symmetric modes. As a result of joint solution of the generator equations, distribution system, three-phase static loads there were obtained the formulae for the generator stator winding phases, gen- erator phases currents, the voltage drops on the load phases and load phases currents connected on a "wye with neutral" and "delta"...|$|E

Different control strategies involving the AVC have been considered and compared with respect to flicker reduction. An innovative: Flicker Adaptive Control (FAC) strategy is proposed for the AVC. The control algorithm requires knowledge of the system line impedance; however, it can be used for both power factor correction and flicker reduction, which is an advantage over previous control methods.

Obtained results practically coincide with experimental results and data of radar observations. Optimum speed allows the birds to fly with a higher grade soaring and shorter distance between the thermal flows. Time to find the next effective thermals (thermal flux) is reduced by increasing the speed, which in turn reduces the average rise in thermal flows, increases the risk not to find appropriate thermal. Soaring birds reduce wingspan and wing area by bending the joints of the extremities at high speeds. This reduces profile resistance and increases the inductive reactance.

40|$|Base {{resistance}} and emitter sheet resistance {{are two of}} the most important process control parameters in solar cell manufacturing, which may be measured inductively. On mono-crystalline silicon, measurement accuracy of this contactless inline technique has already been demonstrated. In this work the investigation of measurement accuracy is extended to multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) and reveals for base resistance measurements severe measurement artifacts of up to a factor 2 upon chemical standard treatments, such as damage etching and acidic texturization. The investigation identifies potential barriers at grain boundaries as reason for these artifacts which form upon chemical treatments and further increase with storage time after such chemical steps. It is found that these potential barriers vanish almost completely after thermal treatments, such as a standard emitter diffusion. As a consequence, the emitter sheet resistance calculated from the <b>inductive</b> sheet <b>resistances</b> before and after emitter diffusion may be significantly underestimated if the presumed base resistance is overestimated.

40|$|Publicación versión impresa: Octubre de 2008 To measure metal {{corrosion}} it {{is necessary}} to make direct physical contact with the specimen or component acting as the working electrode. The most widely used method for determining the corrosion current is electrochemical, the so-called polarisation resistance method. The feasibility of a new method to polarise the metal without the need for direct physical contact was investigated in the present study. The required potential shift is obtained by induction of a current using an external electrical field. The model used for calculation of the corrosion rate assumes that the applied current runs in parallel through the electrolyte and the metal, and electrostatically polarises the metal. The overall electrical resistance of the system can then be expressed as 1 /R_e + M = 1 /R_e + 1 /R_M, where R e+M is the total resistance measured, R e is electrolyte resistance and R M is resistance due to the metal. This latter resistance to electrostatic polarisation is related to the faradaic reaction, which was verified by comparison with the gravimetric losses. This resistance has been called <b>inductive</b> polarisation <b>resistance</b> R pi to distinguish it from the traditional polarisation resistance R p.

The magnitude of the cross section {{has an influence on}} the provision of the required voltage levels on the light sources. The choice of the conductor cross section has been fulfilled based on calculations of the {{operating mode}} of the standard line of outdoor lighting specified in the article. Luminaries with high pressure sodium lamps connected through electromagnetic ballasts were used as sources of light. When choosing the conductor cross section of light lines a number of simplifications are commonly used. Attention is paid to the choice of sections without such assumptions: the <b>inductive</b> <b>resistance</b> of conductors is taken into account; the power of the luminaire depends on the voltage level in it. Luminaries with high pressure sodium lamps are the sources of high harmonics. Three variants of calculation are demonstrated depending on the accounting (or non-accounting) of high odd harmonics. The methods of calculating the mode of the lighting line are also presented in the article. The calculation is performed with the aid of Mathcad software. Operating parameters for each phase of the line (i. e. voltage in the items of the scheme, power, currents, power, and voltage losses in all the sections) were determined. The diagrams of the voltage distribution at items of the lighting line for three variants of calculation are plotted for various sections of aluminum conductors. On this basis the choice of the optimum magnitude of the conductor cross section of the lighting line was made. The obtained results of different calculation variants are compared. The comparison of the results obtained with the use of various methods of calculation was made. The impact of high harmonics on the operating mode of the line under consideration has been analyzed.
