5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. <b>Early</b> <b>diagnosis</b> {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prognosis}} of thyroid {{cancer is}} related to the type of cancer and the stage at the time of diagnosis. [...] For {{the most common form of}} thyroid cancer, papillary, the overall prognosis is excellent. Indeed, the increased incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in recent years is likely related to increased and <b>earlier</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> One can look at the trend to <b>earlier</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in two ways. The first is that many of these cancers are small and not likely to develop into aggressive malignancies. A second perspective is that <b>earlier</b> <b>diagnosis</b> removes these cancers at a time when they are not likely to have spread beyond the thyroid gland, thereby improving the long-term outcome for the patient. There is no consensus at present on whether this trend toward <b>earlier</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is beneficial or unnecessary.|$|R
