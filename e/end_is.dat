5|$|RNAs are a type {{of large}} {{biological}} molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' <b>end</b> <b>is</b> {{the part of the}} RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3' <b>end</b> <b>is</b> transcribed last. The 3' <b>end</b> <b>is</b> also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.|$|E
5|$|The East End of London, {{also known}} simply as the East <b>End,</b> <b>is</b> an area of Central, East London and London Docklands, England; east of the Roman and medieval walls of the City of London, and north of the River Thames. The East <b>End</b> <b>is</b> the {{historic}} core of wider East London but is not defined by any universally accepted boundaries, though the various channels of the River Lea are often {{considered to be the}} eastern boundary.|$|E

5|$|This <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> rejected and the writers favoured the <b>ending</b> that <b>was</b> eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative <b>ending</b> would have <b>been</b> broadcast if a third series was being made, as that <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still has something to say.|$|R
5000|$|The game's <b>ending</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} on the upgrades the player chooses {{during the course of}} the experience. If the player buys any of the Dark spells, then the [...] "Bad" [...] <b>Ending</b> <b>is</b> shown. If none of the Dark spells were unlocked, then the [...] "Good" [...] <b>Ending</b> <b>is</b> shown.|$|R

5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) <b>end</b> <b>is</b> well-developed, but the distal <b>end</b> <b>is</b> narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Attila, the Eastern Empire enjoyed a period of peace, while the Western Empire {{deteriorated}} due to continuing migration and expansion by the Germanic nations (its <b>end</b> <b>is</b> usually dated in 476 when the Germanic Roman general Odoacer deposed the usurper Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus).|$|E

50|$|The <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> to have {{originally}} had the vampires {{destroyed by a}} swarm of bats released from hell by an arcane ritual. This <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> rejected by Peter Cushing, who claimed that Van Helsing would never resort {{to the use of}} black magic. The concept of this <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> used three years later for the climax of Hammer's The Kiss of the Vampire.|$|R
5000|$|The church {{dates from}} the 14th century. The chancel was {{demolished}} in 1780 and the east <b>end</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt. The north wall and the west <b>end</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt in 1834.|$|R

5|$|Finally, the flared <b>end</b> <b>is</b> {{known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
5|$|Flat Bastion is a {{fortification}} in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. Its north <b>end</b> <b>is</b> {{along the}} Charles V Wall, {{from which it}} projects southward. Prince Edward's Gate, Prince Edward's Road, and Trafalgar Cemetery are just {{to the west of}} the bastion. Flat Bastion Road extends to the bastion at the east side of its north face at the Charles V Wall and traverses the bastion at which point it becomes Gardiner's Road.|$|E

It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.|$|R

In 1867 the ecclesiastical parish of Lane <b>End</b> <b>was</b> formed from the neighbouring parishes. [...] The village continued to be divided between the four neighbouring civil parishes until 1934, when the parts within Great Marlow, Hambleden and West Wycombe civil parishes were transferred to Fingest (renamed Fingest and Lane End in 1937). [...] In the 1980s the parish of Fingest and Lane <b>End</b> <b>was</b> abolished, and the civil parish of Lane <b>End</b> <b>was</b> formed.|$|R
5|$|Of course, {{the angle}} of the terrain can {{influence}} all of the calculations above. All else remaining equal, the risk of pitching over the front <b>end</b> <b>is</b> reduced when riding up hill and increased when riding down hill. The possibility of performing a wheelie increases when riding up hill, and is a major factor in motorcycle hillclimbing competitions.|$|E

5|$|The {{closure of}} the last of the East End docks in the Port of London in 1980 created further {{challenges}} and led to attempts at regeneration and the formation of the London Docklands Development Corporation.
