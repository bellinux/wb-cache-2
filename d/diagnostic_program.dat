A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers {{the ruins of a}} robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light. Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly advanced robot with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 30-year <b>diagnostic</b> <b>program</b> to ensure these features. Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply [...] "X". Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first [...] "replicate android" [...] or [...] "Reploid", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow exactly like a human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as [...] "Mavericks" [...] by law-abiding citizens.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{perform a}} {{systematic}} review of {{articles published in}} the last 25 years on prevalence and course of distress {{and quality of life}} surrounding the diagnostic process of suspected cancer, and the influence of rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>programs.</b> METHODS: Twenty-three articles were identified via Pubmed, PsycINFO, and reference lists of articles. Except for three randomized clinical trials and one case control study all studies were uncontrolled cohort studies. RESULTS: Most studies involved patients with suspected breast cancer and therefore had a sex selection bias. Four studies on the effect of rapid outpatient <b>diagnostic</b> <b>programs</b> were found. Studies showed very high prevalence of anxiety, decreasing in case of a benign diagnosis but increasing or sustaining in patients waiting for results or after cancer diagnosis though not significantly more in rapid programs. Quality of life was low and showed varying patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Distress in the diagnostic phase of cancer is a major problem and the rapid decrease of anxiety in patients eventually not diagnosed with cancer suggests a benefit of rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>programs.</b> The available evidence however is limited and shows some inconsistencies. Studies differ in subjects, objective and are limited by quality and quantity. Conflicting results prohibit a conclusion on patients ultimately diagnosed with cancer...|$|R
