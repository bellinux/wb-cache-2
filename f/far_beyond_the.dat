5|$|Kristen Feilberg (1839–1919) {{stands as}} another Danish {{photographer}} known mainly for his images captured <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> borders of Denmark. From the 1860s until the 1890s, Feilberg participated in expeditions to Sumatra, Singapore, and Penang. In 1867, he exhibited photos at an exhibition in Paris and in 1870 he joined {{an expedition to}} the Batak lands of East Sumatra, where he successfully recorded scores of ethnographic images.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas {{and his collaborators}} obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> results obtained by mathematicians. Although the methods used in this work were based on physical intuition, mathematicians {{have gone on to}} prove rigorously some of the predictions of mirror symmetry. In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry have now been rigorously proven.|$|E

5|$|It {{undertakes}} seasonal {{movements in}} response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return north in the winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades. Wandering birds can turn up <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> actual demand, {{and half}} of them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{circumstances}} {{such as a}} good {{breeding season}} followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> normal range. Bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000. Red crossbills Loxia curvirostra too are irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.|$|E

Taking {{much of the}} summer of 2005 off, the band made key festival appearances at the Halifax Pop Explosion, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Sasquatch! Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Vegoose Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival in the UK, Electric Picnic in Ireland and the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E

5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} would be <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> maximum {{anticipated}} {{size of the}} city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) {{moved in with}} him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy—named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to knock down a wall instead. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a perfect match, <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> level of mere soul-mates.|$|E
5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear {{whether or not they are}} as ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E

5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> capabilities of 464-29.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, the SPC {{issued a}} high risk of severe weather for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for severe weather extended for areas <b>far</b> <b>beyond.</b> <b>The</b> low pressure system in place moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E

5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all {{creature}}s have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
