5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it {{was just kind of}} like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

It's a slow build, but once hooked, we couldn't get <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> provocative adventure, with its {{compelling}} characters and innovative gameplay. It's not perfect, but it's also unlike anything else on the PS3 right now." [...] Official Xbox Magazine gave it 8 out of 10, and concluded with [...] "Yes, it's flawed, but L.A.

It's the closest thing Xbox has to PlayStation's unique adventurer Heavy Rain." [...] GamesMaster gave the game 92%, and concluded that L.A.

500|$|... "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] was {{extremely}} well received by television critics. It was awarded {{five out of}} five stars by Billen (The Times) and Wilson (Daily Telegraph), who, respectively, called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and [...] "a quiet elegy, terse and polished, in many ways perfect". Comedy critic Bruce Dessau {{said he could not}} [...] "speak highly <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode", while McDowall (The Herald and The National) said it was the [...] "best thing [...] seen all year", and [...] "surely the best thing the ingenious Shearsmith and Pemberton have done". Bennion (The Independent) finished his review of the episode by saying that Inside No. 9 was [...] "one of the best pieces of British television in years", and, in a review in i, the episode was described as [...] "unmissably good". After the conclusion of the second series, Victoria Segal and Julia Raeside, writing in The Sunday Times, described [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] as [...] "emotionally affecting and brilliantly crafted", highlighting it as the strongest episode in the series.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a group of {{children}} singing the chorus, [...] "All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us".

[...] According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] is played in the key of D minor and the track's time signature is common time. The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener might wonder just who 'Us' is supposed to be... To make the songs lodge in the ear, Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a 'nyah, nyah' two-note motif in 'They Don't Care About Us'... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E

500|$|While {{watching}} the local news, {{it is also}} discovered that former President George W. Bush, who has lost the 2004 election, has returned to Texas which has seceded from the United States, {{along with the rest}} of the southern United States, reforming the Confederate States of America, resulting in a second Civil War. Brian insists that things will still be better in the end, but when they travel five years into the future they find a computer generated post-apocalyptic future caused by nuclear attacks all across the United States which results in the deaths of over 17 million people (including Cesar Millan much to Brian's horror). Admitting that he made a mistake, Brian asks how the situation can be resolved. The two then return to prevent Brian from telling his past self about the attacks. They then return to the present, whereupon Stewie learns that Brian has taken false credit for the Harry Potter series. Seeing that Brian has learned nothing from his warnings, Stewie says they have to repair this by again trying to prevent themselves from telling any future events. This causes hundreds of Stewies and Brians to appear, however, to prevent them from telling the future. This number includes one Brian and Stewie with their Peter who says he [...] "just came for the can", another Brian and Stewie trapped in barber shop twirls, one Brian and Stewie dressed up in their banana outfits, and a Stewie who arrives with his Brian whose throat is slit. Having had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> one Stewie tells all of his and his Brian's numerous future selves to decide whether or not to prevent 9/11, which results in the majority saying no, not to for tell any future events, and to return to their time and stay there. All the Brians and Stewies do it as they are told. From there, Stewie takes Brian back a minute before their past selves arrive and forces them at gunpoint to return to their time. After initial confusion resulting with the Brian that just arrived being shot in the leg, they comply. With that, the altered timeline ceases to exist along with its corresponding Stewie and Brian.|$|E

This guitar is still commercially available under the Axis name, and retains all of the original features of the Edward Van Halen model.

2500|$|The spotted trunkfish is a reef fish which secretes a {{colourless}} ciguatera toxin from glands on {{its skin}} when touched. The toxin is only dangerous when ingested, so there's no immediate harm to divers. However, predators {{as large as}} nurse sharks can die {{as a result of}} eating a trunkfish. [...] Ciguatera toxins appear to accumulate in top predators of coral reefs. [...] Many of the Caribbean groupers and the barracuda for example may contain <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> toxin to cause severe symptoms in humans who eat them. [...] What makes the situation particularly dangerous is that such species may be toxic only at certain sizes or locations, making it difficult to know whether or when they are or are not safe to eat. In some locations this leads to many cases of ciguatera poisoning among tropical islanders.|$|E

However, in a 1996 interview, having just broken the 200 issue barrier, Sim mentioned his wishes regarding Cerebus, should he be prevented somehow from finishing his goal: [...] "If something like that happens and I'm at mid-issue, the instructions are that the comic book gets printed {{with the rest of}} the pages blank.

2500|$|When the NHL {{decided to}} expand for the 1967–68 season amid rumblings that the Western Hockey League (WHL) was proposing to turn {{itself into a}} major league and compete for the Stanley Cup, Canadian {{entrepreneur}} Jack Kent Cooke paid the NHL $2million to place {{one of the six}} expansion teams in Los Angeles. Following a fan contest to name the team, Cooke chose the name Kings because he wanted his club to take on [...] "an air of royalty," [...] and picked the original team colors of purple (or [...] "Forum Blue", as it was later officially called) and gold because they were colors traditionally associated with royalty. The same color scheme was worn by the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), which Cooke also owned. Cooke wanted his new NHL team to play in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, home of the Lakers, but the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, which manages the Sports Arena and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the present day, had already entered into an agreement with the WHL's Los Angeles Blades (whose owners had also tried to land the NHL expansion franchise in Los Angeles) to play their games at the Sports Arena.
