5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E
25|$|Hindman died on January 10, 2007 at age 90. A {{prominent}} city businessman, sportsman and benefactor {{who served}} {{at various times}} {{as chair of the}} local hospital board, school board and police board and as honorary chair of the hospital foundation, he still found time for heavy involvement with numerous sporting organizations, including the Greys. Hindman held the post of team president and/or manager continuously between 1946 and 1986. A team jersey with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> was presented to him at a home game approximately four months before his death.|$|E

25|$|Looking for {{opportunity}} {{beyond the}} mines, Dolbeer {{arrived at the}} Humboldt Bay area where in 1853 he purchased Martin White's Bay Mill in Eureka, California. Finding himself in need of capital after fire destroyed his mill twice, he became partners with William Carson (builder of the Carson Mansion) {{by the spring of}} 1863. The two formed what would become one of the first truly huge Redwood lumber operations, the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company. The mill operated with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> on the Eureka waterfront until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The couple helped {{translate}} Living China, {{a collection}} of stories {{that served as a}} modern left-wing literary work. Helen also produced and dispersed anti-fascist documents to students. In addition, the Snows produced a magazine in 1937 called Democracy, which was intended to spread Christian ethics. Edgar was intended to be {{the driving force behind the}} magazine, however, Helen took charge as her husband worked on his book. The Snows had an agreement that Helen would do all the work for the publication and Edgar would put <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as editor. However, the magazine's production came to an end when the Japanese invaded and seized copies from the presses that same year.|$|E
500|$|Hay {{wrote his}} only novel as a {{reaction}} to several strikes that affected him and his business interests in the 1870s and early 1880s. Originally published in installments in The Century Magazine, the book attracted wide interest. [...] Hay had left hints to his identity in the novel, and some guessed right, but he never acknowledged the book as his, and it did not appear with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> until after his death in 1905. [...] Hay's hostile view of organized labor was soon seen as outdated, and the book is best remembered for its onetime popularity and controversial nature.|$|E

500|$|The Navy tested an [...] "underwater locator" [...] in August 1949 by searching an area {{south of}} the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse for the wreck of Monitor. It found a [...] long object bulky {{enough to be a}} shipwreck, in [...] feet of water that was thought to be Monitor, but {{powerful}} currents negated attempts by divers to investigate. Retired Rear Admiral Edward Ellsberg proposed using external pontoons to raise the wreck in 1951, the same method of marine salvage he had used on the sunken submarine , for the cost of $250,000. Four years later, Robert F. Marx claimed to have discovered the wreck based on the idea she had drifted into shallow water north of the lighthouse before sinking. Marx said he had dived on the wreck and placed a Coke bottle with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in one of the gun barrels, although he never provided any proof of his story.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a notable}} case, American stem-cell {{researcher}} Gerald Schatten had his name listed {{on a paper}} co-authored with Hwang Woo-suk. The paper was later exposed as fraudulent and, though Schatten was not accused of participating in the fraud, a panel at his university found that [...] "his failure to more closely oversee research with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> does make him guilty of 'research misbehavior.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Wild wrote {{most of the}} papers, he was {{characteristically}} {{generous in}} giving credit to others, saying [...] "I did put other people's names on them because they'd made important contributions". One, for example, was technical assistant Bill Rowe. During a period when the solar cycle was at a minimum and nothing was happening, Rowe drove down to Dapto for an 11 am appointment. Wild remarked: Out of sheer conscientiousness he arrived at 8 am, switched on the gear and recorded the most magnificent outburst, {{which led to the}} discovery of first and second harmonics. Well, you couldn't write a paper without putting <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{ensemble}} dedicated its spring 2013 concert to {{the memory}} of its tubist, David Scherr, who died in December 2012.

The other two romantic couples (Buffy and Spike, Willow and Tara) are drawn to each other despite their memory loss. After Xander's initial panic, Anya also appears to check him out.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Cao Rui (Cao Pi's successor), Zhuge Liang – {{who was then the}} chancellor-regent of the state of Shu Han, which Liu Bei founded in 221 – led a series of campaigns to attack the state of Cao Wei. When Zhuge Liang heard that Xu Shu and Shi Tao had become wealthy and famous {{officials}} in Wei, he remarked, [...] "There are some many talents in Wei. Why aren't the talents of these two men put to good use?" [...] Xu Shu died of illness in Wei several years later. A tombstone with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> was found in Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu).|$|E
2500|$|Fulci's {{version is}} as follows: [...] "One day I told Dardano {{the plot of}} my Evil Comes Back (later retitled Per Sempre/Until Death), a sequel on a fantastic note to The Postman Always Rings Twice, and he {{proposed}} it to several producers with {{my name on it}} as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it!</b> (laughs) I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer (Sergio Martino), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2006 book State of Denial, Washington Post {{journalist}} Bob Woodward {{described a}} 29 November 2001, meeting of Middle East analysts, including Zakaria, that was convened {{at the request}} of the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. According to a New York Times story on Woodward's book, the Wolfowitz meeting ultimately produced a report for President George W. Bush that supported the subsequent invasion of Iraq. Zakaria, however, later told The New York Times that he had briefly attended what he thought was [...] "a brainstorming session". He was not told that a report would be prepared for the President, and in fact, the report did not have <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The Times issued a correction.|$|E

50|$|Up until 1995, {{sport as}} a nexus for English {{national}} obsessions {{was a frequent}} topic of his work. In 1994 Wallinger appropriated an entire international football match at Wembley Stadium by being photographed with a large Union Jack banner with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> emblazoned <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> As a state flag the Union Flag has superiority to the Cross of St. George that most England football team fans display.|$|R

2500|$|This {{story was}} {{initially}} developed to feature the Second Doctor and his last companions, Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot. As such, {{it was set}} well into the future, and did not include UNIT. When all three actors left the programme {{at the end of}} the sixth season, it was rewritten to fit the consequential revamp. Original script editor David Whitaker proved incapable of writing for the incoming new format and cast, hence the contributions of Trevor Ray, Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke. All concerned parties agreed to leave sole credit to Whitaker and this was the last Doctor Who serial with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> In an interview years later, Terrance Dicks recounted the experience of rewriting Whitaker's story: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} example {{is that of}} the top Chinese {{scientist}} Qian Xuesen. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950. The Federal Bureau of Investigation located an American Communist Party document from 1938 with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and used it as justification for the revocation. Without clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks announced plans to return to mainland China, which had come under the government of Communist leader Mao Zedong. The Undersecretary of the Navy at the time, Dan A. Kimball, tried to keep Qian in the U.S., commenting: [...] "It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go." ...|$|E
