The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; <b>foodborne</b> <b>disease</b> surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the farm-to-table continuum.|$|E

During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of <b>foodborne</b> <b>disease</b> is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E

40|$|To better {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} <b>foodborne</b> <b>diseases</b> on health in the United States, we compiled and analyzed information from multiple surveillance systems and other sources. We estimate that <b>foodborne</b> <b>diseases</b> cause approximately 76 million illnesses, 325, 000 hospitalizations, and 5, 000 deaths in the United States each year. Known pathogens account for an estimated 14 million illnesses, 60, 000 hospitalizations, and 1, 800 deaths. Three pathogens, Salmonella, Listeria, and Toxoplasma, are responsible for 1, 500 deaths each year, more than 75 % of those caused by known pathogens, while unknown agents account for the remaining 62 million illnesses, 265, 000 hospitalizations, and 3, 200 deaths.

The epide-miology of <b>foodborne</b> <b>diseases</b> is rapidly changing as newly recognized pathogens emerge and well-recognized pathogens increase in prevalence or become associated with new food vehicles (Table 2). In addition to acute gastroenteritis, many emerging <b>foodborne</b> <b>diseases</b> may cause chronic sequelae or disability. Listeriosis, for example, can cause miscarriages (3) or result in meningitis in patients with chronic diseases (3). Toxo-plasmosis is an important cause of congenital malformation (4), and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 infection is {{a leading cause of}} hemolytic uremic syndrome, {{the most common cause of}} acute kid-ney failure in children in the United States (5). Salmonellosis can cause invasive disease (6) or reactive arthritis (7), and campylobacteriosis can lead to Guillain-Barré syndrome, one of the most common causes of flaccid paralysis in the United States in the last 50 years (8).

In these countries, it has been observed that traditional infectious <b>foodborne</b> <b>diseases</b> have decreased while re-emerging and emerging pathogens like Escherichia coli O 157, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Norovirus and Hepatitis A virus have increased. In 2004, in Italy the incidence for Listeriosis was 0. 06 per 100, 000 population and is included among the statutory notifiable diseases. E. coli O 157 :H 7 is not subject to statutory notification in Italy; however, a voluntary national surveillance system for HUS in paediatric patients and for VTEC, has lead to the notification of 429 paediatric HUS cases and 344 clinical cases of VTEC from 1988 to 2004. Data on campylobacteriosis are available thanks to the voluntary notifications received from the Enternet Laboratories: 582 cases were isolated from human clinical specimens in 2004. Furthermore, data from a specific surveillance system for acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA) shows that the incidence of reported cases in Italy is declining.
