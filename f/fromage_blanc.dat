5000|$|<b>Fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> ( [...] ; {{also known}} as maquée) is a fresh cheese {{originating}} from the north of France and the south of Belgium. The name means [...] "white cheese" [...] in French. Fromage frais ("fresh cheese") differs from <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> in that, according to French legislation, fromage frais must contain live cultures when sold, whereas with <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc,</b> fermentation has been halted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> can {{be served}} either as a dessert similar to yogurt, {{frequently}} with added fruit, spread on bread, usually over or under jam, or used in savoury dishes. In many Western countries, <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> is sold in supermarkets alongside yogurts.|$|E
5000|$|In several {{languages}} quark is {{also known}} as [...] "white cheese" [...] (<b>fromage</b> <b>blanc,</b> southern Germany: Weißkäse or weißer Käs, Hebrew: gevina levana גבינה לבנה, baltas sūris, Polish: biały ser, beli sir), as opposed to any rennet-set [...] "yellow cheese". Another French name for it is fromage frais (fresh cheese), where the difference to <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> is defined by French legislation: a product named fromage frais must contain live cultures when sold, whereas with <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> fermentation has been halted. In Swiss French, it is usually called séré.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} public health advocates and {{consumer}} associations urge policy makers to strengthen nutrient labelling rules, {{in order to help}} people to make healthier and better informed food choices. Yet, {{little is known about the}} e¤ectiveness of mandatory labelling. This research evaluates the impact of a mandatory fat label policy on consumer choices in the <b>fromages</b> <b>blanc</b> and dessert yogurt market. While fat labels are mandatory since 1988 for <b>fromages</b> <b>blancs,</b> this is not the case for yogurts. This is a natural source of variation to identify separately consumer preferences for labels and for fat. We use a mixed logit discrete choice model and household scanner data collected in 2007 to estimate the distribution of the Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) for fat labels and simulate various counterfactual policy scenarios in a sample of casual <b>fromages</b> <b>blancs</b> and dessert yogurts consumers. The WTP is negative for about one third of this population, especially for consumers of full-fat dessert yogurts. The rst simulation results suggest that a mandatory labelling policy would make these individuals switch to full-fat <b>fromages</b> <b>blancs</b> or to the outside option, and mandatory labelling would have more impact than a fat tax on the consumption of full-fat products. Hence, variations in labelling rules have been exploited by producers to develop dessert yogurts and increase market segmentation. We plan to rene these results, by taking into consideration manufacturersand retailersstrategic reactions to these policies. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|The {{taxation}} of unhealthy {{food products}} and the mandatory labeling of key nutrients {{may help to}} curve the growth of obesity and related metabolic risk factors. This paper {{is the first to}} propose ex ante evaluations of these policy options. To this end, we study the French market for <b>fromages</b> <b>blanc</b> and dessert yogurts, which is characterized by an exogenous variation in legal labeling requirements across products. This is used to identify separately the consumer preferences for fat-content labels and for fat in a structural demand model that is estimated from household scanner panel data. The estimated demand functions are then combined with a structural supply model to evaluate the impact of fat policies on several market outcomes. An ad-valorem tax of 10 % on the producer price of full-fat products is shown to result in a 9 % fall in fat purchases, whereas the mandatory labeling of fat content produces a 1. 5 % decrease only. This is explained by the producer price responses, which neutralize up to 96 % of the impact of mandatory labeling on consumer demand...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> is {{a creamy}} soft cheese made with whole or skimmed milk and cream. It {{is similar to}} some kinds of quark. It has the {{consistency}} of cream cheese, but less fat. Pure <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> is virtually fat free, but cream is frequently added to improve the flavour, which also increases the fat content, frequently to as high as 8% of total weight.|$|E

This paper {{is the first to}} propose an ex ante evaluation of these two policy options in an oligopolistic setting with differentiated products and heterogeneous demand. Using household scanner data on <b>fromages</b> <b>blancs</b> and dessert yogurts, we separately identify consumer preferences for fat and front-of-pack fat labels by exploiting an exogenous difference in legal labelling requirements between these two product categories. Demand estimates are then combined with a supply model to evaluate both policies. In the absence of any producer price response, making fat labels mandatory reduces the fat supplied to regular consumers in this market by 38 %; an ad-valorem tax of 10 % (5 %) on the producer price of full-fat (half-skimmed) products has a similar impact. Allowing producer price reactions, however, yields much smaller effects: a 9 % drop for the fat tax, and a fall of only 1 : 5 % for mandatory labels. Producers thus neutralise up to 96 % of the impact of mandatory labelling on demand, via large price cuts on products with large ex ante margins. This illustrates how market forces are largely able to defeat the intended effect of market-based public-health interventions...|$|R

50|$|In France, {{a typical}} {{domestic}} breakfast {{consists of a}} cup of coffee, often café au lait, or hot chocolate, sometimes accompanied by a glass of orange or grapefruit juice. The main food consists of sweet products such as tartines (slices of baguette or other breads spread with butter, jam or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink. Brioches and other pastries such as croissants, pains au chocolat (chocolatine) and pains aux raisins are also traditional, but more of a weekend special treat. Other products such as breakfast cereals, fruit compote, <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc,</b> and yogurt are becoming increasingly common {{as part of the}} meal. A traditional French breakfast does not include any savory product, but breakfast buffets in hotels often include ham, cheese and eggs.|$|E
50|$|The Israeli {{breakfast is}} a mix of culinary {{influences}} from eastern Europe, agrarian Yishuv culture, North African cuisine and Levantine cuisine. It usually consists of a range of cheeses along with sliced vegetables, scrambled eggs (or another kind of fried egg) and bread, served with spreads like butter, jam or honey. The most commonly used vegetables are cucumbers, tomatoes, and red bell peppers; carrots, onions and radishes may also be included. Cheeses include, at the very least, cottage cheese, quark or <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc,</b> and a local variety of gouda, and often Tzfatit and labneh too. Side dishes including pickled olives and herring may also be served. Typical Middle Eastern mezze such as Israeli salad, hummus, tehina and baba ghanoush, as well as Shakshouka and a variety of salads may be served. The meal is most often accompanied by coffee, tea and orange juice.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "bouchon" [...] is a {{traditional}} Lyonnais restaurant that serves local dishes such as sausages, duck pâté or roast pork; along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region {{to the north and}} the Côtes du Rhône region to the south. Another Lyon tradition is a type of brunch food called [...] "mâchons", made of local charcuterie and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. Mâchons were the customary meal of the canuts, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories. [...] Other traditional local dishes include Rosette lyonnaise and saucisson de Lyon (sausage); andouillette (a sausage of coarsely cut tripe); pistachio sausage; coq au vin; esox (pike) quenelle; gras double (tripe cooked with onions); salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon, croûtons and a poached egg); marrons glacés; coussin de Lyon, sabodet and cardoon au gratin. Cervelle de canut (lit. silk worker's brains) is a cheese spread/dip, another Lyonnais speciality. The dish has a base of <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc,</b> seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe public-health {{community}} views mandatory Front-of-Pack (FOP) nutrition {{labels and}} nutritional taxes as promising tools {{to control the}} growth of food-related chronic diseases. This paper uses household scanner data to propose an ex-ante evaluation and comparison of these two policy options for the <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc</b> and dessert yogurt market. In most markets, labelling is voluntary and firms display fat labels only on the FOP of low-fat products to target consumers {{who do not want}} to eat fat. We here separately identify consumer preferences for fat and for FOP fat labels by exploiting an exogenous difference in legal labelling requirements between these two product categories. Estimates of demand curves are combined with a supply model of oligopolistic price competition to simulate policies. We find that a feasible ad valorem fat tax dominates a mandatory FOP-label policy from an economic perspective, but both are equally effective in reducing average fat purchases...|$|E
40|$|In {{the village}} of Pescadero, forty-five minutes’ drive north of Santa Cruz, Dee Harley runs San Mateo County’s only active dairy. Harley and her staff care for a herd of more than 200 American Alpine goats, {{crafting}} the animals’ milk into sought-after cheeses (chevre, feta, ricotta, and <b>fromage</b> <b>blanc)</b> that have consistently garnered awards at national and international competitions. An increasingly popular agritourism destination for denizens of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Areas, Harley Farms also offers leisurely, informative tours of its entire dairy operation, from the birth of hundreds of kids each spring to the on-site sale of delicate white cheeses decorated with fresh herbs and colorful edible flowers grown on the farmstead. A native of Yorkshire, England, Harley discovered Pescadero while traveling in California as a young woman. In the gently rolling coastal landscape and in the rural community’s intimate spirit, she saw reflections of her verdant birthplace. When Harley {{fell in love with}} Tim Duarte, the local restaurateur who eventually became her husband, Pescadero became her new home. Harley took up residence on a nine-acre farmstead originally built in 1910 as a cow dairy—and shuttered, like many small local farms, after California’s industrializing dairy industry migrated to the Central Valley. She worked for a while for Larry Jacobs and Sandra Belin at nearby Jacobs Farm. In 1982, she acquired six goats from a local dairywoman. The herd began to grow; one thing led to another, and Harley Farms was born. Sarah Rabkin conducted this interview with Dee Harley on April 8 th, 2009, in a private residence at Harley Farms. Outside the small cottage, guard llamas looked on while goats played atop a chicken tractor {{in the middle of a}} green pasture; small children participating in a farm tour reverently cradled newborn kids; flowers bloomed in garden beds. Dee Harley described the origins and evolution of her business and the day-to-day life of her small farm. She also articulated the values that inform her choices as a farmer and a businesswoman: deep community ties; a sense of responsibility to the local economy; dedication to the health of the herd and the land; creation of a high-quality product; truth in advertising; a sense of whimsy; a fierce resistance to unrestrained growth, and commitment to the preservation of an intimate, sustainable operation...|$|E
