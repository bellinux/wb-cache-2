5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It {{has been suggested that}} the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as {{a vital part of the}} empire, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and Slavs in the Balkans and Sassanids in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} {{appearance}} of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when Phaëton, the son of Helios, {{in an attempt to}} drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire. This story led to the archaic meaning of a phaeton as one who drives a chariot or coach, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reckless or dangerous speed. Plato, in his Chariot Allegory, depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|At this point, the European powers again intervened (see Oriental Crisis of 1840). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, {{which had}} colluded with Austria, Prussia, and Russia {{to sign the}} Convention of London, offered Muhammad Ali {{hereditary}} rule of Egypt {{as part of the}} Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as King Louis-Philippe did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when he also {{had to deal with the}} Rhine crisis. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria. In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.|$|E
500|$|While {{a popular}} legend {{persists}} about a reward of US$40,000 for Tubman's capture, {{this is a}} manufactured figure. In 1868, {{in an effort to}} drum up support for Tubman's claim for a Civil War military pension, a former abolitionist named Salley Holley wrote an article claiming US$40,000 [...] "was not too great a reward for Maryland slaveholders to offer for her". Such a high reward would have garnered national attention, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when a small farm could be purchased for a mere US$400. No such reward has been found in period newspapers. (The federal government offered $25,000 for the capture of each of John Wilkes Booth's co-conspirators in Lincoln's assassination.) A reward offering of US$12,000 has also been claimed, though no documentation exists for that figure either. Catherine Clinton suggests that the US$40,000 figure may have been a combined total of the various bounties offered around the region.|$|E
500|$|Madeline Parker {{was cast}} as Kacey Brynn.

The one problem they had with Parker however, was filming her lying injured on the stairs. In the scene where the NCP arrest civilians at night, {{the idea of using}} night vision, which did not come from the original script, came from director Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. Real night scopes were used to ensure the authenticity of the effect. One of the main visual effects of the episode was another suicide bombing which was caught on camera. Moore stated to have [...] "tortured the visual effects guys about [...] quite a bit," [...] because the camera footage was in black and white and the visual quality of the explosion had to be degraded to match the footage.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after, the Parents Television Council (PTC) {{threatened}} to file indecency complaints with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against any station that played the song between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. PTC President Tim Winter said [...] "there is no misinterpreting {{the lyrics to}} this song, and it's certainly not about a girl named Amy. It's one thing for a song with these lyrics to be included on a CD so that fans who wish to hear it can do so, but it's an entirely different matter when this song is played over the publicly owned airwaves, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when children {{are likely to be}} in the listening audience."

Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community what do they want to do."

2500|$|Pavlaković {{concludes that}} [...] "he {{effectiveness}} of Bleiburg {{to act as}} a site of memory {{can be attributed to the}} fact that it represents both a traumatic past, as well as a moment of rupture, or historical discontinuity. Both of these factors give the commemorations at Bleiburg emotional weight and political significance, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> point when Croatia was going through another historical transition in the 1990s. It also meant that the Bleiburg myth was easily manipulated; the victims of the Bleiburg tragedy were actively invoked not only to distort the Ustasa past, but to justify the resurgence of extreme nationalist political options. The Bleiburg myth became one of many historical moments that symbolized Croatian martyrdom, due to the prevailing narrative of victimization by Greater Serbian aggression during the 1990s. The martyrium myth is one of the most common archetypes in the taxonomy of myths... The danger of presenting the victims of Bleiburg exclusively as martyrs for the Croatian state, however, is that the reality of the NDH regime and the crimes it committed are ignored in the new, revised narrative of World War Two.|$|E
