The world's first sex shop was opened in 1962 by Beate Uhse AG in Flensburg, West Germany, and sex shops can now be found in many countries and online. Sex shops {{are part of the}} sex industry. In most <b>jurisdictions,</b> sex <b>shops</b> are regulated by law, with access not permitted to minors, the age depending on local law. Some <b>jurisdictions</b> prohibit sex <b>shops</b> and the merchandise they sell. In some jurisdictions that permit it, they may also show pornographic movies in private video booths, or have private striptease or peep shows. Also an adult movie theater may be attached. There are also many online sex shops selling a variety of adult content such as sex toys, pornographic magazines, pornographic films and fetish wear etc. These types of shop are often favoured by the consumer as they have less overheads and can be perused within the comfort of the home. Their discreetness is also appealing to some.|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{features}} and charts the principle theorizing of reg-ulatory sociability from collaboration rather than intervention, whatever the interest-based motivation behind transforming crisis, toward orderli-ness. A key theme {{is the role}} played by corporations in facilitating and ben-efiting from sociability. A particular explanatory focus on the way in which corporate culture can change from predatory <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>shopping</b> to em-bracing mutuality of interests in the context of environmental sustainability is employed. The article concludes with a discussion of how, as compulsory discipline increases, it may produce compliance but at costs for regula-tory sociability. The alternative regulatory paradigm is one that moves to resolve the antimony between desire (profit) and reason (sustainability) in a manner that relies on and endorses the constituents of collaboration. Collaborative regulation, the article suggests, can arise out of crisis and be justified through desires for orderliness without compulsion. But for col-laborative regulation to be sustainable, it must complement certain positive “orderly ” aspects within political economy. The analysis determines some observations concerning the shape and shaping of collaborative regulation in an atmosphere of more pluralist knowledge-based (disciplinary) engage-ment involving trust, comity, and sustainability. doi: 10. 1177 / 009539971245411...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project {{is part of}} a wider research plan aimed at addressing some critical issues related {{to a better understanding of}} how institutional frameworks impact on firm performance, a largely debated strategic issue. We use a network perspective, aiming at a better understanding of network structures when patterns of homogenization among network actors that arise in institutionalized settings. The institutional perspective argues that once disparate organizations in the same line of business are structured into an actual field, isomorphism emerges as a consequence of the re-alignment between organizational and environmental characteristics (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). We define institutional embeddedness as the interconnections between organizations and the institutional environment (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). We argue that when actors are embedded in different institutional environments, they are offered the possibility to catch different institutional opportunities residing in other parts of the network. Diverse institutional spheres can represent windows in which frameworks tend to be less constraining to the actions of the firm. We aim to analyze the mechanism through which institutions and legal frameworks shape the behaviours, actions and relations among actors (Zukin and DiMaggio, 1994). Institutional forces rationalizing the environment in which the network is embedded may leverage network relations or break social ties and the consequent benefits of embeddedness (Uzzi, 1997). When the environment is highly regulated firms tend to homogenization through process of isomorphic change (Hawley, 1968). Firms tend to conform (Scott, 1987), driven by procedural conformity that forces organizations in the way they perform specific tasks or procedures following specific requirements that are imposed by institutions. We focus on the research process, as it is less likely to have a clear scheduling as the outcome emerges as a result of changing conditions (Bechky, 2006) and different applicable regulations. Specifically, we aim to formulate research proposition that can be analyzed in the pharmaceutical industry, a setting characterized by institutional forces that significantly constrain actors and subjected to increasing specialization and systemic complexity We aim address the following research questions: Are institutional frameworks impacting on the formation of international networks and R&D location choices?

40|$|Although {{judicial}} protection against administrative action {{has become increasingly}} important, the current organization of judicial review of administrative acts in Belgium may lead to conflicts of <b>jurisdiction,</b> forum <b>shopping,</b> contradictory judgments and legal uncertainty. Therefore, the dissertation analyzes the following findings. Firstly, the demarcation criterion between administrative courts and ordinary courts in Belgium is mainly based on the casuistically developed distinction between objective appeals focused on an abstract legality review and appeals adjudicating subjective rights disputes. Some legal scholars argue that this distinction would be artificial. Secondly, both ordinary and administrative judges seem to offer parallel and overlapping protection against administrative action, which may lead to forum shopping. Thirdly, objective annulment appeals have already regularly been criticized not to offer sufficiently adequate, final adjudication. Therefore, the Council of State Reform Act of 2014 has substantially expanded the instruments of the Belgian Council of State in order make an evolution possible towards a more active and pragmatic adjudicator. Fourthly, the Court of Cassation adjudicates conflicts of jurisdiction between both jurisdictional orders, but {{is at the same}} time an involved party being the supreme ordinary court. Belgium also lacks a mechanism which guarantees uniformity of case law between its distinct highest courts. Fifthly, the establishment of administrative courts is principally an exclusive federal legislative power in Belgium. Nonetheless, the Regions and Communities have increasingly relied on the implied powers to establish their own administrative courts, which has added complexity to the judicial system. The main aim of this Ph. D. thesis is to examine the future direction in which judicial review of administrative action should evolve within the Belgian federal state. It is not the objective to reopen the traditional debate about the choice between a one peak model (jurisdictional monism) and a twin peak model (jurisdictional dualism). Instead, guided by a functional comparative legal analysis of France, the Netherlands and Belgium, the dissertation focuses on the necessary conditions to optimize the functioning of the current Belgian twin peak model. The division of jurisdiction between administrative courts and ordinary courts should be transparent and forum shopping should be avoided. In this regard, one cannot ignore that the rather strict division of jurisdiction between the ordinary and the administrative courts in France excludes forum shopping and is evidently more transparent. The French administrative judge principally has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes in which an administrative authority is involved exercising the prerogatives of public authority. Moreover, effective mechanisms are essential to pursue uniformity of case law and resolve conflicts of jurisdiction. In France, jurisdictional conflicts are adjudicated by a well-functioning Tribunal of Conflicts, equally composed of members from the Council of State and the Court of Cassation. One might consider establishing a comparable Tribunal in Belgium, which would also be a suitable institution to resolve divergent interpretations in case law between the distinct jurisdictional orders. In addition, judges should pursue final adjudication in due time, whereby specialization is useful. Recently, there has already been a subjectivation trend of objective annulment appeals as well as an increased alignment of the available legal instruments between the administrative and the ordinary judges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. This evolution can partly be attributed to the influence of EU Law and the ECHR. Especially in the Netherlands, a fierce debate has been held over the past twenty years about a more pragmatic, final adjudication of administrative legal disputes. As a result, based on a comparative legal analysis, recommendations are developed about the use of the recently expanded and diversified instruments for final adjudication. Finally, the dissertation examines which is the most appropriate legislative level to organize the administrative justice system within the judicial branch sensu lato in Belgium, given the recent establishment of several administrative courts by the Regions and Communities via their implied powers. In this regard, a comparative legal analysis of the federal countries Germany, the United States, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of federalism provide the basis to develop a more coherent distribution of judicial powers in Belgium. Instead of taking the relation of disputes with the substantive powers of the competent legislator as the basis to establish courts via the technique of the implied powers, one could in the future also choose a different path. Based on the conducted analyzes, it seems reasonable to propose that the organization of the Belgian highest courts remains at the federal level, while the organization of all courts of first instance and appellate courts, including the administrative courts, could be transferred to the Regions...|$|R
40|$|Will Hanley's chapter, "When Did Egyptians Stop Being Ottomans? An Imperial Citizenship Case Study," is a nuanced {{study of}} the {{mutability}} of citizenship, particularly in contexts of questionable sovereignty. In this case, the context is the flexible, locally conditioned, and ephemeral nature of the imperial Ottoman presence in Egypt {{around the same time}} period as Elizabeth Dale's focus (in the next chapter), {{the end of the nineteenth}} century and start of the twentieth. Hanley demonstrates the persistence of the Egyptians' Ottoman status well into the twentieth century, evidence he argues has been neglected because the nature of Ottoman citizens'/subjects' membership in their state differs from European and American archetypes of citizenship. The triumph of a system of exclusive, universal, commensurate national citizenships is incomplete—Hanley argues that it cannot be completed, and that thinking of unitary citizenship as completable is misleading—and its advent is recent. Hanley contends that occluded variant systems of state affiliation, including that of turn-of-the-century Egyptian Ottomans, need to be recovered and compared, not least because citizenship in late Ottoman Egypt resembles developing forms of multilevel citizenship. This chapter shows, among other things, the fragility of censuses and government attempts to classify and categorize populations. It also lays out an example of a context in which citizenship is about jurisdiction rather than rights and in which taxation or exemption from taxation determines membership. Furthermore, the chapter illustrates again the importance to governments of residence and settlement: both the nomadic Bedouin and the foreign population were anomalous because they were mobile and exempt from the laws that governed other subjects. Hanley argues that the overwhelming focus of citizenship literature on political rights, especially democratic and electoral politics, deadens analysis of legal, social, civil, and other forms of citizenship. Ottoman-Egyptian citizenship was not democratic, and there can thus be no political consideration of it. When political rights are the measure, states in the Middle East must be judged dysfunctional and pathological, but it is possible to take a more positive view, seeing phenomena such as <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>shopping,</b> self-regulating communities, and differentiated rather than equal citizenship as illustrating how citizenship is actually experienced. This case also suggests parallels with indigenous peoples; with Roma and other nomads; and with legal "persons" such as corporations, which today claim exemptions from state laws, as discussed in Chapters 7, 10, and 11, as well as Chapter 6...|$|E
40|$|Already {{since the}} 1980 ’s, {{in order to}} combat {{irregular}} immigration states have emphasized controlling immigration at source, also {{with the assistance of}} private actors. One of the oldest of these extraterritorialization and privatization methods is carrier sanction legislation, which imposes document control activities to transport companies by threatening them with financial penalties. This method is nowadays endorsed in several international conventions. The downside of the extraterritorial border control is its severe implications on refugee protection. Refugees are often unable to obtain the proper travel documents and therefore cannot resort to international protection. However, due to states’ growing control over their borders {{and on the other hand}} detrimental effect on refugees, the scope of the human rights and refugee rights obligations has come under debate. This thesis is participating in the discussion by evaluating can the norms of refugee and human rights protection apply extraterritorially, and if yes, can carriers’ border control actions breach these rights or are refugees’ rights already taken into account efficiently. Refugee rights and human rights obligations rise from international and regional conventions, which impose obligations mainly to the sovereign states. Thus, the first issue in establishing responsibility is whether carriers’ conduct could be attributed to the state according to the customary rules of international law codified in Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Secondly, the scope of the international obligations must be established. Carrier sanctions have been widely criticized for circumventing the non-refoulement principle recognized in the Refugee Convention and several human rights treaties and also described as the cornerstone of refugee protection. Besides, the carrier sanctions affect the obligation not to penalize refugees for illegal entry recognized in Refugee Convention, right to leave a country and the right to seek asylum. However, whether these obligations apply only on the territory of the state or also in the situations of extraterritorially is not always crystal clear. Even if state´s obligations could apply extraterritorially, states can clearly be responsible only for violations they can impact on. Thus, the third threshold of state´s extraterritorial responsibility is establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction. There is no case law on attribution of carrier’s actions to states and creation of extraterritorial jurisdiction is still an exceptional thing applied inconsistently by different courts. In cases where the attribution is not possible or jurisdictional link is weak, the last chapter of this work discusses if states’ human rights due diligence obligation could still provide a layer of protection and mitigate the negative effects on refugees. Accepting extraterritorial effects on refugee protection would have massive effects on the Western states asylum regimes. It would also create problems targeting responsibility between states and increase the phenomenon of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>shopping.</b> On the other hand, states’ extraterritorial control might create a human rights vacuum where persons are artificially blocked from protection...|$|E
