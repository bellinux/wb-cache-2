40|$|In the work, {{in order}} to solve the inverse problem, i. e. the problem of finding values of the {{additional}} quantities (mass, elasticity), the beam inverse model was proposed. Analysis of this model allows finding such a value of additional mass (elasticity) {{as a function of}} its localization so that the free vibration frequency changes to desirable value. The criteria for choice of the proper pair (mass - its position), including the criterion allowing changing the position of the vibration node of the second mode of the free vibrations, were given. Analysis of the influence of uncertainties in the determination of the additional quantity value and its position on the desired free vibration frequency was carried out, too. The proposed beam inverse model can be employing to identification of the beam cracks. In such a case, the input quantity is free vibration frequency measured on the damaged object. Each determined free-vibration frequency allows determining the <b>flexibility</b> <b>curve</b> for the spring modeling crack as a function of its position. The searched parameters of the crack (its depth and position) are indicated by the common point of two arbitrary curves.

It’s unknown if preoperative flexibility affects maintenance of correction in alternative level screw strategy (ALSS) until biologic stability. METHODS: A prospective study of 49 thoracic AIS-ALSS patients (mean age: 14. 5 -years; 86 % females) was preformed. Radiographic parameters were noted on Fulcum Bending Radiograph (FBR) and standing coronal/sagittal films preoperatively, immediate postoperative and at two-year follow-up. <b>Flexibility,</b> <b>curve</b> correction rate, and fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) were calculated. RESULTS: The mean preoperative coronal Cobb’s angles were 58. 3 ° on standing x-ray and 21. 9 ° on FBR (mean FBR flexibility 63. 2 %). The mean curve correction was 15. 2 ° at immediate postoperative (correction rate: 74. 1 %; FBCI: 123. 4 %), and maintained at 18. 3 ° at 2 -year follow-up (correction rate: 68. 4 %; FBCI: 112. 5 %). 61 % of the patients had insignificant change (< 5 °) in coronal alignment (mean change: 1. 1 °), while the remaining had a mean change of 6. 8 °. The trunk list did not change significantly (p= 0. 368), whereas trunk shift improved on last follow-up (p< 0. 0001). No clinically significant changes were noted in the sagittal profile. While curve flexibility did not predict loss of correction, skeletally mature patients had a 6 -fold higher risk of losing curve correction (95 % CI: 1. 3 - 27. 3). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated satisfactory maintenance of curve correction by low implant density constructs, such as the ALSS. However, skeletal maturity seemed to affect the correction attained. This could be due to a longer standing deformity and less elastic tissue in a mature patient, needing stronger and possibly more fixation points...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assessment of scoliotic <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> and {{stiffness}} {{is essential}} for planning surgical treatment in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Measurement of <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> is currently insufficiently precise. The {{purpose of this study}} was to introduce and validate a novel method of superimposing radiographs for more reliable measurement of <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two independent radiologists measured Cobb angles separately on standard anterior-posterior (AP) (n[*]=[*] 48) and supine bending radiographs (n[*]=[*] 48), in patients with AIS, who were randomly included from a surgical database. The same readers repeated the measurements after the bending radiographs were semi-automatically superimposed on the AP radiographs by fusing the caudad end vertebra. <b>Curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> was calculated. Inter-reader agreement between the two independent readers was calculated using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: A moderate inter-reader agreement was achieved in the upper curve (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 57) and a good agreement in the lower curve (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 72) with the standard method of assessing <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility.</b> With the use of the semiautomatic superimposition, however, almost perfect agreement was achieved for both the upper and the lower <b>curves</b> <b>flexibilities</b> (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 93 and 0. 97, respectively).

40|$|The {{correction}} rate (CR) and fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) {{based on}} the fulcrum bending radiograph (FBR) were parameters introduced to measure the curve correcting ability; however, such parameters do not account for contributions by various, potential extraneous "X-Factors" (e. g. surgical technique, type {{and power of the}} instrumentation, anesthetic technique, etc.) involved in curve correction. As such, the purpose of the following study was to propose the concept of the "X-Factor Index" (XFI) as a new parameter for the assessment of the correcting ability of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). A historical cohort radiographic analysis of the FBR in the setting of hook systems in AIS patients (Luk et al. in Spine 23 : 2303 - 2307, 1998) was performed to illustrate the concept of XFI. Thirty-five patients with AIS of the thoracic spine undergoing surgical correction were involved in the analysis. Plain posteroanterior (PA) plain radiographs were utilized and Cobb angles were obtained for each patient. Pre- and postoperative PA angles on standing radiograph and preoperative fulcrum bending angles were obtained for each patient. The fulcrum <b>flexibility,</b> <b>curve</b> CR, and FBCI were determined for all patients. The difference between the preoperative fulcrum bending angle and postoperative PA angle was defined as AngleXF, which accounted for the correction contributed by "X-Factors". The XFI, designed to measure the curve correcting ability, was calculated by dividing Angle XF by the fulcrum flexibility. The XFI was compared with the curve CR and FBCI by re-evaluating the original data in the original paper (Luk et al. in Spine 23 : 2303 - 2307, 1998). The mean standing PA and FBR alignments of the main thoracic curve were 58. 3 ° and 24. 5 °, respectively. The mean fulcrum flexibility was 58. 8 %. The mean postoperative standing PA alignment was 24. 7 °. The mean curve CR was 58. 0 % and the mean FBCI was 101. 1 %. The mean XFI was noted as 1. 03 %. The CR was significantly positively correlated to curve flexibility (r = 0. 66; p < 0. 01). The FBCI (r = - 0. 47; p = 0. 005) and the XFI (r = - 0. 45; p = 0. 007) were significantly negatively correlated to curve flexibility. The CR was not correlated to AngleXF (r = 0. 29; p = 0. 089). The FBCI (r = 0. 97; p < 0. 01) and the XFI (r = 0. 961; p < 0. 01) were significantly positively correlated to AngleXF. Variation in XFI was noted in some cases originally presenting with same FBCI values. The XFI attempts to quantify the curve correcting ability as contributed by "X-Factors" in the treatment of thoracic AIS. This index may be a valued added parameter to accompany the FBCI for comparing curve correction ability among different series of patients, instrumentation, and surgeons. It is recommended that the XFI should be used to document curve correction, compare between different techniques, and used to improve curve correction for the patient. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

To compare {{the ability of}} four different instrumentation systems in correcting thoracic scoliosis based on the <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> as reviewed by the fulcrum-bending radiograph. Summary of Background Data. The fulcrum-bending radiograph {{has been shown to}} be able to accurately reflect the <b>flexibility</b> of thoracic <b>curves,</b> and the fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) predicts the amount of correction achieved by current surgical techniques. By recruiting <b>curves</b> of known <b>flexibility,</b> the efficacy of the different instrumentations in correcting coronal deformity can be truly compared. Methods. A consecutive series of 127 patients with Idiopathic scoliosis were treated by one of four implants: CD-Horizon (CD-H), Moss Miami (MM), TSRH, and ISOLA. All surgeries were performed by the same group of surgeons using the respective recommended techniques. FBCI was used to compare the correction achieved by these implants. Results. The mean FBCI/correction rate was 101. 0 %/ 57. 9 % in the TSRH group, 103. 5 %/ 58. 5 % in ISOLA, 109. 1 %/ 67. 6 % in CD-H, and 100. 2 %/ 62. 7 % in the MM group. The correction rate was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in the CD-H group than those in the TSRH and ISOLA groups, while the differences in the FBCI between the four implants were not statistically significant. Conclusions. When <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> is taken into account, despite differences in material and design of four commonly used instrumentations, their ability to correct thoracic scoliosis is the same. Future studies describing surgical correction results should be based on the FBCI. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Overview of Literatures: Traditionally the flexibility of the whole lumbar curve was measured, and the flexibility of the proximal lumbar curve was not analyzed in any study. Methods: Twenty-eight MT-AIS patients treated by anterior selective thoracic fusion (STF) were evaluated after mean follow-up of 50. 1 months (range, 25 to 116 months). The male: female ratio was in 5 : 23. The man age at surgery was 14 years and 8 months (range, 11. 4 to 18. 4 years). The lumbar curve was divided into the proximal and distal curves by the lumbar apex. Results: The mean final correction rates (CR) /(flexibilities) of the MT, lumbar, proximal lumbar, and distal lumbar curves were 65. 2 %/(50. 5 %), 61. 9 %/(92. 8 %), 65. 3 %/(90. 9 %), and 36. 4 %/(134 %), respectively. With the final lumbar CR, the lumbar flexibility (r = 0. 267, p> 0. 05) and the proximal lumbar flexibility (r = 0. 327, p> 0. 05) was similarly correlated. The mean lumbar CR was similar to the proximal lumbar CR (61. 9 % vs. 65. 3 %, p = 0. 305). And the correlation between the flexibility and the CR was significant only in the proximal lumbar curve (r = 0. 457, p 0. 05) or the distal lumbar curve (r = 0. 175, p> 0. 05).

40|$|Seventy {{patients}} with adolescent idiopathic right thoracic scoliosis had full {{assessment of their}} pulmonary function using a computerised pulmonary function system. Their mean age at evaluation was 13. 8 years. The following measurements were obtained from anteroposterior and lateral standing and antero-posterior supine bending radiographs: lateral curvature, vertebral rotation, kyphosis, maximum sterno-vertebral distance and apical rib-vertebral angles. Using the above measurements, the <b>flexibility</b> of <b>curve,</b> vertebral rotation and rib-vertebral angle asymmetry were calculated. Patients were classified into three groups {{on the basis of}} their predicted vital capacity, to determine whether radiological features of deformity can help identify {{patients with}} compromised pulmonary function. The mean Cobb angle and vertebral rotation for the 70 patients were 50 ° (range 35 - 100 °) and 22 ° (range 1 - 44 °) respectively. The mean <b>flexibility</b> of <b>curve</b> and vertebral rotation were 52 % and 49 % respectively. Mean thoracic kyphosis was 25 °, ranging from - 7 to 55 °. Of the patients with Cobb angle less than 90 °, 71 % had vital capacity less than 80 % of predicted values, and of these, 18 % had marked compromise of vital capacity (less than 60 % of predicted values). Mean values of Cobb angle, vertebral rotational flexibility, kyphosis, rib-vertebral angle asymmetry (in standing as well as supine bending radiographs) differed significantly between patients with more than 80 % of predicted vital capacity and those with 60 % or less of predicted values. Radiological features indicative of better pulmonary function were: rotational flexibility exceeding 55 %, rib-vertebral angle asymmetry (standing) less than 25 ° and kyphosis greater than 15 °.

40|$|Abstract Background With {{increasing}} use {{of magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), underlying syringomyelia is increasingly found in patients with presumed idiopathic scoliosis. To determine the indications for MRI in the differential diagnosis of scoliosis, several clinical characteristics of syringomyelia have been reported. Neurological signs, particularly abnormal superficial abdominal reflex (SAR), are important in establishing the initial diagnosis of scoliosis. However, the prevalence of abnormal SAR in patients with scoliosis and the sensitivity of this sign in predicting syringomyelia are not well known. We aimed to determine the diagnostic utility of SAR and other characteristics of syringomyelia in patients with scoliosis. Methods We reviewed the medical records of 93 patients with scoliosis, 90 of whom underwent corrective surgery. All patients underwent MRI to determine the presence of syringomyelia. Mean age at surgery was 12. 5 years. Abnormal SAR was defined as unilateral or bilateral absence or hyporeflexia of SAR. We calculated indices of diagnostic utility of abnormal SAR for non-idiopathic scoliosis and for syringomyelia. Abnormal SAR, left thoracic curve pattern, gender, and <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> were compared between scoliosis with syringomyelia and idiopathic scoliosis. Logistic regression analysis was performed with the existence of syringomyelia {{as the dependent variable}} and <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> as the independent variable. Results Abnormal SAR was observed in 20 patients (prevalence 22 %). All 6 patients with myopathic scoliosis displayed bilateral absence of SAR. The sensitivity of abnormal SAR for non-idiopathic scoliosis was 38 %, with 96 % specificity, 90 % PPV (positive predictive value), and 60 % NPV (negative predictive value). Syringomyelia was identified in 9 of the 93 patients (9. 7 %); 8 of these had abnormal SAR. The sensitivity of abnormal SAR for syringomyelia in presumed idiopathic scoliosis was 89 %, with 95 % specificity, 80 % PPV, and 98 % NPV.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} prospective, {{comparative}} radiographic {{analysis was}} to determine the role of the fulcrum-bending radiograph (FBR) for the assessment of the proximal thoracic (PT), main thoracic (MT), and the thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) curves in patients undergoing posterior spinal pedicle screw fixation and fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The FBR demonstrated statistically better correction than other preoperative methods for the assessment of frontal plane correction of the MT curves. The fulcrum-bending correction index (FBCI) has been considered a superior method than the correction rate for comparing curve correction undergoing posterior spinal fusion because it accounts for the <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility.</b> However, their applicability to assess the PT and TL/L curves in AIS patients remains speculative. The relation between FBR and correction obtained by pedicle screws fixation is still unknown. Thirty-eight consecutive AIS patients who underwent pedicle screw fixation and posterior fusion were included in this study. The assessment of preoperative radiographs included standing posterior–anterior (PA), FBR, supine side-bending, and postoperative standing PA and lateral plain radiographs. The <b>flexibility</b> of the <b>curve,</b> as well as the FBCI, was calculated for all patients. Postoperatively, radiographs were assessed at immediate (i. e. 1  week), 3 -month, 6 -month, 12 -month, and 2 -year follow-up. Cobb angles were obtained from the PT, MT, and TL/L curves. The study consisted of 9 PT, 37 MT, and 12 TL/L curves, {{with a mean age of}} 15. 1  years. The mean FBR flexibility of the PT, MT, and the TL/L curves was 42. 6, 61. 1, and 66. 2 %, respectively. The mean operative correction rates in the PT, MT, and TL/L curves were 43. 4, 69. 3, and 73. 9 %, respectively, and the mean FBCI was 103. 8, 117. 0, and 114. 8 %, respectively. Fulcrum-bending flexibility was positively correlated with the operative correction rate in PT, MT, and TL/L curves. Although the correction rate in MT and TL/L curves was higher than PT curves, the FBCI in PT, MT, and TL/L curves was not significantly different (p <  0. 05). The FBR can be used to assist in the assessment of PT, MT, and TL/L curve corrections in AIS patients. When <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> is taken into account by FBR, the ability of pedicle screws to correct PT, MT, and TL/L curves is the same...|$|R

It is compared with current methods based on polynomial fitting, spline fitting, LOESS, and Whittaker smoother, each with thresholding and reweighting approach. For <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> selection in existing algorithms, a new method based on skewness of the residuals is successfully applied. The computational efficiency of all approaches is also discussed. The newly introduced methods could be preferred to visible better performance and short computational time.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} known that every economy {{is faced with}} the problem of unevenly distributed labour demand changes across industries, occupations and regions. In competitive labour markets flexible wages and the mobility of labour would lead to a new equilibrium distribution of wages and employment. Regional or industrial unemployment dispersion in Germany is often blamed on a lack of wage adjustments and the lack of labour mobility when economic fortunes are not distributed evenly, but this hypothesis is hardly ever tested. This paper asks how wage reactions in Germany compare with responses in the United States using individual level data. As a first step labour demand shocks are estimated from employment time series data using deterministic detrending and the Hodrick-Prescott filter. These are then included in typical wage regressions based on micro data. The results propose that German labour markets are not as inflexible as simple evidence might suggest. Although wages are regionally only flexible in the United States, wages are found to react to industrial labour demand shocks in both countries. Especially for more experienced and therefore less mobile groups in the German labour market wages react to industrial labour demand shocks.

40|$|Study Design. : A {{prospective}} study of 50 consecutive patients undergoing selective thoracic fusion for idiopathic scoliosis with minimum 2 year follow-up. Objective. : We aim {{to establish the}} validity and safety of a new strategy using fulcrum bending (FB) radiographs and the inherent <b>flexibility</b> of the <b>curve</b> to select fusion levels for King type 2 and 3 curves (Lenke 1 a, 1 b, and 1 c). The purpose of this new strategy is to preserve motion segments compared to the traditional method of selecting fusion levels. Summary of Background Data. : The aim of fusion in idiopathic scoliosis is to achieve a balanced spine with the shortest fusion preserving motion segments particularly in the lumbar spine. Conventional strategies for choosing fusion levels {{have been based on}} the standing radiographs and have not taken into account the <b>flexibility</b> of the <b>curve.</b> Methods. : We followed 50 consecutive patients who underwent selective thoracic fusion for King 2 and 3 curves (Lenke 1 a, 1 b, and 1 c). The fusion levels were chosen based on our new strategy using the FB radiograph. Twenty-five patients were fused using a hook system and 25 with a hybrid system of hooks and screws. All patients were observed until skeletal maturity and a minimum of 2 years. The curve correction, trunk shift, radiographic shoulder height, list were recorded at the preoperative stage, postoperative stage, and final follow-up. Results. : The patients had an average age of 15. 4 years. The average preoperative Cobb angle was 55. 4 ° and final follow-up Cobb angle for the primary curve was 24. 1 °, with no difference between the 2 groups. With the new strategy, we were able to save levels in 31 patients (62 %), compared to the conventional method of selecting the lowest instrumented vertebra. There was a statistically significant difference in the correction of the fusion mass Cobb angle between the hook and hybrid groups. There was significant improvement in the trunk shift after surgery. Ninety-six percent of patients had balanced or minimally imbalanced shoulders at final follow-up. Three patients had tilting of the vertebra below the fusion mass into the primary curve that did not progress at skeletal maturity. Conclusion. : The new objective strategy for determining fusion levels using FB radiographs is safe and effective. With considering the <b>flexibility</b> of the <b>curve,</b> we are able to save levels distally in over 60 % of patients. This strategy takes into account the power of modern instrumentation. © 2008, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|To clarify if CCI or FBCI could fully {{eliminate}} {{the influence of}} <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> on the coronal correction rate. We reviewed medical record of all thoracic curve AIS cases undergoing posterior spinal fusion with all pedicle screw systems from June 2011 to July 2013. Radiographical data was collected and calculated. Student t test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were {{used to analyze the}} data. 60 were included in this study. The mean age was 14. 7 y (10 - 18 y) with 10 males (17 %) and 50 females (83 %). The average Risser sign was 2. 7. The mean thoracic Cobb angle before operation was 51. 9 °. The mean bending Cobb angle was 27. 6 ° and the mean fulcrum bending Cobb angle was 17. 4 °. The mean Cobb angle at 2 week after surgery was 16. 3 °. The Pearson correlation coefficient r between CCI and BFR was - 0. 856 (P< 0. 001), and between FBCI and FFR was - 0. 728 (P< 0. 001). A modified FBCI (M-FBCI) = (CR- 0. 513) /BFR or a modified CCI (M-CCI) = (CR- 0. 279) /FFR was generated by curve estimation has no significant correlation with FFR (r=- 0. 08, p= 0. 950) or with BFR (r= 0. 123, p= 0. 349).

Our study assessed the outcome of two surgical techniques and to determine the contribution of surgical technique to the X-Factor Index. METHODS: Fifty-four patients (85 % females; mean age: 12 years) with thoracic AIS underwent posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation using two different techniques, by two different surgeons, without direct apical derotation but similar pedicle screw fixation strategy, were prospectively assessed. In technique A (n= 25), after locking only the distal most pedicle screw on the concave side, curve correction was achieved from the convex side using the differential rod contouring technique. In technique B (n= 29), the deformity correction was achieved from the concave side. The FBCI {{was used to compare}} the correction achieved. RESULTS: The median FBCI for groups A and B were 112. 1 and 128. 3, but did not significantly differ (p= 0. 278). When <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> was overall greater than 50 %, individuals in Group B (median, 123. 8) had more curve correction than Group A (median, 109. 4) (p= 0. 030) but this finding was not noted in individuals with higher flexibilities (e. g. 60 % and greater). CONCLUSION: The corrective ability of thoracic AIS depends to a degree on the inherent <b>flexibility</b> of the <b>curve.</b> Although there were suggestions that surgical technique may improve curve correction, statistical significance was not noted. However, larger studies are needed for further validation...|$|R

Free Paper Session 7 - Paediatric Orthopaedics and Paediatric Spine: no. 7. 12 INTRODUCTION: For {{adolescent}} idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients undergoing brace, a 50 % in-brace correction is {{the general}} rule. However, this is an arbitrary figure and {{does not take into}} account the <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility.</b> This study aimed to predict in-brace correction of scoliosis using our standard supine radiographs. METHODS: This is a retrospective correlation analysis of pre-brace supine and in-brace standing radiographs for patients undergoing Boston brace treatment for AIS. Patients with AIS undergoing brace treatment from June to December 2008 were reviewed from initial referral date until maturity. All included subjects were aged ≥ 10 years, Risser sign 0, premenarchal for girls and with a major curve of 25 ° to 40 °. Supine radiographs were performed the day of brace fitting while the inbrace radiograph was taken after the patient had worn the brace for 2 weeks. Other analysed factors included age, gender, body height, weight, age of menarche, and self-reported brace compliance. The Cobb’s angle correction obtained by supine radiographs was used as prediction analysis of in-brace correction using linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients (55 females, 5 males) with a mean age of 11. 9 years were recruited. The mean pre-bracing, supine and in-brace Cobb’s angles were 31. 7 °, 23. 9 ° and 20. 0 °, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed strong positive correlation (R= 0. 713; p< 0. 001) between change in Cobb’s angle in supine and in-brace radiographs. CONCLUSION: This study showed that supine radiographs have predictive value for determining in-brace correction of AIS. Thus, <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> has a strong effect on curve correction using bracing...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. A {{prospective}} study on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis to assess a new method of describing frontal plane correction. Objective. To assess {{the difference between}} using the correction rate and using the new fulcrum bending correction index when describing scoliosis correction. Summary of Background Data. A description {{of the outcome of}} scoliosis surgery based on the correction rate {{does not take into account}} the <b>curve's</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Methods. The fulcrum bending correction index is calculated by dividing the correction rate by the fulcrum flexibility (based on the fulcrum bending radiograph) and is expressed as a percentage. The fulcrum bending correction index was compared with the correction rate in 35 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing surgical correction. These patients were divided into a stiff and a flexible group based on a fulcrum flexibility of 50 % to show the advantage of the fulcrum bending correction index over the correction rate. Results. The difference in correction rate between the flexible (66 %) and the stiff group (45 %) was significant (P < 0. 05). The difference in the fulcrum bending correction index between the flexible (96 %) and the stiff group (107 %) was not significant (P = 0. 2). Conclusions. The fulcrum bending correction index takes into account the <b>curve</b> <b>flexibility</b> and is therefore better than the correction rate for comparing curve correction and use of instrumentation systems between different series of patients. A fulcrum bending correction index of close to 100 % suggests that the instrumentation has taken up all the flexibility revealed by the fulcrum bending radiograph. It is recommended that the fulcrum bending correction index be used in the future as part of the postoperative assessment of frontal plane correction in cases of thoracic scoliosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the local unemployment rate and wage level – commonly referred to as the wage curve. Using a panel data setup for annual enterprise-level microdata, we confirm previous findings that wages in Slovakia are, on the whole, relatively flexible – with a rise in the local unemployment rate of 1 percentage point being associated with a drop in wages of 0. 85 %. We find, however, that these elasticities differ considerably across sectors, regions and, in particular, skills. Our results indicate that overall wage flexibility in the Slovak labour market is driven more by the wage flexibility of higher-skilled employees, and their broader opportunities for employment, than by the institutional arrangements of the labour market. wage curve, panel data, unemployment elasticity of wages, wage <b>flexibility,</b> Slovakia, Phillips <b>curve,</b> microdata...|$|R
