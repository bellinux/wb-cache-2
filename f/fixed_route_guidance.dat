40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{proliferation}} of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years, {{it has become}} possible to utilize the vehicular wireless network to assist the <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> for drivers in a co-operative approach, aiming to mitigating heavy traffic congestion. In this paper, we investigate into the <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> problem in vehicular wireless network, and then propose two efficient routing algorithms, i. e., centralized <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> and distributed <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> according to different situations. A hybrid framework is then proposed to provide optimized routing decisions in a uniform way. Simulation results in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) indicate that, our <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> schemes achieve much better performance than traditional GPS-based navigation and randomized routing...|$|R
40|$|This Working Paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simulation model for <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> based on the principle of multiple user class assignment. The model calculates separate routes for guided and unguided drivers in full interaction with each other, assuming user equilibrium, system optimum and stochastic user equilibrium routing for each of the classes. As the model is equilibrium-based, it is most appropriate for the assessment of the long-term behaviour of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> systems. Conditions are derived under which the solution to the multiple user class assignment problem in a <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> context is unique.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the benefits from}} vehicle <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> in urban networks. We suppose that routes can be altered {{in such a way}} as to achieve system optimal assignment. Benefits are measured by the savings in total travel time when comparing this assignment with the user equilibrium, which is assumed to occur in the absence of <b>route</b> <b>guidance.</b> A continuum approach is used to analyze an idealized corridor in which a freeway is superimposed over a dense grid of surface streets. The main role of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> is to divert traffic from the freeway whenever its marginal cost exceeds that of the street system. It is found that saving in total system travel time of the order of 3 - 4 % can be achieved from <b>route</b> <b>guidance.</b> Benefits are quite sensitive to city street speed. At low speed more users would choose the freeway resulting in congestion, and the potential benefits of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> are relatively high. However, as street speed increases and approaches that of the freeway, <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> would be of less value as more of the motorists would be choosing the city street on their own. Benefits can be enhanced if information is customized to motorists on the basis of their origins and destinations. Finally, it is shown that benefits are reduced when the freeway network is dense. This paper does not consider important aspects of the evaluation of <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> such as the equity issue stemming from increasing some trip times in order to achieve system optimum, or the local impact of diverted traffic. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTraffic signal {{control and}} <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> are {{the oldest and}} most applied dynamic traffic {{management}} measures. Most of the time they operate in a local mode, although there is trend toward network-wide traffic management. For traffic signal control already several network systems existed, but so far the integration with <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> is lacking. In this paper we describe a new strategy to integrate traffic signal control and <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> based on the principles of back-pressure control. The algorithms developed are tested in a theoretical network and it was shown that traffic signal control based on back-pressure control performs well. Using back-pressure for <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> required some assumptions which are open for debate. The results show that the average density is not such a good measure for route pressure and that travel time as a pressure variable performs better. A combination of factors of pressure based on density and travel time seems to be the best choice. Using back-pressure for both signal control and <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> gave promising results, although the differences with optimized local control were small. Future research is recommended on the fine-tuning of the back-pressure traffic signal model, and on further integration and coordination of the control strategies. On the part of <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> finding representative <b>route</b> pressure values and making the model applicable of larger networks requires more research...|$|R

40|$|A {{multiple}} {{user class}} assignment model is developed {{to simulate the}} interaction between a <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> system and an urban traffic control system. For two real- life networks of Leeds and Southampton four basic scenarios are investigated: current situation; - expected situation with <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> but without interaction with the traffic control system; - expected situation with <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> and with interaction with the traffic control system; - optimum future situation with 100 % take-up and compliance with system optimal guidance and delay minimising signal control. The computed extra travel time savings of an integration of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> and signal control are of a similar magnitude as those of a <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> system alone. With static demand delay minimisation performs best, but when demand is dynamically increasing Smith's Po policy gives rise to lowest network travel times. The degrading effect of imperfect advice or non-compliance is small at realistic levels of take-up of up to 25 %. Along the same line, the benefits of system optimal guidance are also modest (in the order of less than 1 %) when take-up of guidance is less than 25 %...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{management}} and <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> are optimization problems by nature. In this article, we consider algorithms for centralized <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> and discuss fairness aspects {{for the individual}} user resulting from optimal <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> policies. The {{first part of this}} article deals with the mathematical aspects of these optimization problems from the viewpoint of network flow theory. We present algorithms which solve the constrained multicommodity minimum cost flow problem (CMCF) to optimality. A feasible routing is given by a flow x, and the cost of flow x is the total travel time spent in the network. The corresponding optimum is a restricted system optimum with a globally controlled constrained or fairness factor. This approach implements a compromise between user equilibrium and system optimum. The goal is to find a <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> strategy which minimizes global and community criteria with individual needs as constraints. The fairness factor L restricts the set of all feasible routes to the subset of acceptable routes. This might include the avoidance of routes which are much longer than shortest routes, the exclusion of certain streets, preferences for scenic paths, o...|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{urban traffic}} amount {{prediction}} models for dynamic <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> systems Zilu Liang 1 * and Yasushi Wakahara 1, 2 The <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> system (RGS) {{has been considered}} an important technology to mitigate urban traffic congestion. However, existing RGSs provide only <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> after congestion happens. This reactive strategy imposes a strong limitation on the potential contribution of current RGS to the performance improvement of a traffic network. Thus, a proactive RGS based on congestion prediction is considered essential to improve the effectiveness of RGS. The problem of congestion prediction is translated into traffic amount (i. e. the number of vehicles on the individual roads) prediction, as {{the latter is a}} straightforward indicator of the former. We thereby propose two urban traffic prediction models using different modeling approaches. Model- 1 is based on the traffic flow propagation in the network, while Model- 2 is based on the time-varied spare flow capacity on the concerned road links. These two models are then applied to construct a centralized proactive RGS. Evaluation results show that (1) both of the proposed models reduce the prediction error up to 52 % and 30 % in the best cases compared to the existing Shift Model, (2) providing proactive <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> helps reduce average travel time by up to 70 % compared to providing reactive one and (3) non-rerouted vehicles could benefit more from <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> than rerouted vehicles do...|$|R

The primary measure of driving performance was the reaction time to a scanning task. Other measures included navigation errors, workload, and percep-tion ratings. Censored regression models were developed to study the effect of <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> type on reaction times. Results indicated that the drivers responded the fastest while using the audio system and the slowest while using the paper map.

40|$|A {{framework}} is developed to parametrically evaluate networks under user equilibrium <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> (UERG) and system optimal <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> (SORG), {{assuming that the}} unguided traffic is in stochastic user equilibrium. The framework can determine in what condition an advanced traveler information system performs well and which <b>route</b> <b>guidance</b> state performs better as the market penetration of guidance systems increases. Unlike other studies that assumed a fixed number of compliant drivers, this study explicitly considers compliance rate as an endogenous variable in a general parametric nonlinear programming framework. Under endogenously determined compliance rate, SORG {{may result in a}} higher total system cost than UERG because of a lower compliance rate, even though SORG aims to minimize total system cost.

To solve this problem, we propose to use the genetic algorithm to alleviate the rising computational cost. We use the genetic algorithm to find the shortest time in driving with diverse scenarios of real traffic conditions and varying vehicle speeds. The effectiveness of the genetic algorithm is clearly demonstrated when applied on a real map of modern city with very large vertex numbers...|$|R
