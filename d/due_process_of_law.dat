The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E

It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly.

40|$|One basic tenet <b>of</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and {{adjudication}} <b>of</b> {{justice is}} the need to follow <b>due</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Admittedly, doing this in any competent court <b>of</b> <b>law</b> may bring about some delays. However when such delays become unreasonable and without justifiable cause, they cause unnecessary hardships for people in a manner that undermine human rights and access to justice. One problematic area in Ghana’s justice system delved into by this paper is the issue of delay in court ruling long after hearing and conclusion of cases. Even though there are rules that prescribe time limits for court rulings, these rules appear to be inconsistent with certain parts of Ghana’s 1992 Constitution and have been interpreted by the nation’s Supreme Court in a manner that seemingly strips them off their legal effect. This paper reviews the rules of time limit for court ruling and analyzes how they have been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the light of some provisions of the 1992 Constitution. It makes recommendations for reform in the rules of time limit in a manner that makes them more justiciable and enhances timeous delivery of judgment after a case has been heard...|$|R

25|$|The {{plaintiff}} in this case, Frank R. Brushaber, was a shareholder in the defendant Union Pacific Railroad company.

With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream.

The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v.

40|$|Corruption of the Gold StandardThe gold {{standard}} is a monetary system which, unlike {{the regime of}} irredeemable currency, is free of coercion. Its main significance {{is not to be}} found in the stabilization of prices, which is neither possible nor desirable, but in the stabilization of interest rates. A {{gold standard}} is established when the unit of currency, or standard of value, is defined by the Constitution as a definite weight of gold of definite fineness. All other forms of currency are then redeemable in gold on demand at the statutory rate. To be effective, a gold standard must have a paraphernalia such as the standard gold coin, minted free of charge (exclusive of the cost of refining) at the Mint in unlimited quantities on the account of anyone tendering the metal. Furthermore, owners of the gold coins of the realm may hoard them, melt them, export them freely without penalty or the threat thereof.
