40|$|AbstractInhalable {{particulate}} matter, especially PM 2. 5 {{is one of}} {{the main}} pollutants in China and it's harmful to both human health and atmosphere. Since the removal efficiency of traditional dust removal devices such as ESP for PM 2. 5 is very low, pretreatment becomes necessary before the dust gets into the <b>dust</b> <b>remover.</b> Acoustic agglomeration {{is one of the}} pretreatment technologies which uses sound wave with high intensity to make fine particles get agglomerate and grow up, and improves the efficiency of traditional dust removal devices for PM 2. 5. In sound wave field, fine particles are carried by the medium which in this paper is air, and vibrate with different amplitude because of different particle sizes, thus relative movement appears and then particles have more chances to collide and get agglomerate. In this paper, the movement of particles with different sizes in travelling wave sound field and standing wave sound field were calculated, including the velocity, displacement, amplitude and so on. The situation that Re< 1 was considered and Viscous force in Stokes region was chose as the main forces here. Studying the movement of fine particle in sound field with different conditions has great meaning in learning the mechanisms of acoustic agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of {{its high}} output，much more dust is {{produced}} in fully-mechanized Longwall mining with top-coal caving (LMTC) mining faces than in conventional mechanized mining faces without top-coal caving. Now dust control in fully-mechanized LMTC mining faces has become a key technological problem needed to be solved. Baced on the ejected dust removal technology, this paper developed a coal dust extraction which used in the fully mechanized LMTC mining face. For the optimization of the extraction’s property, measure systems are designed. By amounts of assembled experiment, the best structure of the extraction is found. In this paper, the research of the spray characteristic on the water nozzle {{was carried out by}} using the jet parameter testing system. Some important result can be gotten such as the velocity of spray particle, the distribution of the velocity, the diameter of spray particle, the spread of the spray particle etc. The study was helpful to optimizing the exhausting-flowing remover and improving the <b>dust</b> <b>remover’s</b> efficiency. From the industry examination, the coal dust extraction’s performance has greatly improved...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{considered}} an hazelnut harvest technique by hazelnuts aspiration from the soil, and a comparison with {{the characteristics of the}} crop and of the soil, with which the considered machines have to interact, has been performed. This technique has broadly spread in Campania Region and for it, it is not required a meadow around the trees. After having performed some tests for the considered harvest technique, the characteristic parameters of working capacity, working quality and energy costs have been evaluated. Further, it has been faced the problems due to the soil dusts. to identify a filtering system capable of reducing the great amounts of dusts introduced in the environment during the process of hazelnuts picking up by means turbo-aspirating machines. The main types of <b>dust</b> <b>removers</b> for medium-thin <b>dusts</b> have been studied and examined; a comparative exam proved the mechanical removal by cyclone (centrifugal dust separator) to be the most effective. Therefore, two prototype filters were examined, each consisting of four cyclones with a turning diameter of mm 350 and mm 250 respectively. Field tests showed the effectiveness of the system; the 350 mm multi-cyclone proved to have a dust removing capacity of 90 %, with no reduction in performance caused by the dust that goes through it, while the 250 mm removes 93. 75 %, with a reduction in performance of approximatevely 30 %. However, {{it would be a mistake}} to give preference to the former over the latter, as its better performance does not compensate, in terms of environment hygiene, the 3. 75 % difference which, though seemingly slight, represents a further reduction of 50 % of the thinner dust contained in the atmospher...|$|R

Reginald Victor Jones identified the object on 18 June as [...] "a whiteish sic cylinder about 35 feet long and 5 or so feet in diameter with a blueish nose and fins at the other end...I had found the rocket."After Operation Hydra bombed other areas of Peenemünde in 1943, the P-7 blockhouse roof was reinforced, and in a 1944 raid, the blockhouse occupants suffered one injury when a periscope fell. (Hermann Weidner's Test Stand 8 was lost in the 1944 July and August raids).|$|R
