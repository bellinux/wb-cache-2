5|$|A second group, the <b>Foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Pure Spanish Horse or PRE Mundial, {{has begun}} another PRE {{registry}} {{as an alternative}} to the ANCCE. This new registry claims that all of their registered horses trace back to the original stud book maintained by the Cria Caballar, which was a branch of the Spanish Ministry of Defense, for 100 years. Thus, the PRE Mundial registry asserts that their registry is the most authentic, purest PRE registry functioning today.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided the <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and {{the culmination of}} the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E

Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice. These findings later became the <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex reversal in humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the Zytglogge {{and the other}} Bernese gate towers were {{extended}} and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> heavy machinery.|$|E
