According to the Rent Subsidies Act (Wohngeldgestz) of 1970, “low-income tenants and owners of accommodations are supported with rents and burdens subsidies.” The determination of the income of families taken into consideration for housing allowances was simplified, and increased levels of protection and support for low-income tenants and householders were introduced {{which led to a}} drop in the number of eviction notices. By 1974, three times as much was paid out in rent subsidies as in 1969, and nearly one and a half million households received rental assistance. Increases were made in public housing subsidies, as characterised by a 36% increase in the social housing budget in 1970 and by the introduction of a programme for the construction of 200,000 public housing units (1971). From 1970 to 1971, an 18.1% increase in building permits for social housing units was made. Other reforms aimed at improving tenants' rights included protection against conversion of rental housing into condominiums, the prohibition of the misappropriation of living space, new regulation of the apartment broker system, and a fee scale for engineers and architects. In addition, the income limits for eligibility for social housing were raised and adapted in order of general <b>income</b> <b>trends.</b>|$|E

The data of the survey consists of the wages of 18 – 60 -year-old men and women insured under the Employees' Pensions Act with the major earnings-related pension providers. The data covers the years 1996 – 2001 and represents 70 – 95 per cent of the wages insured under the Employees' Pensions Act during this period.

5000|$|Many {{advertisers}} {{are competing}} for space in Chinese publications. “Advertisers don’t pay attention to large distribution, rather they prefer a safe environment for their advertisement,” says Hung, {{the publisher of the}} independent fashion magazine. It is reported that [...] "fashion labels are putting even more money into advertising in China than in the States." [...] Vogue magazine is already an internationally well-known publication, which makes advertisers feel safe placing their advertisements in their magazines.

However, since there is no third party auditing system in China, it is unclear whether high profile magazines such as Vogue are profitable because of their distribution sales or the advertisements that they feature. “In a fair market environment, our niche distribution will not seem so distant from the bloated distribution figures of the giants,” said Hung, a publisher of the independent fashion magazine iLook.|$|E

40|$|The chronic and {{expanding}} US trade deficit has refocused attention upon the responsiveness of trade flows to exchange rate and income changes. I estimate import and export equations {{over a period}} spanning the 1990 s New Economy boom and the subsequent recession and dollar depreciation. The results indicate (1) a low responsiveness of imports to exchange rate changes, and (2) a diminution (but not disappearance) of the income elasticity asymmetry first noted by Houthakker and Magee. The combination of low price elasticity of imports with the present size of the trade deficit means that any reduction of the trade deficit will necessarily be accompanied by large exchange rate and <b>income</b> <b>trend</b> adjustments.

40|$|We examine <b>income</b> <b>trends</b> for top executives, {{focusing}} on the years 2000 to 2010, with special emphasis on the period surrounding the Great Recession. First, we merge Execucomp executive compensation records with IRS tax records. We com-pare incomes from our Execucomp sample to top incomes reported by Piketty and Saez (2003). We disaggregate executive <b>income</b> <b>trends</b> by industry, showing which industries are driving the divergence in top executive incomes. We compare our results to fi ndings from Bakija, Cole, and Heim (2010) and Kaplan and Rauh (2010), who examine trends in top incomes for broad occupation and industry categories for {{years prior to the}} Great Recession. We also decompose these <b>income</b> <b>trends</b> by income source to see which components are driving the observed changes. We fi nd that stock options are by far the most volatile component of executive pay. Options are the key driver of both short-term swings and longer-term trends in top executive pay. However, stock awards are also a large and growing component. We fi nd much greater variation in income across years than across industries. Executive incomes are most volatile {{at the very top of}} income distribution. In general, trends for top executives in fi nance and non-fi nance industries are quite similar; however; for those above the 99. 9 th percentile of the income distribution, the decline in incom...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{question}} of how income inequal-ity between two jurisdictions impacts upon government decision making with regards to the provision of public goods or, in gen-eral, {{to the size of the}} public sector. We model policy choices as the outcome of negotiations in a legislature compounded by regional representatives. We show that the more unequal the in-come distribution, the greater the degree of inefficiency in public goods provision. In particular, a divergent <b>income</b> <b>trend</b> between rich and poor makes interregional redistributive conflicts more dramatic and may lead to an under-provision of public goods. Consequently, the larger the income disparity, the lower the size of the public sector. As a result, a wealthier economy may lead to a relatively smaller public sector when income disparity increases. ∗I am very grateful to Abhinay Muthoo for his comments on all the versions o...|$|R

In this paper, the importance of precautionary saving against income uncertainty is analyzed empirically using micro data from the German Socio- Economic Panel Study (GSOEP). Wealth in 2002 is regressed on alternative measures of income uncertainty in a cross-section of households. In addition to the usual controls, risk aversion is also taken into account. When using net financial wealth, precautionary saving is statistically significant and economically quite important. The share of precautionary net financial wealth in total aggregate net financial wealth is on average about 20 %. Compared with net financial wealth, housing wealth is not used as a buffer stock against income uncertainty, confirming the hypothesis that this kind of asset is rather illiquid.

We thus demonstrate that conservative welfare states have put the burden of adjustment to the post- 1975 economic slowdown on birth cohorts that could not get stable jobs before 1975, while similar cohort inequalities are much weaker in liberal and social democratic welfare states. In these latter two welfare regimes, the burden of adjustment to the post- 1975 economic slowdown was not put {{on the shoulders of}} some cohorts relative to others.
