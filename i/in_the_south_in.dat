5|$|Han {{was born}} on 3 August 1900 in Hamhung, {{in the north of}} Korea. His father was a county magistrate. He {{graduated}} from middle school in 1919 and attended Nippon University in Tokyo from 1921 to 1924, studying sociology. He emigrated to Manchuria in 1925 but returned to Seoul <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>in</b> 1927. In 1944, he returned to his native Hamhung. After the liberation of Korea he settled in Pyongyang.|$|E

5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is endemic to the {{south-eastern}} forested areas of Australia, principally {{east of the}} Great Dividing Range. Its range extends approximately from Bundaberg in Queensland to Geelong in Victoria, with outlying colonies in Ingham and Finch Hatton in the north, and in Adelaide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>In</b> the southern parts of its range it occupies more extreme latitudes than any other Pteropus species.|$|E

5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South Vietnamese forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} a seven-day ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in Vietnamese society. However, unbeknown to the South Vietnamese and their allies, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to use the cease-fire to launch a large offensive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>in</b> order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E

5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government.

5|$|By 23 August, the {{remainder}} of the Wehrmacht's Seventh Army had entrenched itself along the Seine River, in preparation for the defence of Paris. Simultaneously, elements of Army Group G—including the German 15th Army and the 5th Panzer Army—moved to engage American forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>In</b> the following week, elements of the Canadian 1st Army repeatedly attacked these German units on the Seine in attempts to break through to the Channel Ports. On the evening of 23 August, French and American Army units entered Paris.|$|E
5|$|If the {{agreements}} at Montmirail had been followed up, {{the acts of}} homage could potentially have confirmed Louis's position as king, while undermining the legitimacy of any rebellious barons within Henry's territories {{and the potential for}} an alliance between them and Louis. In practice, however, Louis perceived himself to have gained a temporary advantage, and immediately after the conference he began to encourage tensions between Henry's sons. Meanwhile, Henry's position in the south of France continued to improve, and by 1173 he had agreed to an alliance with Humbert, the Count of Savoy, which betrothed Henry's son John and Humbert's daughter Alicia. Henry's daughter Eleanor was married to Alfonso VIII of Castile in 1170, enlisting an additional ally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>In</b> February 1173, Raymond finally gave in and publicly gave homage for Toulouse to Henry and his heirs.|$|E

5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program. Bill Gates has said that he thinks global eradication is possible by 2040.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish plan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>in</b> Karelia was {{to advance}} as swiftly as {{possible}} to Lake Ladoga, cutting the Soviet forces in half. Then the Finnish territories east of Lake Ladoga were to be recaptured before the advance along the Karelian Isthmus, including the recapture of Vyborg, commenced. The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army and 23rd Army, so it could advance swiftly. The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first Finnish units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces. During the rest of July, the Army of Karelia advanced further southeast into Karelia, coming to a halt at the former Finnish-Soviet border at Mansila.|$|E

5|$|The {{centre of}} these {{architectural}} developments was the region encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived {{as evidence of}} the widespread temple building of the Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the Kalyani region in the northeast to the Bellary region in the east and to the Mysore region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>In</b> the Bijapur–Belgaum region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the Hemadpanti temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples {{can be found in the}} Konkan region, the presence of the Western Ghats probably prevented the style from spreading westwards.|$|E
5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Consequently, {{there is a wide}} variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> <b>In</b> general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties in the main climate types. Despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation.|$|E

5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>in</b> 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} were in any case completed {{by the start of}} September 1066, and had possibly begun already in March or April. While he brought with him Elisiv, his daughters, and his son Olaf, he left behind Tora and made sure to have his oldest son Magnus hailed as king. Gathering his fleet at Solund in the Sognefjord, Harald departed Norway in August, and landed first in Shetland and thereafter in Orkney (both under Norwegian control). In both places he was joined by several important lords, chieftains, and soldiers, including the Earls of Orkney, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. He next went to Dunfermline, where he met with Tostig's ally Malcolm III of Scotland (and according to some sources, with Tostig) who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers. According to most contemporary sources, Harald and Tostig met at Tynemouth on 8 September, Harald with a total force of, at the most, around 10–15,000 men on 240–300 longships, and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers. Not mentioned in the sagas, but accounted for by John of Worcester, Tostig had departed from his exile in Flanders already in May or June. He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich. As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response, Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald, while Harold Godwinson remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>in</b> expectation of invasion by William of Normandy, who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne.|$|E
