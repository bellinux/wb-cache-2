I am {{inclined}} to think, however, it was connected with a woman. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he who had been wronged hated him who had wronged him with a hate such as does not often burn in a man's brain, unless it be fanned {{by the memory of}} a woman's breath.|$|E

I tell you, Watson, I've {{only known}} her these few weeks, {{but from the}} first I just {{felt that she was}} made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day {{for the first time that}} I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my {{feelings}} towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay." ...|$|E

We've got the proof, we've got the evidence'. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> the case had been going on that long, they were out to get somebody to get it off their books, to put somebody inside. It didn't matter who it was as long as it fitted in some way or they could make it fit in some way and they could put that person inside.|$|E
5000|$|Another likely {{reason for}} the failure of video game adaptations is that {{structural}} conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers. As Nintendo video game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto said in a 2007 interview: [...] “I think that part of the problem with translating games to movies is that the structure of what makes a good game {{is very different from the}} structure of what makes a good movie. Movies are a much more passive medium, where the movie itself is telling a story and you, as the viewer, are relaxing and taking that in passively. Whereas video games are a much more active medium where you are playing along with the story. In some cases, you are progressing the story yourself, or perhaps you get to a point where it gets too difficult and maybe you give up. I think that people who like movies also have an interest in the creative work that goes into making a video game. So there is interactivity with the video game that you don’t necessarily have with a movie. In that sense, I think the structures of the two are very different and you have to take that into account when converting a video game into a movie. I think that video games, as a whole, have a very simple flow in terms of what’s going on in the game. We make that flow entertaining by implementing many different elements to the video game to keep the player entertained. Movies have much more complex stories, or flow, to them, but the elements that affect that flow are limited in number. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> these surrounding elements in these two different mediums vary so greatly, when you fail to take that into account then you run into problems.” ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{will present the}} format of play, {{computer}} game and for us the most relevant format, educational computer games. While studying the area of educational games I was interested in which game features {{are the most important}} for learning. I learned that the kids are more motivated to learn if the teaching subject is presented {{in the form of a}} game and that while playing it one can invoke the state of »flow«, which is the optimal state which gives you the feeling of pleasure and control and where one's abilities match with the challenge presented. Challenges originate from activities, which are optimally set, with clear goals and good feedback. All this is giving the player a feeling of control and leads to the desired state. Furthermore I was interested in which elements influence these two occurances and how to design and create a game to have these features. While studying different models for game design, I decided to use Garris' model of learning cycle, which states that the student enjoys a more personal experiance through the use of suitable feedback, which makes him or her more motivated and attains a better learning result. Algorithms are difficult to understand and an abstract subject, so the goal was to find innovative approach to make the understanding easier, which results in better learning efficiency compared to the currently used methods. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the positive educational features it has, the game format is very suitable for teaching this subject. While teaching the algorithms, visualization is very important as it enables the student to grasp the abstract concepts and that is why I presented it in greater detail in the thesis. Teaching the algorithms turned out to be very difficult if a student does not have an algorithmic way of thinking developed. This is the reason why as a part of this thesis I designed my own educational game, which was created as part of the subject called »Z IKT podprta učna gradiva« and which demonstrates how a student can develop algorithmic thinking through different activities. ...|$|E

In a later interview with The Irish Catholic, he reflects on his college interests: “Going back to my college days, I was a medieval history major, so I {{was very interested in}} the time period back then, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> always saw it as a period in history that unified Christians of all backgrounds.

I was made to feel at first that I was a rank outsider, and I never quite forgot it. I suffered very little bullying, and I never had a fight--in all my time there were only three fights--but I followed my own curiosities. I was already a very keen theologian and politician before I was fifteen. I was also intensely interested in modern warfare.

40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of my research to date, to save you the trouble at looking at the papers. The research summary and proposal I’ll write for my applications will be more polished, less frank, and shorter. Research philosophy. I enjoy thinking about {{a wide variety of}} things, so my intent is to be broad as a researcher (and not be pigeonholed as working only in enumerative geometry, or Gromov-Witten theory). In the medium term, though, I suspect that most of my interests will continue to revolve around intersection theory on moduli spaces. I realize that so far my style has been to produce what I find to be pretty groups of facts, rather than anything foundational. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>because</b> I’ve found myself in a young field (Gromov-Witten theory, loosely) where the foundations have been well set, but where there are lot of beautiful facts still lying around waiting to be found. I had intended to become more arithmetic, but that hasn’t really happened; there’s been too much to think about in geometry. When I first arrived in grad school, I thought of myself as someone with (temporarily!) very little knowledge, but who could figure things out quickly, and I thought that “cleverness ” would be my strength as a mathematician. To my surprise, that’s completely false: I find myself very slow at on-the-spot thinking — I always have to go away and think for a long while. Instead, I learn a lot by working out many examples, and then gradually building up insight (usually geometric) into what’s going on; this I picked up from Joe, Brendan, and to a certain extent MacPherson. Since talking (a whole lot) with Johan, I now find myself comfortable making intuitions technically precise and complete. The articles. I don’t feel like I can really judge the relative value of my articles; different people I talk to have different preferences. So I’ll just sketch what they’re about, and let you decide. I’ve included copies of them all, and they are also all available on my preprints page...|$|R
