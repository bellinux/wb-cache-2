What distinguished the UVA story from anything else ever reported was that the assault did not involve drugs or alcohol, required elaborate planning, and involved so many people that the perps could not have reasonably expected to get away with it—a confluence of factors that caused the allegations to have substantially more in common with ones that ultimately proved to be false, like the Duke lacrosse case and Tawana Brawley incident.|$|E

500|$|The film is {{loosely based}} on the actual crimes {{attributed}} to an unidentified serial killer known as the Phantom Killer; it claims that [...] "the <b>incredible</b> <b>story</b> {{you are about to}} see is true, where it happened and how it happened; only the names have been changed." [...] The actual Phantom attacked eight people between February 22 and May 3, 1946 in or near the town of Texarkana, Texas, which is on the Texas border with Arkansas. Most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside Texarkana, in Bowie County, Texas, while the film has them occurring in Arkansas. However, the general outline of the murders largely follows reality, with mostly minor artistic license taken. As in the film, the real killer was never identified nor apprehended.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to the United States from Libya, his mother suggested that Owumi {{write a book about}} his experience living in Benghazi during the Arab Spring. Although initially wanting to forget those memories, he penned the autobiography Qaddafi's Point Guard: The <b>Incredible</b> <b>Story</b> of a Professional Basketball Player Trapped in Libya's Civil War, which was published in 2013. Owumi wrote the book with Daniel Paisner, a New York Times bestselling author who had also written for Whoopi Goldberg and Denzel Washington. Qaddafi's Point Guard described Owumi's life from his childhood to his season in Egypt. Publishers Weekly called it [...] "resonant, moving memoir of an African athlete who survives incredible cultural and political challenges to play the sport he loves." [...] Kirkus Reviews remarked that it was [...] "well-written but with the feel of a magazine article masquerading as a book." [...] In September 2016, Owumi wrote the fictional thriller The Fire Raven: Volume 1 about a female assassin trying to discover her past. The book received a positive review from thereadercomplex, who recommended it to readers who like [...] "very fast paced stories with a lot of plot twists happening." [...] In April 2017, he released the sequel The Fire Raven: Welcome To Winter: Volume 2.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the first}} Saturn titles, the game was highly {{anticipated}} by journalists after its appearance in promotional material. A reviewer for Next Generation said the game [...] "orchestrates <b>incredible</b> <b>story</b> animation with brilliant, 3D flight graphics to create what is, basically, the ultimate evolution of Space Harrier." [...] He also highly praised the gameplay, particularly the variety of enemies, the difficulty slope, and the controls. Ed Semrad and Danyon Carpenter from Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the game for its [...] "innovative game play" [...] and its [...] "awe-inspiring visuals" [...] from the opening cinematic to the backgrounds and the dragon's animations. Al Manuel and Ken Williams criticized the game's lack of diversity in weapons and its predetermined progression; but the four EGM reviewers agreed that it was a must-have game for Saturn owners. Similarly, The Unknown Gamer from GamePro called the game a [...] "masterpiece", highlighted its high-quality graphics and music, and described the story as [...] "captivat". However, the journalist noted the game's overall difficulty [...] "will single out all but advanced players" [...] with its lack of power-ups or extra lives of any kind. Nevertheless, the game was seen as {{a good example of the}} Saturn's capabilities. In contrast, a reviewer from Maximum said that the game was much too easy even on the highest difficulty setting, greatly reducing its already low longevity. He also said the gameplay would be too simplistic for many players, with its on-rails shooting and selection of only two weapons, but was overall very positive in his assessment of the game, highly praising the 360 degrees of rotation and most especially the textured 3D graphics of the enemies, settings, and bosses.|$|E

2500|$|In 1690 Sigüenza {{published}} a pirate captivity narrative {{which has been}} considered Latin America's first novel, Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez. However, new archival evidence discovered by Fabio López Lázaro (2007, 2011), [...] (2009, 2011), and A. Margarita Peraza-Rugeley (2013) proves that this <b>incredible</b> <b>story</b> of a Puerto Rican taken captive by English pirates off the Philippine Islands is a historical account, not a fictional one. The archival documents contain dozens of eyewitness accounts corroborating not only the existence of Ramírez, his marriage in Mexico City, and also his capture in 1687, his life with pirates (most notably William Dampier), his collaboration with them, and his return to Mexico in 1690, at which time Spanish colonial authorities suspected Alonso of piracy. López Lázaro {{was the first to}} discover archival evidence (published in 2007) for the historical existence of Ramírez, his meeting with the Viceroy of New Spain, and the writing of Los infortunios in 1690. Buscaglia corroborated the existence of Alonso Ramírez as a true historical figure in 2009, citing his marriage certificate and pinpointing with exactitude, after two expeditions to the coast of Bacalar, the site of his shipwreck. López Lázaro's and Buscaglia's studies are the most significant findings in more than a century of scholarship on the book. The new archival evidence leaves no room to doubt that Sigüenza's key role in creating Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez was in editing Alonso's coarse narrative into a superior literary piece. According to López Lázaro's analysis, the book was commissioned by the Spanish administration during the war against Louis XIV to solidify Madrid's commitment to the struggle against French colonial rivals and their buccaneer collaborators but also to warn them about Spain's unreliable English and Dutch allies.|$|E
