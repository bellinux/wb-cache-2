25|$|Vaidyanathan got {{the story}} idea when <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} debate in a television channel in the United States. He originally wrote the screenplay in Tamil and English, it was translated into Malayalam by Ajayan Venugopalan in 2013, the same year the film was announced, he converted it into a Malayali context. Principal photography commenced during mid-April 2014 in Kollam, Kerala.

25|$|After {{travelling}} through France, {{he settled}} in Italy in 1666 - at first as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua {{and then in}} Florence as in-house physician of Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando II de' Medici, who supported arts and science and whom Steno had met in Pisa. Steno was invited {{to live in the}} Palazzo Vecchio; in return he had to gather a cabinet of curiosities. Steno went to Rome and met Pope Alexander VII and Marcello Malpighi, whom he admired. On his way back <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> Corpus Christi procession in Livorno and wondered if he had the right belief. In Florence Steno focused on the muscular system and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steno proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.|$|E
500|$|On 6 September Moon and Walter-Lax were {{guests of}} Paul and Linda McCartney at {{a preview of}} the film, The Buddy Holly Story. After dining with the McCartneys at Peppermint Park in Covent Garden, Moon and Walter-Lax {{returned}} to their flat. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> film (The Abominable Dr. Phibes), and asked Walter-Lax to cook him steak and eggs. When she objected, Moon replied, [...] "If you don't like it, you can fuck off!" [...] These were his last words. Moon then took 32 clomethiazole tablets.

500|$|Convinced that he {{was himself}} a genius, Balzac used Louis Lambert to explore the {{difficulty}} of geniuses in society, {{as well as their}} frequent progression into madness. He had been troubled greatly when, at Vendôme, <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> schoolmate's mental condition deteriorate severely. Lambert's madness is represented most vividly in his attempt at self-castration, followed by years spent in a catatonic state. This transformation is in many ways a byproduct of his genius; because his brilliance is condemned by teachers and incompatible with the society of the other children, Lambert finds himself rejected by the world. He finds no more success in Paris, where he is led to [...] "eat my heart out in misery". He becomes a vegetable, removed from the physical world entirely.|$|E
2500|$|Parry held German {{music and}} its traditions {{to be the}} {{pinnacle}} of music, and {{was a friend of}} German culture in general. He was, accordingly, certain that Britain and Germany would never go to war against each other, and was in despair when World War I broke out. In the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: [...] "During the war <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> life's work of progress and education being wiped away as the male population, particularly the new fertile generation of composing talent—of the Royal College, dwindled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wong is wary {{of sharing}} his {{favourite}} directors, but {{has stated that}} <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> range of films growing up – from Hong Kong genre films to European art films. They were never labelled as such, and so he approached them equally and was broadly influenced. The energy of the Hong Kong films had a [...] "tremendous" [...] impact according to Brunette, {{while some of the}} international names associated with Wong include Martin Scorsese, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alfred Hitchcock, and Bernardo Bertolucci. Some of his favorite contemporary filmmakers include Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino. He is often compared with French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard. Wong's most direct influence was his colleague Patrick Tam, who was an important mentor and likely inspired his use of colour.|$|E

2500|$|Following some {{unconfirmed}} reports, Mohanlal officially announced {{about the}} film in February 2013. The film {{was said to be}} in a comedy genre and Tamil film director Arun Vaidyanathan said to be the director, making his debut in Malayalam cinema. Vaidyanathan got the idea for the script during his stay in the United States, when <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> debate between two political leaders on television: [...] "It was fun and something unheard of in India. I thought that would make an interesting script". According to Vaidyanathan, Peruchazhi is an original script, although the kind of humour used in the film was influenced by Cho Ramaswamy's 1971 Tamil political satire, Muhammad bin Tughluq, which he consider as still relevant and ahead of its time.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Paul VI {{left the}} Vatican {{to go to}} the papal summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, on 14 July 1978, visiting on the way the tomb of Cardinal Giuseppe Pizzardo, who had {{introduced}} him to the Vatican half a century earlier. Although he was sick, he agreed to see the new Italian President Sandro Pertini for over two hours. In the evening <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> Western on TV, happy only when he saw [...] "horses, the most beautiful animals that God had created." [...] He had breathing problems and needed oxygen. On Sunday, at the Feast of the Transfiguration, he was tired, but wanted to say the Angelus. He was neither able nor permitted to do so and instead stayed in bed, his temperature rising.|$|E

50|$|McConaghy {{named the}} {{organization}} Ratanak, which means 'precious gem' in Khmer, after <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>an</b> 11-month-old Cambodian baby called Ratanak die {{because of a}} basic lack of medical aid in John Pilger's documentary film Cambodia Year Ten.

When the man left in a boat, Blacky slowly flew over the rushes where the man had thrown the corn, and presently his sharp eyes made a discovery that caused him to exclaim right out.|$|E
60|$|Neale strolled {{through the}} town from end to end, and across the {{railroad}} outside the limits, to a high bank, where he sat down.

Near at hand it seemed drab and bare. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> long train of flat and box cars come in, and saw that every car swarmed with soldiers and laborers. The train discharged its load of thousands, and steamed back for more.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed at}} him silently and their eyes met. Decidedly Peter, Baron de Grost, {{found it hard to}} break away from his old weakness!
