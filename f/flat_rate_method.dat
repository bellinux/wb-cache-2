5000|$|They {{are easy}} to {{calculate}} and track: Flat interest rates require no calculations to blend principal and interest into a level payment and, as long as these are made on time, require no compounding calculations (see the example to the right). Flat rates keep loan commitments clear, transparent and easily tracked by both parties. Many microfinance institutions do not have computers, so the complexity of true, declining balance calculations may confuse their borrowers and even their staff. Semi-formal institutions like self-help groups, village banks and ASCAs also usually prefer the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background The Swiss Medical Society {{wants to}} control {{eventual}} {{negative effects of}} hospital care quality {{before and after the}} introduction of <b>flat</b> <b>rates</b> in 2012. <b>Method</b> We describe a method based upon well known observation methods using sentinels, day census and the application of findings on an audit method that incorporates both objective appropriateness criteria and subjective judgements. This methodology is termed sentinel census and is applied to patients hospitalized for coronary interventions, namely coronary revascularizations using either catheter based techniques or surgery. Results We expect a 10 % reduction of appropriate indications and a sound hypothesis generation process based upon mortality audits. Based upon on our sample size calculations, annual observations in 300 patients is necessary in order to catch significant differences in the level of appropriateness. Conclusions We propose a national monitoring effort, which is based upon a sentinel-census methodology. We believe that this kind of monitoring is rapidly implementable at a relatively low cost and with the possibility of generation of statistically in clinically meaningful results with a high probability of feasibility and ethical responsiveness...|$|R

3000|$|We {{find that}} cost cap tariffs {{should never be}} chosen over {{pay-per-use}} or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans if consumers are certain about their preferences and consequently in their demand. In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff). The main research questions that are addressed are (1) under which conditions are cost cap tariffs potentially chosen (over pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates)?</b> and (2) what {{is the impact of}} demand uncertainty on tariff choice?

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to give insights into the production, income and environmental effects of the introduction of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> for Dutch agriculture that is lower than the present average direct income payment. For this purpose, a detailed agri-environmental programming model for Dutch agriculture is used. Results of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario are compared to a reference scenario comparing agricultural production in the Netherlands in 2020 in a situation without a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> Results show that total gross margin in Dutch agriculture decreases because of the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> with 7 %. The supply of starch potatoes and cow milk decreases most. Production of seed and consumption potatoes, vegetables and intensive livestock products increases slightly. This is largely due to a shift of farm payments from milk and starch potatoes production to arable crops and vegetable production. It was found that including risk aversion of income volatility amplifies these effects. In the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario total emissions of nutrients from agricultural production to the environment decreases...|$|R

We create a Bertrand duopoly game model with different pricing schemes: One ISP with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> pricing for its QoS service and the other ISP with two part tariff, a combined pricing scheme with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> and usage-sensitive pricing. Based on industry survey data, we conduct a simulation of a random number generation method for consumer demand and Internet access hours. Then, we find an equilibrium point of pricing strategy where an ISP with <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> pricing has higher profit than an ISP with a two-part tariff. Finally, we present an analytical framework for the future QoS Internet pricing strategy. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} firm pricing and consumer choice, where consumers are loss averse and uncertain about their future demand. Possibly, consumers in our model prefer a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> to a measured tariff, even though this choice does not minimize their expected billing amount - a behavior in line with ample empirical evidence. We solve for the profit-maximizing two-part tariff, which is a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> if (a) marginal costs are not too high, (b) loss aversion is intense, and (c) there are strong variations in demand. Moreover, we analyze the optimal nonlinear tariff. This tariff has a large flat part when a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> is optimal among the class of two-part tariffs...|$|R
