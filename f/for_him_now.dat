5|$|The {{next day}} is Troy's {{memorial}} {{service and the}} wedding of Mayor Michael Ebbs (Ralph Fiennes) to Charlie Bratley's mother Terri (Rita Wilson). Lou finally realizes that his son actually has been kidnapped and heads out to look <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Now</b> at Lee's house, Crystal asks Lee to help stop the kidnapping scheme, {{but he does not}} comply. Crystal goes to Dean's house for help, where she finds him hallucinating about Troy's death and finally expressing his grief. Meanwhile, a paranoid Lee, encouraged by Billy, tries to kill Charlie Bratley to avoid being caught, but Charlie fights back and slices the knife through Billy's eye.

25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Now</b> suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E
500|$|Years later, {{reflecting}} on his tenure with the Royals, Affeldt said, [...] "I was pretty frustrated. I wanted to quit. I didn't {{want to go}} to the ballpark. I was just failing a lot.

[...] At the trade deadline on July 31, Affeldt was traded along with Denny Bautista to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann. [...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I need to give you a fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.'

I'm very thankful for it." ...|$|E

60|$|Soames! He {{had kept}} that name {{out of his}} {{thoughts}} these last two years; conscious that it was bad <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> And, <b>now,</b> his heart moved in a disconcerting manner, {{as if it had}} side-slipped within his chest.|$|R
