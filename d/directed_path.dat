5|$|Two {{vertices}} in a {{directed graph}} {{are said to}} be strongly connected to each other if there is a <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> {{from one to the other}} and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.|$|E

3000|$|Remark [...]. Note {{the above}} method {{performs}} well in dense multipath environments, especially in non-line-of-sight conditions[2, 38 – 41], where {{the strength of}} <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> is {{significantly lower than the}} LPs. However, in the presence of line-of-sight propagation (strong <b>direct</b> <b>path),</b> the strength of the <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> can be strong w.r.t. the LPs. In this case, the signal component of the <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> may also be mitigated during the multipath interference cancelation stage. We therefore propose the following algorithm to adapt the proposed method to the dynamic wireless propagation environments, ranging from non-line-of-sight condition to line-of-sight condition.|$|R

25|$|Every <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> graph with an {{even number}} of {{vertices}} is skew-symmetric, via a symmetry that swaps the two ends of the path.

25|$|The {{visualization}} of orders with Hasse diagrams has a straightforward generalization: instead of displaying lesser elements below greater ones, {{the direction of}} the order can also be depicted by giving directions to the edges of a graph. In this way, each order is seen to be equivalent to a directed acyclic graph, where the nodes are the elements of the poset and there is a <b>directed</b> <b>path</b> from a to b if and only if a ≤ b. Dropping the requirement of being acyclic, one can also obtain all preorders.|$|E

30|$|The {{usefulness}} of the effective CFR obtained by (16) may be noted as follows. Thus far, we have assumed that the <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> exists and all paths also have distinctive delays. However, paths can actually have indistinguishable delays. Then, a problem could arise when some scattered paths of considerable amplitudes have delays close to the delay of the <b>direct</b> <b>path,</b> while they also have AOAs considerably {{different from that of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>path.</b> In this case, the effective CFR will possibly contain also the AOA information of the scattered paths that can degrade the location estimation of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm requires significant scattered paths with delays close to the delay of the <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> to also have AOAs close to the AOA of the <b>direct</b> <b>path.</b> This could be realistic if the placement of the AP antenna array is not close to any significant reflective materials. Such placement also seems to be a good practice for other AOA-based localization systems.|$|R

30|$|Recent {{development}} in wireless communication-based positioning technology brings significant challenge of detecting the weak signal component arriving from the <b>direct</b> propagation <b>path</b> for time-of-arrival (TOA)-based approach. Due {{to the common}} obstruction of the <b>direct</b> propagation <b>path</b> in dense multipath environments, identification of the weak <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> in these environments can be very difficult via the classical correlation-based estimator {{in the presence of}} interference from significant later arriving multipath components. A new <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> detection scheme using the multipath interference cancelation is presented in this article. For data communication purpose, an iterative estimator with improved accuracy for joint channel and data estimation is first developed; based on which, the interference of multipath components are reconstructed and subtracted from the original received signal. With the aid of the detected data, an enhanced preamble is formulated. The accuracy of <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> detection is substantially improved by using the correlation between the multipath interference-suppressed signal and the enhanced preamble. Semi-analytical expression of the performance of the iterative estimator is derived. The analysis enables the system to determine an automatic stopping criterion to reduce the computational complexity of the iterative process. The performance of the <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> detection is also analyzed in terms of the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and compared with that of the conventional approach. Computer simulation results show the superiority of the proposed <b>direct</b> <b>path</b> detection. The accuracy of the positioning system using the proposed method is also evaluated in dense multipath environments.|$|R
