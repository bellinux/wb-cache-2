40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} demand for PCS {{has provided the}} impetus to design adaptive antenna arrays to improve spectral efficiency and enhance system capacity. With increasing data rate in some PCS application like DECT(Digital <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telecommunications),</b> higher BER would degrade the system performance further. An adaptive antenna array testbed using 12 elements was built to evaluate its performance on high data rate mobile communications in an indoor environment for DECT applications. The simultaneous data sampling rate on the elements is about 3. 5 MHz. A system design of the adaptive array using digital beamforming for off-line processing is presented.

40|$|Pyramid coding with {{absolute}} moment block truncation coding (PC-AMBTC) technique is proposed for wireless image communication. The <b>digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>cordless</b> <b>telecommunications</b> (DECT) system {{is used as}} wireless communication environment. The impact of Channel fading on the PC-AMBTC technique is investigated and its performance is compared with other algorithms. The image is decomposed into two images (decimated image and the difference image). The AMBTC {{is used for the}} decimated image and a modified geometric vector quantization (MGVQ) is used for the difference image. Since most of the signal power and information is located in the Iow frequency band of the image, special attention is given to this band to protect its information from Channel fading errors. Simulation results show that the proposed technique is very robust to Channel fading erTors. It is found that the performance of PC-AMBTC algorithm is better than the existing algorithms at the same bit rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It is {{anticipated}} {{that there will}} shortly be a requirement for multimedia terminals that operate via mobile communications systems. This paper presents a functional specification for such a terminal operating at 32 kb/s in a <b>digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>cordless</b> <b>telecommunications</b> (DECT) and universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) radio network. A terminal has been built, based on a PC with digital signal processor (DSP) boards for audio and video coding and decoding. Speech coding is by a phonetically driven code-excited linear prediction (CELP) speech coder and video coding by a block-oriented hybrid discrete cosine transform (DCT) coder. Separate channel coding is provided for the audio and video data. The paper describes the techniques used for audio and video coding, channel coding, and synchronization. Methods of subjective testing in a DECT network and in a UMTS network are also described. These consisted of subjective tests of first impressions of the mobile audio–visual terminal (MAVT) quality, interactive tests, and the completion of an exit questionnaire. The test {{results showed that the}} quality of the audio was sufficiently good for comprehension and the video was sufficiently good for following and repeating simple mechanical tasks. However, the quality of the MAVT was not good enough for general use where high-quality audio and video was needed, especially when transmission was in a noisy radio environment. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of arbitrarily programmable, but fixed-rate videophone codecs using quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) video sequences scanned at 10 frames/s is offered. In contrast to existing and forthcoming standard schemes, such as the H. 261, H. 263 and MPEG 2. MPEG 4 codecs, which rely on bandwidth-efficient but error-sensitive variable-length coding techniques combined with a complex self-descriptive bitstream structure, the proposed codecs exhibit a more robust, regular bitstream and a constant bitrate. Clearly, their philosophy {{is different from the}} above error-sensitive and variable-rate standard schemes, since these constant-rate codecs were designed to allow direct replacement of mobile radio voice codecs in second generation wireless systems, such as the Pan-European GSM, the American IS- 54 and IS- 95 as well as the Japanese systems, operating at 13, 8, 9. 6 and 6. 7 kbit/s, respectively. This philosophy can, however, be adopted lo higher rate systems, such as the <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> (DECT) and the Universal Mobile Telecommunication system (UMTS). The Type I codecs proposed benefit from invoking sophisticated compression techniques in order to achieve best video quality at a given bitrate. In contrast, the Type 2 schemes introduced maximize the codecs' error- resilience at the cost of slightly reduced video quality under error-Cree conditions. Gain-cost quantized, fixed but arbitrarily programmable rate discrete cosine transformed (DCT) video codecs, vector-quantised (VQI and quad-tree (QT) coded algorithms arc proposed and their video quality. complexity. compression ratio and error resilience trade-offs are comparatively analysed under identical conditions. Finally, our candidate codecs are compared to the standard H 26 I. H. 263 and MPEG 2 benchmark codecs...|$|E

40|$|GMSK is most {{prominent}} standards around the world. Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telephone (DECT), Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD), Digital communications {{system in the}} 1800 MHz band (DCS 1800 in Europe), Personal communications services in the 1900 MHz band (PCS 1900) in U. S., all use GMSK as their modulation format. The reason GMSK is used for GSM is its High spectral efficiency, MSK uses phase variation for modulation so better immune to noise. Non linear amplifiers are used to give better response and consumes less power so low battery usage which is an important parameter in cellular technologies. Gaussian Minimum Shift keying modulation scheme is a derivative of MSK. In GMSK, the side lobe levels of the spectrum introduced in MSK are further reduced by passing the modulating NRZ data waveform through a pre modulation Gaussian pulse-shaping filter. ISI degrade the performance of GMSK. In this paper we suggested the methods for reduction in the ISI. GMSK performance is improved by using optimum filters, Viterbi-adaptive equalization and soft decision Viterbi decoding...|$|R
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telecommunication (DECT), as a {{standard}} for cordless indoor wireless communication in Europe, is widely used in hospitals, offices and factories. But its performance can be constrained by channel dispersion, and this can limit the use of DECT system in reflective environments. In this master thesis project, non-coherent equalization schemes are investigated. Different equalization algorithms are simulated in Matlab and a least mean square (LMS) algorithm based baseband equalizer is implemented in a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA). But this method is proved insufficient to solve the severe multipath fading problem. Another type of equalizer called passband equalizer is stated afterwards, and a required bit error rate (BER) can be achieved in multipath fading channels up to 500 ns delay spread. This project includes both simulation and hardware implementation. In this thesis, simulations of two types of equalization methods (LMS baseband and passband equalizer) and implementation of the LMS baseband equalizer in FPGA are introduced. The challenge of future work and its possible refinement are also analyzed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, low-IF {{receiver}} {{planning for}} <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telephone (DECT) systems operating around 1. 9 GHz is described. A low-IF receiver architecture is chosen, since it allows {{a high degree}} of integration. Unlike zero-IF receivers, this architecture does not have a DCoffset or self-reception problem. The main features of the DECT system are presented, including the translation from the DECT system specification to RF circuit specification. Analytical expressions are presented for the noise figure (F) and the third order intercept point (IIP 3) of a multi-stage two-path system, which are verified by simulation. These calculations are important for the low-IF receiver planning, since it has an in-phase and a quadrature branch. In order to incorporate the A/D-converter in the receiver planning calculations, a formula is derived which translates the Integral Nonlinearity (INL) of an A/D-converter to the IIP 3 definition. In addition, the optimum IF frequency and selectivity distribution is considered, taking the A/D-converter requirements into account. A detailed description of receiver planning is given applied to the DECT system but the approach is suitable for other standards as well...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of a multi-standard, high image-reject front-end is presented. The front-end {{is designed to be}} used for <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telephone (DECT) systems and wireless communications systems, which oper-ate in the 2 4 GHz Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band (like Bluetooth). A double-quadrature low-IF architecture is chosen, because it can provide a high image rejection ra-tio (IRR) and a flexibility in terms of different systems. In the selected architecture, an RC polyphase filter is applied as an RF I/Q generator. Building block specifications are optimized in order to achieve two goals: a high IRR and a high sensitivity of the receiver. Assuming a mismatch of 1 % between the elements of the RC polyphase filter and 2 phase mismatch in the local oscillator path, a simulated IRR of 63 dB is obtained in the frequency range 1 8 2 5 GHz. In {{spite of the fact that}} the RC polyphase filter deteriorates the front-end noise figure (NF), a NF of 6 dB and a sensitiv-ity of 93 dBm for the DECT receiver has been achieved. 1...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic channel {{allocation}} in cellular {{networks have}} become very popular due to the flexibility obtained by using any of the available channels in any cell {{as long as the}} interference level is below a given threshold. Distributed resource allocation is popular in modern day cellular systems due to the increase in micro-cells and picocells. In our problem we study cellular networks, under distributed dynamic channel allocation and propose a two dimensional Markov chain model to analyze the performance of the system in terms of blocking probabilities. In our analysis, we consider all the mobiles and base stations to be perfectly power controlled, i. e. each mobile (base station) transmits on any channel, such that the signal strength received at its corresponding base station (mobile) is unity irrespective of the actual position of the mobile in the cell. We perform this analysis for a linear highway system and a two dimensional cellular system modelling the shape of the cells to be perfect circles. We look at low mobility systems in our problem. In practice, <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telephony (DECT) is a standard to which our analysis is applicable.

40|$|The intelligent, adaptively {{reconfigurable}} wireless {{systems of}} the near future require programmable source codecs in order to optimally configure the transceiver to adapt to time-variant channel and traffic conditions. Hence we developed a programmable 8 - 16 kbits/s low-delay speech codec, which {{is compatible with the}} G 728 16 kbits/s ITU codec [1] at its top rate and offers a graceful trade-off between speech quality and bit rate in the range 816 kbits/s. The issues of robustness against channel errors strongly influenced the algorithmic design of the 8 - 16 kbits/s speech codec, and hence special attention is devoted to these issues. Source-matched Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codecs combined with un-equal protection pilot-assisted 4 - and 16 -level quadrature amplitude modulation (4 -QAM, 16 -QAM) are employed in order to transmit both the 8 and the 16 kbits/s coded speech bits at a signalling rate of 10. 4 kBd. In a bandwidth of 1728 kHz, which is used by the <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telephone (DECT) system 55 duplex or 110 simplex time slots can be created. Good toll quality speech is delivered in an equivalent bandwidth of 15. 71 kHz, if the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are in excess of about 18 and 26 dB for the lower and higher speech quality 4 -QAM and 16 -QAM modes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} has been {{the development of a}} low power, radio frequency transmitter architecture. Specifically, a technique for in service automatic calibration of a modulated phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer has been developed. Phase/frequency modulation is accomplished by modulating the feedback divide value in a phase locked loop frequency synthesizer. A digital precompensation filter is used to extend the modulation bandwidth by canceling the low-pass transfer function of the PLL. The automatic calibration circuit maintains accurate matching between the digital precompensation filter and the analog PLL transfer function across process and temperature variations. The automatic calibration circuit, which is the main contribution of this thesis, operates while the transmitter is in service. This online calibration eliminates the need for production calibration and periodic down time for calibration cycles. (cont.) In addition the calibration circuitry provides greater accuracy in the modulation than what is possible via offline methods of calibration. The calibration circuit works with M-ary GFSK as well as 2 level GFSK. The automatic calibration circuit has been implemented in two forms to prove its operation. The first version is a circuit board level implementation with a center frequency of around 60 MHz. The second implementation of the system is in a full custom 0. 6,Lm BiCMOS integrated circuit. The integrated circuit contains the complete synthesizer with automatic calibration and operates in the 1. 88 GHz frequency band used by the <b>Digital</b> <b>European</b> <b>Cordless</b> Telephone (DECT) standard. A data rate of 2. 5 Mbps using 2 level GFSK and 5. 0 Mbps using 4 level GFSK has been achieved with a power consumption of 78 mW. by Daniel R. McMahill. Thesis (Ph. D.)
