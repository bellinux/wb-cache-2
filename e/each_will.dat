5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter <b>each</b> <b>will</b> make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E

25|$|The league {{introduced}} the relegation {{system from the}} 2012 season. According to new relegation rule, 2 teams <b>each</b> <b>will</b> be relegated to lower level league based on the standing of 2012 and 2013 season, respectively (total: 4 teams). The league also changed the amount of entrance fee from 1 billion to 500 million Korean won.|$|E
25|$|The {{finished}} scoring matrix {{is shown}} below on the left. The blue color shows the highest score. Note that an element can receive score {{from more than}} one element, <b>each</b> <b>will</b> form a different path if this element is traced back. In case of multiple highest scores, traceback should be done starting with each highest score. The traceback process is shown below on the right. The best local alignment is generated in the reverse direction.|$|E

25|$|The Aspen Dental Eldora Dirt Derby has {{a unique}} {{qualifying}} format. Each truck will take two timed laps, with the faster lap counting as that truck's official time. The trucks are {{assigned to one of}} five heat races where the top five trucks from <b>each</b> <b>will</b> advance to the feature. Those that fail to qualify will have one last chance race, where the top two trucks will also advance. Provisionals will be determined after the last chance race.|$|E
25|$|It {{also shows}} a special {{concern for the}} poor, for widows and the fatherless: all Israelites are {{brothers}} and sisters, and <b>each</b> <b>will</b> answer to God for his treatment of his neighbor. This concern for equality and humanity extends also to the stranger who lives among the Israelites. The stranger is often mentioned {{in tandem with the}} concern for the widow and the orphan. Furthermore, there is a specific commandment to love the stranger.|$|E
50|$|The top team in <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> {{qualify for}} the semi-finals. The runner up in <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> play off with the winner {{qualifying}} for the semi-final.|$|R

25|$|Tomkinson dispatches {{a common}} atheist objection. He agrees {{it is common}} sense that {{everything}} which has a beginning {{is likely to have}} an end, too. But it does not follow from this that humans are merely transient beings. Adam was formed from earth and water, 'elements' which the Muggletonians say have existed for all eternity. Thus, humans will be capable of being resurrected as bodies in a glorified condition at world's end. Then, <b>each</b> <b>will</b> have a full understanding of paradise which can only be partially glimpsed now as inner peace and bliss.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{relationship}} between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in heaven into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and <b>each</b> <b>will</b> be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in the {{quantification}} of damages generally {{and/or the}} partitioning of damages between {{two or more}} defendants, {{the extent of the}} liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not {{have had the opportunity to}} make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, <b>each</b> <b>will</b> be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.|$|E
50|$|Senior A {{consists}} of 12 teams {{divided into two}} groups of 6. The top 2 teams from <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> automatically qualify for the quarter finals. The 3rd and 4th teams from <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> play in preliminary quarter finals. The bottom two teams from <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> cross play with the losers playing in the Senior B competition in 2017.|$|R
50|$|The league {{consists}} of 2 groups each of 11 clubs. Al Ahly tops the first group, and Zamalek tops the second. The first two teams of <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> {{advance to the}} competition playoff, while the ninth team of <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> advance to the relegation play-off. The last two teams of <b>each</b> group <b>will</b> be relegated directly to the Egyptian Second Division.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{disbanding}} of Kochi Tuskers Kerala, <b>each</b> team <b>will</b> {{play the}} remaining eight teams twice, once {{at home and}} once away. Therefore, <b>each</b> team <b>will</b> play 16 matches.|$|R
25|$|Since shared {{libraries}} on most {{systems do}} not change often, systems can compute a likely load address for each shared library on the system before it is needed, and store that information in the libraries and executables. If every shared library that is loaded has undergone this process, then <b>each</b> <b>will</b> load at its predetermined address, which speeds up the process of dynamic linking. This optimization is known as prebinding in macOS and prelinking in Linux. Disadvantages of this technique include {{the time required to}} precompute these addresses every time the shared libraries change, the inability to use address space layout randomization, and the requirement of sufficient virtual address space for use (a problem that will be alleviated by the adoption of 64-bit architectures, {{at least for the time}} being).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Hortensio has {{married a}} rich widow. In {{the final scene}} of the play there are three newly married couples; Bianca and Lucentio, the widow and Hortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that Petruchio {{is married to a}} shrew, a good-natured quarrel breaks out amongst the three men about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager whereby <b>each</b> <b>will</b> send a servant to call for their wives, and {{whichever}} comes most obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina {{is the only one of}} the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. She then hauls the other two wives into the room, giving a speech on why wives should always obey their husbands. The play ends with Baptista, Hortensio and Lucentio marvelling at how successfully Petruchio has tamed the shrew.|$|E
25|$|Iarnród Éireann's {{plans are}} also on the {{pipeline}} to greatly expand the DART suburban railway network by boring a tunnel through Dublin City Centre allowing the creation of two separate DART lines. <b>Each</b> <b>will</b> run from the North-West & South-West of the city, through the city centre and then extend south and north respectively. This plan is made possible with the DART Underground rail project, boring a tunnel under the city centre that will join Heuston Station with Pearse Station and a relocated Docklands station, via St Stephen's Green. The railway lines from Heuston towards Kildare (Hazelhatch) and from the city centre to Maynooth will be electrified, and the old line to Navan reopened and electrified. This will allow the creation of two separate but inter-connecting DART lines: one running from the north west (Dunboyne/Maynooth) through the city-centre to the southeast (Bray/Greystones); and one running from south-west (Hazelhatch) through the city centre to the northeast (Howth/Balbriggan).|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated. Supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in number–the Energy Star label, for example, now appears on 11,000 different companies' models in 38 product categories, from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes. However, despite {{the growth in}} the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products. Shel Horowitz, a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of Guerrilla marketing Goes Green [...] states that to market effectively, green businesses need to market to three different audiences, [...] "deep green," [...] "lazy green," [...] and [...] "nongreen", and that each must be approached differently. <b>Each</b> <b>will</b> have different trigger points that will move them to buy, and for the nongreen audience, marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{antagonist}} {{is named}} Maxwell. Maxwell {{is described as}} a puppet master who is [...] "dapper" [...] and [...] "frail" [...] in stature. He is part-demon and transforms incrementally as his anger at the player increases over the five chapters of Adventure. He is the final unlockable character, obtained after completion of the story rather than with experience points. The character version of Maxwell starts with a Dark Sword, Night Armor, Purple Gem, 4 Nightmare Fuel and the Codex Umbra, a book that when activated, costing 2 Nightmare Fuel, depletes 15 health, lowers maximum sanity by 55, and spawns a shadow clone of himself that aids him in battle, mining and wood chopping. The Shadow Puppet has 75 health and deals 40 damage with each attack. When it dies, it disappears and returns Maxwell's lost maximum of sanity. A maximum of 3 puppets can be spawned at once, and <b>each</b> <b>will</b> disappear 2.5 days after it is spawned.|$|E
500|$|The Earth and its Moon are {{one example}} of this configuration. Today, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth; one of its {{revolutions}} around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. In about 50billion years, if they survive the Sun's expansion, the Earth and Moon will become tidally locked to each other; <b>each</b> <b>will</b> {{be caught up in}} what is called a [...] "spin–orbit resonance" [...] in which the Moon will circle the Earth in about 47 days and both Moon and Earth will rotate around their axes in the same time, each only visible from one hemisphere of the other. Other examples are the Galilean moons of Jupiter (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons) and most of the larger moons of Saturn.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{disbanding}} of Kochi Tuskers Kerala, <b>each</b> team <b>will</b> {{play the}} remaining eight teams twice, once {{at home and}} once away. Therefore, <b>each</b> team <b>will</b> play an extended season of 16 matches.|$|R
