40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>farming</b> has, {{in recent}} decades, become a growing area of enquiry for social scientists. Post 1980 globally, and in New Zealand, {{research}} {{focused on a}} perceived rural crisis, which was characterised by the withdrawal of state subsidies and the exposure of the family farmer to the free market. Many began to question whether the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> would survive. The future of the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> is a contentious topic, with theories of its impending demise or survival {{at the forefront of}} debate. However, in recent literature there is a recognition that a focus on solely structural change is not enough. This study is a response to the recognition that an understanding of the subjective aspects of <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> is required. Taking a small cohort of retired Manawatu farmers this study provides an insight into the subjective dimensions of <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> and the social construction of 'farmer identity'. The participant's accounts are contextualised by a consideration of both regional and national historical processes that have shaped and continue to shape, <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> practice and farmer identity. The study suggests that accounts which conceptualise 'family' farming as either oppositional or outside of a capitalist system of production are inappropriate in the New Zealand context; ignore the intimate relation between <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> and the capitalist system; which represents a tendency to rely on common sense assumptions {{about the nature of the}} <b>family</b> and <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> with no empirical justification. These accounts are typically ahistorical. This study reveals that in taking into account the historical underpinnings of the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> in the Manawatu and New Zealand more generally, and by focusing on the subjective aspects of what it means to be a farmer engaged in <b>family</b> <b>farming,</b> it is possible to understand the relation between capitalism and <b>family</b> <b>farming...</b>|$|R

40|$|The central {{argument}} of the thesis {{is that as}} the dominant economic and social structure in advanced industrialized agriculture, the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business is central to enabling change in rural Australia. A deep understanding of the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business — its components and their interactions — is critical to designing mechanisms for enabling change in Australian agriculture. The process of enabling change needs {{to address the needs}} of the right people, at the right time. A service brokering model — which incorporates this approach — is proposed as an alternative to the current 'product-push' model of extension in Australia. The thesis is presented as a series of selected research papers, published over several years, and which have a common proposition: that understanding the social dynamics of the <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business is core to enabling change in Australian agriculture. In addition to a general introduction to enabling change in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses, the papers address the following topics: • Identification of the characteristics of <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses as the dominant structural unit in Australian agriculture (Paper I) • A review of the role and needs of women in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses in Australia (Paper 2) • Research on the role of agribusiness in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> decision making (Paper 3) • An assessment of the barriers to farm diversification in regional Tasmania (Paper 4) • A review of research on agricultural extension, learning and change (Paper 5) • Identification of effective processes for ensuring the content of learning activities for <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses is relevant to their changing needs (Paper 6) • The case for meeting the needs of <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses through training brokerage (Paper 7) Across the papers, a conceptual framework to assist in the design of programmes aimed at enabling change in <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses in Australia is presented. This model conceives <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> business behaviour as the outcome of the interactions between the family, the natural resources which are farmed, and the farm business, all within a broader social, economic and political context. The thesis presents an alternate extension model to the current 'product-push' model. The service broker concept addresses the provision of extension services in agriculture by focusing on the needs of <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses. A case is made for agencies to act as 'brokers' between <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses and the wide range of services available to address their needs. Such an approach, coordinated at a regional level, has the potential to deliver a major breakthrough in the rate of improvement in the sustainability of our <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> businesses, our rural industries and rural and regional Australia...|$|R

Methods: A total of 122 public procurement within rural <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> published electronically by 99 cities from January to September of 2013 were analyzed. The foods were classified in the following groups: grains; roots and tubers; legumes; meat; fish; vegetables; fruits; processed foods; ingredients; and milk. The cities were grouped into quartiles according {{to the number of}} elementary school students. The foods listed in the public procurement within rural <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> were then assessed according to city size. The Kruskal-Wallis test verified the difference between the number of foods in each group and in each quartile (p< 0. 05). Results: Of all the foods, the most common groups in the public procurement within rural <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> were the vegetable and fruit groups, representing 50 and 31 %, respectively. The number of foods in the groups of grains, legumes, and milk in the public procurement within rural <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> increased with the number of students. On the other hand, cities with fewer students acquired more foods from the fruit group, resulting in differences between the quartiles (p< 0. 05).
