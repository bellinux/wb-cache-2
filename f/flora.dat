5|$|Among {{the many}} ways of {{classifying}} plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil <b>flora,</b> remnants of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic <b>flora,</b> which can vary widely across the globe {{due to differences in}} climate and terrain.|$|E
5|$|In their 1914 <b>Flora</b> of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} to {{the tree}} species that was then known as Ficus suffocans, a name that {{had been assigned to}} it in August Grisebach's <b>Flora</b> of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 <b>Flora</b> of Panama. Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name Ficus maxima be conserved in the way DeWolf had used it, a proposal that was accepted by the nomenclatural committee.|$|E
5|$|Many of Stearn's {{collaborative}} works {{used his}} bibliographic skills. While his genus monographs largely concentrated on Mediterranean <b>flora,</b> notably Epimedium, Allium and Paeonia, {{he was also}} the author of species articles both popular and technical {{as well as a number}} of classical treatises. In addition he produced floristic treatments of a number of regions such as Jamaica and Nepal. He also contributed to many national Florae as diverse as Bhutan and Greece, as well as major regional Florae including the <b>Flora</b> Europaea and European Garden <b>Flora.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally Aristotle divided {{all living}} things between plants, which {{generally}} do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, {{it has become clear}} that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in <b>flora,</b> and some classifications use the term bacterial <b>flora</b> separately from plant <b>flora.</b>|$|E

40|$|The floristic peculiarities {{and species}} {{diversity}} of local <b>floras</b> of different territories of Europe have been shown. Basing {{on our own}} and literature data, we have analysed the degree of similarity of different <b>floras</b> of the technogenous territories along a wide geographical gradient: from the coal mine dumps in Great Britain to ash dumps and areas of plants in the Ural Region. Within {{the areas of the}} metallurgical plants, factories producing non ferrous metals, coal mines, chemical and coke-chemical enterprises, concentrating mills, mine dumps, ash dumps, bread-making plants, mercurial and flux-dolomite dumps, an overall number of 880 species was analysed by their presence/ absence within the areas investigated. Using the principal components and cluster analysis, we have noted a significant zonal influence of local <b>floras</b> on formation of the <b>floras</b> in industrial ecotopes of the different geographic areas of Europe. On a scatterplot a few geographically close groups of technogenous <b>floras</b> are distinguishable: “Western European”, “Ukrainian”, those of “Moscow Region”, “Ural Region” <b>floras.</b> Besides that we have distinguished a group of <b>floras</b> formed due to the determining influence of a complex of specific ecological factors in the Ukrainian south-east...|$|R

5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and <b>Flora.</b> However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and <b>Flora,</b> having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and <b>Flora</b> to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and <b>Flora</b> says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and <b>Flora</b> away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E

40|$|Unusual fossil macrofloras from South America (Peru, Bolivia, Brazil), Africa (Niger), India, and Australia are {{distinctly}} different {{from both the}} Early and Late Carboniferous <b>floras</b> of Gondwana. These <b>floras</b> can be correlated with each other based on macrofloral and palynologic composition, and dated as Late Visean to earliest Serpukhovian through palynologic data from several <b>floras</b> and isotopic data from Australia. The <b>floras</b> are dominated by pteridosperm foliage and characterized by the occurrence of tree-lycopsids, and represent a warm-temperate, frost-free floral belt in Gondwana that reached from 30 8 to as far as 60 8 South that existed directly {{before the onset of}} the major episode of the Carboniferous glaciation. The plants lived during an interval of very warm climate as indicated by the width and extent of the floral belt, conditions that facilitated the migration of plants into this area {{from other parts of the}} globe.
