40|$|Abstract. The BTA (Boring and Trepanning Association) {{deep hole}} {{drilling}} process is commonly used to machine boreholes with a large drilling depth-to-diameter ratio (l/D) and outstanding workpiece quality. The asymmetric tool design leads to a nonzero radial component of the cutting force and the passive force, which are conducted to the borehole wall by so-called <b>guide</b> <b>pads.</b> These <b>guide</b> <b>pads</b> smooth the borehole wall by a forming process and improve the surface quality. Processes, that machine materials with a high adhesion tendency, such as high alloy stainless steel, suffer from poor surface quality in the borehole and the adhesion from the workpiece material on the <b>guide</b> <b>pads.</b> In this paper modified Diamond-Like-Carbon (DLC) coated <b>guide</b> <b>pads</b> for BTA {{deep hole drilling}} tools are investigated. The scope of the experiments was {{the reduction of the}} adhesion by reducing the friction coefficient of the <b>guide</b> <b>pads,</b> as well as the improvement {{of the quality of the}} borehole wall...|$|E
40|$|Different {{materials}} for <b>guide</b> <b>pads</b> {{have been tested}} in the laboratory scale and in real BTA deep hole drilling experiments concerning their wear behaviour: WC-hard metals, TiC/TiN-cerments, Al_ 2 O_ 3 + ZrO_ 2, Al_ 2 O_ 3 + TiC, Al_ 2 O_ 3 + ZrO_ 2 + TiC, Si_ 3 N_ 4 + sinter additives, polycrystalline boron nitride. Friction in the sliding contact could be reduced by an improved guide pad geometry. Wear mechanisms of pads made from the different materials were studied by EDX. <b>Guide</b> <b>pads</b> made from nitride ceramics exhibit high resistance towards abrasion and crack formation. With Si_ 3 N_ 4 as the guide pad material higher cutting rates can be obtained than with the conventional hard metal pads.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the dynamic and stability characteristics of a guided wood cutting spline arbor circular saw is presented. A multibody dynamic model is developed to consider the idling and cutting characteristics. The model considers {{the interaction between the}} blade, the arbor, and the <b>guide</b> <b>pads.</b> The model is capable of analyzing in-plane and out-of-plane edge forces which enables simulation of the cutting performance of the saw. In order to verify the computer model, an experimental test of a guided spline saw during idling run-up is presented. The frequencies and amplitudes of the blade vibrations are documented and plotted. Cutting tests are also conducted and the cutting forces are estimated. The results of a simulation of the idling response of the blade by the computer model and the experimental results are in a good agreement. Factors that significantly affect the characteristics of guided spline saws during cutting are discussed. The computer model is shown to be capable of predicting stable cutting operations of a guided spline saw...|$|E

40|$|Drilling tools {{with great}} {{cantilever}} {{are used for}} the purpose of deep drilling. Vibrations of the drilling tool caused by changing cutting forces, based on form and position errors of a pilot hole, affects the drilling quality. Within the project IntiBo fundamental mechatronic and control insights on the integration of adaptronic components are being developed by the Fraunhofer IPT exemplified by a drilling tool. Such components contribute {{to the fact that the}} vibrations of the tool and machine structure are compensated, as well as form and position errors in the work piece are minimized. The construction of drilling tool enables the use of different adaptronic positioning systems. An integrated sensor actor system in the top of the drilling tool guarantee a highly dynamic radial drooping of the cutting edge. The surface of the drilling hole can thereby be structured with a maximum drooping frequency of several hundred hertz or a maximum stroke of 130 urn. Form and position errors of the work piece are compensated by three radially adjustable <b>guiding</b> <b>pads,</b> which are positioned with an offset of 120 on the circumference of the drilling tool. A third positioning system at the drilling tool body is used for active vibration damping of the tool structure. Based on an intelligent combination of different sensor actor systems, the precision of the machine tool can be clearly improved in relation to surface quality and geometrical accuracy of the work piece. New control loops for multi variable adaptronic systems, as they are developed within the project IntiBo, are essential for this purpose...|$|R
5000|$|Canning {{received}} a hero's welcome {{on his return}} to Perth, however his cook Edward Blake alleged the party had ill-treated Aboriginals, coerced Aboriginal men to locate water by force feeding them salt, destroyed water holes and kidnapped Aboriginal women for sex. After Premier Newton Moore failed to act on his claims Blake {{took them to the}} newspapers which prompted Moore to call a Royal Commission."It was necessary at times to use chains on our <b>guides</b> but we <b>padded</b> them to make sure they did not chafe the men's necks...they were happy with the arrangement." [...] - Evidence given before the Royal Commission by surveyor Hubert Trotman The Commissioner of police admitted that police were forced to chain the guides due to their unwillingness to join the expedition. The continued chaining was justified {{on the grounds that they}} would have run off jeopardising the expedition. After three weeks of questions and replies the Royal Commission exonerated the expedition members of all charges.|$|R
40|$|Guided splined disks” {{are defined}} as flat thin disks in which the inner radius of the disk is splined and matches a splined arbor that {{provides}} the driving torque for rotating the disk. Lateral constraint for the disk is provided by space fixed <b>guide</b> <b>pads.</b> Experimental lateral displacement of run-up tests of such a system is presented, and the flutter instability zones are identified. The results indicate that flutter instability occurs at speeds when a backward travelling wave of a mode meets a reflected wave of a different mode. Sometimes, the system cannot pass a flutter zone, and transverse vibrations of the disk lock into that flutter instability zone. The governing linear equations of transverse motion of such a spinning disk, with assumed free inner and outer boundary conditions, are derived. A lateral constraint is introduced and modeled as a linear spring. Rigid body translational and tilting degrees of freedom {{are included in the}} analysis of the total motion of the spinning disk. The eigenvalues of the system are computed numerically, and the flutter instability zones are defined. The results show that the mathematical model can predict accurately the flutter instability zones measured in the experimental tests...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{friction}} forces acting at the rotor and pads interface, the pressure distribution at the interface is asymmetric in a disc brake system of normal floatingtype caliper design. The asymmetry {{and the high}} unevenness of the interface pressure distribution cause uneven wear and shorten life of pads. It has been speculated that these undesirable features promote disc brake squeal. This paper investigates the contact (interface) pressure distributions at the rotor and piston-pad interface in response to several ideas of simulated structural (geometric or material) modifications. These modifications are made on the pads and/or at the interface between the piston and the back plate or at the <b>pad</b> <b>guide.</b> A detailed finite element model is constructed taking into account all significant contact interfaces between disc brake components. Sliding frictional contact is analyzed to obtain the interface pressure distributions. A plausible modification is identified which offers improved interface pressure distributions against wear. This work may also help create a good design of disc brakes for improved noise performance as well...|$|R
40|$|Caches {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important with the widening gap between main memory and processor speeds. Small and fast cache memories are designed to bridge this discrepancy. However, they are only effective when programs exhibit sufficient data locality. Performance of memory hierarchy can be improved by means of data and loop transformations. Tiling is a loop transformation that aims at reducing capacity misses by exploiting reuse at {{the lower levels of}} cache. Padding is a data transformation targeted to reduce conflict misses. We present an accurate cost model which makes use of the cache miss equations (CMEs) to <b>guide</b> tiling and <b>padding</b> transformations. It describes misses across different hierarchy levels and considers the effects of other hardware components such as branch predictors. We combine the cost model with a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the tile and pad factors that enhance the program. Our results show that this scheme is useful to optimize programs' performance. When compared to previous works, we observe that with a reasonable compile-time overhead, our approach obtains significant performance improvements for all studied kernels on a variety of architectures.

40|$|Peripheral {{artery disease}} (PAD) affects 8 to 10 million Americans, and the {{incidence}} of PAD {{is expected to increase}} as the population ages. A high percentage of the PAD is undiagnosed prior to the onset of a serious cardiovascular event; therefore, the inability to screen and diagnose for PAD in the early stages could hinder efforts to decrease adverse consequences of cardiovascular disease. Individuals with PAD have a 3 to 5 times increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality when compared to people without <b>PAD.</b> <b>Guided</b> by the Stetler model, the purpose of this project was to evaluate the relationship between level of PAD, as measured by skin perfusion pressure, and HbA 1 c using secondary data obtained from charts of patients within the clinic setting. Data included patient gender, age, degree of PAD, and HbA 1 c. A Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation investigated the relationship between the patients 2 ̆ 7 HbA 1 c and level of PAD. There was a significant relationship between HbA 1 c and LT PAD (r =. 21, p =. 009). There was no relation in RT PAD (r =. 01, n = 149, p =. 90). There was a significant relationship between HbA 1 c and age (r =. 34, p =. 00). Ultimately, the goal {{of this study was to}} improve PAD recognition, encourage early intervention, and facilitate effective preventive methods. Critical limb ischemia might be delayed or prevented if it is identified earlier by screening methodologies. Early identification and treatment of PAD can improve the quality of life and care for individuals suffering with PAD...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a microparticle delivery device that generates a plasma jet through laser ablation of a thin metal foil {{and uses the}} jet to accomplish particle delivery into soft living targets for transferring biological agents. Pure gold microparticles of 1 µm size were coated with a plasmid DNA, pIG 121 Hm, and were deposited as a thin layer on one surface of an aluminum foil. The laser (Nd:YAG, 1064 nm wavelength) ablation of the foil generated a plasma jet that carried the DNA coated particles into the living onion cells. The particles could effectively penetrate the target cells and disseminate the DNA, effecting the transfection of the cells. Generation of the plasma jet on laser ablation of the foil and {{its role as a}} carrier of microparticles was visualized using a high-speed video camera, Shimadzu HPV- 1, at a frame rate of 500 kfps (2 µs interframe interval) in a shadowgraph optical set-up. The particle speed could be measured from the visualized images, which was about 770 m/s initially, increased to a magnitude of 1320 m/s, and after a quasi-steady state over a distance of 10 mm with an average magnitude of 1100 m/s, started declining, which typically is the trend of a high-speed, pulsed, compressible jet. Aluminum launch pad (for the particles) was {{used in the present study}} to make the procedure cost-effective, whereas the <b>guided,</b> biocompatible launch <b>pads</b> made of gold, silver or titanium can be used in the device during the actual clinical operations. The particle delivery device has a potential to have a miniature form and can be an effective, hand-held drug/DNA delivery device for biological applications...|$|R
