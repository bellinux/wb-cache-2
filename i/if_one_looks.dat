25|$|Selection at {{the level}} of the {{organism}} can be described as Darwinism, and is well understood and considered common. If a relatively faster gazelle manages to survive and reproduce more, the causation of the higher fitness of this gazelle can be fully accounted for <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> at how individual gazelles fare under predation.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> at {{this train}} from the fixed {{non-rotating}} frame {{on top of}} the center of the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is gravity and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%) than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.|$|E

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of the twentieth-anniversary issue of the Public Opinion Quarterly in 1957, an issue devoted to twenty years of public opinion research, Herbert Hyman reflected on the existing state of theory about public opinion (Hyman, 1957; pp. 54 - 60). The state of theory was bleak, he commented, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> for a grand theory that integrated the vast empirical findings of past and contemporary studies of public opinion. Things <b>looked</b> brighter, however, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> for theoretical orientations of more modest scope, for example, theories of the middle range, a phrase suggested by Robert K. Merton (Merton 1949; pp. 4 - 5) ...|$|R

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> at {{the fields}} around the Deserted Village and {{right up the}} mountain, {{one can see the}} tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E
25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> at the {{building}} programs for FY39 and FY40, the US Navy had 194 destroyers (some ordered in June and July 1940), 140 Patrol Craft (PC's 173', 165', 110'), 78 Sub Chasers (SC’s) and 129 YMS’s (which could be utilized for anti-sub role if necessary). Of the Destroyers laid down in 1940-1 that were not commissioned on December 7, twenty-eight were commissioned between January and June of 1942 with 16 assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet or the European Theater of Operations (ETO) and 12 assigned to the US Pacific Fleet (and of the 12, 1/3 conducted anti-submarine/convoy duty in the Atlantic/Caribbean prior to reporting to the Pacific Fleet) and, of the remaining fifty-two of the classes of 1940-1, 35 were commissioned and assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet and/or the ETO.|$|E

25|$|After the Spanish founded Mission San Gabriel in 1771, the Chino Hills {{was used}} {{extensively}} for grazing by mission cattle.

After Mexico ceded California to the United States it was, and still is, a swamp and subject to flooding annually. Most historical dwellings were demolished {{in the rush to}} build. A local state monument is present in the grass lawn area of the local fire department, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> closely. Casa Colina, a well-known rehabilitation center now situated in Pomona California, began as a tubercular clinic in the Los Serranos sector. Similarly, the well known hospital, Loma Linda Hospital, also had its beginnings as a tubercular clinic. Sadly, most patients admitted for tuberculosis, succumbed to the illness because of the ineffectiveness of pre-antibotic treatments.|$|E

The Catechism states that, {{with the help of}} God's grace, men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires [...] "for sinful relationships with another person's spouse." [...] In Theology of the Body, a series of lectures given by Pope John Paul II, Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> at him/her lustfully or treats him/her [...] "only as an object to satisfy instinct".|$|E

2500|$|Early {{country music}} was infused with the blues. Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, Bob Wills, Bill Monroe and Hank Williams have all {{described}} themselves as blues singers and their music has a blues feel that is different, at first glance at least, from the later country pop of artists like Eddy Arnold. Yet, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> back further, Arnold also started out singing bluesy songs like 'I'll Hold You in My Heart'. A lot of the 1970s-era [...] "outlaw" [...] country music by Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings also borrowed from the blues. When Jerry Lee Lewis returned to country after the decline of 1950s style rock and roll, he sang his country with a blues feel and often included blues standards on his albums.|$|E

2500|$|Sea {{sickness}} {{is a form}} {{of motion}} sickness characterized by a feeling of nausea and, in extreme cases, vertigo experienced after spending time on a craft on water. [...] It is essentially the same as car sickness, though the motion of a watercraft tends to be more regular. [...] It is typically brought on by the rocking motion of the craft or movement while immersed in water. [...] As with air sickness, {{it can be difficult to}} visually detect motion even <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> outside of the boat as water does not offer fixed points with which to visually judge motion.

2500|$|If light {{consisted}} strictly {{of ordinary}} or classical particles, and these particles were fired {{in a straight}} line through a slit and allowed to strike a screen on the other side, we would expect to see a pattern corresponding to {{the size and shape of}} the slit. However, when this [...] "single-slit experiment" [...] is actually performed, the pattern on the screen is a diffraction pattern in which the light is spread out.

The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed when a red laser illuminates a slit and, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> carefully, two faint side bands.

2500|$|... ※ Discrepancy: This {{statement}} is not exact or inaccurate: [...] "... ACT percentiles are calculated {{on the basis}} of the percent of test takers scoring the same score or a lower one, not (as is the case for many other assessments) only the percent scoring lower". Specifically, it applies to the scores of 35 or lower but not the highest score of 36. This is because if 99.96% of test takers scored 36 AND lower, what score did the remaining 0.04% of test takers get? Obviously the answer is none because there is no score higher than 36. Therefore, the correct percentile for 36 appears to be 0.04% (100% — 99.96%). But <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> at the next line (the score of 35) it appears to be 0.3% instead (100% — 99.7%). In other words, 99.7% of the test takers had a score of 35 or lower, meaning the only higher score, 36 (no scores between 35 and 36 as the increment is 1), belongs to the remaining 0.3% of test takers. But which is the true answer, 0.3% or 0.04%? If it's 0.3%, then 0.04% is a calculation error? Or the vice versa (0.04% is true and 0.3% is a calculation error). Please clarify by checking on the original data! It's surprising to see such discrepancy for such a popular and critical test.|$|E
