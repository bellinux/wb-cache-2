In October 2009, when Knowles was chosen for the Woman of the Year Award presented by Billboard magazine, the gross from her tours was revealed.

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{penalties}} {{are no longer}} divided into light and heavy sentences, the criminal courts still are named according to the penalties they were entitled to pass. Penal courts of first instance (or simply penal courts, asliye ceza) are courts with a single judge deciding on minor cases. There is one <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> and in every district, sometimes divided into several branches according to the need and population.

When Dessalines arrived, he first spoke about the atrocities committed by former French authorities, such as Rochambeau and Leclerc, after which he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area's French population be carried out. Reportedly, he also ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that blame would not rest solely on the black population. Mass killings then took place on the streets and on places outside the cities. In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred.|$|E

25|$|The book covers {{almost all}} aspects of life in {{providing}} proper guidance of Islam such as the method of performing prayers and other actions of worship directly from the Prophet Muhammad. Bukhari finished his work around 846/232 AH, and spent the last twenty-four {{years of his life}} visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the hadith he had collected. <b>In</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> that Bukhari visited, thousands of people would gather in the main mosque to listen to him recite traditions. In reply to Western academic doubts as to the actual date and authorship of the book that bears his name, scholars point out that notable hadith scholars of that time, such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal (855 CE/241 AH), Yahya ibn Ma'in (847 CE/233 AH), and Ali ibn al-Madini (848 CE/234 AH), accepted the authenticity of his book and that the collection's immediate fame makes it unlikely {{that it could have been}} revised after the author's death without historical record.|$|E

The second section starts with {{the description of the}} Dardanelles Strait and continues with the islands and coastlines of the Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ligurian Sea, the French Riviera, the Balearic Islands, the coasts of Spain, the Strait of Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, the coasts of North Africa, Egypt and the River Nile, the Levant and the coastline of Anatolia. This section also includes descriptions and drawings of the famous monuments and buildings <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city,</b> as well as biographic information about Piri Reis who also explains the reasons why he preferred to collect these charts in a book instead of drawing a single map, which {{would not be able to}} contain so much information and detail.|$|E
25|$|State Guards were {{reformed}} {{for internal}} security duties {{to replace the}} National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city,</b> even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was {{to remind people that}} there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.|$|E

[...] Critic Karen Wada, in her afterword to the published script, blamed [...] "the sluggish economy, post-September 11 jitters, the New York Times mixed review, and unusually bitter winter weather" [...] for the unexpectedly short run. [...] Lee {{also felt that}} the influential Times review had hurt the show's acceptance, but commented that Hwang added some dialogue to Act II after the Los Angeles run that Lee felt slowed the show down.

500|$|Wilde and aestheticism {{were both}} mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press; the Springfield Republican, for instance, commented on Wilde's {{behaviour}} {{during his visit}} to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde's conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist, wrote in [...] "Unmanly Manhood" [...] of his general concern that Wilde, [...] "whose only distinction is that he has written a thin volume of very mediocre verse", would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women. Though his press reception was hostile, Wilde was well received in diverse settings across America; he drank whiskey with miners in Leadville, Colorado, and was fêted at the most fashionable salons <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> he visited.|$|E

[...] He concluded, [...] "I'd rather have 100 Al Capones <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> than alcohol sold in every grocery store." [...] Amondson made an appearance on The Daily Show with comedian Jon Stewart. He spoke with correspondent Ed Helms who joked with the candidate. During the segment, Amondson remarked, [...] "alcohol cuts the supply of oxygen to the brain and puts you {{in a kind of}} retarded state."

500|$|Writing in The Beatles Anthology, Harrison {{commented on}} the {{difficulties}} he faced as a nascent songwriter during this period, relative to Lennon and Paul McCartney, both {{of whom had been}} writing [...] "since they were three years old". He said he wrote [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] as a love song to Pattie Boyd, the English model whom he married soon after the song's release. The lyrics have nevertheless invited interpretation as being about a groupie or, in the words of music journalist Robert Fontenot, [...] "some other attempt by the singer to juggle two affairs at once". Author Peter Doggett comments on Harrison's inspiration, {{in the context of the}} Beatlemania that continually encroached on the band's lifestyle: [...] "'If I Needed Someone' may be the first pop song written from the jaded, though not quite exhausted viewpoint of a man who had women lined up outside his hotel door <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1990s, {{despite the}} success of The Wiggles, Field {{reported}} being suicidal and [...] "frequently gripped by anxiety, sadness, and negativity". By mid-2004, shortly after his marriage {{and the birth of}} his first child, Field's serious medical issues, worsened by their heavy tour schedule, caused him to consider quitting or re-inventing The Wiggles, despite their great success in the U.K. and North America. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago in 2004, Field improved his health to the point {{that he was able to}} continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements. In early 2013, Field became the only original member of the group to remain after Fatt, Cook, and Page retired. He remained in the group because he wanted to continue to educate children and as Wiggles manager Paul Field stated, [...] "to placate American, British and Canadian business partners".|$|E
500|$|The band {{suffered}} a personal tragedy {{on the night}} of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired {{as a result of the}} incident. The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation. Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he'd [...] "gotten high <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>city</b> in this country and probably half the cities in Europe." [...] But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, [...] "For nine years we have battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. … We wish [...] the best we have to offer". Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of Mellon Collie stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record, and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, [...] "The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music." ...|$|E
