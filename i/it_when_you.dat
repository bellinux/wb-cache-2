Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs?

But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of love and care Mrs Bennet has for her daughters." [...] Wright convinced veteran actress Judi Dench to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read [...] "I love <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> play a bitch.

He also reached base safely by hit or walk in 46 consecutive games (the third-longest such streak in the minor leagues). Peter Gammons wrote that August: [...] "Remember this name: Kevin Youkilis, who resembles Steve Balboni."

[...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, {{and you get a}} free record with <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> buy a gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E

When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans to turn into a park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E
500|$|Roswell met fellow voice actor Hal Rayle in 1986, {{and they}} married in 1987.

They moved from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado, in June 1994 to raise their adopted {{daughter}} Spenser, {{who was born in}} 1993. Between March and November every year, when episodes of The Simpsons were being recorded, Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions. In an article about her and her husband's move, Ricky Lopes of Rocky Mountain News wrote: [...] "When The Simpsons is taping, she goes to Los Angeles every Friday morning for the first reading, flies back that afternoon, flies back Sunday to tape the show Monday and flies back home that night."

500|$|In 2003, Sevigny took on {{the lead}} female role in the art house film The Brown Bunny (2003), which details a lonely {{traveling}} motorcycle racer reminiscing about his former lover. The film achieved notoriety for its final scene, which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics. She went on to defend the movie, [...] "It's a shame people write so many things when they haven't seen <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> see the film, it makes more sense. It's an art film. It should be playing in museums. It's like an Andy Warhol movie." [...] After the film's release at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the William Morris Agency terminated Sevigny as a client. The agency believed the scene was [...] "one step above pornography", and claimed that Sevigny's career [...] "may never recover". In an interview with The Telegraph in 2003, when asked if she regretted the film, she responded: [...] "No, I was always committed to the project {{on the strength of}} Vincent alone. I have faith in his aesthetic... I try to forgive and forget, otherwise I'd just become a bitter old lady." ...|$|E

500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] is a dance-pop {{song that}} {{features}} a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff {{that serves as the}} song's instrumentation. Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On my waist, through my hair / Think about <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> touch me there / Close my eyes, here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I Like to Move It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "In the Dark" [...] is written in the time signature of common time and set in a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C minor and Dev's vocals span from the note of A4 to the note of B5. It has a basic sequence of Cm–E6–A5–G5 as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he talks about it as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, really like <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> serve me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E
500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
