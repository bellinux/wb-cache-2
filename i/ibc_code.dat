40|$|Inflammatory {{breast cancer}} (IBC) is a {{relatively}} rare and extremely aggressive form of breast cancer that is diagnosed clinically. Standardization of clinical diagnoses is challenging, both nationally and internationally; moreover, <b>IBC</b> <b>coding</b> definitions used by registries have changed over time. This study aimed to compare diagnostic factors of IBC reported in a U. S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to clinical criteria found in the medical records of all invasive breast cancer cases at a single institution. We conducted a medical record review of all female invasive breast cancers (n  =  915) seen at an NCI‐designated comprehensive cancer center in Detroit from 2007 to 2009. IBC cases were identified based {{on the presence of}} the main clinical characteristics of the disease (erythema, edema, peau d'orange). We compared the proportion of IBC out of all breast cancers, using these clinical criteria and the standard SEER <b>IBC</b> <b>codes.</b> In the reviewed cases, the clinical criteria identified significantly more IBC cases (n  =  74, 8. 1 %) than the standard IBC SEER definition (n  =  19, 2. 1 %; p <  0. 0001). No IBC cases were identified in the cancer center records using the SEER pathologic coding, which requires the diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma on the pathology report, a notation that is rarely made. Emphasis must be placed on the documentation of clinical and pathologic characteristics of IBC in the medical record, so that analysis of putative IBC subtypes will be possible. Our results indicate the need for a consensus on the definition of IBC to be utilized in future research...|$|R

40|$|The seismic {{design of}} {{building}} frame {{presented in this}} project is based on IS 1893 - 2002 and IS 800. The aim of the present work is to analyze a multistory and multi bay (G+ 5) moment resisting building frame for earthquake forces following IS 1893 and then design it as per IS 800 : 2007. The frame consists of six story’s and has three bays in horizontal direction and five bays in lateral direction. The selection of arbitrary sections have been done following a standard procedure. The two methods {{that have been used}} for analysis are Equivalent static load method and Response Spectrum method. A comparative study of the results obtained from both these methods have been made in terms of story displacement,inter story drift and base shear. The frame has also been further checked for P-∆ analysis and required correction in moments have been done following <b>IBC</b> <b>code.</b> Then the steel moment resisting frame has been designed following IS- 800 : 2007 based on these methods of analysis. In the process of design the section has undergone numerous iterations till all the criteria mentioned in the IS 800 have been satisfied. The designed frame was again analyzed and results were compared in terms of sections used. The cost efficiency of both the methods have been compared. Finally the design of connection of an interior joint and an exterior joint of the frame have been done and the calculations have been shown. Also the design of the foundation which consists of the base plate has been done according to IS 800 : 2007. Relevant calculations have been shown and the figures have been drawn.

40|$|Earthquake is {{the major}} Natural {{disaster}} in Iran which once a while causes widespread death and financial losses. Constructional system and materials used in them, most often accelerate these damages, so these are considered principal reasons of the events. Countries that have regions of high seismicity, conducted research on constructional systems, materials, and methods of improving their resistance to earthquake. These research efforts have found simple solution {{of the problem in}} wood and its proper combinations with other constructional materials. In this research, regarding such target, two subjects were studied. A model of light framed one story single-family residential house in Iran was constructed to determine its dynamical behavior. The model was constructed in one- third scale of a unit with 54 square meters in base. Foundation anchorage in model was made by metal angle pieces, which were bolted to lower plank. These types of connectors could easily be fabricated in metal working shops in Iran. The rest of joints in model were made with bolts and common nails. To see the behavior of the model, its natural frequency, acceleration at different points, lateral movements (displacement), and also response of joints to tensile and compressive forces (developed due to lateral dynamical loading on a shaking table) were measured and analyzed. Results have shown that with respect to Fast Fourier Transformation spectra, ratio of maximum acceleration in roof to bottom of model, in sinusoidal acceleration test, the natural frequency of model is ten HZ (fn = 10 Hz), since 10 Hz frequency has the highest amplitude. This result had contingency with data of sinusoidal acceleration records with 10 HZ frequency and 0. 64 g as well. Therefore, stiffness of model structure would be 78, 250 Kg/cm. In addition, results of several sinusoidal acceleration tests for determining delay damping, has shown on the average 0. 039 for this quantity. Brief results of sinusoidal acceleration test, sweeping frequency and time history of Kobe and Tabas earthquake have shown that maximum displacements (lateral movement due to dynamic loading) are related to this acceleration with 8 HZ frequency and 1. 18 g. This displacement in model has been measured 0. 76 mm, which is lower than allowable limit in <b>IBC</b> <b>code</b> (1 % of story high, that is, 30 mm for a 3 m high). Including scale coefficient of constructed model, this figure would be 5. 76 mm. But for force, it could be considered that highest tensile and compressive force would occur with 10 HZ frequency and 0. 85 g test. The cause is resonant phenomena in this frequency. Therefore, in resonant phenomena maximum force is applied to joints and in this case, each joint would be under load of 30 % of building’s weight. Therefore, well-installed joint can considerably prevent death and financial damages. financial losses. Constructional system and materials used in them, most often accelerate these damages, so these are considered principal reasons of the events...|$|E
