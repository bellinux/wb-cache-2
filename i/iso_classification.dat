40|$|Demand {{response}} {{is the largest}} underutilized reliability resource in North America. Historic demand response programs have focused on reducing overall electricity consumption (increasing efficiency) and shaving peaks but have not typically been used for immediate reliability response. Many of these programs have been successful but demand response remains a limited resource. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) report, 'Assessment of Demand Response and Advanced Metering' (FERC 2006) found that only five percent of customers are on some form of demand response program. Collectively they represent an estimated 37, 000 MW of response potential. These programs reduce overall energy consumption, lower green house gas emissions by allowing fossil fuel generators to operate at increased efficiency and reduce stress on the power system during periods of peak loading. As the country continues to restructure energy markets with sophisticated marginal cost models that attempt to minimize total energy costs, the ability of demand response to create meaningful shifts in the supply and demand equations is critical to creating a sustainable and balanced economic response to energy issues. Restructured energy market prices are set by {{the cost of the}} next incremental unit of energy, so that as additional generation is brought into the market, the cost for the entire market increases. The benefit of demand {{response is}} that it reduces overall demand and shifts the entire market to a lower pricing level. This can be very effective in mitigating price volatility or scarcity pricing as the power system responds to changing demand schedules, loss of large generators, or loss of transmission. As a global producer of alumina, primary aluminum, and fabricated aluminum products, Alcoa Inc., has the capability to provide demand response services through its manufacturing facilities and uniquely through its aluminum smelting facilities. For a typical aluminum smelter, electric power accounts for 30 % to 40 % of the factory cost of producing primary aluminum. In the continental United States, Alcoa Inc. currently owns and/or operates ten aluminum smelters and many associated fabricating facilities with a combined average load of over 2, 600 MW. This presents Alcoa Inc. with a significant opportunity to respond in areas where economic opportunities exist to help mitigate rising energy costs by supplying demand response services into the energy system. This report is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter is the introduction and discusses the intention of this report. The second chapter contains the background. In this chapter, topics include: the motivation for Alcoa to provide demand response; ancillary service definitions; the basics behind aluminum smelting; and a discussion of suggested ancillary services that would be particularly useful for Alcoa to supply. Chapter 3 is concerned with the independent system operator, the Midwest ISO. Here the discussion examines the evolving Midwest ISO market structure including specific definitions, requirements, and necessary components to provide ancillary services. This section is followed by information concerning the Midwest <b>ISO's</b> <b>classifications</b> of demand response parties.

Chapter 5 involves an in-depth discussion of the regulation service that Alcoa's Warrick facility can provide and the current interactions with Midwest ISO.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{individual}} Master Thesis {{study is the}} expansion of the Technical Condition Index (TCI) concept, developed at the Department of Marine Technology at NTNU, as to encompass the following Ship Engine Auxiliary Systems; Fuel Oil System, Lubricating Oil System and Cooling Water System. The first chapter is a literature study on condition monitoring techniques, including an introduction on the role of TCI’s and condition monitoring within a successful maintenance organization. FMECA analysis concluded during the candidate’s Specialization Project revealed three major common component groups subject to condition monitoring for the purpose of establishing TCI’; valves, pumps and heat exchangers. In order to reduce complexity and cost implications, TCI’s and the condition monitoring techniques providing input data should be based on standardized methods, applicable to all components within one such major group. For valves in the systems studied such standardized methods generally applicable to all valves could not be identified. The variety of valve types is vast, while common root-cause failure mechanisms are few, indicating that if valves truly are considered sufficiently critical to justify condition monitoring based on TCI’s, methods must be developed individually each system to be monitored. For pumps, TCI’s are proposed to be based on a combination of vibration monitoring and process parameter analysis. Vibration monitoring should be based on measurement of vibration velocity, given in mm/s-RMS at bearings. <b>ISO</b> standards <b>classification</b> threshold values are proposed utilized in the transfer functions for calculating TCI’s. TCI’s based on process parameter analysis of pumps should utilize the Head – flow test at duty point. This method requires repeatable measurements flow rate and pressure difference over the pump. TCI’s for heat exchangers are proposed to be based exclusively on process parameter analysis, where the parameter to be monitored is the reduction in the overall heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated from measurement of inlet and outlet temperature of both mediums flowing through the heat exchanger as well as mass flow rate and knowledge of the specific heat capacity of {{at least one of the}} two mediums. Technical Condition Indexes proposed have been implemented into TeCoMan software for the Engine Fuel Oil System, and exemplified by calculation of aggregated higher level TCI’s using fabricated data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{building}} classification systems {{is to provide}} the sector with agreed and standardised ter¬minology and semantics, e. g. in systems for technical specification, cost calculation, and exchange of information. There is a growing need to use classification systems in a BIM context. In inter¬¬national construction projects and international construction product trade {{there is a need}} both to translate between national classification systems and to develop common systems. The idea behind the inter¬¬national framework standard for building <b>classification</b> <b>ISO</b> 12006 - 2 is that national systems would be easier to compare if they adhere to the class definitions suggested in the standard. A study of two classification systems, the BSAB system in Sweden and the DBK system in Denmark, both within the framework and yet not compatible, has risen the idea of a deeper analysis of the theoretical basis for the ISO 12006 - 2 classification system to find a solution to this problem.

40|$|This licentiate {{study was}} {{initiated}} by copper, zinc and galvanized steel producers in Europe, who felt {{a need to}} assess runoff rates of copper and zinc from the pure metals and commercial products at marine exposure conditions. Their motive was the increasing concern in various European countries and the on-going risk assessments of copper and zinc within the European commission. Also the circumstance that available runoff rates so far, had been reported for mainly urban exposure conditions, rather than marine. A collaboration was therefore established with the French Corrosion Institute, which runs a marine test site in Brest, {{and a set of}} vital questions were formulated. Their answers are the essence of this licentiate study. Based on the <b>ISO</b> corrosivity <b>classification</b> and one-year exposures, the marine atmosphere of Brest is fairly corrosive for zinc (class C 3) and highly corrosive for copper (C 4). Despite higher corrosivity classifications for both metals in Brest compared to the urban site of Stockholm, used as a reference site, nearly all runoff rates assessed for copper, zinc and their commercial products were lower in Brest compared to Stockholm. This was attributed to a higher surface wetting in Brest and concomitant higher removal rate of deposited chloride and sulphate species from the marine-exposed surfaces. The comparison shows that measured corrosion rates cannot be used to predict runoff rates, since different physicochemical processes govern corrosion and runoff respectively. For copper, the runoff rate in Brest was approximately 1. 1 g m- 2 yr- 1 with cuprite (Cu 2 O) as main patina constituent. During periods of very high chloride and sulphate deposition, paratacamite (Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) formed which increased the runoff rate to 1. 5 g m- 2 yr- 1. For zinc, with hydrozincite (Zn 5 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 6) as the main patina constituent, the runoff rate was relatively stable at 2. 6 g m- 2 yr- 1 throughout the year, despite episodes of heavy chloride and sulphate deposition. The application of organic coatings of varying thickness on artificially patinated copper or on different zinc-based products resulted in improved barrier properties and reduced runoff rates that seem highly dependent on thickness. The thickest organic coating (150 µm thick), applied on hot dipped galvanized steel, reduced the runoff rate by a factor of 100. No deterioration of organic coatings was observed during the one-year exposures. Alloying zinc-based products with aluminium resulted in surface areas enriched in aluminium and concomitant reduced zinc runoff rates. The release rate and bioavailability of copper from different anti-fouling paints into artificial seawater was also investigated. It turned out that the release rate not only depends on the copper concentration in the paint, but also on paint matrix properties and other released metal constituents detected. Far from all copper was bioavailabe at the immediate release situation. In all, the results suggest the importance of assessing the ecotoxic response of anti-fouling paints not only by regarding the copper release, but rather through an integrated effect of all matrix constituents.

It was in collaboration with Fugro N. V., a large Dutch consultancy and engineering firm that is active in onshore and offshore services in the field of geological and geotechnical investigations for a wide field of clients in the petroleum and gas industry but also for other infrastructure. Current methods for the classification of soils comprise of laboratory and in-situ measurements. Fugro is searching for a more accurate and time efficient method to classify soil and provided five soil samples on which a classification had to be performed. The Leica C 10 laser scanner, provided by the department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TU Delft), was used to scan the soil samples. TLS is based on LIDAR (light detection and ranging) which is known for emitting pulses in a very narrow beam of monochromatic light (one wavelength) in the ultraviolet, visible or near-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. After scanning the soil samples, the following features extracted from the 3 D point cloud data were used to perform classification on each soil sample: intensity (backscattered energy), colour (an RGB-image), surface height variations (roughness). The chosen method was <b>iso</b> cluster unsupervised <b>classification.</b> After classification, interpretations were made based on the descriptions of the soil sample and knowledge of bare soil reflectance. The main factors that influenced the soil reflectance were related to characteristics of the samples: glauconite content (an iron-bearing mineral) and surface roughness. Both factors were responsible for a decrease in soil reflectance. Unsupervised classification was applicable on three out of five samples. However, only one sample provided good results. The other two samples were less promising, although some features could clearly be identified after comparing the classified image with ground truth data. Applied Earth Science...|$|R
