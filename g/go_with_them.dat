As the church's youth ministry—which is going to Mexico to help build a school—leave, Michael decides to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The other employees try to talk him out of it, but Michael refuses.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth {{on a trip to}} the Peak District; their visit also {{includes}} Darcy's estate, Pemberley; Elizabeth agrees to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty, and hears nothing but good things about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy, who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.|$|E

Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the Black Pearl, and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, {{reciprocating}} Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending {{him to get the}} chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> as chaplain. His experiences there were to {{form the basis for}} his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Roran is {{planning}} to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so he convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The villagers reach Narda, where they pay for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he now is a Dragon Rider. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden. Jeod decides to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The villagers are chased {{by a group of}} Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.|$|E

They inform them that the disease {{was sent to the}} planet by a foreign race called the Lezonians, whom the Earth Federation has been at war with. Roddick and Millie <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> on their spacecraft to help them find a cure. They learn that Fellpool blood could be used to process a special, invisible material which could give them a massive advantage in the war. Upon coming in contact with Lezonians, they reveal that they were being forced into war by a shadowy, powerful third party with a disgust for the Federation.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E

The team was moved to Reno, Nevada after the 2008 season. At the time, the Reno Silver Sox of the Golden Baseball League (which began as the Mesa Miners in 2005) were reported to be forced to leave Reno when the Sidewinders move into town. The Silver Sox franchise was sold by the league to Tucson Baseball LLC, but the team's history (including Reno's 2006 GBL Championship) did not <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> There were original reports of a possible relocation to Carson City, Nevada, but the team instead moved to Tucson. The Silver Sox team name is now associated with the Arizona Winter League team from Saskatchewan. The new PCL team has since become the Reno Aces.|$|E

However, during their wedding night Gudrid losers her composure and ends up stabbing Sigurd in his thigh. When Sigurd strikes her in return, she panics and flees. Gudrid sneaks away to Thorfinn's group who is about to set sail for Greece, hoping to make a fortune by trading Narwhal horns. Gudrid informs them of what had happened and breaks down in despair over not being able to live the life she wants because she was born a woman. Thorfinn takes pity on Gudrid and offers her to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> but makes it clear that she might never return alive. Gudrid eventually agrees and the group quickly leaves Iceland. Haafdan quickly learns that Gudrid fled with Thorfinn, so Sigurd vows to chase them down and not set foot in his home until he has brought Gudrid back.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> as though recapping a movie. He was known to push this idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E
