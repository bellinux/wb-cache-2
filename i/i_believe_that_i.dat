25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have never been in a battle, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 when asked about politics he said, [...] "I'd been unemployed all my life. It {{was a big deal}} for me when they (Labour) got in. Now David Cameron is no different from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown is no different from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{his first}} parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz {{sent a letter}} to New York Governor George Pataki asking that it be canceled. He wrote, [...] "In all honesty, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> deserve to be in prison {{for the rest of my}} life. I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with my {{situation}} and I have accepted my punishment." [...] Officials at the Sullivan facility duly rejected his case.|$|E
2500|$|Another soldier, PFC Felix López-Santos {{was drafted}} into the Army and sent to Fort Dix in New Jersey for training. López -Santos went to Milne Bay {{and then to the}} small island of Woodlark, both in New Guinea, where he was in the {{communications}} department using telephone wires to communicate to the troops during the war. In an interview, López-Santos stated that in North Carolina he witnessed some forms of racial discrimination, but never experienced it for himself. He stated: [...] "I remember seeing some colored people refused service at a restaurant, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not discriminated against because of my blue eyes and fair complexion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baird {{responded to}} Jordan's {{allegations}} by calling them [...] "the merest bosh" [...] and by denying {{there were any}} inducements or special favors for athletes. [...] He later noted: [...] "President Jordan has made these charges several times, and never brought forth one iota of proof to establish his claim." [...] Former Michigan player and then Drake coach, Willie Heston, {{one of the players}} named as a professional in Jordan's article, responded: [...] "I {{was in a position to}} know what was going on and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am safe in saying that no Michigan athlete ever did anything since Baird took hold of things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore {{had argued}} in a {{previous}} public debate that Osama bin Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film. [...] "Something – I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we do now – has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> understand the convenience of this late conversion." [...] Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC talk show, Scarborough Country, at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002 was replayed.|$|E
2500|$|The Tennis Masters Cup singles final {{featured}} ATP No. 3, Australian Open, Indian Wells and Rome champion Novak Djokovic, and Miami Masters, Pörtschach and Warsaw winner Nikolay Davydenko, in both men's first year-end championships final. The encounter was {{the third}} match of the two, after a Davis Cup rubber won by Davydenko after Djokovic retired, leading two sets to one, and their round robin meeting on day 3, in which Djokovic prevailed 7–6, 0–6, 7–5. Djokovic started the encounter on serve, and took {{the advantage of a}} weak Davydenko service game (the Russian went on to win only 42% of his service points in the set) to break and lead 2–0. A nervous Davydenko failed again to keep his serve at 3–0, and was broken again by the Serb. The Russian managed to save his service game at 5–0, forcing Djokovic to serve for the set. The Serb did not falter, and clinched the set 6–1. Despite holding his first service game, Davydenko was broken again at 1–1 in the second set. Davydenko avoided another break of serve when led 1–3, but was unable to gain the advantage on Djokovic's serve until the Serb served for the match at 5–4. Davydenko then increased his level of play, and came back to 5-all, but Djokovic, keeping his momentum of the match, broke once more, and held to serve to claim victory, after one hour and forty-two minutes, on the final score of 6–1, 7–5. The win marked Djokovic's fourth title of the year (after a six months title drought since Rome, won on May 11) and his eleventh overall, as well as his first year-end championships crown. Djokovic became the first Serbian player to win the singles championships (Nenad Zimonjić had become the first Serbian to win the doubles championships just hours before – and all three men, Djokovic, Zimonjić and Nestor were born in Belgrade), succeeding to two-time defending champion Roger Federer, and, thanks to the win, and Federer's early loss, finished the year only two points behind the Swiss in the ATP Race. Djokovic commented on his win : [...] "I would put it in the same league as a Grand Slam because the best eight players in the world are participating here. [...] I feel very happy. End up the season the way I started it, with a win in a big event. So it's a great boost up for upcoming season." [...] On the possibility of going up in the rankings in the 2009 ATP World Tour season, Djokovic admitted again his goal to become World No. 1 : [...] "Certainly, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have quality to reach the top spot in the upcoming year or, you know, whatever, next couple of years, 10 years [...] That is my lifetime goal that I’ve been always trying to achieve." ...|$|E
