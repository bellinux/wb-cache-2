6000|$|... "What!" [...] ejaculated Michael, at {{the full}} extent of his voice, [...] "am I to have no welcome, no carouse, when I have brought fortune to your old, ruinous <b>dog-house</b> {{in the shape of a}} devil's ally, that can change slate-shivers into Spanish dollars?--Here, you, Tony Fire-the-Fagot, Papist, Puritan, hypocrite, miser, profligate, devil, {{compounded}} of all men's sins, bow down and reverence him who has brought into thy house the very mammon thou worshippest." ...|$|E
60|$|Zante {{appears to}} me an {{excellent}} home for a large family with a small income. A single man lives at the best hotel (Nazionale) for forty-five francs per week. A country-house with nine bedrooms, cellarage, stabling, <b>dog-house,</b> orangery, and large garden, is to be had for 25l. a year. Fowls cost less than a franc; turkeys, {{if you do not}} buy them from a shipchandler, two francs and a half. The strong and sherry-flavoured white wine of Zante rarely exceeds three shillings the gallon, sixpence a bottle. And other necessaries in the same proportion.|$|E
6000|$|Wolfert {{found him}} at his cabin, which was not much larger than a {{tolerable}} <b>dog-house.</b> It was rudely constructed of fragments of wrecks and drift-wood, and built on the rocky shore, {{at the foot of}} the old fort, just about what at present forms the point of the Battery. A [...] "most ancient and fish-like smell" [...] pervaded the place. Oars, paddles, and fishing-rods were leaning against the wall of the fort; a net was spread on the sands to dry; a skiff was drawn up on the beach, and at the door of his cabin lay Mud Sam himself, indulging in a true negro's luxury--sleeping in the sunshine.|$|E
60|$|The rain pattered {{against the}} casements; the bells tolled for church with a melancholy sound. I {{went to the}} windows, in quest of {{something}} to amuse the eye; but {{it seemed as if}} I had been placed completely {{out of the reach of}} all amusement. The windows of my bed-room looked out among tiled roofs and stacks of chimneys, while those of my sitting-room commanded a full view of the stable-yard. I know of nothing more calculated to make a man sick of this world, than a stable-yard on a rainy day. The place was littered with wet straw, that had been kicked about by travellers and stable-boys. In one corner was a stagnant pool of water, surrounding an island of muck; there were several half-drowned fowls crowded together under a cart, among which was a miserable, crest-fallen cock, drenched out of all life and spirit; his drooping tail matted, as it were, into a single feather, along which the water trickled from his back; near the cart was a half-dozing cow chewing the cud, and standing patiently to be rained on, with wreaths of vapor rising from her reeking hide; a wall-eyed horse, tired of the loneliness of the stable, was poking his spectral head out of the window, with the rain dripping on it from the eaves; an unhappy cur, chained to a <b>dog-house</b> hard by, uttered something every now and then, between a bark and a yelp; a drab of a kitchen-wench tramped backwards and forwards through the yard in pattens, looking as sulky as the weather itself; every thing, in short, was comfortless and forlorn, excepting a crew of hard-drinking ducks, assembled like boon companions round a puddle, and making a riotous noise over their liquor.|$|E
5000|$|Gable fronted dormer: Also called {{simply a}} gabled dormer, {{this is the}} most common type. It has a simple pitched roof of two sloping planes, {{supported}} by a frame that rises vertically to form a triangular section below the roofline, i.e. a gable. It is also known as a <b>dog-house</b> dormer (due to its similar shape).|$|E
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} Johns Hopkins University-NASA Glenn team is undertaking {{a collaborative}} research program to elucidate and model the thermal stability and mechanical integrity of candidate coatings for GRCop- 84. GRCop- 84 {{is a high}} conductivity, high strength copper alloy that was recently developed at NASA Glenn for use in high temperature, high heat flux applications. With potential applications in rocket motor combustion chamber liners, nozzle ramps and other actively cooled structures, this new material offers great potential for decreasing weight and increasing reliability of third generation reusable launch vehicles. Current emphasis has turned toward the development of environmentally resistant and thermal barrier coatings for this alloy. Metallic coatings such as NiCrAlY and Cu- 8 - 30 %Cr have shown promise in: prohibiting blanching, reducing <b>dog-house</b> failures, increasing operating temperatures and decreasing cooling requirements. The focus of this research program {{is to develop a}} fundamental understanding of the substrate-coating interactions that occur during thermal cycling (inter-diffusion, viscoplasticity, morphological evolution, crack formation, etc.) and to derive a science-based protocol for future coating selection, optimization and reliability assurance. The microsample tensile testing approach adopted for this study allows us to characterize small-scale and highly scale-specific coatings and properties in a way not possible by conventional means. In addition to providing much needed design data, the integration of microsample testing with detailed microstructural observations provides a mechanistic foundation for coating optimization and life prediction modeling...|$|E
40|$|The {{reusable}} {{launch vehicle}} (RLV) thrust cell liner, or thrust chamber, is {{a critical component of}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). It is designed to operate {{in some of the most}} severe conditions seen in engineering practice. This requirement, in conjunction with experimentally observed 'dog-house' failure modes characterized by bulging and thinning of the cooling channel wall, provides the motivation to study the factors that influence RLV thrust cell liner performance. Factors or parameters believed to be directly related to the observed characteristic deformation modes leading to failure under in-service loading conditions are identified, and subsequently investigated using the cylindrical version of the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials in conjunction with the Robinson's unified viscoplasticity theory and the power-law creep model for modeling the response of the liner s constituents. Configurations are analyzed in which specific modifications in cooling channel wall thickness or constituent materials are made to determine the influence of these parameters on the deformations resulting in the observed failure modes in the outer walls of the cooling channel. The application of thermal barrier coatings and functional grading are also investigated within this context. Comparison of the higher-order theory results based on the Robinson and power-law creep model predictions has demonstrated that, using the available material parameters, the power-law creep model predicts more precisely the experimentally observed deformation leading to the 'dog-house' failure mode for multiple short cycles, while also providing much improved computational efficiency. However, for a single long cycle, both models predict virtually identical deformations. Increasing the power-law creep model coefficients produces appreciable deformations after just one long cycle that would normally be obtained after multiple cycles, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the analysis. This provides a basis for the development of an accelerated modeling procedure to further characterize <b>dog-house</b> deformation modes in RLV thrust cell liners. Additionally, the results presented herein have demonstrated that the mechanism responsible for deformation leading to 'dog-house' failure modes is driven by pressure, creep/relaxation and geometric effects...|$|E
