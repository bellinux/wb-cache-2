40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} {{a new type}} of values for {{cooperative}} TU-games, which we call pyramidal values. Assuming that the grand coalition is sequentially formed, and all orderings are equally likely, we define a pyramidal value to be any expected payoff in which the entrant player receives a salary, {{and the rest of his}} marginal contribution to the just formed coalition is distributed among the incumbent players. We relate the pyramidal-type sharing scheme we propose with other sharing schemes, and we also obtain some known values by means of this kind of pyramidal procedures. In particular, we show that the Shapley value can be obtained by means of an interesting pyramidal procedure that distributes nonzero dividends among the incumbents. As a result, we obtain an alternative formulation of the Shapley value based on a measure of complementarity between two players. Finally, we introduce the family of proportional pyramidal values, in which an incumbent receives a dividend in proportion to his <b>initial</b> <b>investment,</b> measured by <b>means</b> of his marginal contribution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{discusses}} the possible economic effect on regional development by developing applicable methodology and analysing differences in costs, both operational costs and <b>initial</b> <b>investments,</b> of {{two types of}} buses serving urban public transportation systems – diesel fuelled internal combustion engine bus and battery electric bus. Comparison of <b>initial</b> <b>investments</b> to operate the both types of buses shows large <b>initial</b> <b>investments</b> involved when electric energy is being added/used. At the same time operational costs, including energy costs, show opposite picture, especially with large annual distances covered – electrical energy is substantially cheaper. The research shows, that within current state of affairs in Latvia, <b>initial</b> <b>investments</b> of changing public transportation fleet to electric buses {{and the costs of}} battery replacement still outweighs the monetary advantages gained from lower operational costs and additional environmental benefits...|$|R
