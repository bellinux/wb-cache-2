5|$|Sheila {{continued}} with her secretarial course, then {{trained as a}} hairdresser, and briefly found work as a model with the Lucie Clayton agency, which included two months' work in Tokyo. She got pregnant again, and she and Colin married at Chelmsford Registry Office in May 1977 when Sheila was 20, but she lost the baby at six months. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of bed rest in hospital, {{she gave birth to}} the twins. At around this time, Colin began an affair, one that led to his leaving Sheila five months after the birth. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left a party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with <b>her</b> <b>fist.</b> The couple divorced in May 1982.|$|E

500|$|The cover art for [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was previewed on April 20, 2011. On the cover, Beyoncé {{strikes a}} bold pose while {{standing}} in sand. With <b>her</b> <b>fist</b> {{in the air}} covered in forearm protectors, Beyoncé wears a hip cut draping yellow Emilio Pucci dress and black stiletto boots. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the photograph points to a [...] "...post-apocalyptic war zone, donning an elaborate gold headdress and holding a red flag emblazoned with a black 'B'." [...] The photograph was taken on April 14, 2011. Tray Hova of Vibe magazine complimented the cover art of the single, stating that Beyoncé looks [...] "resplendent as hell" [...] on the cover and that [...] "Nobody's complaining about Bey season here." [...] Eleanor Young, in Marie Claire, described the cover art as [...] "hideous". Ray Rogers of Billboard stated that Beyoncé [...] "clearly transmits her trademark message of female empowerment". Becky Bain of Idolator described the cover as [...] "pretty disappointing", and that, with a [...] "ballistic, over-the-top club banger" [...] song like [...] "Run the World (Girls)", she expected {{something more than a}} body shot of Beyoncé, and criticized the cover for being confusing regarding the location of the photography. However, Bain complimented Beyoncé on her choice of stilettoes as [...] "...serious business".|$|E
2500|$|The {{practices}} {{related to}} the placenta varied. [...] Some midwives believed the woman would pass the placenta faster if she blew with great force into <b>her</b> <b>fist</b> or clasped her hands together really tight (Encyclopedia). [...] Some women were encouraged {{to sit on a}} pot filled with hot water to pass the placenta faster. [...] Placentas were buried deep enough so that they could not be dug up by a human or an animal. [...] If the placenta were dug up, this would bring bad luck, illness, or death to the mother and child. [...] Sometimes the placenta were buried or disposed of in a stream of running water to prevent fever in the mother.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, Susan Lucci {{became known}} for gaining Daytime Emmy Award {{nominations}} for her portrayal of Erica, but never winning. Almost {{every year from}} 1978 to 1998, Lucci received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series and never won. Her negative reactions to the losses, including pounding <b>her</b> <b>fist</b> {{on the table and}} leaving one ceremony in tears, were mentioned in tabloids. Her losses also caused her fellow castmate Ruth Warrick to speak out to the press. In 1983, when Lucci lost to All My Children newcomer Dorothy Lyman (Opal), Warrick said, [...] "It seemed impossible that Susan wouldn't win this year. We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled." [...] She later added, [...] "It was {{a slap in the face}} to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That's not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role." [...] The losing streak became a [...] "long-running gag" [...] in the entertainment community. Jay Leno on The Tonight Show used it as a joke as did Saturday Night Live. The author of The Emmy, Tom O'Neil, attributed the losses to the material she submitted for consideration. [...] "In the episodes she sent in last year, she was crying 75 percent of the time," [...] he said. [...] "She drowned her chances in a tsunami of tears. Lucci eventually won the Daytime Emmy Award in 1999, receiving a two-minute standing ovation at the win and again after the show in the press room. A reporter in the press room questioned whether she would miss the attention she got for losing, to which Lucci responded, [...] "Oh, not for a minute. Winning is definitely better." [...] The entries Lucci submitted for the 1999 Daytime Emmy Awards involved scenes from Erica's storyline where she helps Bianca deal with her anorexia.|$|E
