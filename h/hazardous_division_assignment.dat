40|$|Earlier {{studies had}} {{demonstrated}} that fusion of normal with immortal human cells yielded hybrids having limited division potential. This {{indicated that the}} phenotype of limited proliferation (cellular senescence) is dominant and that immortal cells result from recessive changes in normal growth-regulatory genes. In additional studies, we exploited {{the fact that the}} immortal phenotype is recessive and, by fusing various immortal human cell lines with each other, identified four complementation groups for indefinite <b>division.</b> <b>Assignment</b> of cell lines to specific groups allowed us to take a focused approach to identify the chromosomes and genes involved in growth regulation that have been modified in immortal cells. We report here that introduction of a normal human chromosome 4 into three immortal cell lines (HeLa, J 82, T 98 G) assigned to complementation group B resulted in loss of proliferation and reversal of the immortal phenotype. No effect on the proliferation potential of cell lines representative of the other complementation groups was observed. This result suggests that a gene(s) involved in cellular senescence and normal growth regulation resides on chromosome 4...|$|R

Police use of force continues to be a controversial and defining issue in the relationship between law enforcement and a free society. As a study, it is multi-faceted, involving academic, legal, and vocational issues; and as such, it is appropriate to an in-depth study.
