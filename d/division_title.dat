5|$|In 1982, as a Third Division side, Oxford United faced closure {{because of}} the club's {{inability}} to service the debts owed to Barclays Bank, but were rescued when businessman Robert Maxwell took over the club. In April 1983, Maxwell proposed merging United with neighbours Reading, {{to form a new}} club called the Thames Valley Royals, to play at Didcot. Jim Smith would have managed the club and been assisted by Reading boss Maurice Evans. The merger was called off as a result of fans of both clubs protesting against the decision. Furthermore, the Reading chairman stepped down and was replaced by an opponent of the merger. Maxwell also threatened to fold the club if the merger did not go through. Oxford won the Third <b>Division</b> <b>title</b> after the 1983–84 season under the management of Jim Smith, who also guided them to the Second <b>Division</b> <b>title</b> the following year. This meant that Oxford United would be playing First Division football in the 1985–86 season, 23 years after joining the Football League. Smith moved to Queens Park Rangers shortly after the promotion success, and made way for chief scout Maurice Evans, who, several seasons earlier, had won the Fourth <b>Division</b> <b>title</b> with Reading.|$|E
