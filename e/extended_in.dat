50|$|Coordination {{polymers}} can {{be classified}} {{in a number of}} different ways according to their structure and composition. One important classification is referred to as dimensionality. A structure can be determined to be one-, two- or three-dimensional, depending on the number of directions in space the array <b>extends</b> <b>in.</b> A one-dimensional structure <b>extends</b> <b>in</b> a straight line (along the x axis); a two-dimensional structure <b>extends</b> <b>in</b> a plane (two directions, x and y axes); and a three-dimensional structure <b>extends</b> <b>in</b> all three directions (x, y, and z axes). This is depicted in Figure 1.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{prominent}} zigzag pattern of chains of Na polyhedra <b>extending</b> <b>in</b> the c direction {{on the outer}} layer of the slab. The Na1 octahedron shares an edge with the Na2 augmented octahedron which shares a face with the Na3 triangular dodecahedron. This forms a linear trimer that <b>extends</b> <b>in</b> the 011 direction. This trimer is then links by edge-sharing between the Na3 and a1 polyhedra to another trimer <b>extending</b> <b>in</b> the 0-11 direction. This motif continues to form a Na3Φ14 zigzag chain <b>extending</b> <b>in</b> the c direction. In each embayment of this chain the polyhedra are accented by two (IO3+3) groups. Identical chains run parallel to the c axis that are linked only by one weak I-O bond.|$|R
