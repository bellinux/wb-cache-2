5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E

It is used to flocculate and increase the density of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> to overcome high downwell gas pressures. Whenever a drill hits a salt formation, salt is added to the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> to saturate the solution in order to minimize the dissolution within the salt stratum.

30|$|Bottom hole {{temperatures}} can exceed 200  °C during drilling deep oil/gas {{wells and}} hot dry rocks. This exposes the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> to high temperatures for long periods, creating new challenges for high-temperature resistance <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> Bentonite {{is the most}} important ingredient of water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> It is used as a mud-making material to increase the viscosity and yield point of water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> with compact mud cake. However, bentonite particles suspended in water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> could form dispersions or coalescence at elevated temperatures, resulting in drastic changes in rheological properties of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> (Guven et al. 1988; Zhang 2010; İşçi and Turutoğlu 2011; Yao et al. 2014).|$|R

However, since gas is easily influenced by the pressure and temperature than liquid, the pressure and temperature have much more effects on the rheological properties of aphron-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> than on those of conventional water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> because of the air incorporated in aphrons.

25|$|Diesel fuel is {{also often}} used as the main {{ingredient}} in oil-base mud <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> The advantage of using diesel is its low cost and that it delivers excellent results when drilling {{a wide variety of}} difficult strata including shale, salt and gypsum formations. Diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40% brine water.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{development in the}} technology of <b>fluids</b> used for <b>drilling</b> oil and gas wells. The development relates {{to the use of}} novel fluids based on a Malaysian palm oil derivative as an alternative to oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> The advantages of using oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are well documented. However, there is increasing awareness of the serious environmental problems associated with these fluids. This has led to restrictions on the use of oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> {{in many parts of the}} world. The ultimate objective must be to eliminate the use of diesel and mineral oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> There have been significant developments in the technology of water based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> but there are still many situations where the properties of oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are required. The Malaysian palm oil derivative can be used to replace mineral oil in the formulation of oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> These fluids are technically equivalent to oil based muds but are essentially non-toxic, readily biodegradable and based on a renewable raw material that is available locally and in large quantities. The chemistry of the palm oil derivative is described in comparison to that of diesel and mineral oils. Studies on the environmental impact of oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> cuttings are discussed. Biodegradation data is presented which indicates that sea bed recovery should be much more rapid using palm oil <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> than conventional oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> The formulation and properties of the new fluids are describes with some emphasis on their ability to withstand contamination. It is concluded that fluids based on Malaysian palm oil will form effective alternatives to diesel and mineral oil based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> in many situations...|$|R

500|$|When {{drilling}} deep holes, {{which require}} <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> the hole must be cased (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> will be {{absorbed by the}} snow and firn. [...] The casing has to reach down to the impermeable ice layers. [...] To install casing a shallow auger {{can be used to}} create a pilot hole, which is then reamed (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for reaming. [...] An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.|$|E
500|$|Barium sulfate (the mineral barite, BaSO4) is {{important}} to the petroleum industry as a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> in oil and gas wells. The precipitate of the compound (called [...] "blanc fixe", from the French for [...] "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes; as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers; as a paper coating pigment; and in nanoparticles, to improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.|$|E

500|$|The cutting {{apparatus}} of a drill {{is on the}} bottom end of a drill barrel, the tube that surrounds the core as the drill cuts downward. [...] The cuttings (chips of ice cut away by the drill) must be drawn up the hole and disposed of or they will reduce the cutting efficiency of the drill. [...] They can be removed by compacting them into {{the walls of the}} hole or into the core, by air circulation (dry drilling), or by the use of a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> (wet drilling).

500|$|The drill removes {{an annulus}} of ice around the core {{but does not}} cut under it. A {{spring-loaded}} lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. [...] The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface. [...] The core must be cleaned of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide coring project, a vacuuming system {{was set up to}} facilitate this. [...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. [...] The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.|$|E
500|$|Russian and French {{scientists}} have been carrying out molecular DNA studies of the water from Lake Vostok that was frozen in the borehole, by constructing numerous DNA libraries, which are collections of fragments of DNA that allow scientists to identify which species of bacteria may belong to.

However, Vladimar Korolev, the laboratory head of the study at the same institution, said that the bacteria could in principle be a contaminant that use kerosene—the antifreeze used during drilling—as an energy source.|$|E
500|$|A log is kept with {{information}} about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation.

[...] The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used. [...] If more <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> must be removed, air may be blown over the cores. [...] Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken. [...] The core is then bagged, often in polythene, and stored for shipment. [...] Additional packing, including padding material, is added. [...] When the cores are flown from the drilling site, the aircraft's flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a refrigeration unit.|$|E

30|$|LSRV is {{of great}} {{importance}} in controlling the invasion of aphron-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> into formations. The LSRV of aphron-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> is considerably {{higher than that of}} conventional reservoir <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> and should always be maintained at more than 50, 000  cP (Growcock et al. 2006). As the fluid slows due to radial flow and bridging action of the aphrons, the shear rate decreases and thus viscosity rises. This process will continue until the fluids stop. Stability of the LSRV properties is extremely crucial to maintain invasion control, a clean wellbore, and aphron stability (Brookey 1998). If the LSRV drops dramatically, it is highly recommended that drilling should be suspended until the rheological properties of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are recovered.|$|R
500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> [...] In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E
500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E
500|$|Drilling fluids {{are chosen}} {{to balance the}} {{pressure}} so that the hole remains stable. [...] The fluid must have a low kinematic viscosity to reduce tripping time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment {{out of the hole}} and return it {{to the bottom of the}} hole). [...] Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. [...] The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. [...] Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on kerosene-like products mixed with fluorocarbons to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous ethylene glycol and ethanol solutions; and esters, including n-butyl acetate. [...] Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight dimethyl siloxane oils, fatty-acid esters, and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.|$|E
