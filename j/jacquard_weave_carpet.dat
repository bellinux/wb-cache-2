Moreover, recurrent vector equations are investigated for the synthesis of linkages, and used for the design of new mechanisms with linear-angular conditions in the subspace with general constraint one. These conditions are generalized for defining the structural groups of subspace [...] 5 and these structural groups are used both for the creation of new parallel manipulators and new serial-parallel platform manipulators. After investigating hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpets,</b> the knowledge gained during the structural design of mechanisms is applied to the robotization of hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> technology process.
