The 100 <b>hryvnia</b> denomination {{is quite common}} due to its moderately high value.

25|$|As from 7 February 2014, {{following}} {{political instability}} in Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine changed the <b>hryvnia</b> into a fluctuating/floating currency {{in an attempt}} to meet IMF requirements and to try to enforce a stable price for the currency in the Forex market. In 2014 and 2015 the <b>hryvnia</b> lost about 70% of its value against the U.S. dollar. After stabilization efforts by Ukrainian authorities in March 2015 1 US dollar was worth about 22 <b>hryvnia.</b> Early February 2016 1 US dollar was worth about 26 <b>hryvnia.</b>|$|E

25|$|To a large extent, the {{introduction}} of <b>hryvnia</b> was secretive. <b>Hryvnia</b> was introduced according to President's Decree dated 26 August 1996, published on August 29. During the transition period, September 2–16, both <b>hryvnia</b> and karbovanets were used in circulation, but merchants were required to give change only in hryvnias. All bank accounts were converted to <b>hryvnia</b> automatically. During the transition period, 97% of karbovanets were taken out of circulation, including 56% in the first 5 days of the currency reform.

In 2007 the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts.

25|$|The {{economy of}} Ukraine overcame the heavy crisis caused by armed {{conflict}} in southeast part of country.

25|$|The <b>hryvnia</b> was {{introduced}} {{during the period}} when Victor Yushchenko {{was the chairman of}} National Bank of Ukraine. However, the first banknotes issued bore the signature of the previous National Bank chairman, Vadym Hetman, who resigned back in 1993, because the first notes had been printed as early as 1992 by the Canadian Bank Note Company, but it was decided to delay their circulation until the hyperinflation in Ukraine was brought under control.|$|E
