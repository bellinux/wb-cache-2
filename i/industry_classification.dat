For an industry grouping to be useful, its constituents should have a tighter correlation to each other than each has to the overall market. Indeed, analyses based on <b>industry</b> <b>classifications</b> assume that the personality of each industry group {{differs from that of}} the market in general, and that each industry responds to economic factors in a consistent but unique way.

40|$|Using a log-wage model, Horrace and Oaxaca (2001) propose {{estimator}}s of {{the gender}} wage gap across <b>industry</b> <b>classifications.</b> One estimator involves the maximum over sample estimates of population parameters, and inference on this estimator follows with the implicit assumption that the sample maximum equals the population maximum. This paper proposes inference procedures for this estimator that relax this assumption. Specifically, multiple comparisons with the best methods are used to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for industry wage gaps. Using data on fourteen <b>industry</b> <b>classifications,</b> inference experiments indicate that differences in gender wage gaps across industries are insignificant at the 95 % level.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop and test a method for selecting comparable firms {{on the basis of}} common analysts. The method is based on a Monte Carlo simulation on analyst choices, and it produces firm- and time-specific analyst-defined peer groups for sample firms. The analyst-defined peer groups are based entirely on analysts’ choices, and they are independent of conventional <b>industry</b> <b>classifications.</b> As part of the thesis, I also use the analyst-defined peer groups to study the effect of peer firms’ dividend initiations and stock splits on the propensity to initiate dividends and execute stock splits. DATA The sample of the thesis consists of firms listed in the NYSE and individual sell-side analysts who provide coverage for them. The analyst data is based on estimates in the IBES database, and the sources for company data are Compustat and Datastream databases. The sample covers years 1990 to 2007. RESULTS The results of the thesis indicate that, compared to conventional <b>industry</b> <b>classifications,</b> the analyst-defined peer groups are significantly better at explaining cross-sectional variation in valuation multiples and financial statement ratios. The explanatory power of the analyst-defined peer method outperforms the <b>industry</b> <b>classifications</b> on most tested variables also when firms without analyst-defined peers are excluded from the analysis. The method produces peer groups for approximately 50 % of the sample firms, and a limitation compared to conventional <b>industry</b> <b>classifications</b> is that peer firms can only be found for firms with sufficient analyst coverage. The results on dividend initiations and stock splits indicate that firms tend to initiate dividends and execute stock splits in the same years as their peers. The effects persist also after controlling for firm-level variables explaining dividend initiations and stock splits, which indicates that herding behavior is a possible explanation for the findings...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{multiple}} comparison {{methods to}} perform inference on labor market wage gap estimates from a regression model of wage determination. The regression decomposes {{a sample of}} workers' wages into a human capital component and a gender specific component; the gender component is called the gender differential or wage gap and is sometimes interpreted {{as a measure of}} sexual discrimination. Using data on fourteen <b>industry</b> <b>classifications</b> (e. g. retail sales, agriculture), a new relative estimator of the wage gap is calculated for each industry. The industries are then ranked based on the magnitude of these estimators, and inference experiments are performed using "multiple comparisons with the best" and "multiple comparisons with a control". The inference indicates that differences in gender discrimination across <b>industry</b> <b>classifications</b> is statistically insignificant at the 95 % confidence level and that previous studies which have failed to perform inference on gender wage gap order statistics may be misleading.
