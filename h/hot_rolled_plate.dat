The fatigue testing of all the grades was conducted in the VHCF regime using an ultrasonic fatigue testing equipment operating at 20 kHz. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the fracture surfaces revealed {{the presence of a}} microstructure controlled initial growth of short fatigue cracks in all the tested grades. Fracture surfaces of the failed specimens of a high strength martensitic steel grade revealed the typical fine granular area (FGA) within the fish-eye area around the internal inclusions. Fatigue crack initiation in the cold rolled strip duplex stainless steel grade occurred at surface defects left over by the cold rolling process of this grade. However, the presence of FGA around the surface crack initiating defect was observed similar to the internal crack initiations in the high strength martensitic steels. By mapping the FGA size development during VHCF loading, as obtained from fracture surfaces, FGA growth results were obtained. A similar study on <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>plate</b> duplex stainless steel grades, 2304 SRG and LDX 2101, revealed the presence of an initial crystallographic growth region (CGR) in which crack growth direction is changed by microstructural barriers such as phase and grain boundaries.

The detection {{and recognition of}} surface defects can provide effective information for production optimization. There are several types of surface defects on <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> steel <b>plates</b> which are covered by lots of scales. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to recognize eight kinds of typical surface defects from scales. Bandelet transform is applied to extraction of geometrical features. Firstly, each sample image is decomposed into multiple directional subbands at several scales by bandelet transform. Then, some statistical values of bandelet coefficients are calculated and combined into a feature vector from all subbands. In this process, several important parameters of bandelet transform are discussed and determined through experience and experiments.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} effects of material anisotropy on the yielding and hardening behavior of 2024 T 351 aluminum alloy using isotropic and anisotropic yield criteria. Anisotropy may be induced in a material during the manufacturing through processes like rolling or forging. This induced anisotropy gives rise to the concept of orientation-dependent material properties such as yield strength, ductility, strain hardening, fracture strength, or fatigue resistance. Inclusion of the effects of anisotropy is essential in correctly predicting the deformation behavior of a material. In this study, uniaxial tensile tests were first performed in all three rolling directions, L, T  and S, for smooth bar specimens made from <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>plate</b> of Al 2024 alloy. The experimental results showed that the L - and T -directions yielded higher yield strengths and a greater percentage of elongation before fracture than the S -direction. Subsequently, finite element analysis of tensile specimens was performed using isotropic (von Mises) and anisotropic (Hill) yield criteria to predict the onset of yielding and hardening behaviors during the course of deformation. Hill's criterion perfectly fitted with the test data in the S -direction, but slightly underestimated the yield strength in L -direction. The results indicated that the Hill yield criterion is the most suitable one to predict the onset of yielding and hardening behaviors for 2024 T 351 aluminum alloy in all directions...|$|E

While independent long term evaluation studies for copper-nickel itself are widely available, little data exists for these types of composite products.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} beam in buildings has {{known to be}} more economical compared to bare steel beams with hot-rolled steel section, as the composite action between steel and concrete results in significant savings in steel weight and reduce the beam depth. However, the use of {{composite beam}} with cold-formed steel of lipped C-channel {{is yet to be}} established as the structural behavior of such beam is not well understood. This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with cold formed steel section and innovative shear connectors. The composite beam comprises two cold formed steel of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of bracket shear connectors namely single bracket (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>plate</b> (HPSC) shear connectors were developed and used; the proposed shear connectors were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed stud (HSSC) shear connector welded to the top flange of cold formed steel beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed shear connectors. Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed shear connectors. The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all bracket shear connectors suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of shear connector increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed stud shear connectors, the stud possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite cold formed steel beam. Composite beam with HSSC shear connectors showed the best performance as compared to composite beams with SBSC, DBSC and HPSC shear connectors. Also, the results showed that the bending resistance of the composite beam increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. It is concluded that the proposed composite beams with cold formed steel section are strong enough to be used in small and medium size buildings...|$|E

In the dilatometric experiments, it was found that a reduction in the C content increased the phase transformation temperatures, decreased the hardness and promoted quasi-polygonal ferrite (QF) formation over granular bainitic ferrite (GBF) and bainitic ferrite (BF), {{but at the same time}} the sensitivity of the phase transformation temperatures and hardness to cooling rates was reduced. Mechanical testing of laboratory <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>plates</b> revealed that the targeted yield strength of 500 MPa was reached even in the steel with the lowest C content (0. 011 wt-%). An increase in C content did not considerably increase the yield strength, although the tensile strength was more significantly increased. Impact toughness properties, in turn, were markedly deteriorated due to this C content increment. Microstructural analysis of the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>plates</b> showed that an increase in C content decreased the fraction of QF and consequently increased the fraction of GBF and BF, as well as the size and fraction of C-enriched secondary microconstituents.

40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements is established to investigate the structural performance of bolted connections between cold-formed steel strips and <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> steel <b>plates</b> under shear. Non-linear material, geometrical and contact analysis is carried out to predict the load-extension curves of typical bolted connections with cold-formed steel strips of high yield strength and low ductility. The failure mode {{of interest in the}} present investigation is the bearing failure of cold-formed steel strip around bolt holes; a full description of the {{finite element model}} is presented. Based on test data, a stress-strain curve for the cold-formed steel strip is proposed which allows the cold-formed steel strip to yield and degrade in strength at large strain. The load-extension curves of four sets of test specimens were successfully predicted up to an extension of 3 mm. The predicted bearing resistance and the extensional stiffness of the bolted connections compare well with test data. It is found that stress-strain curves, contact stiffness and frictional coefficient between element interfaces, and clamping force developed in bolt shanks are important parameters for accurate prediction of the load-extension curves of bolted connections.
