40|$|In a {{companion}} paper (Guo, Guo, Billings, Coca, and Lang 2010), {{the concept of}} frequency response functions (GFRFs) has been extended to describe the characteristics of spatio-temporal dynamical systems over an unbounded spatial domain from a frequency domain point of view. In this paper, a similar point of view will be taken to investigate spatial-temporal dynamical systems over a bounded spatial domain in the frequency domain. The main difference is that due to the bounded spatial domain, the property of translation invariance {{with respect to the}} spatial domain is not valid any more. In order to overcome this, the paper provides a new definition of impulse response functions, which is different from the standard impulse definitions. The <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of spatio-temporal generalised frequency response functions are given for linear and nonlinear spatio-temporal systems based on this newly defined impulse response function.

Subsequently, own definition of myth is proposed, following and elaborating the theories of P. Ricoeur, L. Coupe, D. Cupitt, and others. Myth is then perceived as a dialectics between narrative and mythic motives which are not unalterable but, in the context created by a story, they obtain always a new meaning. In such manner, myths form chains of interconnected versions that are open for future interpretations in the process of "radical typology. " Myths are not restricted to the realm of religion, "radical typology" factors profane context into calculation. Individual links of the chains of myths can represent pieces of literature as well.

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the proportion of}} the male population that reports having paid for sex in different regions. Methods: Clients of sex workers were identified from representative samples of men asked in face-to-face interviews whether they had had sex in exchange for money or whether they had paid for sex, in the last 12 months. A total of 78 national household surveys and nine city based surveys were selected for inclusion. Where such surveys were not available, results of behavioural surveillance surveys and of research studies were also used. Using national estimates, a median percentage of men who reported paying for sex was calculated for each region. Results: The median percentage of men who exchanged sex for money in the last 12 months in all regions was around 9 - 10 %, with estimates from 13 % to 15 % in Central African region, 10 to 11 % in Eastern and southern Africa, and 5 - 7 % in Asia and Latin America. Estimates for men who paid sex were much lower at around 2 - 3 % with ranges from 7 % in the South African region to 1 % in Asia and West Africa. Conclusions: Although errors of measurement and critical issues of <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> exist, this compilation represents a first attempt to obtain reasonably coherent estimates of the proportion of men who were clients of sex workers at regional level. Large discrepancies between regions were found. Further improvements in national estimates will be critical to monitor coverage of HIV prevention programmes for sex workers and clients, and to improve estimates of national HIV infection prevalence levels in low and concentrated HIV epidemics.

40|$|In {{this book}} we {{investigate}} the prevailing views on integration in 17 European countries, how those views are translated into national policy, and what efforts countries are making {{to monitor the}} integration processes of migrants and track them over time. The book describes {{the degree to which}} migrants participate in their 'new' country and what precisely should be understood by the term 'participation'. Because while the aim is to streamline integration policy in Europe and to base it more on common principles, ultimately integration remains primarily the responsibility of individual European countries. The EU has no competence for harmonising legislation on integration. Although the EU has formulated official definitions and descriptions of important concepts, such as the definition of what a migrant is and what the key aspects of integration are, {{this does not mean that}} countries always feel bound to apply those definitions in their specific national circumstances. Political reality and social sensitivities often lead countries to their own choices, <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of concepts. The migration history of European countries is diverse; for some countries it is a new phenomenon, while for others - for example those with a colonial past - it is something they have been familiar with for many years. The inward and outward migration flows differ considerably across countries; migratory motives also differ, and the population profile varies. These are some of the factors which explain why integration policy and the way in which that policy is evaluated and monitored currently present a very diverse picture across Europe.

Some states have significantly improved the health of their citizens by reducing smoking rates, thereby decreasing smoking-related diseases, deaths, and health care costs. Even in economically challenging times, states can make a significant difference in public health by employing high-impact, cost-effective tobacco control and prevention strategies to: Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies; Protect people from tobacco smoke; Offer help to quit tobacco use; Warn people about the dangers of tobacco; Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship; Raise state cigarette taxes on tobacco.

40|$|The article {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} concept of transitional justice {{in the sphere of}} public and academical debates, in different social environments during the transition period in the recent history. The approach will include an overflight over some <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of that concept and an assessment of possible applications of this concept in the reparative (corrective) theories during the political transition. The evaluation of operational dimension of transitional justice will focus primarily the moral grounds invoked in political and juridical debates, and will pursue some applications of the transitional justice in intergenerational justice realm and {{at the level of the}} institution of retroactivity. Also, the assessment will focus the moral core of the motivation of judicial decisions in the space of positive law debates, concerning the constitutional and normative dimension. Examination of particular aspects of the transition has raised particular interest in the public agenda of romanian political change. Reparation issues in dealing with the past had always occupied a privileged role in public debate, in social and political problems. Justification for corrective measures during transition period were presented on various occasions in different points of view, but tools and proper institutions in generating legitimate formal-political obligations were absent, threatening the strength of the the political stability. Requirements for application of a corrective, reparative justice, appeared as a consequence of subjective awareness of rights and liberties that positive law of the communist system ignored or assign them like law infrigement. An approach of such rights, with their features should be evaluated in the context of both totalitarian and democratic state. A dialogue with the past becomes more necesary and will contribute to the success of any public policy designed for any possible reparation in the future. Transitional justice could also be a frame for testing the theoretical outcomes of an analytical justice which could bring normative results in intergenerational justice. One of the most important issues which requires an approach in transitional justice perspective remains the institution of retroactivity...|$|E

30|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) {{have triggered}} controversies {{at a number}} of levels, from technical scientific details in risk assessment and regulation, to trade and other large-scale political decision-making processes. Clearly, these levels are interrelated. There is legitimate public concern over the safety of GMOs, related to putative human as well as ecosystem health. The concern must, however, be accompanied by scientific evidence. Furthermore, concepts such as ‘safety’, ‘risk’ or ‘scientific justification’ are not clear-cut <b>and</b> need <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although as a {{landlocked}} country, Azerbaijan has {{no access}} to the open sea (hence the ocean), it has a coastline of 713 km on the Caspian Sea, which is a lake or a closed sea depending on various <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Because of its large size and being bordered by five countries, it has (still partially undefined) maritime borders and naval forces by all five Caspian littoral states. Azerbaijan's maritime boundaries with Russia and Kazakhstan have been determined, but is still disputed with Iran and Turkmenistan.|$|R
50|$|African {{socialism}} is {{a belief}} in sharing economic resources in a traditional African way, as distinct from classical socialism. Many African politicians of the 1950s and 1960s professed their support for African socialism, although <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretations</b> of this term varied considerably. This is because African socialism {{has not been the}} product of one single thinker. One example of a definition of African socialism was phrased as a metaphor by de Graft Johnson, from the University of Ghana, in 1962: the African extended-family system writ large.|$|R
