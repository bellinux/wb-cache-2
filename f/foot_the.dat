5|$|The British amassed their army, {{under the}} command of General James Abercrombie, near the remains of Fort William Henry, which lay at the {{southern}} end of Lake George but had been destroyed following its capture by the French the previous year. The army numbered fully 16,000 men, making it the largest single force ever deployed in North America at the time. Its complement of 6,000 regular troops included Lord John Murray's Highlanders of the 42nd (Highland) Regiment of <b>Foot,</b> <b>the</b> 27th (Enniskillen) Regiment of <b>Foot,</b> <b>the</b> 44th Regiment of Foot, 46th Regiment of <b>Foot,</b> <b>the</b> 55th Regiment of <b>Foot,</b> <b>the</b> 1st and 4th battalions of 60th (Royal American) Regiment, and Gage’s Light Infantry, while the provinces providing militia support included Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. On July 5, 1758, these troops embarked on boats, which unloaded them at the north end of Lake George on July 6.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, 901 New York Avenue NW was 75 percent leased, at {{an average}} cost of $36 per square <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> {{delivery}} date was changed once more to September 2004. The building, however, was eventually delivered in early 2005.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused {{to each other and}} to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the <b>foot</b> (<b>the</b> second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E

5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry {{because of the presence of}} French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th <b>Foot,</b> <b>the</b> Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{a two-day}} match against Yorkshire, Miller struck 111 {{including}} three sixes when {{none of the}} teammates passed 30. His innings featured strokes from both {{the front and back}} <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> next day, he scored 75 in 83 minutes against Durham and took 2/1 in another win for the RAAF. That was the first of four back-to-back one-dayers for the RAAF; Miller scored two, 23 and nine against Scottish Services, Greenock and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|Skis used in {{cross-country}} are {{lighter and}} narrower than {{those used in}} alpine skiing. Ski bottoms are {{designed to provide a}} gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.|$|E

Making their way back to the {{hospital}} on <b>foot,</b> <b>the</b> group stops at a clearing which is actually a Conquistador graveyard. Anne and Peter are attacked by corpses rising from the earth. Brian rescues them, but Susan is killed after a zombie bit into her throat.|$|E
500|$|Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion {{refer to}} {{extension}} or flexion of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> at <b>the</b> ankle. These terms refer to flexion between <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> body's dorsal surface, considered {{the front of}} the leg, and flexion between <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> body's plantar surface, considered the back of the leg. These terms are used to resolve confusion, as technically extension of the joint refers to dorsiflexion, which could be considered counter-intuitive as the motion reduces the angle between <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and <b>the</b> leg.|$|R

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{and most of its}} levels are navigated on <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress. A morality choice in the prologue alters the game's entire storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced throughout the timelines. The game features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Edge, a young mercenary who battles {{an empire}} on a flying dragon and encounters a mysterious girl from a vanished civilization. Unlike the other Panzer Dragoon games, which are rail shooters, the player has free 3D movement and some areas are explored on <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> battle system mixes real-time and turn-based elements, with the player circling enemies on the dragon to expose weak spots and escape dangerous positions.|$|E
5|$|Underground {{is built}} upon the skateboarding formula of {{previous}} Tony Hawk's games: the player explores levels and completes goals while performing tricks. The game features a new focus on customization; the player, instead of selecting a professional skater, creates a custom character. Underground adds {{the ability for}} players to dismount their boards and explore on <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> plot follows the player character {{and his or her}} friend Eric Sparrow as the two become well-known professionals and grow apart.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} Panzer Dragoon games, which are rail shooters, Panzer Dragoon Saga is a {{role-playing}} video game (RPG). The player controls the young mercenary Edge, who flies a powerful dragon. Gameplay {{is divided into}} three modes: traversing large areas on the dragon, battling enemies, and exploring on <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> game uses a random encounter system, whereby battles are triggered randomly as the player flies.|$|E
5|$|With some difficulty, a five-month-old was chosen, and {{assigned}} army number 25142301—which represents regiment number 2514, 23rd Regiment of <b>Foot</b> (<b>the</b> original {{name of the}} Royal Welsh Fusiliers), and 01 denoting the 1st Battalion. The new goat will also be called William Windsor, beginning as a fusilier while being trained for military life. He will receive a ration of two cigarettes per day, which he eats, but will not be permitted Guinness until he is older.|$|E
5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill for the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E

An improvement of the simple lever-and- tilt hammer device operated by one's <b>foot,</b> <b>the</b> hydraulic-powered trip hammer used for pounding, , and polishing grain was first mentioned in the Han dictionary Jijiupian of 40 BCE. It was also mentioned in the Regional Speech (Fangyan) dictionary written by Yang Xiong (53 BCE– 18 CE) in 15 BCE, the philosophical Xinlun 新論 written by Huan Tan (43 BCE– 28 CE) in 20 CE, the poetry of Ma Rong (79–166 CE), and the writings of Kong Rong (153–208 CE).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a {{standing}} army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. Their role was of such importance that the Scots Parliament forced Queen Anne to give royal assent to the controversial 1704 Act of Security by threatening to withdraw Scottish forces back out of the Confederate armies. The new British Army created by the Act of Union in 1707 incorporated existing Scottish regiments, such as the Scots Guards, The Royal Scots 1st of Foot, King's Own Scottish Borderers 25th of <b>Foot,</b> <b>The</b> Cameronians 26th of Foot, Scots Greys and the Royal Scots Fusiliers 21st of <b>Foot.</b> <b>The</b> new armed forces were controlled by the War Office and Admiralty from London. During this period, Scottish soldiers and sailors were instrumental in supporting the expansion of the British Empire and became involved in international conflicts, including the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch, the 43rd (later 42nd) regiment, in 1740. It marked the beginning of a major role for Highlanders within the British military structure, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion and would not begin in earnest until the late 1750s.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on <b>foot,</b> <b>the</b> Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
