Since this time the college has become <b>fully</b> <b>mixed,</b> with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred.

Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate numbers have been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E

Admixing states creates new quasiparticles with unusual material properties. Their pursuit is relevant to efficient low-threshold lasers, nonlinear optical materials for switching that outperform anything previously available, and solid-state Bose–Einstein condensates that underpin quantum technologies.

2500|$|Though {{the album}} was {{completed}} and <b>fully</b> <b>mixed</b> by November 1972, Trident spent months {{trying to get a}} record company to release it. After eight months of failing that, they took the initiative and released it themselves in 1973. During this time, Queen had begun writing material for their next album, but they were disheartened by the current album's delay, feeling they had grown past that stage, even though the record-buying public was just getting wind of them. They recorded two BBC sessions during the interim. The first single, [...] "Keep Yourself Alive" [...] (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version) was released a week before the album (UK dates, 6 and 13 July respectively). The track length was edited for release in the US, from 3:47 to 3:30. The US single was issued in October. All countries had the B-side [...] "Son and Daughter". The album was released in the US on 4 September.|$|E

This was broadcast live on Norway's main national TV carrier NRK. The setlist for this show consisted of tracks from the band's recent transfiguration Abrahadabra, leading tracks [...] "Vredysbyrd" [...] and [...] "Progenies of the Great Apocalypse" [...] from Death Cult Armageddon, as well as newly updated versions of tracks from their standard back catalog; [...] "The Serpentine Offering", [...] "Kings of the Carnival Creation", and [...] "Mourning Palace" [...] which were re-orchestrated by Gaute Storaas. The band played a similar show the following year at the Wacken Open Air festival, having yet performed a second live show with a symphony orchestra and choir. This time, they were accompanied by the Czech National Orchestra with the same choir, being the second band in the festival's history to play with a live orchestra and choir (next to German power metal band Rage's 2007 performance). The show was broadcast live on Germany's Kultur TV arts channel. Silenoz has also said in several recent interviews that both live sets have been <b>fully</b> <b>mixed</b> and will be accompanied by a feature-length documentary and bonus material when released. [...] In late 2011-2012 the band went on a special tour for fans in various European countries, including playing in some small, intimate venues celebrating their 1997 album Enthrone Darkness Triumphant by playing the album in its entirety, alongside an additional set of various fan favourite tracks, following a poll to fans directly, asking which of their first 3 albums would they want to see played in full on their next European tour.|$|E

Also, change law of throat tube inlet function shows the reason why pulse liquid jet pump could improve performance, mainly to increase the entrainment rate. 1...|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{rejuvenation}} behaviors of Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 (at.%) BMGs upon DCT have been investigated. At high casting temperature, for the <b>fully</b> <b>mixing</b> of elements, <b>fully</b> amorphous phase with quite homogeneous structure can be fabricated after quenching. No rejuvenation occurs for these samples {{because of the}} lack of internal stress during cyclically cooling and heating. In the contrary, at low casting temperature, for the element segregation, nano-cluster dispersed amorphous structure can be observed, which generates high internal stress and causes the rejuvenation of samples upon DCT. The rejuvenated sample with more free volume shows better plasticity than As-cast ones. These findings provide a novel method to tailor the microstructure of as-cast BMG samples, which affects both the mechanical properties and rejuvenation behavior during the following DCT treatment.|$|R
