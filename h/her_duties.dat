5|$|Louise {{was bored}} at court, and by {{fulfilling}} <b>her</b> <b>duties,</b> which were {{little more than}} minor secretarial tasks, such as writing letters on the Queen's behalf; dealing with political correspondence; and providing the Queen with company, she had more responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between <b>her</b> <b>duties</b> as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E

"Since {{you insist}} so much upon my 'duty,' I {{must say that}} {{it seems to me that}} an honest girl in my {{position}} has three duties to consider, and not one, as you say, Lady Bellamy.

5|$|During the Obama presidency, some {{progressive}} {{lawyers and}} activists called for Ginsburg to retire so Obama {{would be able}} to appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate. They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain. Ginsburg rejected these pleas. She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform <b>her</b> <b>duties.</b> Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.|$|E

5|$|Journey was {{the last}} game made under a three-game {{contract}} between Thatgamecompany and Sony, the first two being Flow and Flower. Development of the game began in 2009, {{after the release of}} Thatgamecompany's previous title Flower. The 18-person development team for Journey was composed mainly of creators of the company's previous games; co-founder Jenova Chen was the creative director and Nick Clark returned as lead designer.

5|$|Latouche-Tréville was recommissioned on 15 February 1907 and {{assigned}} to the gunnery school. The following month, her torpedo tubes were removed. On 22 September 1908, her aft turret was badly damaged when one of her loaded guns misfired when the breech was opened. The ignition of the propellant blew the breechblock through the turret door and threw the sighting hood onto the ship's deck. The ship was saved from being lost by a crewman who closed the door between the magazine and the ammunition hoist. Fourteen crewmen were killed and five were wounded in the incident. Repairs took {{until the end of}} the year to complete, and she resumed <b>her</b> <b>duties</b> until she was again placed in reserve on 1 January 1912. Latouche-Tréville was recommissioned on 20 November for service in the Levant; she departed Toulon on 10 December and arrived in Port Said, Egypt on 16 December. The ship was refitted in Bizerta, Tunisia, from 8 November 1913 to 26 December, during which time her military masts were replaced by light pole masts.

5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with <b>her</b> <b>duties.</b> As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and <b>her</b> <b>duties</b> as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{television}} series Smallville, the character of Chloe Sullivan appeared in her own web-based spin-off series, titled Smallville: Chloe Chronicles. Allison Mack continued <b>her</b> <b>duties</b> as the investigative, high school reporter, with the series originally airing exclusively on AOL.com. The first volume aired between April 29, 2003 and May 20, 2003. The web series eventually {{made its way to}} Britain's Channel 4 website. Smallville: Chloe Chronicles was created by Mark Warshaw, with the scripts written by Brice Tidwell; Allison Mack was given final script approval. This final approval allowed Mack to review and make changes to the script as she saw fit. Warshaw also communicated regularly with Gough and Millar so that he could find more unique ways to expand Smallville stories over to Chloe's Chronicles.|$|E

5|$|Cormoran {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career abroad, usually in Germany's South Pacific colonies in the Samoan Islands. <b>Her</b> <b>duties</b> there typically consisted of survey work and suppressing colonial unrest. She briefly cruised in South African waters in late 1894 and early 1895 before steaming to the Pacific. She participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in the Shandong Peninsula in China in 1897. Cormoran returned to Germany in 1903 and was modernized in 190708. The following year, {{she returned to the}} South Pacific, where she remained until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Docked in Tsingtau for repairs at the onset of hostilities, she was unable to actively take part in the fighting. She was therefore disarmed and scuttled in the harbor; her guns were used to strengthen the defenses of the port.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, the Methodist Church {{helped the}} merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president.

From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had to cut back her time as president because of <b>her</b> <b>duties</b> in Washington, DC. Funding declined {{during this period of}} her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status. By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by her many responsibilities.|$|E
