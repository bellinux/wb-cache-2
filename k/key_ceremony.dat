5000|$|The {{thesis that}} emerged, {{according}} to which all aspects of Kwakiutl culture, and especially the <b>key</b> <b>ceremony</b> of the much-studied potlatch, hitherto studied as {{a classic example of}} materialist interests underlying ritual organizations, were coterminous with religion, and religion in term was grounded in the way nature is perceived, proved controversial among area specialists- As an anti-functionalist, he was opposed to cultural materialism. [...] Bill Holm was sceptical, noting that Goldman lacked adequate familiarity with the Kwakiutl language in which these primary texts were written. This same charge from area specialists had been made earlier against his work on Polynesia. This lack of intimate linguistic knowledge caused him to make many errors in his review of Kwakiutl texts, and Holm found Goldman's conclusions both unconvincing and disturbing. Philip Drucker ended his review by challenging Goldman's insistence that all aspects of the Kwakiutl lifeway were expressive of religious belief, and judged this approach preconceived, extremist and not believable. For him, Goldman's argument was both monotonous and biased.|$|E
5000|$|King Agaja, {{grandson}} of Houegbadja, {{came to the}} throne in 1718 and began significant expansion of the Kingdom of Dahomey. By 1720, King Agaja repudiated the kingdom's allegiance to Allada and began increasing military activity throughout the region. In 1724, Agaja offered his military to help with a succession struggle within Allada. [...] However, he turned his forces on the army of Allada and took over the city, relocating his capital from Abomey to Allada. [...] In 1727, Agaja took over the city of Whydah and thus became the primary force on {{a major part of}} the coast. [...] In 1729, Agaja began war against the Oyo Empire with a number of cross-border raids. [...] During the war, the royal family of Whydah returned to the throne forcing Agaja to fight to reclaim the city. He moved much of his army with a significant portion in the back composed of women dressed like male warriors (this is possibly the beginning of the Dahomey Amazons). The Whydah royal family had assumed that the Dahomey army had been weakened in the war with Oyo and, upon seeing such a large force, fled from the city. [...] In 1730 the war with Oyo ended and Dahomey retained domestic control but became a tributary of the Oyo empire. [...] By the end of Agaja's reign, the Kingdom of Dahomey occupied significant area, particularly the crucial coastal slave trade cities. At the same time, Agaja created much of the administrative apparatus of the kingdom and instituted the <b>key</b> <b>ceremony</b> of the Annual Customs, or Xwetanu in Fon.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, only the chief's {{daughter}} was eligible {{to wear the}} malu and it was applied to these young women {{in the years following}} puberty. Women with the malu were expected to perform <b>key</b> <b>ceremony</b> tasks and represent their families and villages on ceremonial occasions. However in 1930, anthropologist Te Rangi Hiroa observed that [...] "...the tattooing of a girl is often used as an opportunity for a student to try his prentice hand. This is also rendered possible by {{the fact that there is}} no fusita (fine mat) passed or any of the ceremony that marks the tattooing of the male. It is often sufficient reward for the novice to have the opportunity of practice and to be well fed during the period occupied by the operation...For the daughter of a high chief, who is to become the village taupou, it can be readily understood that an expert artist would be requisitioned and his reward greater." [...] Ceremonial roles are still important in Samoan society and are restricted in similar ways to particular people with the correct qualifications and cultural knowledge, but the significance of the malu has shifted. From at least the 1990s, there has been less emphasis on chiefly qualifications, and women of a variety of backgrounds and ages have been tattooed with the malu. However, the malu is not important to all Samoans, or the only symbol of an individuals commitment or participation in samoan cultural life. In the Samoan congregations of some churches, men and women have been discouraged from getting tattooed.' In New Zealand and Australia, the malu is increasingly important as a symbol of Samoan cultural identity rather than only a signifier of a persons ability to carry out specific Samoan ceremonial roles. The contemporary meanings and significance of malu are often vigorously contested and in recent years this has become especially noticeable in social media forums when tattooists and tattooed people share photographs of their tattoos. It is clear from these most public debates that the changes in meaning for all forms of Samoan tattooing are being made by the people who wear the images as much as the tattooists who create them.|$|E

40|$|Seventy {{years have}} passed {{since the end of the}} Asia-Pacific War, yet Japan remains embroiled in {{controversy}} with its neighbors over the war’s commemoration. Among the many points of contention between Japan, China, and South Korea are interpretations of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, apologies and compensation for foreign victims of Japanese aggression, prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and the war’s portrayal in textbooks. Collectively, these controversies have come to be called the “history problem. ” But why has the problem become so intractable? Can it ever be resolved, and if so, how? To answer these questions, the author mobilizes the sociology of collective memory and social movements, political theories of apology and reconciliation, psychological research on intergroup conflict, and philosophical reflections on memory and history. The history problem, he argues, is essentially a relational phenomenon caused when nations publicly showcase self-serving versions of the past at <b>key</b> <b>ceremonies</b> and events: Japan, South Korea, and China all focus on what happened to their own citizens with little regard for foreign others. Saito goes on to explore the emergence of a cosmopolitan form of commemoration taking humanity, rather than nationality, as its primary frame of reference, an approach increasingly used by a transnational network of advocacy NGOs, victims of Japan’s past wrongdoings, historians, and educators. When cosmopolitan commemoration is practiced as a collective endeavor by both perpetrators and victims, the author argues, a resolution of the history problem—and eventual reconciliation—will finally become possible...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the murder}} of his rival John Comyn on 10 February at Greyfriars in Dumfries, and the crisis this act incited, Robert the Bruce’s inaugural {{ceremony}} took place at Scone in late March 1306. Much about this ceremony is speculative; however, subsequent retrospective legitimisation of the Bruce claims to the royal succession would suggest that all possible means by which Robert’s inauguration could emulate his Canmore predecessors and outline his right to rule on a level playing field with his contemporaries were amplified, particularly where they served the common purpose of legitimising Robert’s highly questioned hold on power. Fourteenth-century Scottish history is inextricably entwined in the Wars of Independence, civil strife and an accelerated struggle for autonomous rule and independence. The historiography of this period is unsurprisingly heavily dominated by such themes and, while this has been offset by works exploring subjects such as the tomb of Bruce and the piety of the Bruce dynasty, the ceremonial history of this era remains firmly in the shadows. This paper will address three <b>key</b> <b>ceremonies</b> through which a king would, traditionally, make powerful statements of royal authority: the inauguration or coronation of Bruce; the marriage of his infant son to the English princess Joan of the Tower in 1328, and his extravagant funeral ceremony in 1329. By focusing thus this paper hopes to shed new light on the ‘dark and drublie days’ of fourteenth-century Scotland and reveal that glory, dynastic majesty and pleasure were as central to the Scottish monarchy in this era as war and political turbulence...|$|R

50|$|Since aristocratic {{children}} between the ages of 10 and 20 took part in genpuku in order to assume adult status and responsibilities, the role of the aristocratic child was to prepare for adult life. For both male and female children, studies in the Heian Period began between ages 3 and 4, usually under the supervision of a wet nurse and perhaps her husband. Children of these ages were taught about <b>key</b> court <b>ceremonies,</b> Buddhist doctrine, and proper ethics. At the age of seven they moved on to more formal learning, specifically studying the skills needed to navigate court life and to succeed in court positions. Skills included, but were by no means limited to, handwriting and calligraphy, and were mainly an education requirement for male children; however, the education of girls was important as well. The ultimate goal of children, whether they were male or female, was to successfully carry on their families tradition and reputation. Proper education for girls tied to successful or advantageous marriage, or their future ability to maintain a wealthy patron within the court.|$|R
