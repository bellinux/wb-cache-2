As Australia in 1940 became increasingly involved in World War II and expanded its military forces, Madgwick and colleagues David Drummond, C.E.W. Bean, (Sir) Robert W. Wallace (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney), Richard Charles Mills, W.G.K. Duncan, Alf A.J. Conlon, and others began to publicly {{call for the}} Australian Army to install an adult education program to combat illiteracy among its members and <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> in the political history of Australia. Beginning in May 1940 and culminating in a special conference on 20 August 1940, Madgwick and the others cooperatively drafted an adult education scheme for the Army.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{regarded}} the emperor {{as a mere}} man who was as much under God's authority as were his subjects, and Christian values favored the social emancipation of women and children. The church permitted the remarriage of widows (as taught by the apostle Paul, not traditionally allowed in East Asian societies), prohibited concubinage and polygamy, and forbade cruelty to or desertion of wives. Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required to <b>educate</b> <b>them.</b> Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in Asian culture) were prohibited.|$|E

25|$|The {{view that}} {{sexuality}} is victimization teaches girls {{to be careful}} of being sexually victimized and taken advantage of. Educators who hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls how to say no, teaching them of the risks of being victims and <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> about risks and diseases of being sexually active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective does not address the existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|E
25|$|Recorded missionary {{efforts in}} Denmark started with Willibrord, Apostle to the Frisians, who preached in Schleswig, {{which at the}} time was part of Denmark. He went north from Frisia {{sometime}} between 710 and 718 during the reign of King Ongendus. Willibrord and his companions had little success: the king was respectful but had no interest in changing his beliefs. Agantyr did permit 30 young men to return to Frisia with Willibrord. Perhaps Willibrord's intent was to <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> and recruit some of them to join his efforts to bring Christianity to the Danes. A century later Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims and Willerich, later Bishop of Bremen, baptized a few persons during their 823 visit to Denmark. He returned to Denmark twice to proselytize but without any recorded success.|$|E

25|$|During 1768–1774, no {{progress}} was made in setting up a national school system. Catherine continued to investigate educational {{theory and practice of}} other countries. She made many educational reforms despite the lack of a national school system. The remodelling of the Cadet Corps 1766 initiated many educational reforms. It then began to take children from a very young age and <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> until the age of 21. The curriculum was broadened from the professional military curriculum to include the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law. This policy in the Cadet Corps influenced the teaching in the Naval Cadet Corps and in the Engineering and Artillery Schools. After the war and the defeat of Pugachev, Catherine laid the obligation to establish schools at the guberniya—a provincial subdivision of the Russian empire ruled by a governor—on the Boards of Social Welfare set up with the participation of elected representatives from the three free estates.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{however, the}} Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and {{moved from the}} liberalist to neoliberalist {{point of view of}} how to deal with {{imperial}} possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard the rights of the natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat. With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order. This was due to the assumption that subjects of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation to <b>educate</b> <b>them</b> in the sphere and set an example. The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding racial differences which could not weaken it. This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, something {{that a large number of}} Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.|$|E
