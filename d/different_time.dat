5|$|S. C. Hawkes {{argues that}} the eight items in the hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins.

5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a mutated {{bandicoot}} {{who must}} travel through time and stop Doctor Neo Cortex from gathering the Crystals. He is aided by Aku Aku, an ancient witch doctor mask who protects Crash from harm {{and gives him}} sage advice between levels. Also helping Crash is his younger sister Coco Bandicoot, who gathers the Crystals on the Great Wall of China, on the surfaces above Atlantis and in the skies of World War I Europe. Crash's enemy, Doctor Neo Cortex, has been aided by his mentor, Aku Aku's twin brother Uka Uka. Aku Aku previously locked Uka Uka away to protect the world from him, but has been freed because of Cortex's bumblings. Aiding Doctor Cortex and Uka Uka is Doctor Nefarious Tropy, the self-proclaimed master {{of time and the}} creator of the Time Twisting Machine used to gather Crystals and Gems in <b>different</b> <b>time</b> periods. Cortex's other allies include Tiny Tiger, a tall, hulking beast who battles Crash in the Colosseum; Dingodile, a half-dingo half-crocodile hybrid with a large flamethrower; and Doctor N. Gin, a scientist with a missile in his head.|$|E

5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many <b>different</b> <b>time</b> periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a <b>different</b> <b>time</b> from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{somewhat}} controversial {{argument is}} that evolution in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural proteins (such as enzymes), control embryonic development. In turn, these regulatory genes {{turn out to be}} based on a very old set of highly conserved genes which Carroll nicknames the toolkit. Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that toolkit genes such as Hox must have evolved before the Cambrian radiation which created most of the animal body plans that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication but far more often by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same signal may be given at a <b>different</b> <b>time</b> in development, in {{a different part of the}} embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in <b>different</b> <b>time</b> zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between <b>different</b> <b>time</b> machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E

5|$|Time Gal is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to <b>different</b> <b>time</b> periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, {{which can}} be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included <b>different</b> <b>time</b> periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E
5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given {{at the moment when}} the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a <b>different</b> <b>time</b> (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.|$|E

5|$|XIII-2 begins {{three years}} after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the {{collapse}} of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several <b>different</b> <b>time</b> periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called Chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.|$|E
