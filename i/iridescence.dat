5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong <b>iridescence,</b> to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E

50|$|Ctenolepisma ciliata is {{a species}} of {{primitive}} insect of the order Thysanura (= Zygentoma). Described from Spain, {{it is a common}} species in subarid habitats of the Mediterranean bassin from Portugal to Western Asia. It is very close to C. longicaudata. Its dorsal pattern is usually uniformly brownish or greyish with <b>iridescences,</b> or with two or four longitudinal fringes along the abdomen. Anatomic/morphologic differences with related species involve microscopic characters as setation or shape and distribution of scales.|$|R
5|$|Meat ant {{workers may}} be {{confused}} with those of I. lividus, as the two appear similar and are grouped in the same species complex. I. lividus and the much more localised I. spadius can be distinguished from {{other members of the}} I. purpureus group by the shape of the pronotum. Aside from colour differentiation that was a key morphological character to distinguish I. purpureus and the synonym I. greensladei from each other, some meat ant populations exhibit polymorphism despite being monomorphic (occurs in a particular form); specifically, body size among meat ants may vary geographically. For example, those that are found in very hot regions tend to be larger, whereas those found in regions of high humidity tend to be smaller than average. Examined workers once referred to as I. greensladei from southwestern Western Australia have erect setae on the genae (lateral sclerites), whereas those studied elsewhere have glabrous genae, meaning that these areas have no hairs. Such patterns are most likely clinal, where several characteristics may gradually differentiate over a geographical area. The colour of the setae throughout the body and the <b>iridescence</b> may vary geographically. For example, populations restricted to the coasts of Western Australia usually have pale setae, compared to most colonies throughout the country, which have the common blackish setae. In 1993, Shattuck could not separate populations with pale setae when other key diagnostic traits that would separate these populations were not considered. Meat ants from the Western Australian wheatbelt and goldfields show different iridescence; the <b>iridescence</b> in some collected specimens ranged from pale greenish-blue to yellowish-green, especially around the humeri (a structure which forms the basal corner of an insect's wing or wing case) and frons. The variation of the <b>iridescence</b> is, however, a consistent pattern found in other Iridomyrmex species with little distinction, making it a subtle character. The colour variation is less marked in all collected specimens of I. purpureus, as well as its close relative I. viridiaeneus, which is found in dry regions around the south-western regions. Shattuck further notes that populations found throughout the Northern Territory and South Australia have reduced pubescence on the first gastral tergite, but this is different elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{was first}} observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young a century later. Young described <b>iridescence</b> {{as the result}} of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 study {{proposed}} the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from the Tibetan Plateau {{with a narrow}} white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali's swift, A. salimali, the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth's swift, A. leuconyx, and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia, characterised by a green <b>iridescence</b> and shallow tail fork, is split as Cook's swift, A. cooki. The remaining subspecies are the nominate A. p. pacificus and the southern race A. p. kurodae (which includes the Tibetan population formerly named as kanoi). This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2012 paper showed that cooki {{is closely related to}} the dark-rumped swift, A. acuticauda, which should therefore be included in the pacificus clade, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.|$|E

50|$|And, when {{a colored}} object has both diffuse and {{specular}} reflection, usually only the diffuse component is colored. A cherry reflects diffusely red light, absorbs all other colors {{and has a}} specular reflection which is essentially white (if the incident light is white light). This is quite general, because, except for metals, the reflectivity of most materials depends on their refractive index, which varies little with the wavelength (though it is this variation that causes the chromatic dispersion in a prism), so that all colors are reflected nearly with the same intensity. Reflections from different origin, instead, may be colored: metallic reflections, such as in gold or copper, or interferential reflections: <b>iridescences,</b> peacock feathers, butterfly wings, beetle elytra, or the antireflection coating of a lens.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} method for reproducing diffraction colours on natural surfaces with complex nanostructures {{that can be}} represented as height-fields. Our method employs Chebyshev approximations to accurately model view-dependent <b>iridescences</b> for such a surface into its spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). As main contribution, our method significantly reduces the runtime memory footprint from precomputed lookup tables without compromising photorealism. Our accuracy is comparable with current state-of-the-art methods and better at equal memory usage. Furthermore, a Chebyshev polynomial basis set with its near-best approximation properties allow for scalable memory-vs-performance trade-offs. We show realistic diffraction effects with just two lookup textures for natural, quasi-periodic surface nanostructures. Performance intensive applications like games and VR can benefit from our method, especially for low-end GPU or mobile platforms...|$|R
5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and <b>iridescence</b> are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy <b>iridescence.</b> He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iridescence,</b> as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E

60|$|May in Venice {{is better}} than April, but June is best of all. Then the days are hot, but not too hot, and the nights are more {{beautiful}} than the days. Then Venice is rosier than ever {{in the morning and}} more golden than ever as the day descends. She seems to expand and evaporate, to multiply all her reflections and <b>iridescences.</b> Then the life of her people and the strangeness of her constitution become a perpetual comedy, or at least a perpetual drama. Then the gondola is your sole habitation, and you spend days between sea and sky. You go to the Lido, though the Lido has been spoiled. When I first saw it, in 1869, it was a very natural place, and there was but a rough lane across the little island from the landing-place to the beach. There was a bathing-place in those days, and a restaurant, which was very bad, but where in the warm evenings your dinner didn't much matter as you sat letting it cool on the wooden terrace that stretched out into the sea. To-day the Lido is a part of united Italy and has been made the victim of villainous improvements. A little cockney village has sprung up on its rural bosom and a third-rate boulevard leads from Santa Elisabetta to the Adriatic. There are bitumen walks and gas-lamps, lodging-houses, shops and a teatro diurno. The bathing-establishment is bigger than before, and the restaurant as well; but it is a compensation perhaps that the cuisine is no better. Such as it is, however, you won't scorn occasionally to partake of it on the breezy platform under which bathers dart and splash, and which looks out to where the fishing-boats, with sails of orange and crimson, wander along the darkening horizon. The beach at the Lido is still lonely and beautiful, and you can easily walk away from the cockney village. The return to Venice in the sunset is classical and indispensable, and those who at that glowing hour have floated toward the towers that rise out of the lagoon will not easily part with the impression. But you indulge in larger excursions--you go to Burano and Torcello, to Malamocco and Chioggia. Torcello, like the Lido, has been improved; the deeply interesting little cathedral of the eighth century, which stood there {{on the edge of the}} sea, as touching in its ruin, with its grassy threshold and its primitive mosaics, as the bleached bones of a human skeleton washed ashore by the tide, has now been restored and made cheerful, and the charm of the place, its strange and suggestive desolation, has well-nigh departed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Iridescence</b> (or goniochromism) in jewel bugs like Poecilocoris lewisi are {{the result}} of {{structural}} coloration. Instead of pigments, the colors are caused by the interference, diffraction, or scattering of light by numerous tiny structures.|$|E

25|$|In {{other species}} like the African shield bug (Calidea panaethiopica), the dorsal cuticle {{is dotted with}} tiny {{regularly}} spaced hemispherical cavities. The depressions act like Bragg mirrors. When light hits the pitted surface, it gives off multiple reflections resulting in the distinctive two tone yellow-blue <b>iridescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{commonly}} {{confused with}} diffraction gratings are the iridescent colors of peacock feathers, mother-of-pearl, and butterfly wings. <b>Iridescence</b> in birds, fish and insects is often caused by thin-film interference {{rather than a}} diffraction grating. Diffraction will produce the entire spectrum of colors as the viewing angle changes, whereas thin-film interference usually produces a much narrower range. The surfaces of flowers can also create a diffraction, but the cell structures in plants are usually too irregular to produce the fine slit geometry necessary for a diffraction grating. The <b>iridescence</b> signal of flowers is thus only appreciable very locally and hence not visible to man and flower visiting insects. However, natural gratings do occur in some invertebrate marine animals, like the antennae of seed shrimp, and have even been discovered in Burgess Shale fossils.|$|E
25|$|Pigment color {{differs from}} {{structural}} color in that pigment color {{is the same}} for all viewing angles, whereas structural color is the result of selective reflection or <b>iridescence,</b> usually because of multilayer structures. For example, butterfly wings typically contain structural color, although many butterflies have cells that contain pigment as well.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Quanguo Li et al. {{determined}} the plumage coloration of Microraptor {{based on the}} new specimen BMNHC PH881, which also showed several other features previously unknown in Microraptor. By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with scanning electron microscope techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In Microraptor, these cells were shaped {{in a manner consistent}} with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These rod-shaped, narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much like those of a modern starling, and indicated <b>iridescence</b> in the plumage of Microraptor. Though the researchers state that the true function of the <b>iridescence</b> is yet unknown, it has been suggested that the tiny dromaeosaur was using its glossy coat as a form of communication or sexual display, much as in modern iridescent birds.|$|E
25|$|Iridophores are {{structures}} that produce iridescent colors with a metallic sheen. They reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine. When illuminated, they reflect iridescent colors {{because of the}} diffraction of light within the stacked plates. Orientation of the schemochrome determines {{the nature of the}} color observed. By using biochromes as colored filters, iridophores create an optical effect known as Tyndall or Rayleigh scattering, producing bright blue or blue-green colors. Iridophores vary in size but are generally smaller than 1 mm. It has been shown that squid at least are able to change their <b>iridescence.</b> This takes several seconds or minutes and the mechanism is not understood. However, <b>iridescence</b> can also be altered by expanding and retracting the chromatophores above the iridophores. Because chromatophores are under direct neural control from the brain, this effect can be immediate.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in {{chemistry}} enabled {{the introduction of}} waterproof mascara along with better lash lengtheners and thickeners. Matte colors were popular for eyes, {{in contrast to the}} <b>iridescence</b> that characterized 1960s make-up. The decade's competing visions of beauty were seen in its dichotomy of eye shadow colors: both dramatic, smoky dark gray and transparent, natural beiges and grays were popular.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, asterism, chatoyancy, <b>iridescence,</b> tarnish, and pleochroism. Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, {{such as in}} opal, results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. <b>Iridescence</b> is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating {{on the surface of}} crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry. In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure. Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum.|$|E
25|$|Thus, it {{has been}} known for many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, {{electrically}} charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations with interparticle separation distances, often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. In all of these cases in nature, the same brilliant <b>iridescence</b> (or play of colors) {{can be attributed to the}} diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves that satisfy Bragg’s law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of X-rays in crystalline solids.|$|E
25|$|Corvids {{are large}} to very large passerines with a robust build, strong legs and all species except the pinyon jay have {{nostrils}} covered by bristle-like feathers. Many corvids of temperate zones have mainly black or blue coloured plumage; however, some are pied black and white, some have a blue-purple <b>iridescence</b> and many tropical species are brightly coloured. The sexes {{are very similar}} in color and size. Corvids have strong, stout bills and large wingspans. The family includes the largest members of the passerine order.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} has a chromatic harmony that {{is incredibly}} rich, expressive and radiant. On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space {{there is a}} predominance of transparent harmonies of <b>iridescence</b> and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. The rhetoric of the expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.|$|E
25|$|Fresh meat can {{be cooked}} for {{immediate}} consumption, or be processed, that is, treated for longer-term preservation and later consumption, possibly after further preparation. Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce <b>iridescence,</b> commonly {{thought to be}} due to spoilage but actually caused structural coloration and diffraction of the light. A common additive to processed meats, both for preservation and because it prevents discoloring, is sodium nitrite, which, however, is also a source of health concerns, because it may form carcinogenic nitrosamines when heated.|$|E
