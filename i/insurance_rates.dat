25|$|Nelson {{voted in}} favor of the Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which {{required}} the National Flood Insurance Program to raise <b>insurance</b> <b>rates</b> for some properties at high risk of flooding. In 2014, following an outcry by Florida property owners facing steep flood insurance rate hikes, Nelson supported legislation to provide retroactive refunds for people who have had large flood insurance rate increases due to the sale or purchase of a home, cap average annual premium increases at 15 to 18 percent and allow subsidies for <b>insurance</b> <b>rates</b> that are based on current flood maps.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a calculation method of engineering <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> based on engineering cost. The research has great significance for promoting {{the development of}} the engineering insurance and improving the exits project risk management model. The paper uses the modification method and the maximum possible loss method to calculate the engineering <b>insurance</b> <b>rate.</b> Firstly, the paper calculates the <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> of part project according to engineering costs and risks of each separated project, then gets the <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> of unit project through the weighted average of the proportion of part project costs. Similarly, it is available to get the <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> of other single project. Ultimately, the overall engineering <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> for the engineering project can be obtained...|$|R

25|$|This Spanish victory, {{compounded}} by the serious storm losses in the Caribbean, produced a financial crisis among marine insurance underwriters throughout Europe. Many went bankrupt, and war <b>insurance</b> <b>rates,</b> already remarkably high due {{to the presence of}} privateers, were driven to intolerable levels. It also increased and made increasingly public the dissatisfaction which prevailed against the ministry, and against the conduct and government of the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|Donelon was {{challenged}} {{for his second}} full term as commissioner in the primary held on October 22, 2011, by public-interest attorney Donald C. Hodge, a Democrat. During the campaign, questions arose about the ethics of the Department of Insurance, {{the high cost of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>rates,</b> and the amount of funds that Donelon received from insurance companies. Donelon, however, handily prevailed with 651,285 votes (67.5 percent) to Hodge's 313,931 (32.5 percent).|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the number}} of natural {{disaster}} occurrence is increasing because of abnormal changes of weather in Korea. In Korea the storm and flood insurance system is in effect to prevent these natural disasters.

25|$|To fight an {{offensive}} war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant {{ships in the}} Atlantic and Pacific oceans. <b>Insurance</b> <b>rates</b> skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested. After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15 million in 1871.|$|E
25|$|Tryon {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war <b>insurance</b> <b>rates</b> for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E

50|$|The {{unemployment}} <b>insurance</b> <b>rate,</b> {{paid by the}} employer, {{is experienced}} based and averages about 1.0%-6.0% of the first $7,000 of worker's income—employers with high turnovers pay more. The federal unemployment <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> (now) is 6.2% of the first $7,000 of worker's income. The Great Recession resulted in a high unemployment rate, causing California to borrow about $10 billion from the federal government.|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{higher tax}} rates, some {{companies}} get multiple account numbers {{with a state}} unemployment insurance agency and shuffle employees around to the account number with the lowest unemployment <b>insurance</b> <b>rate</b> each year.

25|$|The 401 was {{available}} in the Javelin, Matador, and Ambassador car lines and in Jeeps from its introduction in 1971 through 1974. In 1975 and 1976, emission controls, <b>insurance</b> <b>rates,</b> and high gasoline prices meant the 401 {{was available}} on the large Matador model, and then only for police department orders. Buyers of full-sized Jeeps (Wagoneer, Cherokee, J-10 and J-20) could order a 401 until 1979. This engine was also supplied to International Harvester for use as an optional engine in International's Light Line pickup trucks and Travelalls from late 1973 through 1974.|$|E

Parker claimed that Donelon had failed to keep down <b>insurance</b> <b>rates</b> in the state, with homeowners rates in Louisiana nearly double the national average and premiums up 36 percent since 2006. A second Democrat also ran for the position, Donald Hodge, Jr., of Baton Rouge.|$|E
25|$|Whitman was re-elected in 1997, {{narrowly}} defeating Jim McGreevey, {{the mayor}} of Woodbridge Township, who criticized Whitman's record on property taxes and automobile <b>insurance</b> <b>rates.</b> McGreevey also criticized Whitman for allowing a private sector company to administer the vehicle inspection program. In the 1997 election, the early prediction was that Whitman, as an incumbent, would have an easy win. The result, however, was that Whitman duplicated her 1993 election with only a one-point victory and a plurality of the votes. Murray Sabrin, a college professor who ran as a Libertarian candidate, and finished third with {{five percent of the}} vote, received votes mostly from conservative Republicans who might otherwise have voted for Whitman.|$|E

Ma also was implicated in a scandal of Taipei Bank stock releases in 2003. However, the case was dismissed after an investigation by the Taipei prosecutor. He was strongly criticized by the DPP for not allowing the ROC national flag to be flown along with a PRC flag during Asian Women's Football Championship held in Taipei. Ma responded that he was merely following Olympic protocol, which only officially recognizes the Chinese Taipei Olympic Flag and forbids ROC national flags from being shown in an Olympic Game Stadium.|$|E
25|$|A {{new engine}} option made the Charger's {{list for the}} first time, the 440 Six Pack. With three two-barrel carburetors and a rating of , {{it was one of}} the most exotic setups since the cross-ram Max Wedge engines of the early 1960s. The Six Pack was {{previously}} used on the mid-year 1969 Dodge Super Bee and Plymouth Road Runner. Despite this new engine, production slipped again to 46,576 mainly due to the new E-body Dodge Challenger pony car, as well as rapidly increasing automobile <b>insurance</b> <b>rates.</b> In the 1970 NASCAR season, the 1970 Charger had ten wins, more than any other car, including the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytonas and Plymouth Superbirds, thus giving Bobby Isaac the Grand National Championship.|$|E
25|$|The engine line-up {{remained}} {{almost identical}} to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a drop in power ratings. High <b>insurance</b> <b>rates</b> for muscle cars, and increasing concerns for emission controls were likely the reason for Ford's changes to its engines. Other manufactures were following suit, including Torino's main competitor Chevrolet's Chevelle, which featured lower compression on all of its 1971 engines, while SS models had the 350 CID 2-barrel as its standard engine. Ram Air induction remained an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.|$|E

25|$|The small local cost {{provided}} towns {{incentive to}} petition for crossing eliminations to prevent public thoroughfares from being blocked by trains. Numerous municipalities soon agitated for crossing eliminations, with Brockton's April 1891 petition {{the first of}} the lot. Shortly before then, the Old Colony Railroad announced plans to replace the aging and undersized Brockton station with a more appropriate structure. The station design was well-received, but its at-grade design - which would have precluded crossing eliminations - was seen {{as a threat to the}} economic future of the city. Brockton then had no fire station east of the railroad, adding fire safety concerns to the more widespread issue of pedestrian safety. Frequent delays for fire engines responding to calls caused higher <b>insurance</b> <b>rates</b> and lower land values in the eastern part of the city.|$|E

Alpert expressed that, being a former peacekeeper in Bosnia, he understands what policies work and which ones do not. The current one does not. Alpert set out {{a plan for the}} withdrawal of troops from the current war in Afghanistan.

Alpert explained that he would vote on the issue that night.|$|E
25|$|The statute {{expanded}} MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) {{coverage for}} children of low income parents and restores MassHealth benefits like dental care and eyeglasses. The legislation included a merger of the individual (non-group) insurance market into the small group market to allow individuals to get lower group <b>insurance</b> <b>rates.</b> The process of merging the two markets also froze the market for such insurance {{for a short period}} in April–May 2010 as the current government tried to keep the leading non-profit insurers, which insure over 90% of the residents, in the state from raising premiums for small businesses and individuals. Eventually the state's non-partisan insurance board ruled that the government did not have the actuarial data or right to freeze the premiums. Five of the non-profit insurers then settled for slightly lower premium increases than they had initially requested rather than litigate further. The sixth litigated and won the right to implement all its original increases retroactively. Payment rates were supposed to be increased to hospitals and physicians under the statute but that has not happened. The statute also formed a Health Care Quality and Cost Council to issue quality standards and publicize provider performance.|$|E
