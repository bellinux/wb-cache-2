5|$|As {{part of his}} {{strategy}} {{for dealing with the}} Marcher Lords, Llywelyn married his eldest son, Dafydd, to Isabella, the daughter of William de Braose, a powerful lord in Brecon, Builth and Abergavenny. The Marcher Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an integrated system of curtain walls. Following Dafydd's marriage, Llywelyn appears to have started a second phase of building at Dolbadarn, probably in the 1240s, adding these elements to the existing castle. The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with rubble and debris, interwoven with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years.

In an area just {{to the north of the}} castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks {{to the creation of}} corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

In 2006, Saleh was presented with evidence that bin Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Abbottabad, Pakistan.

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of Rasanayagam Mudaliar and Swami Gnanapragasar the Aryacakravarti dynasty was {{connected}} to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. Rasanayagam believes that a Brahmin <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Rameswaram married into the surviving family members of the Kalinga Magha, an invader claiming to be from Kalinga kingdom in India. Magha apparently belonged to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The Royal flag of the Jaffna kingdom is similar to the Royal insignia of the Eastern Gangas. Gangas themselves also claimed Brahmin origins. The Setu coins minted by the Aryacakravarti kings also have a similar symbol.|$|E
