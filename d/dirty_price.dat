2500|$|When {{the bond}} is not valued {{precisely}} on a coupon date, the calculated price, using the methods above, will incorporate accrued interest: i.e. any interest {{due to the}} owner of the bond since the previous coupon date; see day count convention. The price of a bond which includes this accrued interest is known as the [...] "dirty price" [...] (or [...] "full price" [...] or [...] "all in price" [...] or [...] "Cash price"). The [...] "clean price" [...] is the price excluding any interest that has accrued. [...] Clean prices are generally more stable over time than dirty prices. This is because the <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> will drop suddenly when the bond goes [...] "ex interest" [...] and the purchaser is no longer entitled to receive the next coupon payment.|$|E
5000|$|An American bond {{option on}} the <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> of a bond (such as some {{convertible}} bonds) may be exercised immediately if ITM and a coupon is due.|$|E
50|$|The market {{convention}} for bond prices assigns a <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> of 98.55 to the trade, not 0.9855. This is {{sometimes referred to}} as the price for 100 par value.|$|E
5000|$|Clean {{prices are}} more {{stable over time}} than <b>dirty</b> <b>prices</b> [...] - [...] when clean prices change, it is for an {{economic}} reason, for instance a change in interest rates or in the bond issuer's credit quality. <b>Dirty</b> <b>prices,</b> on the other hand, change day to day depending on where the current date is {{in relation to the}} coupon dates, in addition to any economic reasons.|$|R

50|$|Asset swaps {{also exist}} where the coupon payment of the linker (inflation bond) {{as well as}} the {{redemption}} pickup at maturity is exchanged for interest rate payments expressed as a premium or discount to LIBOR for the relevant bond coupon period, all dates are co-terminus. The redemption pickup is the above par redemption value in the case of par/par asset swaps, or the redemption above the proceeds notional {{in the case of the}} proceeds asset swap. The proceeds notional equals the <b>dirty</b> nominal <b>price</b> of the bond at the time of purchase and is used as the fixed notional on the LIBOR leg.|$|R
50|$|In finance, {{the clean}} price {{is the price}} of a bond {{excluding}} any interest that has accrued since issue or the most recent coupon payment. This is to be compared with the <b>dirty</b> <b>price,</b> which {{is the price of}} a bond including the accrued interest.|$|E
50|$|The {{clean price}} more closely {{reflects}} changes in value due to issuer risk {{and changes in}} the structure of interest rates. Its graph is smoother than that of the <b>dirty</b> <b>price.</b> Use of the clean price also serves to differentiate interest income (based on the coupon rate) from trading profit and loss.|$|E
5000|$|To {{separate}} out {{the effect of}} the coupon payments, the accrued interest between coupon dates is subtracted from the value determined by the <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> to arrive at the clean price. [...] The accrued interest is based on the day count convention, coupon rate, and number of days from the preceding coupon payment date.|$|E
40|$|Cahier de Recherche du Groupe HEC Paris, nÂ° 641 The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare various methods which extract a Risk Neutral Density (RND) out of PIBOR as well as of Notional {{interest}} rate futures options and to investigate how traders reacted to a political event. We first focus on 5 dates surrounding the 1997 snap election and several methods: Black (1976), a mixture of lognormals (as in Melick and Thomas, 1997), an Hermite expansion (as in Abken, Madan, and Ramamurtie, 1996), and a method based on Maximum Entropy (following Kelly and Buchen, 1996). By and large the various methods give similar RNDs. Yet, the Hermite expansion approach, by allowing for somewhat <b>dirty</b> options <b>prices,</b> by providing a good fit to options prices, and by being very fast is the retained method for the data at hand. We then consider a daily panel of options running from February 1997 to July 1997. After constructing standardized options, i. e. with a fixed time to maturity, we find that operators in both markets anticipated the snap election a few days before the official announcement and that a substantial amount of political uncertainty subsisted even a month after the elections. The greater liquidity of PIBOR options eases information extraction...|$|R

A daily panel of options running from February 1997 to July 1997 reveals that operators in both markets anticipated the snap election a few days before the official announcement, and that a substantial amount of political uncertainty subsisted even a month after the elections. Uncertainty evolved with poll forecasts of who would form the future government. futures option pricing; notional; PIBOR; Political Risk; risk neutral density...|$|R
50|$|Bonds, {{as well as}} {{a variety}} of other fixed income securities, provide for coupon {{payments}} to be made to bond holders on a fixed schedule. The <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> of a bond will decrease on the days coupons are paid, resulting in a saw-tooth pattern for the bond value. This is because there will be one fewer future cash flow (i.e., the coupon payment just received) at that point.|$|E
50|$|The {{price of}} a bond is {{the present value of}} its future cash-flows. To avoid the impact of the next coupon payment on the {{price of a}} bond, this cash flow is {{excluded}} from the price of the bond and is called the accrued interest. In finance, the <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> is the price of a bond including any interest that has accrued since issue of the most recent coupon payment. This is to be compared with the clean price, which is the price of a bond excluding the accrued interest.|$|E

In many markets, it is market practice to quote bonds on a clean-price basis. When a purchase is settled, the accrued interest is added to the quoted clean price to arrive at the actual amount to be paid.|$|E
5000|$|Using the Black model, {{the spot}} {{price in the}} formula is not simply the market price of the {{underlying}} bond, rather it is the forward bond price. This forward price is calculated by first subtracting {{the present value of}} the coupons between the valuation date (i.e. today) and the exercise date from today's <b>dirty</b> <b>price,</b> and then forward valuing this amount to the exercise date. (These calculations are performed using today's yield curve, as opposed to the bond's YTM.) The reason that the Black Model may be applied in this way is that the numeraire is then $1 at the time of delivery (whereas under Black-Scholes, the numeraire is $1 today). This allows us to assume that (a) the bond price is a random variable at a future date, but also (b) that the risk-free rate between now and then is constant (since using the forward measure moves the discounting outside of the expectation term http://www.opentradingsystem.com/quantNotes/T_forward_measure_.html). Thus the valuation takes place in a risk-neutral [...] "forward world" [...] where the expected future spot rate is the forward rate, and its standard deviation is the same as in the [...] "physical world"; https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135831/http://finance.eller.arizona.edu/lam/fixi/creditmod/xl/BM1S09.xls see Girsanov's theorem.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{in detail}} the mechanism and the specificity of corporate and government interest-bearing bonds quoting on US and European financial markets.

40|$|We derive a closed-form {{formula for}} {{computing}} bond prices between coupon payments. Our results cover both the `Treasury' and the `Street' pricing methods used by sovereign and corporate issuers. We apply our formulas to two UK gilts, the 8 % Treasury Gilt 2015, and the 0. 5 % Treasury Gilt 2022, {{and show that}} we can obtain the <b>dirty</b> <b>price</b> of these bonds at any date {{with a minimum of}} calculations, and without intensive computational resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{distinguishing}} the concepts regarding the bonds as a requirement of the investment decision-making process. After presenting the main characteristics of bonds, there are analyzed some aspects regarding their value. Some statements are made, concerning {{the various forms of}} price used (issue, repayment, current). There is a distinction presented, between the dissimulated (<b>dirty)</b> <b>price</b> and the real (clean) price. Finally, a short case study is presented, in order to practically clarify the content of the theoretical approach...|$|E
