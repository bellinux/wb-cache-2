5|$|In {{the wake}} of the floods, several citizens' groups and {{political}} parties, notably the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), strongly recommended that Tiruchirappalli be designated as the second, administrative capital of Tamil Nadu, due to its centralised location, the presence of a large international airport, a low level of congestion, the availability of vacant government land and a decreased likelihood of flooding. PMK leader S. Ramadoss said the party would seriously consider the matter <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to power.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the very}} {{important}} things one has {{to take into account}} in written Maldivian which is not so important in spoken Maldivian is the ‘sukun’ on the letters ‘alif’ and ‘shaviyani’. ‘Sukun’ in general is a mark to indicate an abrupt stop on the sound of the letter on which it is placed. However, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> within the word, the letter is repeated; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> on a ‘shaviyani’ or ‘alif’ {{at the end of a}} word, it signifies the sound ‘h’; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> on a ‘thaa’, the sound is replaced by ‘iy’.|$|R

5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E
5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> and chattered when a new garden was tilled, {{then there would be}} good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E
5|$|All {{military}} {{aircraft in the}} DRC are operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kaminia and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment.

25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out – Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide.

50|$|A further {{method to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of socially sensitive issues is the so-called randomized response technique. Therein, for example, respondents secretly throw a coin and respond “yes” <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> up heads, and are instructed to respond truthfully (e.g. drug abuse) <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> up tails. This enables the researcher to estimate the actual prevalence of the given behavior without needing to know the true state of an individual respondent.|$|R

25|$|By 1914 {{he becomes}} a {{sergeant}} in the First Richmond Howitzers, under Captain Jeb Stuart III. As part of the Army of Northern Virginia, Featherston fights on the Susquehanna River and then falls back towards Maryland. During this time he reports his suspicions to an intelligence officer about Pompey, Captain Stuart's manservant, being a Marxist rebel. Pompey is protected from investigation by his prominent master, however, and reveals himself as a real Marxist when the Negro uprisings break out. Featherston allows Negro workers to serve an artillery piece to repel a US attack. The Negroes themselves are even enthusiastic about serving with Featherston, commenting they would have helped him defend the position even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> down to using pistols.|$|E
25|$|About 2100 hours, as 2nd Battalion, C Battery of the 555th, and {{the trains}} were forming on the road, Kean ordered the commanders {{to move the}} 2nd Battalion and one battery of {{artillery}} through the pass immediately, but to hold {{the rest of the}} troops in place until daylight. Immediately, the 2nd Battalion moved through the pass, and once over it was out of communication {{with the rest of the}} regiment. In effect, though the 2nd Battalion thought it was the advance guard of the rest of the regiment, it was on its own and neither force could assist the other <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> under attack. In the movement of the 2nd Battalion and C and Headquarters Batteries, Daly was wounded a second time and was evacuated. The 2nd Battalion cleared the pass before midnight. On the west side it came under light attack but was able to continue its advance all the way to Taejong-ni, where it held position for the rest of the night.|$|E

25|$|The English {{retained}} a fort they had established at Langholm in the Scottish borders. Unable to secure its return by diplomatic leverage, Regent Arran reduced it by force on 17 July 1547 following an unsuccessful attempt in June. At the same time, a French naval force took St Andrews Castle from the Castilians. On 24 July Arran ordered seven signal beacons {{to be prepared}} to warn of an expected English invasion by sea. The first was at St Abb's Head, the second at Dowhill near Fast Castle, next on the Doun Law near Spott, North Berwick Law, 'Dounprenderlaw', at Arthur's Seat or Edinburgh Castle, and at 'Binning's Craig' near Linlithgow. The keepers of these 'bailes' were instructed to have horsemen ready to carry news of the invasion to the next beacon <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> in day-light. The towns of Lothian, the borders and Forth valley were ordered to ensure that all men between sixty and sixteen living in sight of the beacons were ready to respond to the signal.|$|E
25|$|If {{the contestants}} {{had the same}} score {{at the end of}} the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker {{question}} each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. On Match Game PM, or on the syndicated daytime show if time was running short, a time-saving variant of the tie-breaker was used that reversed the game play. The contestants wrote their answers first on a card in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant's answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tie-breaker went on until there was a clear winner. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to the sudden-death tie-breaker, only the final question (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.|$|E
25|$|One form {{of fraud}} {{involves}} affixing counterfeit labels of expensive wines to bottles of less expensive wine. This practice became particularly prominent following {{the devastation of}} the phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as Southwest France or Calabria in Italy) and then labeling the wine as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or Tuscany. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive appellation systems and Protected Designation of Origin or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect {{the name of a}} wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of Chianti, Oporto and Tokaji. Today most major European wine producing countries have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well systems include the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, and the Denominación de Origen (DO) system used in Spain. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities.|$|E
