The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E
