5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E

The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|Edgefield {{was known}} as a violent place, even by the {{standards}} of antebellum South Carolina, where matters of personal honor might be addressed with a killing or duel. Before Tillman Sr.'s death from typhoid fever in 1849, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> a man and been convicted of rioting by an Edgefield jury. One of his sons died in a duel; another was killed in a domestic dispute. A third died in the Mexican-American War; a fourth of disease aged 15. Of Benjamin Jr.'s two surviving brothers, one died of Civil War wounds after returning home, and the other, George, killed a man who accused him of cheating at gambling. Convicted of manslaughter, George continued to practice law from his jail cell during his two-year sentence, and was elected to the state senate while still incarcerated. He later served several terms in Congress.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reconcile}} some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Orton's mother seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity. The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.|$|E
5|$|Few records exist of Thomas Coke's early years, {{although}} {{it is known that}} he was educated in Longford, Derbyshire, before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French refugees. In 1765 he was sent to Eton College, where he was joined by William Windham, a close friend in his later life. Coke was apparently happy at Eton, and was excellent at field sports; on one occasion 70 snipes <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> were found in his room, and on another he narrowly avoiding being punished for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Park. He was not particularly interested in his academic studies, {{but by the time he}} left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class, and practical skills to deal with his future estates. After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, financed by his father and his great-aunt (who offered him £500 not to go to a university, regarding them as dens of vice). Coke visited France and Italy, where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke, preferring the similarly-aged Englishman to her 52-year-old alcoholic husband.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington told them <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> Fryer following {{an argument about}} her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home countries or some combination of these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E

5|$|The {{search for}} bodies continued, but with winter setting {{in it was}} called off in November. Presented with the {{evidence}} of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking the photographs of Lesley Ann Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue by two men who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> John Kilbride. The prosecution's opening statement was held in camera, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused. The proceedings continued in front of three magistrates in Hyde over an 11-day period during December, {{at the end of which}} the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.|$|E
5|$|The section {{north of}} Maricopa, toward present day I-10, {{was built by}} 1939. The road headed north toward Tempe to U.S. Route 80. Between 1951 and 1958, the road was {{extended}} south to its current terminus at SR 84; at this time, I-10 had still not been built, nor had the route become a numbered route. By 1971, I-10 was finished through {{the south and east}} edges of the Phoenix area. In 1989, ADOT made preparations to establish the number along Maricopa Road and reserved the right-of-way along the parkway. This may have been because of a controversy over the name of John Wayne Parkway, which the road was dubbed at the time. The Gila River Native Americans, whose reservation the parkway ran on, did not want this name, as John Wayne, the actor who formerly owned a ranch on the road, had appeared in several movies in which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> Native Americans. In 1997, the route was officially established as a state highway with its current routing. SR 347 was widened from a two-lane road to the four-lane expressway that it is today.|$|E
5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted off the record that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 18 April 1945, he led his company through the shell-battered, sniper-infested {{wreckage}} of Nuremberg, Germany. When blistering machinegun fire caught his unit in an exposed position, he ordered his men to take cover, dashed forward alone, and, as bullets whined about him, shot the 3-man guncrew with his carbine. Continuing the advance at the head of his company, he located an enemy patrol armed with rocket launchers which threatened friendly armor. He again went forward alone, secured a vantage point and opened fire on the Germans. Immediately he became the target for concentrated machine pistol and rocket fire, which blasted the rubble about him. Calmly, he continued to shoot at the patrol until <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> all 6 enemy infantrymen. Continuing boldly far in front of his company, he entered a park, where as his men advanced, a German machinegun opened up on them without warning. With his carbine, he killed the gunner; and then, from a completely exposed position, he directed machinegun fire on the remainder of the crew until all were dead. In a final duel, he wiped out a third machinegun emplacement with rifle fire at a range of 10 yards. By fearlessly engaging in 4 single-handed fire fights with a desperate, powerfully armed enemy, Lt. DALY, voluntarily taking all major risks himself and protecting his men at every opportunity, killed 15 Germans, silenced 3 enemy machineguns and wiped out an entire enemy patrol. His heroism during the lone bitter struggle with fanatical enemy forces was an inspiration to the valiant Americans who took Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed,</b> with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E
