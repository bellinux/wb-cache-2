Facility checkout tests were made using standard ASME long-radius metering nozzles. These tests demonstrated facility data accuracy at flow conditions similar to the model tests. Channel 14 static tests reported here consisted of 21 ASME nozzle facility checkout tests and 57 static model performance tests (including 22 at no charge). <b>Fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratio varied from 1. 4 to 2. 0, and fan to core total pressure ratio varied from 1. 0 to 1. 19.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of nozzle configurations on spray drift and explain the influences using several atomization characteristics (length of spray sheet, spray angle, velocity distribution of flow field, fluctuation of velocity, and droplet size). Nozzles manufactured by one company (Lechler GmbH, Germany) were tested by spraying local tap water in a wind tunnel at an operating pressure of 0. 3 MPa and under room temperature. The nozzles tested were compact air-induction flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> (IDK 120 - 02, IDK 120 - 03), standard flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> (ST 110 - 02, ST 110 - 03), and hollow-cone swirl nozzles (TR 80 - 02, TR 80 - 03).

Results showed that spray drift was significantly different among nozzle types (P< 0. 0005) and that nozzle configurations influenced breakup length, spray angle, droplet size, and velocity. Nozzles producing larger droplet sizes had lower velocity. Smaller droplets were produced when longer and wider spray sheets were produced.

The lawn spray gun application at a mean volume rate of 1122 L ha[superscript]- 1 in comparison to flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> at 187 L ha[superscript]- 1 or Raindrop nozzles at 374 L ha[superscript]- 1 significantly reduced the injury potential to non-target plants 90 cm or more from the spray swath edge. The direct deposition of spray at the 30 cm downwind location suggests that a small unsprayed buffer area next to non-target plants should be left {{in order to avoid}} direct spray contact to non-target plants for all nozzle types tested. The percentage of spray recovered indicates that large differences do occur within the spray swath. The corresponding coefficient of variation (CV) values for the nozzle types were above the recommended CV value of 15 %; however, other research has shown that applications with a CV range of 14 % to 28 % provided satisfactory uniformity for droplet deposition. The low percent spray recovery with RA- 6 nozzles and the spray gun on turfgrass suggests that droplets produced by flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> may have greater collection efficiencies than those by RA- 6 nozzles or the spray gun. Simulated spray drift on annual flowers indicates that petunia (Petunia x hybrida) is extremely sensitive to the triethylamine salt of triclopyr ((3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinyl) oxy) acetic acid or the dimethylamine salt of 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid, while impatiens (Impatiens wallerana) is one of the least sensitive species tested.

40|$|Overall {{trends for}} next {{generation}} aero-engines are oriented to more efficient architectures {{to ensure a}} reduction in fuel consumption and an improvement in expected ranges, emissions levels and operability. Engine manufacturers have investigated different ways to improve engine performance, for instance by using new materials, technologies or integration methods. Engine performance can also be improved though changes in thermodynamic cycle by means of variable cycle devices capable of better adapting it to flight conditions. Due to current design constraints, engines are optimized to best average performance for a specific mission type, yet not for all the operating points encountered throughout the missions. By adding a degree of freedom, the cycle can be further optimized during the entire mission potentially leading to additional fuel savings. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} impact of variable fan and core nozzle areas on the performance of a long range turbofan through a long range mission. By moving the operating points, these devices have a strong effect on engine operations and therefore on the Specific Fuel Consumption. Variations in Specific Fuel Consumption are evaluated as well as compressors surge margins, considered as important performance and operability parameters, throughout the same 14 hours long range mission and for range of +/- 15 % for the <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> area and +/- 20 % for the core nozzle area. This study shows that optimization of the <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> area on each mission point for minimum SFC can lead to fuel savings of up to 20 kg (44 lb) representing 0. 05 % of improvement. However, maximizing the surge margin by optimizing the variable <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> permits an increase of up to 7 % depending on the considered compressor. On the other hand, optimization of the core nozzle area on each mission point for minimum specific fuel consumption allows a reduction of 127 kg (282 lb) in fuel consumption, representing an improvement of 0. 34 % while having different effects on the engine compressors surge margins. Using the core area to maximize the surge margin provides an increase of up to 2 % depending on the considered compressor with a side effect on specific fuel consumption. At this stage, the results from this study suggest that the amount of fuel savings obtained through the use of variable <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> and variable core nozzle may not be sufficient to overcome the associated constraints such as added weight and integration aspects. However, a broader optimization approach,involving all the design aspects and parameters could lead to different quantitative conclusions...|$|E

However, one of the azimuthally varying nozzle designs exhibited even better performance than any of the uniform chevron nozzles. In addition to the <b>fan</b> chevron <b>nozzles,</b> a new technology was demonstrated, using devices that enhance mixing when applied to an exhaust nozzle. The acoustic benefits from these devices applied to medium BPR nozzles were similar, and in some cases superior to, those obtained from conventional uniform chevron nozzles. However, none of the low noise technologies provided equivalent acoustic benefits on a model-scale high BPR exhaust nozzle, similar to current large commercial applications. New technologies must be identified to improve the acoustics of state-of-the-art high BPR jet engines...|$|R
40|$|The series/parallel tandem {{fan engine}} is {{evaluated}} for application in advanced STOVL supersonic fighter aircraft. Options in engine cycle parameters {{and design of}} the front fan flow diverter are examined for their effects on engine weight, dimensions, and other factors in integration of the engine with the aircraft. Operation of the engine in high-bypass flow mode during cruise and loiter flight is considered {{as a means of}} minimizing fuel consumption. Engine thrust augmentation by burning in the front fan exhaust is discussed. Achievement of very short takeoff with vectored thrust is briefly reviewed for tandem fan engine configurations with vectorable front <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Examples are given of two aircraft configuration planforms, a delta-canard, and a forward-swept wing, to illustrate the major features, design considerations, and potential performance of the tandem fan installation in each. Full realization of the advantages of tandem fan propulsion are found to depend on careful selection of the aircraft configuration, since integration requirements can strongly influence the engine performance.
