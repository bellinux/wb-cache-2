She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas".

Slant Magazine's writers listed the song at number 36 on their list of Best of the Aughts: Singles saying: [...] "'Hung Up' employs a ticking clock to represent fear of wasted time, but Madonna isn't singing about aging or saving the world—she's talking about love. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Madge sounded this vapid.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the poor, lonely {{woman had}} felt such warmth of love. Her sons {{had been like}} her husband, chary of expressing their affection; and like most Puritan families, there was little of caressing among them. Sitting there with the rain {{on the roof and}} driving through the trees, they planned getting back into the old house. Howard's plan seemed to her full of splendor and audacity.

60|$|They now {{separated}} {{to prepare}} for the sad ceremony; for whenever an appeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to follow--even in a fairyland like Oz. But is must be stated that the people of that Land were generally so well-behaved that {{there was not a single}} lawyer amongst them, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> any Ruler had sat in judgment upon an offender of the law. The crime of murder being the most dreadful crime of all, tremendous excitement prevailed in the Emerald City when the news of Eureka's arrest and trial became known.|$|E

60|$|Thus he {{came upon}} the trail of The Sheik's band as it {{traveled}} down river from the point where The Sheik had captured Meriem to his own stockaded village. Korak pretty well knew who it was that had passed, for there were few in the great jungle with whom he was not familiar, though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he had come this far north. He had no particular business, however, with the old Sheik {{and so he did}} not propose following him--the further from men he could stay the better pleased he would be--he wished that he might never see a human face again. Men always brought him sorrow and misery.|$|E
6000|$|By and by {{she fell}} asleep, only to dream that the package was a caressing hand {{stealing}} about her, feeling for hers, and holding it with soft, strong clasp. When she awoke {{she had the}} strangest sensation in her right palm. It was moist, throbbing, hot, and the feel of it on her cheek was strangely thrilling and comforting. She lay awake then. The night was dark and still. Only a low moan of wind in the pines and the faint tinkle of a sheep bell broke the serenity. She felt very small and lonely lying there in the deep forest, and, try how she would, {{it was impossible to}} think the same then as she did in the clear light of day. Resentment, pride, anger--these seemed abated now. If {{the events of the day}} had not changed her, they had at least brought up softer and kinder memories and emotions than she had known for long. Nothing hurt and saddened her so much as to remember the gay, happy days of her childhood, her sweet mother, her, old home. Then her thought returned to Isbel and his gift. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> anyone had made her a gift. What could this one be? It did not matter. The wonder was that Jean Isbel should bring it to her and that she could be perturbed by its presence. [...] "He meant it for his sister and so he thought well of me," [...] she said, in finality.|$|E
