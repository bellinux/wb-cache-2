500|$|The {{scene in}} which Tooms enters Scully's home was {{initially}} filmed in Hutchison's absence. The crew shot his entrance later, using a larger blue screen set. These shots were digitally merged so that Tooms would appear to emerge from a much smaller hatch than was filmed. The effect was kept to a minimum; Hutchison's footage was not [...] "squeezed" [...] too much, as both Carter and visual effects supervisor Mat Beck have stated their belief that [...] "less is more: <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of the supernatural {{is all that is}} required".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{describes}} herself as a [...] "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [...] and maintains that honest songwriting {{is very important to}} her. She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} from NME {{considered that}} the song sashays along with sass, while still remaining charming, {{and said that}} though it doesn't mark Allen out as excellent dating material, as a soundtrack to the summer, [...] "it’s a dead fackin’ cert". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called [...] "Smile" [...] {{just as good as}} [...] "LDN", [...] "its loose reggae arrangement augmented by the clever sample of Jackie Mittoo’s piano from the Soul Brothers’ 60s rocksteady tune [...] "Free Soul", as Allen sings bitterly about her ex, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of vulnerability at first, before going to her friends for reassurance, and confronting the guy during the chorus with a mean-spirited confidence that has us cheering inside". While John Murphy of MusicOMH praised the song and its [...] "gently lilting reggae rhythm", Priya Elan from NME considered that the Althea & Donna groove of [...] "Smile" [...] is what made fans [...] "fall for her in the first place". The former argued that [...] "even people who profess to hate pop music will secretly be tapping a foot to it and claiming it is just downright perfect pop for lolling around during the lazy warm, guaranteed to cheer the listeners up, no matter how down they're feeling". Other reviews came from The Guardian reporter Sophie Heawood, who didn't consider the song as Allen's greatest effort, but still thought she was far better than being called [...] "the female Mike Skinner".|$|E

60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>hint,</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>hint,</b> of {{physical}} feebleness in his voice, {{and it was}} so strange that I looked quickly at him. His hand was sweeping nervously across his face, as though he were brushing away cobwebs. I was puzzled. The whole thing was so unlike the Wolf Larsen I had known.|$|R
500|$|The 1960s {{setting of}} X-Men: First Class, technologically {{inspired}} by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they [...] "did a cool job representing the period, {{in a way it}} still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the [...] "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" [...] personality. The director said his goal was to [...] "feel like a '60s Bond film, but {{with a little bit of}} reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time." [...] At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the [...] "bloody hard balancing" [...] of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was [...] "not so alien to the kids that it looked like a period piece." [...] The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly [...] "that 60s misogynist vibe" [...] with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.|$|E
500|$|Midnight Heat was {{released}} in July 2012 following Heat Rush. It is packaged in a purple bottle. According to Beyoncé's official website, [...] "For , fragrance is an essential accessory to highlight your inner radiance, confidence and sex appeal. Midnight Heat is the ultimate evening scent, sensual and enticing with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of mystery." [...] The perfume's top notes are described as dragonfruit, apricot and starfruit; middle notes of orchid, tulip and peony; and base notes of sandalwood, patchouli and amber. A poster for the fragrance {{was released}} on July 18, 2012, and shows Beyoncé wearing a purple mini-dress. Idolator's writer X. Alexander wrote that she looked [...] "appropriately regal in purple in her new fragrance art" [...] while Julee Wilson of The Huffington Post wrote that the advertisement [...] "definitely screams sensual". Gaby Wilson of MTV commented that the photo appropriately sets the mood for the midnight perfume further praising Beyoncé's look. Ambika Mutto of VH1 gave a negative review for the poster, writing that she was [...] "really disappointed" [...] because the image was [...] "boring and literal". She noted, [...] "Sexy hair flying, sexy dress in a color reminiscent of midnight, on a rooftop against the midnight sky — we get it." [...] A writer of the website Digital Spy praised the scent, writing that it empowers [...] "your inner diva" [...] and added that [...] "there will be no Single Ladies left if you wear this". At the 2013 StyleBistro Awards, Midnight Heat was nominated in the category for Best New Fragrance.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Romances was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Terry Jenkins of AllMusic praised the collaborative work of Silvetti and Manzanero and called Romances [...] "a sensuous, enchanting album". Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune called Miguel's voice the album's strong point and noted the [...] "presence of electronic instruments and the darker, more somber mood". On the other hand, she felt that Miguel was beginning [...] "to slip", citing the tracks [...] "Jurame" [...] and [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] as examples. Fernando Gonzalez wrote for the Orange County Register noting although the album is [...] "Impeccably produced, arranged and recorded", he felt that boleros [...] "demand more than that". Gonzalez elaborated: [...] " [...] He sounds simply loud, rather than romantic, in [...] "Sabor a Mi; he comes across as (soap) operatic rather than tormented in [...] "El Reloj [...] "; he is a star -- not a humble student -- in [...] "Contigo Aprendi"." [...] The Corpus Christi Caller-Times music critic Rene Carbrera wrote a positive review of the album praising the string arrangements as [...] "elegantly done" [...] and complimented Miguel's take on [...] "Sabor a Mí" [...] and [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] {{as he had done}} it [...] "delightfully done in the traditional way and flavored with Trio Los Panchos requinto [...] "cling" [...] endings." [...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote an unfavorable review of the recording; he criticized its productions for having all the tracks [...] "awash in silky keyboards and airy strings with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of percussion in the background". He also panned its lead single [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] for coming off as a [...] "love song for the chaste" [...] due to its arrangements being [...] "so stifling, so precious, it's difficult to feel any sensuality".|$|E

The {{moonlight}} was clear, and he looked well in his white uniform, which showed his solid but finely molded figure and emphasized the clean brownness of his skin.

50|$|In Puerto Rico {{it always}} refers to skirt steak, cooked on a {{barbecue}} grill. The chimichurri sauce is optional, since {{the meat is}} very savory with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>hint</b> of sea salt that is sprinkled over the meat during cooking. It is also customary to replace chimichurri sauce with a guava rum sauce made with spices and 7up or Ajilimójili sauce.|$|R

Inglis notes a rare [...] "wistfulness" [...] in the lines [...] "There's a line that I can draw / That often leaves me wanting more", which appear in the middle-eight. Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, considers that the song recalls the [...] "teenage preoccupations" [...] of Harrison's Beatles-era compositions [...] "Don't Bother Me" [...] and [...] "I Need You", but he adds: [...] "The difference is that this time there's a menacing undercurrent of aggression and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of one drink too many." ...|$|E
2500|$|Overall, the {{character}} and Torv's performance has received generally positive reviews. Although, the initial response to Anna Torv's performance was mixed in the first season. In his review of the pilot episode for New York, John Leonarwas found Torv [...] "wonderfully played" [...] her character. IGN's Travis Fickett agreed, calling Torv's early work on Fringe [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show." [...] MSNBC was equally praiseworthy of Torv and her character, writing [...] "Olivia is {{the soul of the}} show — two-fisted and defiant, yet vulnerable. Torv knows how to convey authenticity, {{even in the midst of}} an outrageous scene. And sporting sensible pantsuits and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of makeup, she makes Olivia a plausibly gorgeous pro, not a crime-busting tootsie." [...] Conversely, SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall believed Torv's early performance to be [...] "downright wooden", while others criticized the actress and character for being [...] "cold and distant." [...] The New York Observer found her to be the one weak link of the main cast, criticizing Torv for her accent and for showing [...] "less emotion than a piece of plywood." ...|$|E
60|$|For another {{fortnight}} Weston tactfully {{carried out}} his somewhat difficult task; {{and then it}} was with a curious sense of regret that he stood one evening in a little roadside station. Major Kinnaird was apparently counting the pile of baggage some little distance away, his wife and daughter were in the station-room, and Ida and Weston stood alone where the track came winding out of the misty pines. She glanced from him to the forest, and there was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> perceptible <b>hint</b> of regret in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little girl}} softly pressed her hands together. [...] "I hope she'll {{let me stay}} up! I feel so excited, and I hate to lie and think so long before I get to sleep. Couldn't you <b>just</b> <b>hint</b> <b>a</b> little to her that I might stay up? It's Sunday night." ...|$|R

I did n't like his meeting me so much and told him so by going another way. He understood, and being a gentleman, made no fuss. I dare say he thought I was a vain goose, and laughed at me for my pains, like Churchill in 'Helen.'" ...|$|R

O., who has been {{specially}} mentioned for bravery and who very nearly got the Victoria Cross, comes here with the halo of a brilliant escape from the Germans, wounded, a young man of good family and connections, and apparently as keen as mustard to get back again in the fighting line. Good Heavens! The most careful sailor in the world might <b>just</b> drop <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> to that sort of man. What nearly happened last night may happen a dozen times within the next week. Even our great secret, General," [...] Thomson continued, dropping his voice a little, [...] "even that might come to his ears." ...|$|R
60|$|Because {{she wished}} to {{goodness}} they'd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so {{that was why she}} <b>just</b> gave <b>a</b> gentle <b>hint</b> about its being late.

[...] "Ralph has been absolutely dumb about it but he did <b>just</b> give us <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> {{that he had a}} little surprise in store for the submarines. There was something on deck, covered all up and watched by <b>a</b> sentry, and <b>just</b> before we sat down to lunch, you know, we were turned off and {{had to go to the}} 'Ship'.

60|$|At last {{came the}} blessed {{day when the}} nurse {{permitted}} me to wheel the convalescent out upon the porch. The morning was lovely, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of autumn in its coolness, and to Zulime it was heavenly sweet, for it seemed that she had emerged from a long dark night of agony and doubt.|$|E
60|$|Cecily, who was eleven, {{was pretty}} also--or {{would have been}} had Felicity not been there. Felicity rather took the colour from other girls. Cecily looked pale and thin beside her; but she had dainty little features, smooth brown hair of satin sheen, and mild brown eyes, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of demureness in them now and again. We remembered that Aunt Olivia had written to father that Cecily was a true Ward--she had no sense of humour. We did not know what this meant, but we thought it was not exactly complimentary.|$|E
60|$|Ivor {{brought his}} hands {{down with a}} bang on to the final chord of his rhapsody. There was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> in that triumphant harmony that the seventh had been struck along with the octave by the thumb of the left hand; but the general effect of splendid noise emerged clearly enough. Small details matter little {{so long as the}} general effect is good. And, besides, that hint of the seventh was decidedly modern. He turned round in his seat and tossed the hair back out of his eyes.|$|E

Of course, I don't expect that he would unbosom himself to any one, but, to tell you the truth, as we are {{situated}} now, the faintest hint as regards his inclinations, or lack of inclinations, towards certain things would be of immense service. If he criticised any of our institutions, for instance, his remarks would be most interesting. Then he has been spending several months in various capitals. He would not be likely to tell any one his whole impressions of those few months, but a phrase, a word, even a gesture, to a clever woman might mean a great deal. It might also mean a great deal to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{fruit of}} the cashew tree is an {{accessory}} fruit (sometimes called a pseudocarp or false fruit). What {{appears to be the}} fruit is an oval or pear-shaped structure, a hypocarpium, that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower. Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as marañón, it ripens into a yellow and/or red structure about 5-11 cm long. It is edible and has a strong [...] "sweet" [...] smell and a sweet taste. The pulp of the cashew apple is very juicy, but the skin is fragile, making it unsuitable for transport. In Latin America, a fruit drink is made from the cashew apple pulp which has a very refreshing taste and tropical flavor that can be described as having notes of mango, raw green pepper, and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little <b>hint</b> of grapefruit-like citrus.|$|R
60|$|And {{perhaps there}} is no time in a summer's day more cheering than when the warmth of the sun is just {{beginning}} to triumph over the freshness of the morning--when there is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> lingering <b>hint</b> of early coolness to keep off languor under the delicious influence of warmth. The reason Adam was walking along the lanes at this time was because his work {{for the rest of the}} day lay at a country-house about three miles off, which was being put in repair for the son of a neighbouring squire; and he had been busy since early morning with the packing of panels, doors, and chimney-pieces, in a waggon which was now gone on before him, while Jonathan Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback, to await its arrival and direct the workmen.|$|R

6000|$|It was {{a glorious}} {{moonlight}} night, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of October frost in the air--enough to give sparkle and tang. After {{a few moments}} I became aware that Miss Ponsonby was also [...] "musing" [...] at her window {{in the shadow of}} the acacia tree. In that dim light she looked quite pretty. It was suddenly borne in upon me for the first time that, when Miss Ponsonby was young, she must have been very pretty, with that delicate elusive fashion of beauty which fades so early if the life is not kept in it by love and tenderness. It seemed odd, somehow, to think of Miss Ponsonby as young and pretty. She seemed so essentially middle-aged and faded.|$|E
60|$|The person {{reading was}} a trifle different; {{one would have}} said of {{him that he was}} of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his attire which attested a certain {{fellowship}} with the organisms of his environment. His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco: his footgear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on the floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have missed its meaning. In countenance the man was rather prepossessing, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of sternness; though that he may have assumed or cultivated, as appropriate to one in authority.

How would it do to have had the girl actually reject him? It never came to that with us; and instead of his being a howling outside swell that was rather condescending to her, suppose I have him some sort of subordinate in her father's business? It doesn't matter much what; it's easy to arrange such a detail. She could be in love with him all the time, without even knowing it herself, or, at least, not knowing it when he offers himself; and she could always be vaguely hoping or expecting that he would come to time again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] he answered, benignly. [...] "You {{have managed}} to please everybody, Mr. Parr included,--and {{some of us are}} not easy to please. I thought I'd tell you this, as a friend, as your first friend in the parish. Your {{achievement}} has been all the more remarkable, following, as you did, Dr. Gilman. Now it would greatly distress me to see that state of things disturbed, both for your sake and others. I thought I would <b>just</b> give you <b>a</b> <b>hint,</b> as {{you are going to see}} Mr. Parr, that he is in rather a nervous state.
