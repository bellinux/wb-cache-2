5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted <b>in</b> <b>court</b> was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was supposed to have been used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed <b>in</b> <b>court</b> and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth <b>in</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
