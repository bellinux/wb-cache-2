5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not provide a satisfactory solution, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> move the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of washlands were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth washland, which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the washland when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional washlands were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Gemini 10, Collins was {{assigned}} to the backup crew for the second manned Apollo flight, with Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Thomas Stafford and Collins as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Along with learning the new Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), Collins received helicopter training, as these were thought to {{be the best way to}} simulate the landing approach of the LM. After the completion of Project Gemini, it was decided to cancel the Apollo 2 flight, since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> repeat the Apollo 1 flight. In the process of crews being reassigned, Collins was moved to the CMP position on the Apollo 8 prime crew, since his new crew was Borman, Collins and William Anders. Deke Slayton had decided that the CMP should have some spaceflight experience, something that Anders did not have. Three years later, this change would be the reason Collins orbited the Moon while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on its surface.|$|E

500|$|... "Everyone agreed {{he had the}} look," [...] Lydon later recalled, but musical skill {{was another}} matter. [...] "The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish....

Marco Pirroni, who had {{performed}} with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, [...] "After that, it {{was nothing to do}} with music anymore. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story".|$|E
500|$|Emilie de Ravin, an Australian actress, {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Shannon, speaking her dialogue with an American accent. Instead, they offered her the part of Claire; she accepted without reading the script, assuming <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be a recurring role. While de Ravin had never been pregnant, she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters. She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult, later saying that [...] "in many ways, the filming is actually like the drama. You endure the muggiest weather in the rainforest... You're really exposed to the elements." [...] The actress admitted being [...] "creeped out" [...] by the premise of [...] "Raised by Another", in which a psychic tricks Claire by sending her to the island to raise her baby.|$|E

Rose had halted the show several times to calm the audience. From then on, he became known for personally addressing disruptive fans and giving instructions to security personnel from the stage, at times stopping concerts to deal with issues in the crowd. In 1992, Rose stated, [...] "Most performers {{would go to a}} security person in their organization, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be done very quietly. I'll confront the person, stop the song: 'Guess what: You wasted your money, you get to leave.'" [...] As a result of the deaths at Monsters of Rock, the festival was canceled the following year.|$|E
500|$|... 'Artpop' {{is really}} an inferno and it's the only song on the record that I didn't really wanna go {{anywhere}} or explode or orgasm. Because then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be like composing {{something that would be}} just like every other sort of orgasm that I've ever had. And because its really the center of the record, I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone, to this concept of Art+Pop, that we can put art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore. How can we the artist back our ideas and for our visions {{to be the most important}} thing. The thing that's driving culture, driving these corporations. I didn't wanted [...] to grow too much, I wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra.|$|E

The song, a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would [...] "never make any more records". Drummond said, [...] "What do you expect us to do, go and make a jungle record?"; Cauty added [...] "Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be sad wouldn't it? We're too old." [...] NME gleefully informed their readers, [...] "The K Foundation's contribution to the 'Help' LP is a jungle track." [...] Help was released on 9 September 1995.|$|E
5000|$|Riders of the Purple Sage {{received}} generally poor reviews {{upon its}} theatrical release. The reviewer for The New York Times criticized the film's lack of entertainment quality, while acknowledging Tom Mix's appeal and attraction to his fans. The reviewer for Variety wrote: It {{is all right}} to understand Mix and know what his admirers want, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> as well to recollect that adults watch Mix pictures also, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> as well if some of these directorial absurdities were omitted or made to blend.|$|R

500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E
500|$|Jon Snow {{was killed}} in the fifth-season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy", and in the lead up to the sixth season, actor Kit Harington, who portrays the character, stated {{that he would not be}} {{returning}} to the series except to play a corpse, and would not be resurrected despite rampant speculation. Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear was that people were not going to care. Or <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be, 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even verbal communication of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E
500|$|Philip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a {{long time}} seeking a {{distributor}} for Tender Mercies without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for Angelo My Love, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute Tender Mercies. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged with the picture, to the point the theaters were so silent, [...] "if you flicked a piece of paper on the floor, you could hear it fall." [...] However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford's words, [...] "absolutely disastrous." [...] As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, [...] "I don't know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. I guess they thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> get lost in the shuffle." [...] Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as [...] "like watching paint dry".|$|E

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

2500|$|In {{speaking}} about the show in 2010, Bain reflected: [...] "We had some very good science fiction people as advisors who {{knew what they were}} talking about. For instance, they knew that sound up there wouldn't travel, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that. There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. For all I know now it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|E
