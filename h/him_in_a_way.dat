500|$|Marquis {{first took}} up writing {{around the turn}} of the century, writing {{newspaper}} articles. [...] In 1922 he was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He resigned after only ten weeks, but he was there long enough to realize that several participants of the Custer battle were still alive. Between 1923 and 1926 Marquis practiced medicine privately on the Crow Reservation but then tried to make writing his permanent career. Throughout his life Marquis was often in debt; his writing was sometimes interrupted by the need to earn money at medicine, or even his original career of typesetting. From 1926 he returned to his contacts among the Cheyenne, interviewing them in depth. The trust he developed with them allowed them to open up to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> they had not with any other outsiders. The result formed the bulk of Marquis' most important works.|$|E
500|$|In 1936 London Films {{released}} Things to Come, {{in which}} Richardson played the swaggering warlord [...] "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively {{that the film}} was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, [...] "Though not so very much older than I am, I regarded <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> as a father, and to me he was as generous as a prince." [...] In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, Bees on the Boatdeck. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August {{of the same year}} he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barré Lyndon's comedy thriller, The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.|$|E

500|$|Hirst {{gave the}} {{impression}} of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile [...] "went right round his head and met at the back." [...] Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's Times obituary said: [...] "No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of Wisden can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, {{and he was one of}} the most illustrious of his time." [...] Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as [...] "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been [...] a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: [...] "He was very good. But he didn't know how to use it, you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dana, {{thinking}} about Kevin being {{stuck in the}} 1800s {{for an extended period}} of time: [...] "A place like this would endanger <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> I didn’t want to talk to him about. If he was stranded here for years, some part of this place would rub off on him. No large part, I knew. [...] The place, the time would either kill him outright or mark him somehow. I didn’t like either possibility." [...] (Kindred, p.77) ...|$|E
2500|$|Chandler {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington. His {{father was in the}} military, causing him to move {{multiple}} times. They lived in Olympia, Washington; Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; Alameda, California and Galveston, Texas. In Texas, the 6' 5" [...] Chandler {{was a member of the}} high school football team. He oftens refers to the fact that Jeff Faircloth, a football teammate, was quick to share the good news of Jesus with <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that intrigued Chandler. Over the course of two years, Chandler attended church gatherings, opposed the beliefs, raised questions and doubts against Christianity and eventually submitted his life to the Lordship of Christ.|$|E

2500|$|In late 211, Liu Zhang {{invited the}} warlord Liu Bei, who {{was based in}} {{southern}} Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), to lead his troops into Yi Province to help him counter the threat of another warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhang Yu accompanied Liu Zhang when he met Liu Bei for a reception banquet in Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). During the banquet, Liu Bei saw that Zhang Yu had a thick beard, so {{he came up with}} a joke to make fun of Zhang Yu: [...] "When I was in Zhuo County (涿縣), there were many people with the family name Mao. They were everywhere, be it north, south, east or west. The Prefect even remarked, 'Zhuo County is surrounded by Maos!'" [...] Zhang Yu also cracked a joke to get back at Liu Bei: [...] "Once upon a time, there was a certain Prefect of Lu County (潞縣) who was later reassigned to Zhuo County. After he retired, someone wanted to write him a letter but didn't know how to address <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that reflected the two appointments he held, so he thought of the term 'Gentleman of Lu-Zhuo' (潞涿君)." [...] Zhang Yu's joke was meant to mock Liu Bei, who had no beard.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 Dom {{underwent}} a storyline where he fell for {{his best friends}} sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw. Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; [...] "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful." [...] Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; [...] "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have {{to pretend to be}} anyone else for her to like him." [...] Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; [...] "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi." [...] The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; [...] "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons. He's done everything he can for Delphi— that's his main reason for coming back." [...] Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.|$|E
