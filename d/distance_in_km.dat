40|$|In this paper, the {{question}} of the location of exporters of manufactured goods within a country is investigated. Based on insights from new trade theory, the new economic geography (NEG) and gravity-equation modelling, an empirical model is specified with agglomeration and increasing returns (the home market effect) and transport costs (proxied by distance) as major determinants of the location decision of exporters. Data from 354 magisterial districts in South Africa are used with a variety of estimators (OLS, Tobit, RE-Tobit) and allowances for data shortcomings (bootstrapped standard errors and analytical weights) to identify the determinants of regional manufactured exports. It is found that the home-market effect (measured by the size of local GDP) and distance (measured as the <b>distance</b> <b>in</b> <b>km</b> to the nearest port) are significant determinants of regional manufactured exports. This paper contributes to the literature by using developing country data, and by adding to the small literature on this topic.

We present some non-structural estimates in which the probability of filling a vacancy is influenced by unemployment and vacancies in the surrounding areas, but we argue that these estimates cannot adequately estimate the true cost of distance.

Also, workers are discouraged from appling to jobs where they expect a large number of applications. Finally, we find evidence of constant returns to scale in matching markets. The estimated model seems to replicate fairly accurately actual commuting patterns across Census wards, although it tends to underpredict the proportion of individuals who live and work in the same ward.

Estimates of this model show that the cost of distance is relatively high - the utility of being offered a job decays at exponential rate around 0. 3 with <b>distance</b> (<b>in</b> <b>km)</b> to the job - so that labor markets are indeed quite `local'. Also, workers are discouraged from applying to jobs in areas where they expect relatively strong competition from other jobseekers.
