50|$|The {{power plant}} {{consists}} of multiple-shaft combined cycle unit with one steam turbine-generator, three gas turbine generators and three heat recovery steam generators, designed for natural <b>gas</b> <b>firing.</b> The gas turbine generators came fromm General Electric with F-class technology and was shipped in 2002.

50|$|There are {{alternative}} configurations, {{including a}} secondary circulating loop which ducts {{a portion of}} the primary air flow through an external pressurized heat exchanger. This bypass flow can also be utilized for cool-down using an air-over heat exchanger. While <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> does not readily lend itself to small machines, it can be fitted to autoclaves of three to four foot diameter and up. The longer the machine, the longer the heat exchanger tube and thus the more efficient it will be. This heating option is less costly than hot oil and more costly than electric or steam (assuming an existing boiler) to purchase, but the extra expense is paid back very quickly.Over its full service life, the electrically heated autoclave will cost enough to have paid for another four or five comparable autoclaves. For any but the smallest lab machines, <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> and steam heating are, to put it plainly, the best alternatives to consider.|$|E

50|$|Pellet boilers {{are used}} as central heating systems for heat {{requirements}} (heating load) of more than 3.9 kW (Kilowatt). But pellet central heating systems are not only used in single or two family homes (up to 30 kW), but also for larger residential or business units with heat requirements {{of a few hundred}} kW. Pellet burner systems run most efficiently at full load and can usually be regulated down to up to 30% of its full capacity. Since the warm up phase of pellet ovens usually takes longer than for oil or <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> systems, short burning phases have negative effects on the fuel efficiency. In order to improve energy efficiency and reduce harmful emissions, pellet ovens are usually combined with buffer systems like water tanks for example.|$|E

40|$|Strines Textiles near Manchester {{expect to}} make energy savings of 64, 200 GJ/year worth 173, 300 pounds from direct <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> of their dyeing and after-print processes. The savings, to the greater extent, have been {{achieved}} by converting processes to local direct <b>gas</b> <b>firing,</b> thereby moving towards the elimination of wasteful central boiler plant and steam distribution system. Additional energy savings have been generated in the wet wash processes, which remove surplus print dye from the fabric. The savings were achieved by heating the water with directly fired equipment which fully condenses water vapour in combustion exhaust, and by effluent heat recovery. Energy usage in the steaming operation, which fixes print dyes to the fabric, has been markedly reduced by the replacement of old plant by a new Stork Brabant steamer, with the steam provided by a steam generator located {{at the point of}} use. The project cost was 527, 950 pounds. The total project savings were approximately 173, 300 pounds giving a payback period of three years. ...|$|E
