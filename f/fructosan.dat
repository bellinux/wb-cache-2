50|$|When World War II began, Porter {{moved to}} the Rothamstead {{laboratories}} because of Imperial College's new focus on the war effort. In 1947, she moved to St. Louis in the United States for a year to research at the laboratory of Nobel-winning biologists Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori. There, she studied the role of enzymes in starch synthesis and decomposition {{and how to use}} enzymes in experiments on glycogen metabolism. She studied the breakdown of starch in 1948 and 1949 after she returned to London. That year, Porter spent six months at Bangor University, where she discovered that the enzyme starch phosphorylase is present in barley.In 1953, Porter became head of her own research group at Imperial College, thanks to a grant from the Nuffield Foundation. Her group used the then-innovative techniques of chromatography and radioactive labels to further study plants' metabolic pathways. She synthesized radioactive starches and glucose and used them in experiments that analyzed the movement of photosynthetic metabolites and the process of starch and <b>fructosan</b> formation, one of the first scientists to do so in Britain. Unlike her earlier experiments, this research was conducted on tobacco plants. The new techniques, combined with autoradiography, allowed her to study these processes in living cells and tissue. In 1956, primarily due to this research, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. The next year, Porter was promoted to the position of Principal Scientific Officer of the Institute of Plant Physiology and was appointed Reader of Enzymology in the Botany Department. In 1959, she became the department head of Imperial College's Department of Plant Physiology, as well as the college's first female professor. Because of her credentials in biochemistry, Porter was elected to the Committee of the Biochemical Society in 1962. Porter retired from her position as department head in 1964, the same year that she spearheaded the creation of specialized task forces in the Society and became Second Secretary to the College's Agricultural Research Council. She was also appointed as an honorary member of the Agricultural Research Council Society. The next year, she was appointed Chairman of the Biochemical Society. As chair, she innovated the subscription policies and the journal publication policies; the changes she implemented influence the Society today. Porter was honored in 1966 by being appointed as a Fellow of the Imperial College of Science and Technology. In 1972, she was appointed as adviser to the secretary of the Agricultural Research Council. Throughout her extensive career, Porter authored or coauthored 39 papers in various journals.|$|E

However, the administration at birth of minute amounts of anti-A 48 Id antibodies causes a long-lasting activation of A 48 Id+-bearing clones. This activation is related to direct interaction of anti-A 48 Id antibodies with precursors bearing the A 48 Id+ immunoglobulin receptor, since an A 48 Id+ response can be transferred with highly purified B cells in lethally irradiated mice. The maturation of these precursors into A 48 Id+ anti-beta 2 leads to 6 <b>fructosan</b> antibody-secreting cells requires challenge by the antigen. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) data showed that in 1 -mo-old mice an UPC 10 (U 10) -like spectrotype was observed, whereas in 3 -mo-old mice, a new spectrotype binding BL rather than inulin (In) was identified. This spectrotype was observed only in CXBJ mice, the single strain in which an A 48 Id+ response was observed.

Interestingly, in 1 -mo-old BALB/c mice treated with anti-A 48 Id antibodies, the challenge with 17 - 38 monoclonal antibody led to the activation of A 48 Id- anti-beta 2 leads to 6 fructosan-reactive clones with BALB/c type IEF spectrotypes, whereas in 3 -mo-old BALB/c mice treated with anti-A 48 Id antibodies, the challenge with 17 - 38 monoclonal antibody led to the activation of W 3082 IdX+ anti-beta 2 leads to 6 and beta 2 leads to 1 fructosan-reactive clones. In these animals, inhibition of A 48 Id+ anti-beta 2 leads to 6 <b>fructosan</b> clones was observed.

In the present study, examination of tissue extracts from a number ofdifferent plant species by ion-exchange chromatography did not confirmthe presence of endogenous fructose 1 -phosphate. However, injectionof fructose into developing Jerusalem artichoke tubers resulted in the rapid formation of labelled glucose 6 -phosphate, fructose 6 -phosphate, fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate, and probably glucose 1 -phosphate, followed by the appearance of fructose 1 -phosphate which was identified by ion-exchange chromatography and hydrolysis. The incorporation of label into <b>fructosans</b> was also noted and examined. Fructose-l-phosphate was also produced from fructose by tuber calluscultures but not by mature tubers from fructose or by developing 14 tubers from sucrose. Attempts to detect a kinase in the developing tubers which would specifically transfer phosphate from nucleotide triphosphates or phosphoenolpyruvate to C- 1 of fructose failed although ATP:fructose- 6 -phosphotransferase activity was identified and partially characterised. Fructose 1 -phosphate formation by enzymic isomerization of fructose 6 -phosphate or the partial hydrolysis of fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate using tuber extracts could not be demonstrated.

In Northern blotting experiments, most of these hybridomas were shown to use VH (heavy chain variable region) genes related to the 441 - 4 germline VH gene that encodes the A 48 VH region.

One group of molecules is specific for inulin, {{which is a}} fl(2 [...] - * 1) <b>fructosan,</b> {{as well as for}} levan; such antibodies, which can first be detected in BALB/c mice at 28 d of age (2), express idiotypes (Id) that cross-react with those found on inulin-binding myeloma proteins (3). The second principal group of antibodies binds BL, but not inulin, and fails to express cross-reactive idiotypes (IdX) of anti-inulin antibodies (1); these can be elicited in l-d-old BALB/c mice after immunization with BL (2). The Id found on myeloma proteins ABPC 48 (A 48) and UPC 10 (UI 0), which bind BL but fail to bind inulin, are generally not detected on anti-BL antibodies of BALB/c mice (3). However, in nu/nu BALB/c mice, pretreatment with anti-El 09 IdX antibodies before immunization with BL results in the occurrence of A 48 Id + anti-BL antibodies (4). This observation indicates that the A 48 Id ÷ anti-BL response belongs to a normally silent fraction of the anti-BL repertoire. This observation prompted us to investigate the activation of A 48 Id+-bearing clones in neonates after the administration of anti-A 48 Id antibodies. Our results indicate that the administration of anti-A 48 Id antibodies to 1 -d-old BALB/c mice causes a substantial increase in the A 48 Id ÷ component of the anti-BL antibody response.

Quantitative precipitin and inhibition assays showed that W 3129, W 3434, and QUPC 52 had specificities for isomaltose oligosaccharides {{similar to those}} previously found with α(1 → 6) -specific human antidextrans. W 3129 and W 3434 were most complementary to IM 5 but W 3129 reacted equally with IM 4 and IM 3 while W 3434 had a greater affinity for IM 4 than IM 3. QUPC 52 had a larger combining region and was most complementary to IM 6. Protein UPC 102 (IgA), like MOPC 104 E (IgM) (27), was most complementary to the α(1 → 3) -linked trisaccharide, nigerotriose, and thus differed from J 558 (29), which was inhibited best by nigeropentaose. UPC 102 was similar to J 558 but they differed from MOPC 104 E in their reactions with non-α(1 → 3) -linked disaccharides. The fructosan-specific myeloma proteins fell into two groups with different specificities. The first group, W 3082 (IgA), UPC 61 (IgA), and the previously studied J 606 (IgG 3) (28, 29), reacted with inulin and W 3082 and UPC 61 appeared to have identical specificities for β(2 → 1) -linked fructofuranosyl residues with maximum complementarity for the tetrasaccharide βDfructofuranosyl (2 → 1) βDfructofuranosyl(2 → 1) βDfructofuranosyl(2 → 6) Dglucose while protein J 606 was inhibited best by the trisaccharide βDfructofuranosyl(2 → 1) βDfructofuranosyl(2 → 6) Dglucose. W 3082 and UPC 61 also differed from J 606 in their behavior toward sucrose and βDfructofuranosyl(2 → 6) Dglucose as compared with αDglucosyl(1 → 3) Dfructose (turanose). The second group containing myeloma proteins UPC 10 (IgG 2 a) and Y 5476 (IgA) behaved similarly to human antilevans in that neither reacted with inulin nor were they inhibited by the β(2 → 1) -linked fructose oligosaccharides. Unlike the β(2 → 1) -specific proteins, they reacted with perennial rye grass levan that contained over 90 % β(2 → 6) links.

We have studied the consequences of perturbing the immune network formed by the clones that comprise the bacterial levan (BL) 1 idiotype (Id) system.

This is followed by ensiling into a laboratory silo (1. 0 liter polyethylene container) and stored at 20 ℃ over 30 days.

The values of pH, VBN and VBN/TN showed small but significant decreases by ethanol addition at 3 and 5 % levels in FO, but in IR they did not show significant changes. The addition of ethanol did not give significant changes in the contents of lactic, acetic and propionic acids for both FO and IR. Butyric acid content showed significant decreases in FO in contrast to a slight decrease in IR, resulting in a higher improvement of fermentation quality for FO than for IR by adding ethanol. 寒地型牧草の青刈りエンバク及びイタリアンライグラスの 2 草種において，エタノール添加がサイレージの発酵品質及び残存糖類に及ぼす影響について検討を行なった．エンバク及びイタリアンライグラスともに無処理サイレージは，pH，揮発性塩基態窒素（VBN）及び全窒素（TN）に対する揮発性塩基態窒素比率（VBN/TN）が低いサイレージであった．エンバクサイレージでは， 3 ％以上のエタノール添加により，さらに低下効果が認められた．イタリアンライグラスサイレージでは，VBN生成に対してわずかに抑制効果があった．酪酸含量に対するエタノールの添加効果についても，両サイレージともにエタノール添加量の増加に伴い，強い抑制効果が認められた．特にエンバクサイレージでは， 3 ％以上の添加で酪酸の生成はみられなかった．乳酸及び酢酸含量において，エタノール添加量を増加した場合，エンバクでは 3 ％添加までは増加傾向がみられたが，イタリアンライグラスでは減少したことから，乳酸菌に対する影響は材料草などにより異なるものと考えられた．両サイレージにおいて，エタノール添加はVBN及び酪酸生成というような不良発酵を抑制したので，発酵品質（V-SCORE）を改善し，乾物損失も防ぎ，さらに糖の残量が増加したものと思われた...|$|E
40|$|When the {{detached}} first {{leaves of}} green or etiolated oat (Avena sativa cv. Victory) seedlings senesce in the dark, their oxygen consumption shows a large increase, beginning after 24 hours and reaching {{a peak of}} up to 2. 5 times the initial rate by the 3 rd day. This effect takes place while the chlorophyll of green leaves, or the carotenoid of etiolated leaves, is steadily decreasing. Kinetin, at a concentration which inhibits the decrease in pigment, completely prevents the respiratory rise; instead, the oxygen consumption drifts downwards. Lower kinetin concentrations have a proportional effect, 50 % reduction of respiration being given by about 0. 1 mg/l. About one-fifth of the respiratory rise {{may be attributed to}} the free amino acids which are liberated during senescence; several amino acids are shown to cause increases of almost 50 % in the oxygen consumption when supplied at the concentrations of total amino acid present during senescence. A smaller part of the rise may also be due to soluble sugars liberated during senescence, largely coming from the hydrolysis of a presumptive <b>fructosan.</b> The remainder, and the largest part, of the increase is ascribed to a natural uncoupling of respiration from phosphorylation. This is deduced from the fact that dinitrophenol causes a similar large rise in the oxygen consumption of the fresh leaves or of leaf segments kept green with kinetin, but causes only a very small rise when the oxygen consumption is near its peak in senescent controls. The respiration of these leaves is resistant to cyanide, and 10 mm KCN even increases it by some 30 %; in contrast, etiolated leaves of the same age, which undergo a similar rise in oxygen consumption over the same time period, show normal sensitivity to cyanide. The respiratory quotient during senescence goes down as low as 0. 7, both with and without kinetin, though it is somewhat increased by supplying sugars or amino acids; glucose or alanine at 0. 3 m bring it up to 1. 0 and 0. 87, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2008. Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{aggressive}} and challenging invasive species within wetlands of the Pacific Northwest. This invasive typically dominates a site, producing a monoculture, reducing the biodiversity and microhabitats on the site. Three treatments were tested within agricultural watercourses for reed canarygrass stem reduction. Two of the three treatments were successful in reducing the returning stem count. The densely planted single canopy and hogfuel treatment (HF/willow) and a multi-canopy and hogfuel treatment (referred to as an RCG barrier) reduced the returning reed canarygrass stem counts by 64 % and 56 % respectively compared to the control plots. A competition experiment was implemented within a controlled setting between Phalaris arundinacea and a native wetland sedge, Scirpus microcarpus. In addition to competition, two other treatments were integrated into this experiment, high vs. low soil moisture and high vs. low nitrogen additions. Although a statistically significant reduction of reed canarygrass biomass was not found when reed canarygrass was grown with small fruited bulrush (Scirpus microcarpus), a trend of reduced RCG biomass was noted within the high soil moisture, high nitrogen, interspecific competition treatments. Copious amounts of carbohydrate reserves in reed canarygrass rhizomes can be problematic as the shoots easily return after control methods from the reserves. The carbohydrate reserve levels within reed canarygrass rhizomes were tested after detaching from the parent clone and placing under an opaque material. A sample of the rhizomes were removed after three, six and nine months and analyzed for <b>fructosan</b> levels. The results from the regression indicate too high a variation within the three-month samples and too few data points within the six and nine-month samples to receive a significant fit of the data to the recession line. However, averaging the data, shows a sustained level of fructosans for the first six months, followed by a significant drop of fructosans at the nine month time frame. Additionally, a considerable reduction in the number and size of the rhizomes found after six and nine months reveal that breaking the rhizomes away from the clones and covering with an opaque material weakens their ability to survive over time. This suggest that tilling, followed by mulching, may be an effective control strategy...|$|E

Treatment of newborn BALB/c mice at 1 d of age with 0. 1 - 10 microgram of either the A 48 myeloma protein or monoclonal proteins that share idiotopes with the A 48 family, followed by immunization with BL 2 - 4 wk later, produces an anti-BL response that {{is dominated by the}} A 48 Id. Various degrees of activation of the A 48 Id BL response were observed by injecting mice with A 48 monoclonal protein only up until 3 wk of age. Activation of the A 48 Id clones by treating with A 48 monoclonal protein was ineffective in mice who were older than 4 wk. Elicitation of an A 48 Id BL response required specific antigenic stimulation with either beta 2 leads to 6 or beta 2 leads to 1 <b>fructosan</b> epitopes, because it does not occur after injection with TNP- Ficoll in spite of the A 48 treatment. The expansion of A 48 Id clones in mice treated at birth with A 48 monoclonal protein is associated with an increase in A 48 Id-specific helper T cells. The binding specificity of these cells was demonstrated by infusing them into nu/nu BALB/c mice and observing that they rendered help that enalbed the animal to mount an anti-TNP response after immunization only with A 48 -TNP, but not with MOPC 384 -TNP conjugates. The helper activity of these cells is sensitive to the effects of treatment with anti-Lyt- 1. 2 antibodies plus complement. A predominantly A 48 Id BL-specific response can be transferred into lethally irradiated mice by infusing them with purified T and B cells from A 48 -treated mice. The transfer of this response can be ablated by treating the T cells with anti-Lyt- 1. 2 antibodies plus complement. These results indicate that A 48 Id-specific helper cells possess the ability to select the A 48 Id-bearing B cell precursors for expression, thus exerting a fine-tuning effect on the idiotypic expression of the anti-BL repertoire. We propose that this idiotype-induced idiotype response, which can be, in principal, induced by idiotypes provided by the mother, {{plays an important role in}} the expansion of precursors of antibody-forming cells during embryonic as well as postnatal life...|$|E

Fawn, an established cultivar since 1964, and TFM, an experimental line, were observed to grow better during {{spring and fall}} months respectively, in the field. Different temperature regimes of 10 / 4, 16 / 4, 27 / 10, and 32 / 16 °C were employed to study the effect of temperatures on the growth and biochemical characteristics of these two cultivars. Fawn was significantly greater than TFM across the three harvests in dry matter production. There {{were no significant differences}} between Fawn and TFM in watersoluble carbohydrates (WSC) across the three harvest material. During the seven month period, there were also no significant differences in water-soluble carbohydrates and crude protein between the two cultivars. Stems had a higher concentration of WSC but were lower in crude protein than leaves in both cultivars. Fawn also produced more foliage dry matter (for the first and second harvests) across all temperatures tested. In regrowth, TFM and Fawn grew better at low and high temperatures respectively. This was expected on the basis of field results. Fawn was significantly greater than TFM in WSC and free sugars in both the first and second harvests and in the regrowth but in percent fructosans there {{were no significant differences between}} cultivars. TFM was significantly greater than Fawn in percent crude protein in both first and second harvest and regrowth. Temperature affected crude protein and WSC content as temperature increased, WSC, <b>fructosan,</b> and free sugars content decreased. Fructosans were lower in the regrowth material than either the first or second harvest. Percent crude protein in the foliage dry matter increased as temperature increased except in the regrowth where the lowest and highest temperatures showed the highest concentration. Tillering was higher in Fawn, and the most favorable temperature for both cultivars was at 16 / 4 °C. Root dry weight was lower in Fawn, however, the concentration of WSC, fructosans, and free sugars in the roots were higher in Fawn than TFM. These sugar components were lower in the root material than in the foliage or regrowth material. There were no differences in the mean relative growth rate between cultivars, although Fawn was highest at the high temperatures, with TFM being higher at the three lower temperatures.
