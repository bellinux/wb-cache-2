25|$|Ideally, campfires {{should be}} made in a <b>fire</b> <b>ring.</b> If a <b>fire</b> <b>ring</b> is not available, a {{temporary}} fire site may be constructed. Bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site. Alternatively, turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage. Another way is to cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, {{to a depth of}} a few inches. A ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire. Fire rings, however, do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the <b>fire</b> <b>ring</b> may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it, or the rocks could crack.|$|E
25|$|A keyhole fire {{is made in}} a keyhole-shaped <b>fire</b> <b>ring,</b> and is used in cooking. The large round area is used {{to build}} a fire to create coals. As coals develop, they are scraped into the {{rectangular}} area used for cooking.|$|E
25|$|People {{interested}} in staying overnight at R. B. Winter State park have three options. They can stay {{at one of}} the 59 modern camp sites some of which are equipped with electricity. All the sites have access to modern restrooms with showers. Each camp site also has its own <b>fire</b> <b>ring,</b> picnic table and lantern holder. There are three cottages that sleep up to five people. The cottages have electric lights and a small baseboard heater as well as wooden floors, windows, skylights, porches, a picnic table and <b>fire</b> <b>ring.</b> There is one modern cabin that is available to rent year-round. It is two stories with a furnished living area, kitchen, one-and-a-half baths, four bedrooms and two porches.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether visitor perceptions of ecological impacts at wilderness campsites could be accurately measured using photographs or written descriptions rather than actual site evaluations. Photographs and written site descriptions of 20 campsites were used to measure perceptions of two forms of campsite impacts (bare ground and <b>fire</b> <b>rings).</b> Live site evaluations were used as the criterion for evaluating the photographic and description approaches. Four hundred fifty wilderness visitors were interviewed to assess perceptions of campsite preferences and other background variables. Twenty campsites in two different areas of the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness were selected, 12 for bare ground and 8 for <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> evaluations. Both hikers and horse riders were sampled to see if there were significant differences between the two groups. Evaluative standards were also established for the impacts in question, based on respondents' perceptions. Findings suggest that photographs and written descriptions can be used in place of site visits for evaluating specific impacts at campsites. For evaluating more general characteristics such as desirability or preference, however, there are more differences between the on-site and off-site methods. Horse riders were more tolerant thah hikers of large amounts of bare ground and large <b>fire</b> <b>rings,</b> and preferred sites with <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> over sites without them. Evaluative standards were established for acceptable levels of bare ground and size and appearance of <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> at the two study locations. Visitors found sites without <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> or bare ground to be less acceptable than sites with small amounts of bare ground or small <b>fire</b> <b>rings.</b> The importance of bare ground and <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> was compared to the importance of other physical campsite characteristics, such as view of scenic features, quality of tent site, shelter from weather, and proximity to other camps. Visitors ranked the impacts in question less important than other physical characteristics when evaluating campsites. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are offered...|$|R

25|$|With annual use {{consistently}} {{double that}} of the 1980s, user impacts began to degrade the Smith River environment. Most noticeably, firewood became scarce. Boat camps were outfitted with steel <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> in 2003 to help reduce the impact on forests adjacent to the Smith River and to help {{minimize the risk of}} fire. By requiring floaters to keep their fires inside the <b>fire</b> <b>rings,</b> larger <b>fires</b> and bonfires—which consumed extremely large amounts of wood—were effectively eliminated. That year, 3,714 total users were on the Smith. Average group size, however, reached 7.03.|$|R
25|$|Visitors {{can stay}} {{overnight}} at Ohiopyle State Park's Kentuck Campground, or rent a cottage. The campground has 226 campsites with 27 {{of them being}} walk-in, tent only sites. All campsites have a picnic table and <b>fire</b> <b>ring,</b> modern restrooms with hot showers and flush toilets, and four playgrounds. The rustic cottages have electricity, but lack running water. Each cottage can sleep five people in single or double bunks.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the campsites {{are rather}} {{different}} {{between the two}} wilderness areas. Boundary Waters' campsites have designated fire grates in the <b>fire</b> <b>ring</b> and a small fiberglass latrine. Quetico's campsites are far less used than BWCAW and many are not marked on maps. The sites themselves {{do not have a}} latrine (participants must dig a cat-hole at least 150 feet away from water and camp) nor do they have a fire grate.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{campground}} has 35 {{sites with}} a washhouse that {{is equipped with}} showers and flush toilets. The camp sites can accommodate tents, campers and RVs.

It sleeps up to twelve people with four bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and a fireplace. Sinnemahoning State Park has three picnic area.|$|E
25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall <b>fire</b> <b>rings</b> also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Detail of Mark 6 exploder. For contact operation, the {{collision}} of the torpedo with the target ship would move the <b>firing</b> <b>ring</b> and release the firing pin stem. The firing pin stem would then move vertically (powered by the firing spring) and detonate the tetryl booster charge. The mechanism worked for low-speed torpedoes, but for the high-speed Mark 14 torpedo, the same impact deceleration that caused the <b>firing</b> <b>ring</b> to move was also large enough to cause the firing pin stem to bind and fail to detonate the booster.|$|R

25|$|A campfire is {{a fire at}} a {{campsite}} {{that provides}} light and warmth, and heat for cooking. It can {{also serve as a}} beacon, and an insect and predator deterrent. Established campgrounds often provide a stone or steel <b>fire</b> <b>ring</b> for safety. Campfires are a popular feature of camping. At summer camps, the word campfire often refers to an event (ceremony, get together, etc.) at which there is a fire. Some camps refer to the fire itself as a campfire fire.|$|E
