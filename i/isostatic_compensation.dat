40|$|International audiencePassive {{continental}} margin subsidence is {{initiated by the}} synrift mechanical stretching of the lithospheric upper brittle layer and continues during the postrift phase; the thermal cooling and contraction of the upwelled asthenosphere forces the margin to subside {{in addition to the}} overloads from sea water and sediments. Therefore, the total subsidence in stretched basins includes fault-controlled initial sinking, thermal subsidence and flexural <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensations.</b> Decoupling and estimating the different components of this subsidence from stratigraphic analysis and restricted geophysical and sedimentological databases remains problematic. In particular, backstripping the sediment layers requires a well-constrained geological framework. A method is proposed here to investigate the subsidence history of a margin based on forward stratigraphic modelling. Using the Sedflux model, several experiments are done using generally agreed upon assumptions on the parameters describing lithospheric rheology and isostatic behaviour of a margin. The stratigraphic modelling of the Rhône deltaic margin during the last climatic cycle (125 kyr) provides an assessment of these parameter estimates and their influence on geohistory (tectonic/thermal subsidence and sediment loading). The model results confirm the important impact of water loading on vertical deflection along the platform between glacial low sea-level and interglacial high sea-level. Based on Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean) observations, a conceptual method that uses the stratigraphic simulations is produced in order to evaluate the different components of the total subsidence of a margin, and, in particular, the relative impact of tectonic subsidence and sediment load...|$|R
40|$|Voyager images {{demonstrate}} that the icy satellites have been shaped {{by a variety of}} magmatic and tectonic processes, of which ridge and trough terrain is a manifestation. This terrain is observed on Ganymede, Enceladus, Miranda, and Ariel, and many models have been proposed to explain its origin. A likely model is horst and graben style normal faulting, in which horizontal extension results in a series of downdropped grabens and relatively uplifted horsts. The apparent negative elevation of ridges and troughs relative to surrounding terrain has been used to argue such an extensional-tectonic origin for ridge and trough terrain on Ganymede and Enceladus. A ridge or ridge set which stands above a presumed original base level, thus, might be suspect of having a magmatic or compressional origin. It has been shown that rotation of domino-style normal faulting, which involves rotation of fault blocks about a fulcrum, can allow ridges to stand slightly above the original base level, and this relative uplift may be amplified by <b>isostatic</b> uplift. <b>Compensation</b> might also be accomplished through uplift of adjacent horsts. These theories are defended with dynamical equations...|$|R

We show that complications arising from ice sheet multiples can be effectively managed and further information concerning low-velocity subglacial sediment thickness may be determined, via top-down utilization of synthetic receiver function models. We combine shallow structure constraints with {{the response of}} deeper layers using a regularized Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to constrain bulk crustal properties. Crustal thickness estimates range from 17. 0 ± 4 km at Fishtail Point in the western WARS to 45 ± 5 km at Lonewolf Nunataks in the TAM. Symmetric regions of crustal thinning observed in a transect deployment across the West Antarctic Ice Sheet correlate with deep subice basins, consistent with pure shear crustal necking under past localized extension. Subglacial sediment deposit thicknesses generally correlate with trough/dome expectations, with the thickest inferred subice low-velocity sediment estimated as ∼ 0. 4 km within the Bentley Subglacial Trench. Inverted PRFs from this study and other published crustal estimates are combined with ambient noise surface wave constraints to generate a crustal thickness map for West Antarctica south of 75 °S.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{restoration of}} two parallel cross-sections {{in the central}} portion of the Santos Basin enables a first understanding of existent 3 D geological complexities. Santos Basin {{is one of the}} most proliferous basins along the South Atlantic Brazilian margin. Due to the halokinesis, geological structures present significant horizontal tectonic transport. The two geological cross-sections extend from the continental shelf to deep waters, in areas where salt tectonics is simple enough to be solved by 2 D restoration. Such crosssections display both extensional and compressional deformation. Paleobathymetry, <b>isostatic</b> regional <b>compensation,</b> salt volume control and overall aspects related to structural stylewere used to constrain basic boundary conditions. Several restoration algorithms, such as simple shear, flexural slip and free methods, were used to restore the sedimentary deformation, including salt gravity gliding. The results of the 2 D restoration are consistent with five major sequences of sedimentary evolution: (1) the brittle pre-salt deformation, (2) the significant and fast salt deposition, (3) the initial post-salt deformation with predominant rafting tectonics, (4) the Late Cretaceous progradational deposition and coeval development of compressional minibasins, and (5) the Cenozoic sedimentary deposition, with less intense salt tectonics. A 1 D subsidence analysis based on the 2 D restored results is shown as a useful restoration control tool. The 1 D results indicate that an initially proximal infill evolves towards distal regions under salt tectonics control. The 1 D diagrams also record the history of the overburden movements through lateral depocenter migration in minibasins areas, submitted to large horizontal salt spreading. The results highlight an important isostatic movement during salt deposition, large but not enough to eliminate a needed depression to accommodate the thick evaporites. By quantifying the halokinetic lateral deformation through time, the results suggest less intensity of the phenomenon throughout the Paleogene, with minor impacts on the petroleumsystemin this period...|$|R

We believe that these anomalies are probably the result of ancient impacts and represent regions of denser material buried beneath the outer depositional crust. Similar anomalies are also found in the region of the north polar ice cap even though a gravity anomaly resulting from the 3 km high icecap has not been uniquely identified.

40|$|Topography {{and gravity}} are {{geophysical}} fields whose joint statistical structure derives from interface-loading processes modulated by the underlying mechanics of <b>isostatic</b> and flexural <b>compensation</b> {{in the shallow}} lithosphere. Under this dual statistical-mechanistic viewpoint an estimation problem can be formulated where the knowns are topography and gravity and the principal unknown the elastic flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. In the guise of an equivalent "effective elastic thickness", this important, geographically varying, structural parameter {{has been the subject}} of many interpretative studies, but precisely how well it is known or how best it can be found from the data, abundant nonetheless, has remained contentious and unresolved throughout the last few decades of dedicated study. The popular methods whereby admittance or coherence, both spectral measures of the relation between gravity and topography, are inverted for the flexural rigidity, have revealed themselves to have insufficient power to independently constrain both it and the additional unknown initial-loading fraction and load-correlation fac- tors, respectively. Solving this extremely ill-posed inversion problem leads to non-uniqueness and is further complicated by practical considerations such as the choice of regularizing data tapers to render the analysis sufficiently selective both in the spatial and spectral domains. Here, we rewrite the problem in a form amenable to maximum-likelihood estimation theory, which we show yields unbiased, minimum-variance estimates of flexural rigidity, initial-loading frac- tion and load correlation, each of those separably resolved with little a posteriori correlation between their estimates. We are also able to separately characterize the isotropic spectral shape of the initial loading processes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Three seismic {{refraction}} profiles obtained between 42 °N and 43 °N {{along the}} median {{valley of the}} Gorda Ridge, an active spreading center, allow the computation of the velocity structure underlying the valley. Wide angle reflections which appear on the seismic records suggest {{the existence of a}} velocity inversion underlying layer 3 and were analyzed in combination with refraction arrivals. The resulting velocity model has a low velocity zone with a directly-determined velocity of 5. 72 km/sec, between crust of velocity 6. 48 km/sec and Moho of velocity 7. 54 km/sec. The velocity inversion is 0. 7 km thick and lies 3 km below acoustic basement. Consideration of the velocity structure of the Gorda Ridge, together with other information on processes involved in oceanic crustal formation, suggests a model which is consistent with current knowledge on oceanic spreading centers. In the proposed model, the rise of asthenospheric material on the ascending limb of a convection cell causes the generation of a small percentage of partial melt. The molten fraction tends to coalesce {{near the top of the}} ascending limb, forming a region of significant partial melt under the ridge crest. This molten material is the immediate source reservoir for mid-ocean ridge magmas. The geophysical expression of the reservoir is a region of low seismic velocity and low density. As the magma cools from the upper surface, heavy minerals tend to work their way downward, forming a layer of cumulate ultramafic rocks at the base of the crust, while the lighter constituents work upward to form the cumulate gabbros of oceanic layer 3. The injection and extrusion of magmatic material upward leads to the formation of layer 2. The crust under the median valley is in isostatic equilibrium with the partial melt during formation, but as it is displaced laterally from the magmatic center, the entire lithosphere becomes competent and the <b>isostatic</b> depth of <b>compensation</b> moves downward into the mantle. This is thought to cause the familiar ridge crest topography of a median valley and adjacent axial mountains observed at slowly spreading ridges. The features of this general model in the specific case of the northern Gorda Ridge between 42 °N and 43 °N have been tested by the comparison of theoretical and observed gravity and magnetic anomalies. The computation of the theoretical gravity anomaly for this model gives values which match the observed anomaly.

40|$|The time {{variations}} of gravity observed with satellite GRACE or with terrestrial measurements {{are due to}} the combination of ice-volume changes and hydrologic mass changes, that add {{to the effects of}} vertical crustal movements and tectonic mass changes. The vertical crustal movement is expected to generate a long-term effect, the hydrologic and ice-mass changes being both seasonal and long-term. The superficial mass variations generate a load variation which induces vertical isostatic crustal accommodation. Apart from the glacial isostatic response, vertical movements can be generated also by tectonic effects: exhumation typically in areas of plate convergence, and subsidence due to sediment compaction, postseismic movements or subduction. At the Himalayan orogen the ongoing uplift has been measured by GPS, and rates of a few mm/yr are typical. The horizontal convergence rates are much greater, in the order of several cm/yr. As crustal material is not destroyed, it implies that the crustal material contributes to crustal thickening, which according to the <b>isostatic</b> degree of <b>compensation</b> is divided into topographic uplift and crustal root thickening. These different mechanisms of mass transfer generate a change in the gravity field combined to different extents of changes in the topography. The observation of this mass transfer would give a useful constraint on understanding the mountain building process. In this study first a review of the observed gravity variations and geometry variations is given, based on published results. It is found that depending on the authors, contrasting conclusions are found regarding the interpretation. The gravity changes have been determined using satellite GRACE as well as through absolute gravity observations. These two data sets differ substantially, as the first gives a spatially averaged result with wavelengths typical of the spatial resolution of the GRACE satellite, whereas the repeated absolute measurements are point-like observations. For the Tibetan plateau GPS observations give evidence that horizontal convergence is 3 - 4 times the uplift rate. The absolute gravity rate at Lhasa set at the South-Eastern border of the plateau is - 1. 97 ± 0. 66 microGal/yr, and when corrected for the observed uplift and assumed erosional denudation remains negative at a rate of - 1. 56 ± 0. 67 microGal/yr (Sun et al., 2011). The residual negative gravity rate has been interpreted as the observation of crustal thickening, in terms of Moho deepening, at a rate of 2. 3 ± 1. 33 cm/yr (Sun et al., 2009). Alternatively, Matsuo and Heki (2010), determine the gravity change from GRACE observations for 2003 - 2009 and attribute the yearly and long term gravity change to hydrologic effects which are concentrated at the outer border of the Tibet plateau, estimated to 47 ± 12 Gigaton/yr iceloss. These authors mention the uncertainty in the contribution of isostatic or tectonic uplift, but think the hydrologic effect to be preponderant in their observations. The GRACE observations were filtered with a Gaussian filter of radius 400 km to reduce short wavelength noise. Yi and Sun (2014) extend the analysis of the GRACE satellite observations to 10 years. Uplift may have the cause of a glacial isostatic movement, of crustal thickening, or a combination of both effects. The difference resides in the mass variations at Moho level: for crustal thickening the Moho is deepened, producing a negative gravity effect; in case of glacial isostatic accommodation the Moho is uplifting, and it produces a positive gravity effect. This signal adds to the positive gravity effect of the uplift, which increases the superficial mass. We here calculate simulations for the Tibet plateau, assuming different geometries and rates for crustal thickening and uplift rates and compare them with the published gravity changes. The simulations quantify the wavelengths and change rates of the expected gravity signal. Another product of the simulations is the so called “viscous ratio”, which is defined as the ratio between terrestrial gravity change rate from absolute gravity observations and the observed uplift, which in southern Alaska is between - 0. 1 to - 0. 2 microGal/mm (Sato et al., 2012), whereas in Tibet at the Lhasa station is much lower, - 2. 5 microGal/mm (Sun et al., 2009; 2011). This difference could be an indicator of the different mechanisms which are affecting the crust-mantle contact. The simulations contribute to define the requirements to future gravity missions apt to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the genesis of the Tibet plateau...|$|R

We specifically address the different modes of deformation taking place in crustal levels according to a self-consistent formulation of the concept of mechanical decoupling. Subsequently, we investigate the style of lithospheric decoupling in the Valencia Trough (NW Mediterranean), a prime example of a young continental rift basin. During its evolution, the lower crust (or at least part of it) acted as a weak, non-competent layer that eventually flowed laterally to accommodate deformation in the subcrustal lithosphere and overlying crust, which became mechanically decoupled. We use a numerical model to discern whether these two layers deformed fully independently (vertical decoupling), or maintaining a mechanical link (horizontal and partial decoupling).

Normal faulting and horizontal extension, however, dominate current tectonic activity, and <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> of thinning crust should lead not to increased but to decreased mean elevations. Here we test the idea that enhanced Quaternary erosion of the Alps and <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> of the mass removed can account for the distribution of present-day geodetically measured rates of vertical movement in the western Alps. Using geophysical relief and Kuhlemann's estimated average erosion rate for the Alps, we quantify the spatial distribution of erosion and the volume of eroded rock, respectively.

The isostatic misfit map evidences excess crustal root as large as 10 km in the western part of the study area, whereas a ‘missing’ crustal root of ∼ 5 km appears east of 4. 3 °E. This excess root/missing topography correlates with the presence of a dense mantle lid, the noticeable southwestward drift of the Western Rif area, and with a current surface uplift. We propose that a delaminated mantle lid progressively detaching westward or southwestward from the overlying crust is responsible for viscous flow of the ductile lower crust beneath the Rif area. This gives rise to isostatic uplift and westward drift due to viscous coupling at the upper/lower crust boundary.

In addition, a corresponding vertical gravity field was evaluated solely from the topography of the Beta region. A comparison of these two maps confirms the strong correlation between gravity and topography which was previously seen in line-of-sight gravity maps. It also demonstrates that the observed gravity is a significant fraction of that predicted from the topography alone. The effective depth of complete <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> for the Beta region {{is estimated to be}} 330 km, which is somewhat deeper than that found for other areas of Venus...|$|E
40|$|Gridded geoid height data (Marsh et al. l, 1986) and gridded {{bathymetry}} data (Van Wykhouse, 1973) {{are used}} to estimate the average compensation depths of 53 oceanic swells and plateaus. The relationship between geoid height and topography is examined using Airy and thermal compensation models. It is shown that geoid height is linearly related to topography between wavelengths of 400 and 4000 m as predicted by <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> models. The geoid/topography ratio {{is dependent on the}} average depth of compensation. The intermediate geoid/topography ratios of most thermal swells are interpreted as a linear combination of the decaying thermal swell signature and that of the persisting Airy-compensated volcanic edifice...|$|E
40|$|In {{order that}} sub-lithospheric density {{variations}} be revealed with the geoid, the regional geoid anomalies associated with bathymetric variations {{must first be}} removed. Spectral techniques were used to generate a synthetic geoid by filtering the residual bathymetry assuming an Airy-type <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> model. An unbiased estimated of the admittances show that for region under study, no single compensation mechanism will explain all of the power in the geoid. Nevertheless, because topographic features are mainly coherent with the geoid, to first order an isostationally compensated lithosphere cut by major E-W fracture zones accounts {{for most of the}} power in the high degree and other SEASAT geoid in the Pacific...|$|E
40|$|We use gravity {{implied by}} the Earth’s rock-equivalent {{topography}} (RET) and modelled <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> masses to evaluate the new global gravity field models (GGMs) from European Space Agency (ESA) ’s Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite gravimetry mission. The topography is now reasonably well-known {{over most of the}} Earth’s landmasses, and also where conventional GGM evaluation is prohibitive due to the lack (or unavailability) of ground-truth gravity data. We construct a spherical harmonic representation of Earth’s RET to derive band-limited topography-implied gravity, and test the somewhat simplistic Airy/Heiskanen and Pratt/Hayford hypotheses of <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation,</b> but which did not improve the agreement between gravity from the uncompensated RET and GOCE. The third-generation GOCE GGMs (based on 12 months of space gravimetry) resolve the Earth’s gravity field effectively up to spherical harmonic degree 200 – 220 (90 – 100 km resolution). Such scales could not be resolved from satellites before GOCE. From the three different GOCE processing philosophies currently in use by ESA, the time-wise and direct approaches exhibit the highest sensitivity to short-scale gravity recovery, being better than the space-wise approach. Our topography-implied gravity comparisons bring evidence of improvements from GOCE to gravity field knowledge over the Himalayas, Africa, the Andes, Papua New Guinea and Antarctic regions. In attenuated form, GOCE captures topography-implied gravity signals up to degree 250 (80 km resolution), suggesting that other signals (originating, e. g., from the crust-mantle boundary and buried loads) are captured as well, which might now improve our knowledge on the Earth’s lithosphere structure at previously unresolved spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|Between 1997 and 2003, Central Europe was {{the target}} of large {{international}} seismic programs to investigate the upper lithosphere. So far, new results concerning the Eastern Alpine region include a 3 D model of the P-wave velocity in the crust and a map of the Mohorovicic discontinuity (Moho) and interpretations of two representative profiles [...] Taking gravity data into account, these models provide also insights into the density distribution of the lithosphere and <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation.</b> The lateral distribution of the crustal velocities and the new Moho map enable to determine a significant fragmentation of the lithosphere. The inferred kinematics of the crustal blocks is closely related to Neogene tectonics and displacements observed by GPS...|$|E
40|$|Magellan gravity data {{confirm that}} several of the large, tectonically deformed, plateau-like {{highlands}} on venus are shallowly compensated, most likely by crustal thickness variations. Apparent depths of <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation,</b> computed in the spatial domain, range from 30 to 50 km for Alpha, Tellus, Ovda, and Thetis Regiones. Using a two-layer model for <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation,</b> Alpha, Tellus, and Ovda are best represented as nearly completely compensated in crust that is regionally 20 - 40 km thick around these highlands, with little contribution from deeper mantle sources. In contrast to these three areas, a stronger regional gravity high associated with Thetis requires a significant upper mantle component to compensation. This is evident in the spectral admittance as a pronounced deep, long-wavelength anomaly. In the two-layer isostatic model, a broad, deeply compensated upland underlies a shallowly compensated central block of Thetis. If this deep component is interpreted as a thermal anomaly, the loci of maximum upwelling agree well with sites of recent extension. The plateau highlands are thus physiographically and isostatically equivalent to terrestrial continents, though probably not compositionally. They also share the record of a long tectonic history. The large regional gravity anomaly of Thetis indicates that active mantle proceses continue even beneath some areas (tessera) thought to be a relic of a former geological regime. The excellent agreement of modeled crustal thicknesses around Alpha, Tellus, and Ovda Regiones suggests that 20 - 40 km is a representative global value for the plains. Such a crust is thicker than previously estimated and about twice as thick as the expected thickness of crust produced at venusian spreading center...|$|E
40|$|A global lunar {{topographic}} map with a spatial resolution of finer than 0. 5 degree has been derived {{using data from}} the laser altimeter (LALT) on board the Japanese lunar explorer Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE or Kaguya). In comparison with the previous Unified Lunar Control Network (ULCN 2005) model, the new map reveals unbiased lunar topography for scales finer than a few hundred kilometers. Spherical harmonic analysis of global topographic data for the Moon, Earth, Mars, and Venus suggests that <b>isostatic</b> <b>compensation</b> is the prevailing lithospheric support mechanism at large scales. However, simple rigid support is suggested to dominate for the Moon, Venus, and Mars for smaller scales, which may indicate a drier lithosphere than on Earth, especially for the Moon and Venus...|$|E
