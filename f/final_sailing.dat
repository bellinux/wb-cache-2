5|$|On 15 October 1787, Bounty left Deptford for Spithead, in the English Channel, {{to await}} <b>final</b> <b>sailing</b> orders. Adverse weather delayed arrival at Spithead until 4 November. Bligh {{was anxious to}} depart quickly, to reach Cape Horn {{before the end of}} the short {{southern}} summer, but the Admiralty did not accord him high priority and delayed issuing the orders for a further three weeks. When Bounty finally sailed on 28 November, the ship was trapped by contrary winds and unable to clear Spithead until 23 December. With the prospect of a passage around Cape Horn now in serious doubt, Bligh received permission from the Admiralty to take, if necessary, an alternative route to Tahiti via the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E

After returning from her last port visit in Bermuda, the ship conducted two days sails for families and past crew members, on the 7 and 8 March 2017, respectively. The vessel conducted a <b>final</b> <b>sail</b> past of Halifax harbour on 10 March 2017, upon which she was paid off and the ships company reassigned to other units.|$|R

25|$|A {{passenger}} ferry service also operated {{for many}} years between Wellington and Lyttelton (the port closest to Christchurch). This service was operated by the Union Steam Ship Company, and the passenger ferries typically operated an overnight service, although in later years the last of these vessels, the Rangatira, operated alternate nights in each direction plus a daylight sailing from Lyttelton to Wellington on Saturdays (so as to get a balance of four sailings in each direction, each week). One of these passenger ferries, the Wahine, was lost in a storm as it entered Wellington Harbour on 10 April 1968, {{with the loss of}} 51 passengers and crew. The <b>final</b> <b>sailing</b> of the Rangatira, which was custom built and entered service in 1972, was on 15 September 1976, after two money-losing years (subsidised by the government).|$|E
500|$|Bounty left London on 15 October 1787, {{and after}} {{being held at}} Spithead {{awaiting}} <b>final</b> <b>sailing</b> orders was further delayed by [...] bad weather; it was 23 December before the ship was finally away. This long hiatus caused Bounty to arrive at Cape Horn much {{later in the season}} than planned and to encounter very severe weather. Unable to make progress against westerly gales and enormous seas, Bligh finally turned the ship and headed east. He would now have to take the alternative, much longer route to the Pacific, sailing first to Cape Town and then south of Australia and New Zealand, before working northwards to Tahiti.|$|E
2500|$|On July 2, 1925, {{the ship}} was again renamed—this time as the SS Montnairn. [...] She sailed {{for the next few}} months between Liverpool and Quebec.

50|$|While {{living in}} Darwin, {{the capital of}} Australia's Northern Territory, Stuart met New Zealander Kerry George Hamill. Glass and Hamill {{purchased}} a 28-foot, traditional Malaysian perahu bedar named Foxy Lady. Together with Hamill's Australian girlfriend, Gail Colley, Glass and Hamill sailed Foxy Lady north to Timor, {{and from there to}} the island of Flores, in eastern Indonesia, then on to Bali. At this point, Gail Colley left the boat. Jan Seeley crewed with them to Singapore from where they continued to Penang where they were joined other travellers, including Gail Colley and Phillip Parsonson, and they sailed up the Strait of Malacca to the Thai island of Phuket. Some time in June 1978—following the departure of Gail Colley—Stuart and Kerry sailed around the tip of the Malaysian peninsula and up to Kuala Terengganu, on Malaysia's eastern coast. There they met another young traveller, Englishman John Dawson Dewhirst, who joined Foxy Lady on her <b>final</b> <b>sail</b> into Cambodian waters.|$|R

40|$|A Matlab-FEM code {{has been}} {{developed}} for deformation analysis of sails as a MSc <b>final</b> project. <b>Sails</b> are modelled as isotropic homogeneous membranes reinforced with cables. The problem, fully non-linear, is resolved by assembling the global stiffness matrix of a mesh of membrane and cable elements in the MatlabTM environment to get an N-equations N-unknowns system. The solution is found with a Quasi- Newton solver. Validation has been performed by comparing numerical results obtained from the developed code with analytical solutions of geometrically simple cases and with experimental data from tests {{carried out in the}} DINAV Ship Structures laboratory. A full Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis of a main sail has been carried out coupling the code with an aerodynamics panel code developed as another MSc final project (Vernengo, 2008). The result is in accordance with the physics of the phenomena and engineering judgment...|$|R
