40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} {{development}} cooperation of RWE Power, BASF and Linde - aiming at an advanced optimised CO 2 -scrubbing technology for power plant application - the first post-combustion capture pilot plant in Germany was constructed and commissioned at the lignite-fired 1, 000  MW Niederaussem power station in 2009. The pre-assembly of the pilot plant started in October 2008 and commissioning took place in July 2009 as planned. 7. 2 t of CO 2 per day can be captured from a flue gas slipstream of the power plant downstream of the desulphurisation plant (FGD). The pilot plant comprises optimised components such as a flue gas pre-scrubbing direct contact cooler unit {{as well as a}} lean liquid cooler and an <b>interstage</b> <b>cooler</b> that both allow returning the solvent at different absorber heights. During a 6 -month campaign, all aspects of the optimised process configuration were tested using 30 %-weight MEA as benchmark solvent and the performance of a new advanced amine-based solvent developed by BASF was trialled. This paper summarises the operational experience gained and compares some of the results obtained for MEA with those of the new amine-based solvent...|$|E

The package is easy to use with user friendly interface utilizing the graphical capabilities of the personal computer. The model used in the package is a heterogeneous model, which has been checked against an industrial reactor having three adiabatic beds with <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling,</b> and gave excellent agreement with the industrial data. The two-point boundary value differential equation for the catalyst particles is solved using the orthogonal collocation method and three internal collocation points are necessary to obtain accurate results. The model is used to investigate the optimal behavior of the reactor...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Energy is {{investigating}} the use of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR) [Oh, 2005] to produce electricity and hydrogen. In anticipation of the design, development and procurement of an advanced power conversion system for HTGR, this study was initiated to identify the major design and technology options and their tradeoffs {{in the evaluation of}} power conversion system (PCS) options to support future research and procurement decisions. These PCS technology options affect cycle efficiency, capital cost, system reliability and maintainability and technical risk, and therefore the cost of electricity from Generation IV systems. In this study, we investigated the effect of <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> in the PCS and present some results...|$|R
40|$|By the {{everyday}} increasing enthusiasm for using renewable-sustainable sources in energy production area, focusing on one and optimizing {{it in the}} best possible way should be of much interest. Biogas production from anaerobic digestion of wastes is a well known energy source which could be applied more efficiently if the CO 2 portion of it would be upgraded to CH 4 as well. There is a methanation reaction which could convert carbon dioxide to methane with the use of hydrogenation. In this report, the effort is to simulate this methanation reactor which is a catalytic bed of ruthenium on alumina base. The temperature change and its’ effect on reaction kinetics and equilibrium, also deriving designing parameters for the catalyst bed are different tasks which was tried to be covered in this thesis work. Based on calculations, the reactor can operate isothermally or adiabatically. The point is that each method has its own cons and pros. For the isothermal case finally the optimum temperature to run the reaction is decided to be 600 K in 10 bar total pressure. In adiabatic case then it is understood to work on <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> strategy which in given conditions came to the number of 6 for reactors and 5 for <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> devices. Afterwards it is thought to apply some technical changes to conventional adiabatic method and recycle some part of the product to the entrance of the reactor and assist the conversion. In this method number of reactors would be reduced to 2 and one heat exchanger in the middle. Selecting the best process in large scale treatment, needs lots of economical analysis and detail design while in small scale condition the most preferred method to run the reaction is isothermal...|$|R
40|$|The modeling, simulation, {{and dynamic}} {{optimization}} of an industrial reaction system for acetylene hydrogenation {{are discussed in}} the present work. The process consists of three adiabatic fixed-bed reactors, in series, with <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling.</b> These reactors are located after the compression and the caustic scrubbing sections of an ethylene plant, characterizing a front-end system; in contrast to the tail-end system where the reactors are placed after the de-ethanizer unit. The acetylene conversion and selectivity profiles for the reactors are optimized, taking into account catalyst deactivation and process constraints. A dynamic optimal temperature profile that maximizes ethylene production and meets product specifications is obtained by controlling the feed and intercoolers temperatures. An industrial acetylene hydrogenation system is used to provide the necessary data to adjust kinetics and transport parameters and to validate the approach...|$|R
40|$|In a batch electro-electrodialysis (EED), sodium {{sulphate}} solution {{with an initial}} concentration of 80. 90 g/dm 3 was converted to obtain solutions of sodium hydroxide (13. 96 %) and sulphuric acid (10. 15 %) and a dialysate (3. 23 g/dm 3 of sulphate ions). Changes in the EED process′ performance (temperature, cell voltage, concentrations, energy consumption) with an increasing conversion degree of salt are presented. Based on the presented results of the batch experiment, conditions necessary to run the process continuously are discussed. A single pass method is inapplicable due to excessive heating of the electro-electrodialyser. A cascade method enables <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> of the solutions, providing temperatures suitable for ion-exchange membranes to work. Increasing the number of stages in the cascade reduces both the number of electro-electrodialysers and specific electric energy consumption, providing the same production capacity. However, this increases the investment cost...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{describes}} how experimentally generated results {{were used to}} optimize conversion of a process using adiabatic batch reactor systems. The process used in the experiment was exothermic reversible process. The experiments were conducted using Dewar Thermos-flask operating under adiabatic conditions. Equilibrium conversions were determined from temperature–time information. Temperatures were determined using negative temperature coefficient thermistor. For a single batch process, the equilibrium conversion determined experimentally was shown to be 0.55 and 0.21 with respect to acetic acid using two initial temperatures of 283  K and 295  K, respectively. It is shown by a simple geometrical approach that without {{the knowledge of the}} kinetics of the process, by increasing the number of reactors and considering internal cooling systems, the reaction equilibrium lines were crossed and conversion improved significantly. The paper also shows that one can attain the maximum possible conversion of 0.72, thus increasing equilibrium conversions by 31  % by adding a single adiabatic reactor to the single-stage adiabatic reactor by this geometrical technique, and hence proposes the optimal reactor configuration with <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> system to achieve this optimal conversion.|$|R
40|$|In {{the effort}} to reduce the release of CO{sub 2 } {{greenhouse}} gases to the atmosphere, sequestration of CO{sub 2 } from Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Oxy-Fuel power plants is being pursued. This approach, however, requires significant compression power to boost the pressure to typical pipeline levels. The penalty can {{be as high as}} 8 % to 12 % on a typical IGCC plant. The goal of this research is to reduce this penalty through novel compression concepts and integration with existing IGCC processes. The primary objective of the study of novel CO{sub 2 } compression concepts is to boost the pressure of CO{sub 2 } to pipeline pressures with the minimal amount of energy required. Fundamental thermodynamics were studied to explore pressure rise in both liquid and gaseous states. For gaseous compression, the project investigated novel methods to compress CO{sub 2 } while removing the heat of compression internal to the compressor. The high-pressure ratio due to the delivery pressure of the CO{sub 2 } for enhanced oil recovery results in significant heat of compression. Since less energy is required to boost the pressure of a cooler gas stream, both upstream and <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> is desirable. While isothermal compression has been utilized in some services, it has not been optimized for the IGCC environment. This project determined the optimum compressor configuration and developed technology concepts for internal heat removal. Other compression options using liquefied CO{sub 2 } and cryogenic pumping were explored as well. Preliminary analysis indicates up to a 35 % reduction in power is possible with the new concepts being considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{problem is}} examined: {{for a given}} system of reactions with given kinetics, find all the possible outlet conditions {{that can be achieved}} by using any system of steady-flow chemical reactors. The outlet conditions or variables that are considered include concentrations, residence time and temperature. This set of all possible outlet conditions for a given feed was called the Attainable Region by Horn (1964). The boundary of the attainable region is of particular interest as, provided the objective function has open contours over the space of Hie attainable region, the optimum of a system of steady flow reactors will lie in the boundary of the region. More importantly, the optimal reactor structure can be determined from the reactorri that form the boundary of the. attainable region. The prr>-oerties of reaction and mixing are interpreted geometrically and from this a set of necessary conditions for the attainable region is derived. In particular the region must be convex with non-zero reaction vectors on the boundary either pointing into or tangent to the region. A limited, but powerful, sufficiency condition is also derived. The attainable region is constucted for both two and three dimensional examples. It is also shown how the region can be constructed when constraints, such as a specified sequence of reactors, are imposed. The properties of a reactor that lies in the boundary of the attainable region in n-dimensional space are discussed, and in principle the attainable region can be constructed in any number of dimensions. The most important and novel result found is that the method generates the structure of the reactor network that makes up the boundary of the attainable region and hence for many problems the optimal reactor network. This is in contrast to all previous methods where one guessed a network and then optimized it for various parameter values. It was also found that the optimal reactor configuration would in almost also all cases be a series-parallel arrangement of C. S. T. R 's, plug flow reactors and bypasses. Furthermore, the geometry of the boundary of the attainable region gives rise to analytical conditions for optimum reactors structures that are otherwise not readily available. Other interesting results were: - the boundary of the attainable region has very different properties depending on whether the dimension of the space is even or odd, suggesting that the optimization of systems of reactors in even and odd dimensional space could yield rather different results. - the geometric optimization of <b>interstage</b> <b>cooling</b> and coldshot reactors firstly gives insight into the known analytical conditions, but furthermore applies under conditions where the simple analytical optimization breaks down. - the well known properties of plug flow reactors with first order kinetics can be easily explained by the geometric properties of the attainable region...|$|R
