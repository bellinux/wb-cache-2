25|$|The socialist {{orientation}} of IFTU was {{complicated by the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> Appleton, came from the non-political camp and had been an ally of Gompers. Moreover, IFTU demanded that the British TUC and GFTU had to merge into a single organization. The result was that TUC decided {{that it would be}} the sole British representative in the IFTU. Thus the GFTU leader Appleton resigned as IFTU president. He was replaced by J. H. Thomas.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so he knows how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> {{were not}} habitually either magistrates or lawyers, but men clad in sword and cape, caused {{that they did}} not have any vote in court cases, and the court did not submit to their authority, but in {{representation}} <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> king. Thus, the authority of <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> when he was not a magistrate, was void in judicial matter and merely signed the verdicts. The Audiencias chaired by the viceroy were called viceregal Audiencias, and the chaired ones by a governor-captain general were the pretorial Audiencias.|$|R

While local elections {{are often used}} by Romanian parties as a preliminary test of future general election, the electoral system used made them more then that.

5000|$|This {{move was}} {{undoubtedly}} related to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> party would ensure for its members {{direct access to}} state resources. The main point, however, is that {{since most of the}} NDP's members were originally members of the disbanded ASU, its creation was more the result of presidential instigation than of pressures from an organised constituency. Put differently, the mass conversion from [...] "socialist" [...] to [...] "democratic" [...] ideology implied not only the desire to remain under direct presidential patronage, but also <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emergence of the ruling NDP was no more reflective of constituency interests than the ASU was under Nasser's party system.|$|R
6000|$|Immediately some of {{the gentlemen}} {{composing}} that body wrote out a call for a meeting and had it published in their papers. This call, however, went very much further than Mr. Lincoln had contemplated, as {{he did not say}} the [...] "Legislature of Virginia" [...] but [...] "the body which called itself the Legislature of Virginia." [...] Mr. Stanton saw the call as published in the Northern papers the very next issue and took the liberty of countermanding the order authorizing any meeting of the Legislature, or any other body, and this notwithstanding the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was nearer the spot than he was.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may {{be safely}} assumed that no motive of {{convenience}} {{to the citizens}} requires the reception of bank paper." [...] In addition to this, Mr. Silas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the Senate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the revenue in specie. It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it {{was done by the}} votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators. No subtreasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by Congress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon {{the question of whether the}} administration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it that the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> at first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head as publicly recants it as he at first espoused it. I repeat, then, that by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie. Now mark what the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made there are but between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States. The expenditures of the Government for the year 1838--the last for which we have had the report--were forty millions. Thus it is seen that if the whole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it. By this means more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the whole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps not more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less than one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and shinplasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation. By this means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and most likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the specie-men have of it,--each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to his share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men. In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised? And was the sacred name of Democracy ever before made to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people? ...|$|E

50|$|The sole caveat to this {{position}} of presidential pre-eminence was <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> selection to <b>the</b> premiership required {{approval by the}} National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament: because the Assembly can dismiss the government {{by a vote of}} no confidence, it follows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prime minister must command a majority in the Assembly. This was not a problem whilst the legislative majority was aligned with <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> and indeed, de Gaulle, who was responsible for inspiring much of <b>the</b> Constitution, envisioned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> will resign if the people disavow him in an Assembly election, and will then elect a new president (there is no vice-president in France) and a new election takes places less than two months after a resignation, a new president being elected for a new, full term; that happened in 1969, when de Gaulle resigned because the people voted against a referendum proposed by him).|$|R

50|$|The Chancellor {{chairs the}} {{meetings}} of the cabinet. The constitution does not vest the Chancellor with the authority to issue directions to ministers; it characterizes his or {{her role in the}} cabinet as that of a primus inter pares. The power of the office to set policy derives partly from its inherent prestige, partly from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> is required to dismiss ministers the Chancellors requests removed, and partly from the Chancellor's position of leadership in the party or coalition controlling the National Council.|$|E

50|$|Since 1962, French {{presidents have}} been elected by popular vote, {{replacing}} the electoral college, which was only used once. This change was intended to give Fifth Republic presidents more power than they might have had under the original constitution. While still seen as the symbol and embodiment of the nation, the president also was given a popular mandate. Of course, the majority party of the National Assembly retained power as well, but since the popularly elected president appointed the prime minister, the former was seen as having {{the upper hand in}} any conflict between executive and legislature. Furthermore, the imbalance is further illustrated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> can dissolve the Assembly at any time (but not more than once in a year), whereas the legislature has no powers of removal against the president.|$|E
50|$|Although Álvarez had {{appeared}} ascendant by 1982, some observers described {{the political situation}} in Honduras as a triumvirate, with Brigadier General Álvarez formulating national security policy and refraining from a direct military takeover of the government, President Suazo supporting Álvarez's policies in return for military tolerance of his rule and military support for his domestic policies, and the United States government providing the economic and military aid that helped sustain the arrangement. Some disputed the claim that Suazo was subservient to the military, pointing out the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> refused to increase {{the budget of the}} armed forces. That budget, however, failed to take foreign military aid into account. The increase in United States military aid from US$3.3 million in fiscal year 1980 to US$31.3 million in FY 1982, therefore, represented a substantial expansion in the military's role in government.|$|E
