500|$|In October 2011, Smith {{spoke to}} Q Radio {{about the new}} album. [...] "It's {{still going to be}} fairly electronic, I think, {{compared}} to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E
500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time." [...] Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reactions}} by both professional {{critics and}} fans {{to the release}} of Confield were mixed, though generally positive. According to Sean Booth, [...] "most of Confield came out of experiments with Max that weren't really applicable in a club environment." [...] In contrast, 2003's Draft 7.30 was seen by some as an easier record to grasp. Booth stated in an interview around the release of Draft 7.30 that [...] " [...] doesn't seem to limit us in the way it did when we first started. Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> get it, we're totally fluent in it and can be more expressive." ...|$|E

5000|$|On the Rolling Stones' {{experiments}} with country, Jagger said in 2003, [...] "The country songs, like 'Factory Girl' or 'Dear Doctor', on Beggars Banquet were really pastiche. There's {{a sense of}} humour in country music anyway, a {{way of looking at}} life in a humorous kind of way - and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> acknowledging that element of the music." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to conventional, paid advertising, In-N-Out benefits from positive {{word of mouth}} spread by enthusiastic fans. For many years, it has given customers free bumper stickers which simply say [...] "In-N-Out Burger". The company helps devoted customers advertise its brand by selling souvenir clothing with the In-N-Out logo. Celebrity fans and free endorsements in mass media also promote the business. When Heisman Trophy winner and Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith raved about In-N-Out cheeseburgers during a press conference before the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, a senior executive said, [...] "It does not get much better than that for us. We're kind of a small company, {{and we do not}} have any celebrity endorsers. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> got the best one we could have." [...] Huell Howser was allowed, in what is believed to be a first, to film with his television cameras inside a store for a California's Gold Special. The show also included a behind-the-scenes tour of the In-N-Out Headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{members of}} Our Lady Peace began writing new {{material}} together {{soon after the}} Gravity tour began. In October 2002 they returned briefly to Bob Rock's Maui studio to record two unfinished songs from Gravity that were planned to be released on a soundtrack, which never happened. [...] "Working with him on that soundtrack song was just another reaffirmation for us how well we work together," [...] Maida stated in an October interview. [...] "With the way this band has grown, and the way we've come to trust Bob, it would be ridiculous for us to look for another producer now. When we're all together, {{we feel like we}} can do anything. We have to go at least one more round with him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> scratched the surface of what we can do together." [...] By the end of 2002, the band was eager to re-enter the studio in Maui to begin laying down demos with Rock. Two new songs, [...] "Not Afraid" [...] and [...] "Talk is Cheap" [...] were premiered in March 2003 while touring in Europe with Avril Lavigne.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Brad Delson {{experimented with}} an EBow when {{the band was}} piecing {{together}} [...] "The Little Things Give You Away". The band decided {{not to use the}} effect for the solo in that song and instead ended up creating [...] "No More Sorrow" [...] out of the effect. In [...] "Given Up", he jingles the keys that are heard while several clap sounds are overlaid in the intro of the song (as mentioned in the lyric book: Brad added the sounds on the intro song: multiple tracks of claps - and keys jingling.). Shinoda and Delson teamed up with David Campbell to add string elements to six songs; [...] "Leave Out All the Rest", [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "Hands Held High", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", as well as the two b-sides [...] "No Roads Left" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds" [...] (which was instead later used in the iPhone game 8-Bit Rebellion! as well as being included as a bonus track for A Thousand Suns), respectively. All scratching elements by Joe Hahn that existed in the previous two studio albums are largely absent because of the low mixing, except on the songs [...] "What I've Done", [...] "Wake", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] and [...] "In Pieces". Hahn contributes more with programming, electronics, and other elements to many of the songs. The church organ and military drumbeat on [...] "Hands Held High" [...] were originally to be used as the backdrop to melodic vocals, but Rubin recommended that the band try the opposite approach according to the album booklet. For the album, the band recorded fifty to sixty songs in August 2006. Their previous albums took only about three to six months to complete, while this one took 14 months. They spent over six months writing the songs. In previous albums, they composed an average of 40 songs, but they made over 100 this time. [...] "Shadow of the Day" [...] is one of two songs (the other being [...] "No Roads Left") to have Bennington playing the guitar. During live performances, Shinoda is generally playing the keyboard for [...] "Shadow of the Day", while Bennington plays rhythm guitar. Shinoda stated in an interview: [...] "We were looking back at the things that we had done in the past... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> figured that we had exhausted that sound. It was easy for us to replicate, it was easy for other bands to replicate, and we just needed to move on." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{video game}} Deus Ex: Human Revolution, {{which is set}} in the future and {{features}} a cyborg who was attacked then augmented by a megacorporation has two police officers, one called Alex Murphy, in a police station in Detroit discussing [...] "That 80s movie about the cop that gets shot up" [...] then one of the men turns to the player and says [...] "Hey, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> talking about you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A {{lot more}} mature. A lot more focused. We {{just had a}} lot more time to spend with it. Working with Butch Walker in the studio just made us a lot more efficient, and we could move a lot faster.

5000|$|... {{the best}} women's {{basketball}} game ever played Goldberg Jeff Jacobs {{notes that the}} book is [...] "well-written" [...] with great metaphors, but the real core {{of the book is}} narrative. He writes [...] "Women's basketball hasn't left enough permanent footprints in sports literature. From the moment he walked outside Gampel Pavilion, turned to former Courant sports writer Matt Eagan, the beat guy at the time, and said, ' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> saw the best women's basketball game ever played,' this was in the back of Goldberg's mind." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{band was}} {{also trying to}} be {{unpredictable}} in their songwriting, especially with Traces. Jermaine Ochoa Peck says, [...] "With the music industry in general, this wave of sound is different from how it sounded before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> also <b>just</b> rode that wave. People are starting to be more open to the different sound…indie folk. It’s not only us, there’s {{a lot of other}} bands, who are also getting into this kind of music as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{paused a}} moment and then added: [...] "As a matter of fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may <b>just</b> as well go down later in the day. I have some writing to do, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you told me, Rupert, that you thought of going to the Dulwich Gallery. I was rather too impetuous. Very likely he wouldn't be in. But if we get down by the 5.15, which gets to Purley about 6, I expect <b>we</b> shall <b>just</b> catch him." ...|$|R

No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better wait a while, Mr. Joyce,” he said, as the latter dipped his paddle in the water and turned the boat’s head towards the island.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2012, {{the band}} also {{began working with}} {{producer}} and LCD Soundsystem frontman James Murphy, whom the band had been wanting to work with for over six years. Butler: [...] "LCD Soundsystem to me is like New Order and the B-52's and we deeply share {{a lot of those}} influences, and we did completely different things with it. Régine is kind of the person who dances. At any given minute, if you can get Régine to dance, you're kind of on the right track, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> wanted to make a record that Régine could dance to." ...|$|E

5000|$|Guitarist Nick Hipa had the {{following}} to say regarding {{the direction of}} the album. [...] "Collectively we've all pushed ourselves, and we're all doing things that we weren't even capable of doing on the last record. And on top of just experimenting and trying different things, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> wrote some pretty sick jams, so I'm happy with it. That's all I can say. For kids who like our band and think they know what to expect from us, it might throw them off a little bit [...] [...] [...] I encourage anybody who likes our band to approach this album with an open mind."

I told you mother does work, but she mayn't be able to get any at first, so we can't reckon on that. When she does, you know, we shall be able gradually to buy the furniture." ...|$|R
2500|$|Martie: [...] "We {{had reached}} a point where we were {{laughing}} a lot about it, and people didn't really know how far it had gone. I realized I had suppressed a lot about the death threat. It all came flooding back in the process of writing this song, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all realized <b>just</b> how painful it had been for us.." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jagger countered, saying, [...] "The country songs, like 'Factory Girl' or 'Dear Doctor' on Beggars Banquet {{were really}} pastiche. There's {{a sense of}} humour in country music anyway, a {{way of looking at}} life in a humorous kind of way - and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> {{acknowledging}} that element of the music. The 'country' songs we recorded later, like [...] "Dead Flowers" [...] on Sticky Fingers or [...] "Far Away Eyes" [...] on Some Girls are slightly different. The actual music is played completely straight, but it's me who's not going legit with the whole thing, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'm a blues singer not a country singer." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March and April 2008, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a headlining US tour, during which they only performed acoustically. They were supported by PlayRadioPlay!, Treaty of Paris and Secondhand Serenade. In addition, MxPx was originally scheduled to support as well, however, they had to pull out due to scheduling conflicts. As a result, the Spill Canvas took their place. On April 25, the band announced they would be going on an indefinite hiatus. Key explained that [...] "It doesn't {{have anything to do}} with turmoil in the band. It's more of a, facing adulthood now, and we can't stay in Neverland forever. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> need a break." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} named after an annual fair in Spring Hill, Queensland, suburb of Brisbane Grammar School, Forster's high school. Some of the band had also lived there in the early eighties. McLennan said of the title, [...] "It was {{generally}} not that we were home sick, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> wanted to have, after Before Hollywood, which was so obviously an American kind of thing, a regional home-town thing." [...] In another interview McLennan stated [...] "we all lived there and the main reason was that in September, October of every year in Brisbane, there is, in Spring Hill, a fair, and as the album came out around then {{we thought it would}} be nice to have a parochial mention in a title because we hadn't done that for a long time." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Brothers and Sisters" [...] {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{additions}} to the album. [...] "It was a kind of track that took quite a different direction for most of its life", said Rowntree. [...] "...And then right at the end we switched about and took it in a different direction, it wasn't quite so dark." [...] "It sounded more like The Velvet Underground when we started", claimed Albarn. [...] "It was too overtly about one thing. It was too druggy, in a way, which is a kind of weird thing, 'cause the song is all about drugs so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> pushed ourselves a bit more with it and gave it a lot more space - countered by the list and the list was kind of sort of inspired by the life of JFK and his need to have 28 drugs everyday of his Presidency just to keep him functioning." ...|$|E
5000|$|Appearing at Elliott Bay Book Company in Seattle in 2006, Saknussemm fielded {{questions}} about the rumor, remarking, [...] "As Zanesville {{has much to do}} with the idea of the Conspiracy Theory as the folk religion of our time, I'm somewhat amused. But I've heard something similar about Poppy Z. Brite. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>just</b> like hoaxes and rumors. They reassure us that we can actually participate in the manufacture of reality. But as one of my characters says, 'I'm real enough.'" [...] A series of readings in New York and appearances on public radio and at the Squaw Valley Community of Writers helped to dispel the rumor.|$|R
2500|$|With {{writing and}} {{recording}} commencing {{almost immediately after}} finishing touring, the band were inspired to capture the energy of their live performances. Despite having previously received acclaim for redefining their sound record-to-record, the band felt little pressure to repeat this, Brian Lane simple stated that as with previous recording sessions, the band had become bored of performing their older material, and would naturally look to write and record songs that were different. Guitarist Vincent Accardi commented that [...] "after The Devil and God, the structures of songs were a bit more complex and things {{were a little bit}} delicate. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>just</b> had a great urge to try to write simple, loud rock songs and just get the point across immediately".|$|R
5000|$|Fahey's most {{sustained}} television {{work was}} {{a starring role}} in the one-season (1961-62) series Father of the Bride. It was based upon a film {{of the same name}} starring Elizabeth Taylor. Fahey likely got the role because, as one newspaper reviewer pointed out, she [...] "looks enough like Liz Taylor to be her sister." [...] Fahey was not flattered by the comparison, however, telling one interviewer [...] "the fact that I'm supposed to look like Elizabeth Whats-Her-Name {{had nothing to do with}} my getting part, because we don't really look alike <b>I</b> don't <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> happen to have the same colorings." [...] Fahey wanted to be released from the show even before it came up for renewal, reportedly feeling too much emphasis was being placed on the [...] "father" [...] character and not enough on her [...] "bride." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in 2008, Browning tells Radio Bonnaroo how a Jimmy Stewart session {{contributed to}} the {{composition}} of the Umphrey's McGee track entitled “Gulf Stream. “Gulf Stream actually came out of what we call a ‘Jimmy Stewart’, which is our version of an improv. And it came out of one at the Eagles Ballroom at The Rave in Milwaukee, Wisconsin not too far from our hometown in Chicago. It was actually a pretty neat night because, typically the improvs are based around mostly instrumental music, but that night Jake actually stepped up to the microphone over that chord progression and started singing. And Brendan not to miss a beat stepped up and started singing the round with him. So {{the two of them were}} essentially just improv-ing not only music but the vocals as well. And when we got off stage, everyone loved it and said ‘Hey, we should, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> wrote a song!” ...|$|E

5000|$|On 21 July 2005, {{a second}} series of explosions were {{reported}} in London, two weeks and some hours after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Four controlled explosions, of devices considerably less advanced {{than those of the}} previous attacks, were carried out at Shepherd's Bush, Warren Street and Oval underground stations, and on a bus in Shoreditch. Even though the attacks on the 21st were less severe than those on the 7th, Blair was reported to have said that the bombings in London today were intended [...] "to scare people and to frighten them, to make them anxious and worried".

5000|$|According to Barry Gibb, [...] "I think 'Melody Fair' {{was written}} in the studio, we used to write a lot of stuff on the spot in the studio. We often used to go to {{recording}} studios without any songs at all. Because the time was booked and we had to be there. So we'd turn up at seven at night, and we'd basically start writing and cutting the backing track of a song that wasn't finished. <b>We</b> would <b>just</b> create it in that way. A lot of albums were done in a month or five weeks. The first one was three weeks, 'Melody Fair' was probably influenced by 'Eleanor Rigby', I was wanting to make the same kind of statement".
