5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success <b>in</b> <b>taking</b> control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E

5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start <b>in</b> <b>taking</b> pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E

5|$|He {{has been}} called the radical {{conservative}} of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty <b>in</b> <b>taking</b> a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.|$|E
