5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these <b>intercity</b> <b>services</b> the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E
