40|$|Abstract- The {{usage of}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has grown {{drastically}} {{because of their}} ability to operate in dangerous locations while keeping their human operators at a safe distance. UAVs are widely used in military operations nowadays because of their reliability, cost effectiveness and multi-functionality. The problem we posed in this paper is the weight lifting capacity of UAVs. Improvement in weight lifting capacity may leads to adding a more function in account of UAVs. To validate this proposal, we considered many different structures of UAVs and choose Quadrotor. The payload of our Quadrotor is around 4 kg which adds function of weight lifting in military operations as well as industrial applications. Calculation of aerodynamic <b>drag-lift</b> <b>forces</b> has been done. The stresses generated in the body of quadrotor is not more than 22. 5 MPa in "Box " sectional chassis and 22. 2 MPa in "C " Sectional chassis as per the practical testing. To validate these results, the stress analysis of two types of body of quadrotor ("Box " and "C " section) is carried out in ANSYS static structural solver. As per the Static Structural solver the stress generated are 15. 4 MPa and 16. 97 MPa in "Box " and "C " sectional chassis respectively. Further analysis and fabrication of model is under process. Quadrotor can be used in safety, inspection of tool in construction industry, toxic material handling, transmitting important and emergency orders...|$|E
