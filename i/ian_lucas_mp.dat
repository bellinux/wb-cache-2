The research tested primary school children at two time points (when children started attending breakfast clubs and approximately 6 months later) and compared their {{performance on a}} variety of measures to those children not attending a school breakfast club. The researchers found that children attending breakfast clubs maintain or slightly increase their level of companionship across the six month period. Conversely, for those children not attending breakfast club, there was a significant decrease in their level of companionship for the same time period...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007 {{the then}} culture {{minister}} Margaret Hodge {{said she would}} consider a redesign of the Union Flag to incorporate the Welsh dragon, during a debate in the House of Commons on {{the frequency with which}} the flag flies above public buildings. The issue was initially raised by <b>Ian</b> <b>Lucas,</b> another Labour <b>MP,</b> who complained that the flag introduced in 1606 following the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne as James I combined the cross of St George and the saltire of St Andrew. This principle continued in 1801 when the St Patrick cross was incorporated following the Union with Ireland Act 1800. Lucas claimed the identity of Wales had been suppressed ever since the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. In the debate, Albert Owen MP said that [...] "we in Wales do not feel part of the union flag because the dragon or the cross of St David is not on it." [...] Conservative MP Stewart Jackson described the comments as [...] "eccentric".|$|R

5000|$|At {{that moment}} a {{difficult}} time started for the band. It {{was not easy to}} find a proper follow-up for [...] "Hello Josephine". Although the ballad [...] "Ann Louise" [...] sold well, it could not compete with the success of [...] "Hello Josephine". In addition, there were problems with the authorities. At that time there was no open European market and work permits for Englishmen were rather limited in the Netherlands. The Scorpions were urged to return to Manchester, where hardly anybody knew them because CNR did not release records in the UK. Peter Lewis and <b>Ian</b> <b>Lucas</b> decided to return and recruited guitarist Graham Lee for lead guitar and backing vocals, Dave Vernon (bass) and Roy Smithson (organ).The first single in their new line-up, [...] "Greensleeves" [...] entered the charts.There was a highlight for the band in October 1965; the Scorpions were one of the big names on the yearly TV-event called the Grand Gala du Disque. They performed two songs. Other artists on the show were The Everly Brothers, Dave Berry and The Supremes.Shortly after that, drummer <b>Ian</b> <b>Lucas</b> left the band and was replaced by Tom Unthank. The band found it difficult to promote themselves due to the difficulty in obtaining work permits and so gradually, the band's popularity waned. At the end of 1967, they returned to England.
