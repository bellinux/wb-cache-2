5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
