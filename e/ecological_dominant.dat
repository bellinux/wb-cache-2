[...] "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the <b>ecological</b> <b>dominant</b> in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three." [...] The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.|$|E
40|$|Insects {{associated}} with the floodwater mosquito Ochlerotatus albifasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) were studied from intermittent puddles in temperate Argentina {{in an attempt to}} detect the main predators. Forty-one taxa occurred in the puddles from spring to fall. Coleoptera and Diptera were dominant and diverse. Ephemeroptera and Odonata were scarce in numbers and species, and Heteroptera occurred in low numbers of species and high abundance of individuals. The main predators of immature O. albifasciatus were detected on the basis of relative abundance (ISA index), <b>ecological</b> <b>dominant</b> groups, and species association (‘‘I’’ index). Liodessus sp. and Rhantus signatus signatus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) were the most abundant predators in the puddles and Liodessus sp., Lancetes marginatus (Dytiscidae) and Psorophora ciliata (Culicidae) were the most frequent. Liodessus sp. and O. albifasciatus were the best associated species in all seasons. Liodessus sp. was indistinctly {{associated with}} all larval instars and pupae, while R. signatus signatus, L. marginatus and Psorophora ciliata were more {{associated with the}} pupal stage of the mosquito. Desmopachria concolor (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), Tropisternus lateralis limbatus and Tropisternus setiger (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) were other potential predators inhabiting the puddles, but their relevance was minor...|$|E
40|$|Big {{bluestem}} (Andropogon gerardii) is an ecologically dominant {{grass with}} wide distribution across the environmental gradient of U. S. Midwest grasslands. This system offers an ideal natural laboratory to study population divergence and adaptation in spatially varying climates. Objectives were to: (i) characterize neutral genetic diversity and structure within and among three regional ecotypes derived from 11 prairies across the U. S. Midwest environmental gradient, (ii) {{distinguish between the}} relative roles of isolation by distance (IBD) vs. isolation by environment (IBE) on ecotype divergence, (iii) identify outlier loci under selection and (iv) assess the association between outlier loci and climate. Using two primer sets, we genotyped 378 plants at 384 polymorphic AFLP loci across regional ecotypes from central and eastern Kansas and Illinois. Neighbour-joining tree and PCoA revealed strong genetic differentiation between Kansas and Illinois ecotypes, which was better explained by IBE than IBD. We found high genetic variability within prairies (80 %) and even fragmented Illinois prairies, surprisingly, contained high within-prairie genetic diversity (92 %). Using BAYENV 2, 14 topranked outlier loci among ecotypes were associated with temperature and precipitation variables. Six of seven BAYESCAN FST outliers were in common with BAYENV 2 outliers. High genetic diversity may enable big bluestem populations to better withstand changing climates; however, population divergence supports the use of local ecotypes in grassland restoration. Knowledge of genetic variation in this <b>ecological</b> <b>dominant</b> and other grassland species will be critical to understanding grassland response and restoration challenges {{in the face of}} a changing climate...|$|E

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{evidence}} suggest that natural ecosystems are organized for high productivity and diversity: (i) changes not previously experienced by a natural ecosystem, such as novel human disturbances, tend to diminish its productivity and/or diversity, just as 'random' {{changes in a}} machine designed for a function usually impair its execution of that function; (ii) humans strive to recreate properties of natural ecosystems to enhance productivity of artificial ones, as farmers try to recreate properties of natural soils in their fields; and (iii) productivity and diversity have increased during the Earth's history as a whole, and after every major biotic crisis. Natural selection results in ecosystems organized to maintain high productivity of organic matter and diversity of species, just as competition among individuals in Adam Smith's ideal economy favours high production of wealth and diversity of occupations. In nature, poorly exploited energy attracts more efficient users. This circumstance favours the opening of new ways of life and more efficient recycling of resources, and eliminates most productivity-reducing 'ecological monopolies'. <b>Ecological</b> <b>dominants</b> tend {{to be replaced by}} successors with higher metabolism, which respond to more stimuli and engage in more varied interactions. Finally, increasingly efficient predators and herbivores favour faster turnover of resources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Peltaspermales are a {{group of}} pteridosperms or "seed ferns, " plants with fern-Uke, {{compound}} leaves (fronds) that also bear seeds. Historically thought {{to be one of}} several groups of exclusively Mesozoic seed-ferns, the peltasperms have proven more recently to be widespread and abundant in the Permian tropics, appearing at least as early as latest Carboniferous. The group includes a number of genera, most of which occur in the southwestern United States, which is the focus of this report. The ancestral subgroup appears to be the callipterids, represented by the genera Autunia and Rhachiphyllum. Derived foliage taxa include the comioids (Comia and an undescribed genus), the supaioids (Supaia, Glenopteris, cf. Brongniartities, and perhaps several undescribed genera; this group is taxonomically "difficult"). Several genera of North American gigantopterids also most likely are assignable to the Peltaspermales (Gigantopteridium, Lonesomia, Evolsonia, Delnortea, and three genera equated with Chinese taxa on the basis of venation but that, in fact, may be distinct, Cathaysiopteris, Zeilleropteris, and Gigantonoclea, and at least one new genus certainly occurring in China where it was described as "Gigantopteridium " marginervum). All of these foliage forms are associated with the reproductive organs Autunia (= Sandrewia) or Peltaspermum. The abundance and diversity of this group in southwestern North America indicates an extensive and early radiation of the peltasperms, during which they became <b>ecological</b> <b>dominants</b> in the Permian lowland tropics. 6...|$|R

The DEB theoryhas been successfully applied to several bivalve species to compare bioenergetic and physiological strategies for the utili- zation of energy. In particular, mussels within the Mytilus edulis complex (M. edulis,M. galloprovincialis, and M. trossulus) have been the focus of many studies due to their economic and ecological importance, and their worldwide distribution. However, DEB parameter values have never been estimated for Mytilus californianus,a species that is an <b>ecological</b> <b>dominant</b> on rocky intertidal shores on the west coast of North America and which likely varies considerably from mussels in the M. edulis complex in its physiology. We estimated a set of DEB parameters for M. californianus using the covariation method estimation procedure and compared these to parameter values from other bivalve species. Model parameters were used to compare sensitivity to environ- mental variability among species, as a first examination of how strategies for physiologically contending with environmental change by M. californianus may differ from those of other bivalves. Results suggest that based on the parameter set obtained, M. californianus has favorable energetic strategies enabling it to contend with a range of environmental conditions. For instance, the allocation fraction of reserve to soma (κ) is among the highest of any bivalves, which is consistent with the observation that this species can survive over a wide range of environmental conditions, including prolonged periods of starvatio...|$|E

Se realizaron 12 muestreos mensuales en 24 sitios a partir de mayo 2009 hasta abril 2010. Se realizaron 288 arrastres, se capturó un total de 21 795 organismos con un peso total de 279. 5 kg. Se identificaron 46 especies de peces (34 géneros y 23 familias). Los intervalos de variación espacial de la abundancia fueron: 0. 018 - 0. 094 ind. /m²; 0. 249 - 1. 072 g/m² y 9. 75 - 19. 32 g/ind. Los índices de diversidad fueron: Hn= 1. 46 - 2. 15 bits/ind., J= 0. 45 - 0. 71 y D= 2. 08 - 3. 92. La variación temporal de la abundancia y diversidad fue de 0. 026 - 0. 066 ind. /m²; 0. 342 - 0. 764 g/m² y 6. 49 - 22. 98 g/ind. Hn= 1. 76 - 2. 08; J= 0. 52 - 0. 64 y D= 3. 07 - 4. 18. Se identificaron 11 especies dominantes, que representan el 94. 39 % en número de individuos y 89. 66 % en peso de la captura total. El análisis cluster permite identificar cuatro grupos de especies que se asocian a las distintas condiciones de hábitat de la reserva. El análisis de correspondencia canónica destaca la asociación de H. plumierii con la salinidad y los sólidos disueltos.

It has the biggest and better conserved seagrass beds, and it represents an important habitat for food, protection and breeding of aquatic organisms, and a temporal refuge for migratory species. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the ichthyofauna diversity in the littoral coastal area of the RBLP, to identify the <b>ecological</b> <b>dominant</b> species, and to analyze the abundance of the fish community and its temporal and spatial changes, and their relationship with some environmental variables. Monthly fish samples were obtained with the aid of trawl nets, from 24 samplings sites distributed along the reserve, between May 2009 and April 2010. The trawl net was operated 288 times and 21 795 individuals with 279. 5 kg of weight were collected. A total of 46 fish species grouped in 34 genera and 23 families were identified. In a spatial scale, the abundance showed the next ranges: 0. 018 - 0. 094 ind. /m²; 0. 249 - 1. 072 g/m² and 9. 75 - 19. 32 g/ind.; the diversity indexes obtained were: Hn= 1. 46 - 2. 15, J= 0. 45 - 0. 71 and D= 2. 08 - 3. 92. In a temporal scale, the abundance and diversity ranged between: 0. 026 - 0. 066 ind. /m 2; 0. 342 - 0. 764 g/m² and 6. 49 - 22. 98 g/ind.; Hn= 1. 76 - 2. 08; J&# 8217;= 0. 52 - 0. 64 and D= 3. 07 - 4. 18. Eleven dominant species were identified with a representation of the 94. 39 % in number of individuals, and 89. 66 % in weight of the total catch. From the total, eight species had economic or commercial importance, especially Lagodon rhomboides and Haemulon plumierii. The cluster analyses identified four fish associations; these results are discussed in order to identify relationships between habitat-species. Finally, the canonical correspondence analysis evidenced an association between H. plumierii with salinity and dissolved solids.

40|$|Three quadrats, {{one hundred}} meters to the side, were {{located at the}} plains-foothill border region {{southwest}} of Boulder, Colorado, near Bluebell Canyon. One quadrat was in a wooded area, another in a meadow, and the third in an ecotone, half-meadow, half-wooded area. Ants were intensively collected in these quadrats for three summers, from 1965 through 1967. The summer of 1968 was utilized for soil moisture and temperature determinations, {{as well as for}} actual counts of ant colonies. A total of 25 species and subspecies was discovered. Of these 25 species, nine were species found in two quadrats, which provide evidence of a distinct boundary between the lower edge of the foothill zone and the plains, since eight of these nine were found in the ponderosa pine forest and the ecotone, but did not penetrate the meadow. The other species was found in the meadow and ecotone, but did not penetrate the ponderosa pine forest. There were two additional species in the meadow and five in the forest which did not penetrate the ecotone. The Lincoln Index was utilized in this study to determine its efficacy in estimation of the size of selected ant colonies. It was found to be inaccurate, since use of this index results in great underestimation of ant colony size. Individual nest stability and nest number constancy were also examined. The majority of the 25 species and subspecies are quite unstable in their nesting habits, and nest number was somewhat inconstant. Total counts of ant nests were made, and these, plus the number of nests of the various species, made it possible to determine the <b>ecological</b> <b>dominants</b> in each quadrat for each year. It was also found that there were more species of ants in this study in the wooded quadrat, which had a slope facing north by northwest, than in the ecotone or in the meadow.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} and pace of terrestrial plant extinction and macroecological change {{associated with the}} Triassic/Jurassic (Tr/J) mass extinction boundary have not been quantified using paleoecological data. However, tracking the diversity and ecology of primary producers provides an ideal surrogate with which to explore patterns of ecosystem stability, collapse, and recovery and to explicitly test for gradual versus catastrophic causal mechanisms of extinction. We present {{an analysis of the}} vegetation dynamics in the Jameson Land Basin, East Greenland, spanning the Tr/J extinction event, from a census collected paleoecological data set of 4303 fossil leaf specimens, in an attempt to better constrain our understanding of the causes and consequences of the fourth greatest extinction event in earth history. Our analyses reveal (1) regional turnover of <b>ecological</b> <b>dominants</b> between Triassic and Jurassic plant communities, (2) marked structural changes in the vegetation as reflected by potential loss of a mid-canopy habit, and (3) decline in generic-level richness and evenness and change in ecological composition prior to the Tr/J boundary; all of these findings argue against a single catastrophic causal mechanism, such as a meteorite impact for Tr/J extinctions. We identify various key ecological and biological traits that increased extinction risk at the Tr/J boundary and corroborate predictions of meta-population theory or plant ecophysiological models. These include ecological rarity, complex reproductive biology, and large leaf size. Recovery in terms of generic-level richness was quite rapid following Tr/ J extinctions; however, species-level turnover in earliest Jurassic plant communities remained an order of magnitude higher than observed for the Triassic. We hypothesize, on the basis of evidence for geographically extensive macrofossil and palynological turnover across the entire Jameson Land Basin, that the nature and magnitude of paleoecological changes recorded in this study reflect wider vegetation change across the whole region. How exactly these changes in dominance patterns of plant primary production affected the entire ecosystem remains an important avenue of future research. © 2007 The Paleontological Society.

Here we use a deep-time case study to evaluate the impact of a well-constrained CO 2 -induced global warming event on the <b>ecological</b> functioning of <b>dominant</b> plant communities. We use leaf mass per area (LMA), a widely used trait in modern plant ecology, to infer the palaeoecological strategy of fossil plant taxa. We show that palaeo-LMA can be inferred from fossil leaf cuticles based on a tight relationship between LMA and cuticle thickness observed among extant gymnosperms. Application of this new palaeo-LMA proxy to fossil gymnosperms from East Greenland reveals significant shifts in the <b>dominant</b> <b>ecological</b> strategies of vegetation found across the Triassic–Jurassic transition. Late Triassic forests, dominated by low-LMA taxa with inferred high transpiration rates and short leaf lifespans, were replaced in the Early Jurassic by forests dominated by high-LMA taxa that were likely to have slower metabolic rates. We suggest that extreme CO 2 -induced global warming selected for taxa with high LMA associated with a stress-tolerant strategy and that adaptive plasticity in leaf functional traits such as LMA contributed to post-warming ecological success...|$|R

The volume of literature that provides indirect evidence in favour of competition (observational approach) greatly exceeds the number of studies that provide direct evidence (experimental approach). In part for this reason the importance of competition in community ecology is questioned by some ecologists. The strongest evidence for competition is derived from controlled field experiments which manipulate the abundancies of putative competitor species. It is stressed that {{to be able to}} study competition in the field and to test its theories, interaction coefficients have to be measured.

While development discourse is touting the role of smallholder agriculture in supporting development processes and multifunctional agriculture to meet sustainability objectives, the different framings of problems and solutions between the World Development Report 2008 (World Bank 2008) and the International Assessment of Agriculture Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD 2008) are exposing contradictions and tensions within dominant development discourse. This thesis explores the ways in which the reframing of agriculture as a response to food, energy, and climate crises is being constituted within and external to development discourses, and the potentials for an alternative development. I argue that we are, indeed, in a moment of transition in which the epistemic tensions within development discourse are providing space for a radical shift in how agriculture is conceptualized (and practiced) vis-a-vis food, energy, and climate crises, providing an opportunity for social movements advocating food and fuel sovereignty to flourish within the interstices of the competing visions of agriculture in development discourse. In conclusion, I explore how the discursive and political interventions of the food sovereignty movement, in a moment of declining confidence in agro-industrial food and energy systems, is reformulating the original agrarian question and establishing food sovereignty as the basis for development alternatives. In this transitional moment agrarian social movements are reclaiming the political subjectivity of peasant agriculture grounded on the social and ecological benefits of peasant agrecological practices and knowledges...|$|R
40|$|Scavenging is an {{important}} but poorly understood <b>ecological</b> process. <b>Dominant</b> scavengers can impose a selection pressure that alters the predator’s fitness, morphology, behavior, and ecology. Interactions between ursids, likely the most important dominant scavengers in the Holarctic region, and solitar felids, which are characterized by long feeding times, provide a good opportunity for studying the effects of kleptoparasitism by dominant scavengers. We analyzed the effects of scavenging by brown bears Ursus arctos on Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and predator’s response to kleptoparasitism in a European temperate forest ecosystem. Bears found 32 % of lynx prey remains and 15 % of all biomass of large prey killed by lynx was lost to bears. In response, lynx increased their kill rate by 23 % but were able to compensate for only 59 % of the losses. The frequency of bear scavenging was strongly dependent on bear activity patterns and was highest during the lynx pregnancy and lactation period, when {{up to half of}} lynx kills were usurped by bears. We suggest that ursid scavenging, by promoting the hunting of smaller prey, may have played {{an important}} role in the evolution of the Lynx genus as well as other predators in the Holarctic. Our study indicates that prey loss to dominant scavengers is a widespread phenomenon among felids worldwide, including forest habitats. We highlight several implications of scavenging that could considerably improve our understanding of the ecology of vertebrate communities and the evolution of predators as well as benefit the future management and conservation of endangered predators...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 56 species of land snails and 9 {{freshwater}} species were recorded at 22 alluvial forest sites (14 alder sites, 8 beech or hornbeam sites) in the Small Carpathian Mts. (SW Slovakia) during the researches in 2008 – 2009. Fifty two species {{were recorded in}} alder carrs and 32 species in adjacent forests. Woodland species sensu stricto (17 species, 32. 7 %) and euryecious species (10 species, 19. 2 %) predominated in alder forests. <b>Dominant</b> <b>ecological</b> groups in beech and hornbeam forests were woodland species sensu stricto (14 species, 43. 8 %) and woodland eurytopic species (6 species, 18. 8 %). There were 28 species (433 individuals) at the highest species richness site (Lozorno, alder carr). Generally, the species richness was higher in alder forests in comparison to beech or hornbeam forests. As expected, there was a higher number of species at the carbonate sites than non-carbonate sites. The following species were recorded in the Small Carpathian Mts. for the first time: Deroceras rodnae s. lat. Grossu et Lupu, 1965, Deroceras turcicum (Simroth, 1894) and freshwater snail Gyraulus rossmaessleri (Auerswald, 1852) ...|$|R

How {{the moral}} basis of {{sustainable}} development shifted This article traces the shift in the moral arguments in the sustainable development discourse, which occurred between 1972 and 2002. In the early 1970 s <b>ecological</b> considerations were <b>dominant</b> and the zero-growth option had strong support. By {{the end of the}} 1980 s the influential report of the Brundtland Commission recommended that the balance between the ecological, economic and social aspects {{of sustainable development}} ought to be maintained. From the 1990 s there was a shift to poverty alleviation as the main focus of the sustainable development discourse. Representatives of the developing countries started making valuable contributions to the evolution of the concept of sustainable development and succeeded in merging the sustainable development discourse into the wider North-South debates. A decrease in wealth rather than a decrease in poverty would be the correct approach to the achievement of sustainable development. However, such a radical change of course would only be possible once considerable progress has been made towards redressing the imbalances in the current global dispensation...|$|R
40|$|For decades, ecologists {{have studied}} trophic {{interaction}} in aquatic systems, {{and described the}} food web structure of <b>dominant</b> <b>ecological</b> groups based on gut content analyses. The conception of these interactions may, however, be biased {{by the lack of}} couplings to the microbial food web and direct errors in diet analyses (e. g. differences in digestion rate between food types). In this thesis, I examined the planktonic food web by analyzing the trophic structure (i. e. trophic levels) with an alternative technique, the abundances and fractionation of stable isotope. I used natural abundances of stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta 15 N) and carbon (delta 13 C) to describe the food web structure of mesozooplankton communities in the Central Baltic Sea (Bornholm Basin, Gdansk deep and Gotland Basin) and Southern North Sea (German Bight). I focused on assessing spatial and seasonal isotopic variation with respect to trophic levels of the dominant mesozooplankton species in both marine systems. The stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon provide powerful tools for assessing trophic levels of and carbon flow to consumers in the food web...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} {{patterns of}} access to water and other areas of public service delivery in South Africa have been markedly skewed. Despite the reversal of the regime {{and the fact that}} South Africa is a middle-income country, there are a significant {{number of people who are}} water- poor and poor in governance and institutional capacity to manage water. The recurring themes in integrated water resource management, reticulation pipes, weirs and pumps, stream flow regulations, and <b>ecological</b> requirements are <b>dominant</b> in water sector discourse and are alienating for those who do not master the language. There are constraints determined by racial, economic, or social structures that retain and reproduce dominant power relations. The paper considers the relationship between knowledge, agency, and shame and posits that unequal relations of power and knowledge restrict agency, jeopardize the building of trust, and may perpetuate feelings of shame. The role of the state in opening up water policy networks and redressing issues of knowledge, power, and agency is critical. shame; trust; water; participation; social networks...|$|R
30|$|Increasing {{evidence}} has emerged supporting a tight link between gut bacterial community and shrimp health. However, the {{knowledge about the}} variation of gut bacterial community, especially with different disease onset time, remains elusive. Here, healthy and diseased shrimps were collected at 3 disease-outbreak times (day 70, 80 and 85) to investigate the variation of gut bacterial community and its underlying ecological process with 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The gut bacterial community of diseased shrimp was distinct from the healthy one and temporally less stable, characterized by decreased alpha-diversity and dispersive structure. And its <b>dominant</b> <b>ecological</b> process experienced a transition with disease onset time, although deterministic process mainly governed the healthy gut bacterial assembly. In addition, the core microbiota of healthy shrimp gut harbored more diverse bacterial taxa with more cooperative interactions, while the diseased core microbiota showed opposite pattern with significantly higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens as well. These findings indicate that shrimp heath is highly relevant to the homeostasis of its gut bacterial community. Preservation and restoration of the bacterial community equilibrium could represent an effective strategy for shrimp disease prevention.|$|R

For absorptive roots, which are mainly responsible for resource acquisition, {{we hypothesized that}} root economic strategies differ with increasing root diameter. To test this hypothesis, we used seven plant species (a fern, a conifer, and five angiosperms from south China) for which we separated absorptive roots into two categories: thin roots (thickness of root cortex plus epidermis <  247  µm) and thick roots. For each category, we analyzed a range of root traits related to resource acquisition and conservation, including root tissue density, different carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) fractions (i. e., extractive, acid-soluble, and acid-insoluble fractions) as well as root anatomical traits. The results showed significant relationships among root traits indicating an acquisition-conservation tradeoff for thin absorptive roots while no such trait relationships were found for thick absorptive roots. Similar results were found when reanalyzing data of a previous study including 96 plant species. The contrasting economic strategies between thin and thick absorptive roots, as revealed here, may provide {{a new perspective on}} our understanding of the root economics spectrum...|$|R
