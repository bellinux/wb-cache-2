25|$|On 25 June 1650, Wren entered Wadham College, Oxford, {{where he}} studied Latin and the works of Aristotle. It is anachronistic to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{received}} scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with John Wilkins, the Warden of Wadham. The Wilkins circle was a group whose activities {{led to the formation}} of the Royal Society, comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.|$|E
25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.|$|E
500|$|MacMurray briefly {{served as}} Assistant Secretary of State from 1924 to 1925. In 1925, he was {{appointed}} Minister to China under President Calvin Coolidge, who described him as [...] "our top China expert". He assumed the post in July 1925. MacMurray was well regarded within the diplomatic community in Peking; Sir Ronald Macleay with the British delegation described him as friendly and agreeable, and relatively unburdened by the preconceived ideas and sentimentality towards China that afflicted several of his predecessors. Macleay noted that MacMurray could express himself well and forcefully in diplomatic meetings, {{but that he was}} [...] "rather academic", and may have lacked confidence in himself. [...] "I <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> allows himself very little freedom of action and refers to Washington on every possible occasion," [...] wrote Macleay. [...] Another British diplomat, Sir Miles W. Lampson, recorded MacMurray's complaints that Washington allowed him little initiative, and seldom adopted his proposals.|$|E

500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were named}} 2012 inductees for the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. In an {{interview}} that same day, Anthony Kiedis talked about Frusciante and if he would attend the ceremony. Kiedis stated, [...] "It would be a guess on my behalf {{on whether or not}} he’ll come. I can’t <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind of thing. I haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us so many great gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level." [...] Frusciante eventually declined to be present for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.|$|E
2500|$|Voigt never tested {{positive}} to performance-enhancing drugs in his career. He alleged {{that he never}} doped and was always against the practice. At the end of October 2012, he wrote a blog entry to address the turmoil caused by the Lance Armstrong-USADA doping affair, and related in it his personal experiences, stating that he [...] "just never doped". Voigt {{argued that it was}} impossible for him to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be regarded as a doper and cheater by his children if he took performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
2500|$|H.L. Mencken, {{writing in}} the Smart Set {{described}} Cope as beset with three female suitors and [...] "somewhat heavily patronized" [...] by Randolph. Cope fails {{to benefit from the}} efforts of Mrs. Phillips and Randolph and [...] "even forgets to be grateful....It is simply beyond him to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needs help....A very fair piece of writing as novels go. A bit sly and pizzicato; even a bit distinguished. If you know the later novels of E.F. Benson, you know the tone of it." [...] Mencken noted how different the novel was from some of Fuller's earlier work, novels that [...] "launched realism in America." [...] In the author of Bertram Cope's Year he found [...] "a pleasant style, an adept technique, the manner of a gentleman." [...] It concluded: [...] "It is surely something to be an American novelist, and yet write like a gentleman." ...|$|E

2500|$|Angel Mendez' parents — Antonio Méndez Pomales, {{a native}} of Fajardo and Martina Rivera García from Naguabo — moved from Puerto Rico to New York City seeking a better life. [...] His father owned and {{attended}} a grocery store in the South Bronx while his mother cared for their eight children at home. When Mendez' mother became ill and the family's economic situation worsened, his father could not raise him and his siblings, therefore 2 were sent to foster homes and 6 {{were placed in the}} Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, an orphanage on Mount Loretto, Staten Island. There he received his primary and secondary education. Mendez {{was a member of the}} cadet corps along with his brothers and many of the [...] "Mount" [...] kids. At a young age, he became fascinated with military life and with his friends would often <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was on a [...] "patrol" [...] while camping at Stokes State Forest and Worthington State Forest.|$|E
2500|$|Cappon {{was known}} for his {{conservatism}} as a coach. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, the uniforms never changed, having small sewn-on numbers and no player names. [...] He considered a fast break as a lack of discipline and would not allow his players to shoot before five or ten passes had been completed. [...] In 1995, former Princeton player Selden Edwards wrote an article on Cappon's influence at Princeton. [...] Edwards, a junior varsity player in the Cappon era, wrote that [...] "Cappy was Princeton basketball to anyone even vaguely familiar with the teams of that era." [...] Edwards described Cappon's physical appearance this way: [...] "In 1959, the fall I arrived at Princeton, Cappy was in peak form, a character who knew he was a character. He was in his early sixties, and his body {{looked as if it had}} been sculpted in ice cream and left in the sun. He was bald, the skin on his face drooped, he had deep shadows under his eyes. His voice was gravelly, and he enunciated as if he had wads of Kleenex in his mouth. He always said exactly what he meant, and his language was delightfully salty. Legend had it that he had been a great athlete at Michigan, but by the 1960s no one could <b>imagine</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> was grumpily personable and totally without pretension." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... The painting, by George C. Barker & Son, and the decorating by Hayman, of this city, {{have been}} a source of {{enormous}} outlay, but the result is an equivalent to the cost, for the passenger, on arriving at the Quarter Deck and proceeding to the Grand Saloon, must certainly <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is in the halls of enchantment, only read of in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. In each panel of the quarter-deck is painted a piece of statuary, while every nook and corner is covered with paint of the most delicate hue and finished off with an abundance of gilt. The appearance of the main saloon is really charming. Here, there, and everywhere, are flowers and birds, the one, in some cases, just appearing to blossom and the other, apparently, just waiting to spring from a branch, whereon it is perched, so naturally is everything done. In the main saloon, ladies' saloon, and social hall, may be seen very delightful specimens of good taste in the selection of the new velvet carpets, rugs, mats, silk curtains, lace curtains, etc., all of which are of the very costliest kind. The whole of the furniture in the grand saloon and ladies' saloon is covered in plum colored velvet, while that of the social hall is done in velvet and rep, each having a very beautiful effect on the surroundings ...|$|E

60|$|When {{the tale}} was finished, Prescott sat a while, smoking thoughtfully. <b>He</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had struck Jernyngham's trail; all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had heard was {{characteristic}} of the man.|$|R

2500|$|The story {{follows the}} adventures of a noble (hidalgo) named Alonso Quixano who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his sanity and decides to set out to revive chivalry, undo wrongs, and bring justice to the world, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. He {{recruits}} a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical orations on antiquated knighthood. Don Quixote, {{in the first part}} of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is living out a knightly story. Throughout the novel, Cervantes uses such literary techniques as realism, metatheatre, and intertextuality. The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers (1844), Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897), as well as the word [...] "quixotic" [...] and the epithet [...] "Lothario"; the latter refers to a character in [...] "El curioso impertinente" [...] ("The Impertinently Curious Man"), an intercalated story that appears in Part One, chapters 33–35. Arthur Schopenhauer cited Don Quixote as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with Tristram Shandy, La Nouvelle Héloïse, and Wilhelm Meister.|$|E

Labu and Labi eventually start a gunfight in the imaginary bar, and their gun sound effects wake their boss up for the third time. Haji Bakhil yells at them to go to sleep, and punishes them for their behaviour by giving them chores to do first thing in the morning.|$|R
