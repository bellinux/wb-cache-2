5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-8 {{was named}} {{the way it was}} because it is home to the eighth {{planetary}} system confirmed {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA-directed program tasked with searching a region of the sky for terrestrial planets that transit, or cross in front of (and thereby, for a while, make dimmer) the stars that they orbit with respect to Earth. The planet <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> around Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements. Kepler-8b's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., alongside planets <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, and Kepler-7.|$|E

40|$|We give a {{generalization}} {{to higher}} dimensions of Silverman's result on finiteness of integer points <b>in</b> <b>orbits.</b> Assuming Vojta's conjecture, we prove a sufficient condition for morphisms on P^N so that (S,D) -integral points <b>in</b> each <b>orbit</b> are Zariski-non-dense. This condition is geometric, and for dimension 1 it corresponds precisely to Silverman's {{hypothesis that the}} second iterate of the map is not a polynomial. In fact, we will prove a more precise formulation comparing local heights outside S to the global height. For hyperplanes, this amounts to comparing logarithmic sizes of the coordinates, generalizing Silverman's precise version in dimension 1. We also discuss a variant where we can conclude that integral points <b>in</b> <b>orbits</b> are finite, rather than just Zariski-non-dense. Further, we show unconditional results and examples, using Schmidt's subspace theorem and known cases of Lang [...] Vojta conjecture. We end with some extensions {{to the case of}} rational maps and to the case when the arithmetic of the orbit under one map is controlled by the geometric properties of another. We include many explicit examples to illustrate different behaviors of integral points <b>in</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>in</b> higher dimensions.

40|$|To compare color Doppler imaging (CDI) {{parameters}} of the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) in patients with Graves` orbitopathy (GO) and in normal controls. Forty-three GO patients and 14 normal controls underwent CDI of the SOV. Patients had either fibrotic (lipogenic or myogenic) or congestive orbitopathy. The findings for each group were compared. Fifty-eight orbits with fibrotic orbitopathy, 28 with congestive orbitopathy, and 28 from controls, were studied. In the congestive group, SOV flow was detected in 13, undetectable in 11, and reversed in four orbits; in the fibrotic group, it was present in 41 and undetectable <b>in</b> 17 <b>orbits.</b> <b>In</b> normal controls, SOV flow was detected in 25 and undetectable <b>in</b> three <b>orbits.</b> The differences among the three groups were significant. There was also {{a significant difference between}} controls and the congestive GO orbits but not between the fibrotic group and the other two groups. Fibrotic myogenic orbitopathy patients displayed a significantly smaller SOV flow than patients with lipogenic orbitopathy. SOV was significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>orbits</b> with congestive GO or with myogenic fibrotic GO, but not <b>in</b> <b>orbits</b> with fibrotic lipogenic orbitopathy. SOV congestion may be a contributing pathogenic factor in both congestive and fibrotic myogenic Graves` orbitopathy...|$|R
