50|$|In February 1983, Mitsubishi {{launched}} {{a special edition}} Sigma GL Satellite. Priced $1,000 below the GL luxury level, the Satellite was built in sedan and wagon versions, with air conditioning, five-speed manual or automatic transmission all as options. However, two-tone paintwork, a laminated windscreen, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering column, <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> and a heated rear window were fitted as standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|In March 1970, CitroÃ«n {{introduced}} rain-sensitive <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> {{on their}} SM model. When the intermittent function was selected, the wiper would make one swipe. If the windscreen was relatively dry, the wiper motor drew high current, which set the control circuit timer {{to delay the}} next wipe longest. If the motor drew little current, it indicated that the glass was wet, setting the timer to minimize the delay.|$|R
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|R
25|$|Both four-door {{sedan and}} five-door station wagon {{variants}} were available as before, although trim levels {{were limited to}} SLX and GS. The SLX was aimed at fleet markets, fitted with power steering, a radio cassette player, a remote boot and fuel cap release, and electric side-view mirrors. The sedan-only SLX V6 added four-wheel disc brakes over the 2.2 model's front-disc, rear-drum layout, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) on the V6 available as an option. Wagons without ABS fitted made do with a load-sensing valve mechanism to control rear brake lock-up. The higher GS trim built on the SLX level, adding 60/40 split-fold rear seats, variable <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> a four-speaker stereo, tachometer, central locking and a more luxurious interior upholstery style.|$|R
5000|$|Mazda began {{producing}} the Festiva as the [...] "Mazda 121" [...] for Australia and Europe in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan. The 121 ended production in 1990, and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991. From October 1991, Ford Australia began importing {{the car as}} the [...] "Ford Festiva" [...] from Kia's South Korean production facility. Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only. From January 1993, a Festiva three-door, badged [...] "Festiva Trio" [...] was launched in Australia. Both versions were powered by the overhead camshaft carbureted 1.3-liter B3 engine with the five-speed manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional for the five-door. Standard equipment in Australia included an AM/FM radio, tachometer, <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> remote releases for the rear door and fuel tank filler door, with air-conditioning available as an option. Ford discontinued the Festiva in the Australian market in March 1994.|$|R

Unlike other markets, federalized quad {{headlamps}} were fitted for the 1983 and 1984 model years. Buyers could specify sedan or liftback bodies with a five-speed manual transmission or extra-cost four-speed automatic paired to the 2.0-liter gasoline 2S-ELC motor rated at [...] Toyota then offered DX (deluxe) and LE (luxury edition) trim levels, the latter adding standard {{features such as}} body-colored bumpers, tachometer, tilt steering wheel, upgraded stereo, electric mirrors and variable <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers.</b> Updates for the 1984 model year included an overdrive lockout switch for the automatic transmission. Also optional was the manual-only 1.8-liter 1C-TLC turbo diesel for the DX with , a special gauge cluster, and quieter exhaust system. Changes for 1985 involved the facelift (now with one-piece headlamps), {{the transfer of the}} optional cruise control's switchgear from the dashboard to the wiper stalk, and wider LE-type tires for the DX trim (from [...] ). 1985 cars received gas-charged front shock absorbers and stiffer rear springs, an anti-theft alarm system was now optional on both grades, automatic became an option for the diesel, the DX added a standard tilt steering wheel, and the LE models offered an optional electronic instrument cluster. For 1986, a replacement diesel engine, the automatic-only 2.0-liter 2C-TLC arrived for the DX and LE (...) , and the gasoline model increased power by around [...] Other revisions for this model year were a revised powered brake system and new cloth seat and door trim for LEs.|$|R

40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter and comfort, automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> {{noise and vibration}} become more noticeable. As {{a result of the}} market information survey, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a lowfrequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. Typically, noise and vibration study of the automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> has been carried out by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. This report describes evaluation of noise and vibration that generated by an automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> using numerical approach via finite element method. In doing so, two types of test are conducted i. e. modal testing for individual wiper components and noise and vibration test to identify noise category for a selected passenger car <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> Later, a 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> assembly is developed. This FE model is then validated at the component level using modal analysis {{in order to ensure that}} dynamic characteristics of the FE model close to a real <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In order to evaluate characteristics of noise and vibration of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper,</b> complex eigenvalue analysis that made available in ABAQUS is employed. It is found that the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> generates noise at frequency around 11 Hz which is identified as chatter and the predicted frequency is fairly close with measured frequency obtained in the experiment. This chatter noise is dominated by bending mode of the wiper blade. Having found the characteristics of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> noise, several structural modifications are proposed to the rubber blade and simulated once again. There are three modifications that capable of preventing noise and vibration in the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> This finding could help car makers to design quiet and effective <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> and in turn to produce quieter and comfort {{passenger cars}}...|$|R
2500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} {{the second generation}} Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria {{as a replacement for}} the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totalling [...] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor, but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, centre console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, <b>intermittent</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carburetored engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter [...] "T". With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an [...] "average" [...] (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|R

50|$|In April 1908, {{he drove}} down to Crystal Palace Park in a 1904 Darracq-Charron {{motorcar}} to see Newcastle United play against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. It was such a novelty to see a car in those days that it was put into a car showroom window while he was there, {{because so many people}} wanted to see it. On the way back from the cup final, snow kept getting on the windscreen and Gladstone had to keep {{getting out of the car}} to clear it. This experience led to his invention of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In April 1911, Gladstone patented the design of a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> with Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool. Gladstone's version of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> was never manufactured, however. His original prototype can be seen in Newcastle's Discovery Museum.|$|R
