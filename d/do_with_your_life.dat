5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?,</b> bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E
500|$|After working {{together}} as Electrafixion, McCulloch, Sergeant and Pattinson regrouped in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics {{and the band}} made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant continue to record as Echo & the Bunnymen, releasing What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009), and Meteorites (2014).|$|E
500|$|What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> was {{released}} on 16 April 1999 through London Records following {{the release of the}} first single from the album, [...] "Rust", the previous month. One further single, [...] "Get in the Car", followed the album's release. The album received mixed reviews from the music press, being described as both flawless and having no appeal. The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen; the album peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

5000|$|Polygons Owen S. Good said [...] "That {{brooding}} chiptune {{will have}} you questioning what you've really <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> too." [...] The Mary Sues Jessica Lachenal described the music as [...] "slow, plodding, aimless." [...] Dangerous Mindss Martin Schneider reviewed [...] "The slow, tinny music is a perfect complement" [...] to the game.|$|R
6000|$|Hallward {{turned again}} to the portrait, and gazed at it. [...] "My God! if it is true," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "and {{this is what you}} have <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be!" [...] He held the light up {{again to the}} canvas, and {{examined}} it. The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed, and as he had left it. It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.|$|R
500|$|Released in March 1999, [...] "Rust" [...] was {{the first}} single to come from What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?.</b> The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart, and NME {{magazine}} named it their Single of the Week. The album was released the following month on 16 April and, having failed {{to appeal to the}} public as much as the band's previous albums, peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "Get in the Car", one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin' Criminals, was later released as a single.|$|E
500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time in my whole life".|$|E

50|$|Tracing Back Roots is {{the third}} studio album by American metalcore band We Came as Romans. It was {{released}} on July 23, 2013 through Equal Vision Records. The album is noted for the band's shift from their signature metalcore sound to a more melodic, clean vocal driven sound, while still maintaining metalcore elements throughout. The album has been received with favorable reviews which praise the band's “go out and <b>do</b> something <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> purpose” message.|$|R
5000|$|Singer {{attempts}} {{to show how}} the key for a satisfactory life resides on its purpose and how crucial for that purpose a commitment to an ethical life is. This connects with the argument that the pursuit of self-interest is self-defeating. He argues that altruism can be genuine - not just enlightened self-interest, and offers examples of people who sacrificed their lives to save people from Nazis to make this point. Singer comments on the effect of having the widest perspective possible on our ethical decisions; on how our rational capability sometimes leads us to change our goal; and on the paradoxical opportunity that the existence of so many ills on the world brings to us by way of showing plenty of clearly worthwhile goals. To live a good life, the book prescribes: [...] "You can rethink your goals and question what you are <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> That might mean quitting your job, selling your house, and going to work for a voluntary organization in India. More often, the commitment to a more ethical way of living will be the first step of a gradual but far-reaching evolution in your lifestyle and in your thinking about your place in the world. One thing is certain: you will find plenty of worthwhile things to do." ...|$|R
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Life?</b> used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Papoose {{would go}} the record calling his {{collaboration}} with [...] Erykah Badu, [...] "Cure" [...] {{to be his}} favorite song he has ever made, {{and said that he}} believes the song could [...] "change the world." [...] Erykah Badu would later claim that her vocals were from over 10 years ago, and were used with out permission. He described the title track as [...] "Uplifting", and said it is about following your dreams of what you want to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> He would describe his verses in the song, [...] "Pimpin' Won't Die" [...] as continuations of Tupac's [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] and Slick Rick's [...] "Children's Story". He described the Brenda's Got a Baby continuation as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the editors}} had a {{difficult}} time finding someone to write the series, with Tim Hunter proving a tricky character to get right: although he already appeared in a mini-series, the character's main function had been to bear witness to the past, present and future of magic in the DC universe and so did not offer a writer much detail to work with. [...] Karen Berger eventually settled on writer John Ney Rieber to continue Tim's story, who expanded Tim's character using his own memories of being fourteen, later saying, [...] "I don't believe that my soul is likely to be shuffled off to Purgatory after I die. [...] What would be the point? I've been fourteen already." [...] Rieber utilized his own teenage confusion and delight in writing Tim, while introducing his first girlfriend Molly as a counterpoint: Molly was the opposite of Tim in nearly every way, someone [...] "who'd already figured out the best thing you could possibly <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> was live it." ...|$|E

I'm a pool player, so they ask me, 'Haven't you <b>done</b> {{anything}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> except shoot pool? Haven't you ever worked?' I always tell them, 'Well, no, sir, I can't say that I've ever worked.' That always gets those rascals, 'cause they always ask, 'But how have you managed to live?' Oh, Lawdie, that's so silly. I tell them, 'Sir, I live like a tree [...] - [...] 3 percent from the soil and 97 percent from the air.' You know, that's true."

5000|$|Towards the episode’s end, Dawkins {{interviews}} actor Ricky Gervais {{who is a}} known atheist of his {{ideals of}} what {{the meaning of life}} is. Gervais states that for life to be meaningful one must love what they do, and center their life around meaningful relationships. That it doesn’t matter what exactly you do, but that you must <b>do</b> something <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> that you enjoy. To the question [...] "Why does an atheist bother {{to get up in the}} morning?", Dawkins argues that we each have to forge our own sense of meaning. For him, it is awe and wonder in scientific inquiry. Dawkins comes the conclusion that rather than to accept fate, meaning is found when we revolt against outrageous fortune. That the meaning of life is subjective, personal and that every individual person must set out to give our lives their own meaning.|$|R
5000|$|The ending {{reveals that}} Dwight is indeed Dwight Eisenhower {{on his way}} to West Point. If the player chooses the [...] "redemption" [...] option and forgives Bob for his actions, Silas reveals he had been {{deliberately}} exaggerating his tales to confirm his suspicions, with details Ben would know only if he were Roscoe. Silas then asks Dwight what he plans to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his life, and upon hearing that he's becoming a soldier, Silas says: [...] "Well, you do it right then, son. Don't tear down the world out of anger and spite like I did. You build it up. You <b>do</b> something decent <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life.</b> You hear me?" [...] to which Dwight says, [...] "Sir, yes sir" [...] and sets out to become the 34th president of the United States, and if the player chooses the [...] "revenge" [...] option, Silas duels with Bob, with Silas emerging as the victor. Everyone present at the bar becomes cautious to Silas, with Dwight being highly disturbed.|$|R

5000|$|Marguerite Annie Johnson {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer. Angelou's older brother, Bailey Jr., nicknamed Marguerite [...] "Maya", derived from [...] "My" [...] or [...] "Mya Sister". [...] When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents' [...] "calamitous marriage" [...] ended, and their father sent them to Stamps, Arkansas, alone by train, {{to live with their}} {{paternal}} grandmother, Annie Henderson. In [...] "an astonishing exception" [...] to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because [...] "she made wise and honest investments". And Angelou's life has certainly been a full one: from the hardscrabble Depression era South to pimp, prostitute, supper club chanteuse, performer in Porgy and Bess, coordinator for Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, journalist in Egypt and Ghana in the heady days of decolonization, comrade of Malcolm X, and eyewitness to the Watts riots. She knew King and Malcolm, Billie Holiday, and Abbey Lincoln.

50|$|Mann {{made his}} directorial debut with the TV movie The Jericho Mile. This was partly shot in Folsom Prison. Mann says that {{influenced}} {{the writing of}} Thief:It probably informed my ability to imagine what Frank’s life was like, where he was from, and what those 12 or 13 years in prison were like for him.. The idea of creating his character, was to have somebody who has been outside of society. An outsider who {{has been removed from}} the evolution of everything from technology to the music that people listen to, to how you talk to a girl, to what <b>do</b> you want <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> and how <b>do</b> you go about getting it. Everything that’s normal development, that we experience, he was excluded from, by design. In the design of the character and the engineering of the character, that was the idea.Mann made James Caan do research as a thief for his role.I always find it interesting, people who are aware, alert, conscious of what they do and are pretty good at it… People who want to put in 50-60 hours a week and go home and are not really conscious of life moving by, don’t really interest me very much... As part of the curriculum designed for an actor getting into character, I try to imagine what’s going to really help bring this actor more fully into character. And so I try to imagine what experiences are going to make more dimensional his intake of Frank, so that he is Frank spontaneously when I’m shooting. So one of the most obvious things is it’d be pretty good if Caan was as good at doing what Frank does as is Frank.Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronnie Caan served as the film's producers.|$|R

It's all very well to talk of a {{competence}} and a big house, and if you were to take me, perhaps we might keep the old place on and furnish it again, and my mother thinks {{a great deal about the}} title. For my part I think it's only a nuisance when a man has not got a fortune with it, and I don't suppose it will be any pleasure to you to be called Lady Ball. You'd have a life of fret and worry, and would not have half so much money to spend as you have now. I know all that, and have thought a deal about it before I could bring myself to speak to you. But, Margaret, you would have duties which would, I think, in themselves, have a pleasure for you. You would know what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> and would be of inestimable value to many people who would love you dearly. As for me, I never saw any other woman whom I could bring myself to offer as a mother to my children."

Then he paused, looked into her face for a moment, and after that, allowed his eyes again to fall on the ground.|$|E
