Design A descriptive cross sectional study Method Data was collected from 242 schoolboys aged 14 - 19 years from 2 Colombo district schools using a pre-tested and self-administered questionnaire. Results Among the 242 students surveyed, 3. 7 % had knowledge on sexual harassment and 31 % had knowledge on sexual abuse. 190 (78. 5 %) students had experienced sexual harassment and 53 (21. 9 %) had experienced sexual abuse. Commonest type of sexual abuse was oral sex with a prevalence of 9. 5 %. 10. 7 % students had been subjected to penetrative sex. Commonest reason for not reporting an incident of sexual harassment and sexual abuse was fear. Prevalence of sexual abuse was highest in the lower social class.
