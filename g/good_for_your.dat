500|$|Some {{criticism}} {{came from}} {{the feeling that the}} program was not educational. Others were concerned about the waste of food products like beans and eggs in physical challenges and obstacles. In 1989, television and film critic Jeffrey Lyons wrote that he [...] "wouldn't dream of proclaiming that Super Sloppy Double Dare is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> child. But what's wrong with watching an admittedly dumb—but hilarious—program just for fun?" ...|$|E

The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> fans to know you will have a home game." ...|$|E
500|$|Indiewire's Max O'Connell criticised the church's {{approach}} for being counterproductive. He predicted that [...] "their {{campaign against the}} film {{is going to be}} the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for, if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> image." [...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|E

In May 2015, Franz Beckenbauer criticised Götze for poor {{performances}} and lack of determination in playing. After a couple of weeks, Götze's teammate Arjen Robben backed him up for all the negative criticism. [...] "You need to make certain experiences as a player," [...] the Netherlands international said. [...] "How you cope with certain situations also makes you strong as a player.

2500|$|On 2 April 1903, Bernardo Reyes, {{governor}} of Nuevo León, violently crushed a political demonstration, {{an example of}} the increasingly authoritarian policies of president Porfirio Díaz. Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the spirit of his late brother Raúl, he decided to act. The spirit of Raúl told him, [...] "Aspire to do <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism." [...] Madero founded the Benito Juárez Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of Arjuna (a prince from the Mahabharata).|$|E
2500|$|During Mack Brown's time at Texas, he {{has only}} lost sixroad games in an opponent's stadium. [...] The Red Raiders are the only team so far to have {{defeated}} the Longhorns twice in road games, and {{they have done so}} in four-year increments with victories in 1998 and 2002. [...] The 2002 game was lost by Texas 42–38, when defensive starters Derrick Johnson, Kalen Thornton, Marcus Tubbs and Nathan Vasher were all injured. [...] Texas' coaching staff said that injuries are not an excuse to lose a ball game. [...] Mack Brown said, [...] "It's still a loss. Nobody cares. [...] I used to talk about injuries all the time, and it does nothing <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> team. Some years you have them, and some years you don't... We've still got a chance for everything after eight games, and that's unbelievable." [...] The most recent two Tech-Texas games had not been close score-wise, with Texas winning 51–21 in Lubbock in 2004 and 52–17 in Austin in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{regional}} {{success of}} [...] "Only a Lad", the group released its first full-length album, also titled Only a Lad (and featuring a new {{recording of the}} song), in 1981. Oingo Boingo also appeared in the 1981 film Longshot, performing their unreleased song [...] "I've Got to Be Entertained". The band, recording for A Records, released albums in 1982 (Nothing to Fear) and 1983 (<b>Good</b> <b>for</b> <b>Your</b> Soul) that drew comparisons to Devo and later, Wall of Voodoo. At this point, new manager Mike Gormley, who had just left the position of VP of Publicity and Asst. to the Chairman of A, negotiated a release from the label and signed the band to MCA Records. The first release was officially a Danny Elfman solo record in 1984 (titled So-Lo); {{it was actually a}} group effort released under Elfman's name to avoid contractual conflict with their previous label. Subsequently, the band would record under their own name for MCA.|$|E

The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy.

2500|$|On 16 April 2009, while {{preparing}} {{to board a}} British Airways flight at London's Gatwick Airport bound for a concert appearance in Bologna, François Ravard, accompanying Faithfull, was detained and then later arrested. In a statement, British Airways said: [...] "A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna. He appeared to be intoxicated on arrival at check-in. In such circumstances, an assessment is made {{as to whether the}} passenger is fit to travel. When he was refused travel, he became physically and verbally abusive. Police were called and he was arrested. Such behaviour will not be tolerated." [...] Faithfull, however, had not been drinking and was allowed to board. The pair was flying to Italy on a leg of her world tour promoting Easy Come, Easy Go. According to her spokesperson, [...] "Marianne was at Gatwick airport but was not involved in any way in the situation that occurred and she managed to travel on to Bologna as planned. Her gig tonight there will go ahead as planned, and Francois travelled from Britain to join her yesterday. Marianne hadn't been drinking {{at the time of the}} incident and she does not drink alcohol. She is enjoying life and loving it as she is sober and clean." [...] Faithfull revealed that although Ravard was still her manager, their 15-year relationship had ended some months ago. Faithfull stated, [...] "I'm all right but I have had a bit of an adventure – my relationship broke up. I felt very betrayed and lonely. I am much, much better now, but it is not <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> self-esteem." [...] On 3 May 2009, she was featured on CBS News Sunday Morning and interviewed by Anthony Mason in the [...] "Sunday Profile" [...] segment. Both in-studio and on-the-street (New York City) interview segments with Faithfull and Mason were interspersed with extensive biographical and musical footage.|$|E
