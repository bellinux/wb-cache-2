40|$|Abstract: Examinations of {{roll call}} voting have found issue {{salience}} affects the <b>influences</b> <b>over</b> roll call voting in different issue areas. However, {{it is unclear}} whether these findings can be extended to legislatures generally as studies have focused only on the U. S. congress or one U. S. state legislature. This article examines the <b>influences</b> <b>over</b> roll call voting in fifteen issue areas in five legislative chambers in four U. S. states. The results show the <b>influences</b> <b>over</b> roll call voting vary based on issue salience, but chamber variations suggest features in the political environment, such as party competition and the resources available to legislators, are just as important in understanding the factors that influence roll call voting. Key words: roll call voting, issue area...|$|R
