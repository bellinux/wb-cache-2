40|$|Summary. The {{irregular}} {{behavior of}} {{some kinds of}} suspensions {{on the basis of}} polymeric compositions and fine-dispersed fractions is characterized. As a simple, one-dimensional, shearing, viscometric flow such materials demonstrate the following mechanical behavior. There is no deformation if the shear stress does not exceed a certain critical value. If this critical value is exceeded, the flow is begins. This behavior is well-known and corresponds to the <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> of viscoplastic fluid. However, further increase in the shear rate results in “solidification”. The <b>rheological</b> <b>model</b> of such viscoplastic fluids, mechanical behavior demonstrating the “solidification” effect is offered. This model contains four empirical parameters.

40|$|International audienceMethods for {{estimation}} of the complex modulus generally produce data from which discrete results can be obtained {{for a set of}} frequencies. As these results are normally afflicted by noise, they are not necessarily consistent with the principle of causality and requirements of thermodynamics. A method is established for noise-corrected {{estimation of}} the complex modulus, subject to the constraints of causality, positivity of dissipation rate and reality of relaxation function, given a finite set of angular frequencies and corresponding complex moduli obtained experimentally. Noise reduction is achieved by requiring that two self-adjoint matrices formed from the experimental data should be positive semidefinite. The method provides a <b>rheological</b> <b>model</b> that corresponds to a specific configuration of springs and dashpots. The poles of the complex modulus on the positive imaginary frequency axis are determined by a subset of parameters obtained as the common positive zeros of certain rational functions, while the remaining parameters are obtained from a least squares fit. If the set of experimental data is sufficiently large, the level of refinement of the <b>rheological</b> <b>model</b> is in accordance with the material behavior {{and the quality of the}} experimental data.

The impact of these <b>rheological</b> <b>models</b> was elucidated through comparisons of haemodynamic flow details and drug transport behaviour at various blood flow rates. Results Recirculation lengths were found to reduce by as much as 24 % with the inclusion of a non-Newtonian <b>rheological</b> <b>model.</b> Another model possessing the viscosity and density of blood plasma was also implemented to account for near-wall red blood cell losses and yielded recirculation length increases of up to 59 %.
