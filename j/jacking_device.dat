50|$|A pallet , {{sometimes}} inaccurately {{called a}} skid (a skid has no bottom deck boards), is a flat transport structure that supports goods {{in a stable}} fashion while being lifted by a forklift, pallet jack, front loader, work saver, or other <b>jacking</b> <b>device,</b> or a crane. A pallet is the structural foundation of a unit load which allows handling and storage efficiencies. Goods or shipping containers are often placed on a pallet secured with strapping, stretch wrap or shrink wrap and shipped. Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the wooden box and the wooden barrel, as it works well with modern packaging like corrugated boxes and Intermodal containers commonly used for bulk shipping.|$|E
30|$|In addition, a push-in test {{served as}} a {{compressive}} test of the anchor casting itself, while a jacking test functioned as a tensile test as used in the field. In the push-in test, the loading procedure was stopped for some specimens due to safety concerns, but all the anchors endured at least 1.18 times the nominal ultimate strength of the strand before the test was stopped or the anchor failed. The jacking test reflected the real-world condition, {{but there was no}} strand fracture under the maximum loading force of the <b>jacking</b> <b>device,</b> which was larger than the minimum ultimate tensile strength.|$|E
