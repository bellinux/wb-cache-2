5|$|James Nesbitt is {{an actor}} from Northern Ireland whose filmography {{encompasses}} both television and film roles over a 30-year period. Nesbitt's screen career {{began in the}} early 1980s with uncredited roles in episodes of the BBC Play For Today strand, which he had while attached to the Riverside Theatre's youth group. His first credited role came in 1989, as a bit player in the John Ogdon biopic Virtuoso, which was followed by his first feature film role in 1991 in <b>Hear</b> <b>My</b> Song.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in <b>Hear</b> <b>My</b> Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E

500|$|Mendelssohn {{also wrote}} many smaller-scale sacred works for unaccompanied choir and for choir with organ. Most {{are written in}} or {{translated}} into English. Amongst the most famous is <b>Hear</b> <b>My</b> Prayer, whose second half contains [...] "O for the Wings of a Dove," [...] which became often performed as a separate item. The piece is written for full choir, organ, and a treble or soprano soloist. Mendelssohn's biographer Todd comments [...] "The very popularity of the anthem in England later exposed it to charges of superficiality from those contemptuous of Victorian mores".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{he lived with}} fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the {{successful}} star of Soldier Soldier. In his debut feature film, <b>Hear</b> <b>My</b> Song (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A New York Times critic wrote, [...] "the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, [...] "When I did <b>Hear</b> <b>My</b> Song, I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are." [...] His attitude left him {{out of work for}} six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and Between the Lines. In 1993, he appeared in Love Lies Bleeding, an instalment of the BBC anthology series Screenplay and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in Go Now (1995), Jude (1996) and Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). A Guardian journalist wrote that [...] "he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor" [...] in Jude and Sarajevo.|$|E

It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice and hear what I had to say."

500|$|William James Nesbitt, [...] (born 15 January 1965) is {{an actor}} and {{presenter}} from Northern Ireland. Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Nesbitt {{grew up in the}} nearby village of Broughshane, before moving to Coleraine, County Londonderry. He wanted to become a teacher like his father, so he began a degree in French at the University of Ulster. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical Up on the Roof (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in <b>Hear</b> <b>My</b> Song (1991).|$|E

He replaced for example [...] "" [...] (<b>Hear</b> <b>my</b> prayer; to you shall all flesh come) by [...] "In sorrow we mutely lower the flags, for into the grave sunk what was dear to us."

[...] Beyoncé was also motivated by her audience's strong expectations from her as a singer.

It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice and hear what I had to say." ...|$|E

[...] "Truthfully, I never really wanted to be a big movie star. I never even wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre." [...] During that period, McAdams turned down roles in the films The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Casino Royale (2006), [...] (2006) and Get Smart (2008). In February 2006, she made a one-off stage {{appearance}} in The Vagina Monologues at St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto to raise funds for V-Day. That same year, McAdams received a Rising Star Award nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and hosted the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.|$|E
