40|$|The field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the agronomic and economic interference between cotton and pigeon pea at Students Farm, Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam, Pakistan. The intercropping pigeon pea with cotton showed adverse effects on all the growth and yield contributing parameters of cotton. In pigeon pea, the taller plants (300 cm), greater number of branches (12. 33 plant - 1), remarkably higher pods (223. 66 plant - 1), heavy seed index (103. 33 g) and maximum seed yield (2182. 33 kg ha - 1) were observed in sole cropping system. In cotton, maximum plant height (164. 00 cm), more production of bolls plant - 1 (26. 33), higher number of branches plant - 1 (37. 33), greater bolls plant - 1 (16. 66) and satisfactory seed cotton yield (2271 kg ha - 1) were recorded when cotton was sown as sole crop. The agronomic parameters ob both intercrops decreased as compared to sole crops. The economic analysis indicated that cotton sole crop on an average recorded cost of production Rs. 31098 ha - 1 against Rs. 26000 ha - 1 intercropping of cotton with pigeon pea. The physical productivity study includes the total seed cotton yield of cotton as a sole crop and the total yield of cotton from intercropping with pigeon pea. The cotton sole crop yielded 2271. 00 kg ha - 1 and cotton intercropping with pigeon pea yielded 1120. 00 kg ha - 1. According to average per hectare revenue, productivity of cotton sole Rs. 56775. 00 and intercropping cotton with pigeon pea Rs. 28000 ha - 1. The cotton sole crop on average recorded net returns {{at the rate of}} Rs. 25677 ha - 1 whereas, cotton with pigeon pea intercropping exhibited the net returns at the rate of Rs. 2000 ha - 1, which was very low due to adverse affect of pigeon pea intercropping with cotton. In this study <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> were determined to examine economic efficiency of both cotton sole and cotton intercropping with pigeon pea. The results derived from the above analysis reveal that growing cotton sole crop earned input output ratios at the proportion of 1 : 87 whereas, cotton intercropping with pigeon pea had <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> at the proportion 1 : 07.

This included Rs. 6000. 00 for loading, Rs. 16000. 00 for transportation and Rs. 6000. 00 of unloading respectively in the study area.

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of different biogas systems, including single and co-digestion of multiple feedstock, different biogas utilization pathways, and waste-stream management strategies was evaluated. The input data {{were derived from}} assessment of existing biogas systems, present knowledge on anaerobic digestion process management and technologies for biogas system operating conditions in Germany. The energy balance was evaluated as Primary Energy Input to Output (PEIO) ratio, to assess the process {{energy efficiency}}, hence, the potential sustainability. Results indicate that the PEIO correspond to 10. 5 - 64. 0 % and 34. 1 - 55. 0 % for single feedstock digestion and feedstock co-digestion, respectively. Energy balance was assessed to be negative for feedstock transportation distances in excess of 22 Â km and 425 Â km for cattle manure and for Municipal Solid Waste, respectively, which defines the operational limits for respective feedstock transportation. Energy input was highly influenced by the characteristics of feedstock used. For example, agricultural waste, in most part, did not require pre-treatment. Energy crop feedstock required the respect cultivation energy inputs, and processing of industrial waste streams included energy-demanding pre-treatment processes to meet stipulated hygiene standards. Energy balance depended on biogas yield, the utilization efficiency, and energy value of intended fossil fuel substitution. For example, obtained results suggests that, whereas the upgrading of biogas to biomethane for injection into natural gas network potentially increased the primary energy input for biogas utilization by up to 100 %; the energy efficiency of the biogas system improved by up to 65 % when natural gas was substituted instead of electricity. It was also found that, system energy efficiency could be further enhanced by 5. 1 - 6. 1 % through recovery of residual biogas from enclosed digestate storage units. Overall, this study provides bases for more detailed assessment of environmental compatibility of energy efficiency pathways in biogas production and utilization, including management of spent digestate.

Energy inputs into digestate handling, feedstock pre-treatment and biogas upgrading, that are next most energy consuming stages, is greatly affected by the assumptions made about amount of substrate, produced biogas and transportation distance. When considering the maximal distance between macroalgae harvesting point and biogas production site and to which at which the energy balance remains positive then digestate handling becomes the most energy demanding process stage...|$|R
25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy <b>input</b> to protein <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|R
25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} food conversion efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy <b>input</b> to protein <b>output</b> <b>ratio</b> of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that feed first needs to be grown for most traditional livestock. Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates need to use a significantly greater amount of energy just to stay warm whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a food conversion twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|R

40|$|Here {{the authors}} explore, {{implement}} and verify the potential utility of hybrid intelligent adaptive systems for {{processing and analysis}} of multi-channel non-invasive abdominal foetal electrocardiogram (fECG) signals. This approach allows clinicians to enhance non-invasive cardiotocography (CTG) with continuous ST waveform analysis (STAN) of fECG signals to improve intrapartum monitoring during labuor. The system uses a multi-channel adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system with a new hybrid learning algorithm based on uniquely synthesised data, which comports well with real data acquired from clinical practice. The system allows the user to obtain a reference signal for objective verification. The functionality of the system has been evaluated not only by subjective criteria (an fECG morphology study by a gynaecologist), but also by objective criteria using quantitative performance metrics such as <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> signal-to-noise <b>ratios,</b> root mean square error, sensitivity S +, and positive predictive value among others. Experimental results indicate that hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems {{have the potential to}} improve the diagnostic and monitoring qualities (sensitivity and specificity) of fECG signals while preserving their clinically important features by leveraging the combined utility of non-invasive CTG and STAN.
