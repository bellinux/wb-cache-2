5|$|First Class : This {{advancement}} badge is {{the first}} advancement badge that places the Scout <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> leadership and organisation. A Scout is required to plan and run a wide game for their Patrol, a Patrol camp, an overnight Patrol hike for which a log book must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their Patrol about pioneering, {{and they need to}} assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of Kentrosaurus results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{position}}</b> <b>of</b> {{the center}} of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal. It rests {{just in front of}} the hip, a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs. However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E
5|$|Vespasian moved {{rapidly to}} Egypt, leaving the Jewish war {{under the command}} of Titus. At the same time Alexander, as a proven {{commander}} with experience of Jewish affairs, was sent by Vespasian to join Titus as his chief of staff and adviser, second only to Titus himself. By April 70, Jerusalem was under siege by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander, the offspring of a pious Jewish family, whose own father had donated the gold and silver for the Temple gates, now found himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> command against his former brothers in that very sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|After {{several days}} visiting {{his father in}} Purworejo, Oerip {{returned}} to Meester Cornelis where he took up a posting to BattalionXII. Even though he was the smallest man in the unit and the only native, he was placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> leadership. A year and half later {{he was sent to}} Banjarmasin, Borneo. After a period patrolling the jungles outside Puruk Cahu and Muara Tewe, he was sent to Tanah Grogot, followed by Balikpapan. While stationed there Oerip was promoted to first lieutenant but faced discrimination as a native in the Dutch forces. In Banjarmasin he had convinced his commander to strike an ordinance forbidding non-Dutch officers from joining the football team, and by 1917 Oerip had received equal legal status with Dutch officers. After Balikpapan Oerip was further sent to Samarinda, Tarakan, and ultimately Malinau.|$|E
5|$|Camilla and Marietta became Catholic nuns. Camilla {{took the}} name Suor Beatrice {{and entered the}} convent of San Domenico di Cafaggio, where she was {{entrusted}} {{to the care of}} Antonmaria's sister, Suor Albiera and Lisa's sisters, Suor Camilla (who was acquitted in a scandalous visitation by four men at the convent) and Suor Alessandra. Beatrice died at age 18 and was buried in the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella. Lisa developed a relationship with Sant'Orsola, a convent held in high regard in Florence, where she was able to place Marietta in 1521. Marietta took the name Suor Ludovica and became a respected member of the convent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> some responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{promoted}} and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates {{to their}} superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations {{to one day}} succeed Hitler {{as leader of the}} Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E

When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
