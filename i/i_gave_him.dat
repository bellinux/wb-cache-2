25|$|In {{the early}} 1420s James acted as {{the link between}} his brother and the {{powerful}} Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany who was acting as Regent for his cousin James I of Scotland while he was being held by the English for ransom. His links with the Albany Stewarts however did not prevent him from becoming a councillor to the king once he returned from imprisonment in 1424. Along with his nephew, Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas, {{he sat on the}} jury which convicted Murdoch and two of his sons of treason for failure to pay the ransom and allowing the king to be imprisoned for 18 years. In 1426 as a reward for his loyalty Douglas received royal confirmation of his lands, his eldest son William was knighted in 1430 and by 1435 he was sheriff of Lanarkshire strengthening his place among the kings principal followers. This backing from the earl of Douglas' senior kinsman was vital for the king to prevent a clash with the powerful Douglas affinity and shortly before his death in 1437 James <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> the title of Earl of Avondale.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

I couldn't grumble about that. We used to get on very well, and he would listen to the {{instructions}} <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him.</b> Then he became world famous!" [...] The respect was mutual: though Greaves described the Chelsea title-winning side as [...] "almost certainly one of the least talented teams ever to win the title", he made an exception for McNichol, [...] "the ball player of the team". In all competitions, he made 202 appearances for Chelsea and scored 66 goals.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{living in}} the countryside, Persona 4 {{characters}} were designed to look and sound [...] "normal" [...] and like [...] "modern high-schoolers", according to lead editor Nich Maragos. Initially, he wrote the game's cast as being [...] "more rural than was really called for". [...] "The characters aren't really ... They just happen {{to live in a}} place that's not a major metropolitan area." [...] While interviewing members of Persona 4s development team, 1UP.com editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have [...] "more stylish" [...] hair than the other characters. Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country.

500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him. R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis.

500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E

To neutralize any suspicion that Montenegro was acting against Russian interests, Njegoš cultivated a close personal friendship with vice-consul Grujić, who advised the czar that Njegoš was as dependable as ever.

2500|$|Some {{months after}} Truffaut's Stolen Kisses Claude Jade starred in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz (1969), as Michèle Picard, a secret agent's anxious daughter, {{married to a}} {{reporter}} (Michel Subor).
