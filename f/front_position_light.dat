An open-access {{version is}} {{available}} at arXiv. org (one of the alternative locations) Statistical properties of {{the front of a}} semi-infinite system of single-file diffusion (a one-dimensional system where particles cannot pass each other, but in between collisions each one independently exhibits diffusive motion) are investigated. Exact as well as asymptotic results are provided for the probability density function of (a) the <b>front</b> <b>position,</b> (b) the maximum of the <b>front</b> <b>positions,</b> and (c) the first-passage time to a given position. The asymptotic laws for the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> and the maximum <b>front</b> <b>position</b> are found to be governed by Fisher Tippett Gumbel extreme value statistics. The asymptotic properties of the first-passage time is dominated by a stretched-exponential tail in the distribution. The farness of the front {{with the rest of the}} system is investigated by considering (i) the gap from the front to the closest particle, and (ii) the density profile with respect to the <b>front</b> <b>position,</b> and analytical results are provided for late-time behaviours...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} non-perturbative {{description}} of stationary flames with arbitrary gas expansion is considered. A general method for deriving equations for the flame <b>front</b> <b>position</b> is developed. On {{the basis of}} the Thomson circulation theorem an implicit integral of the flow equations is constructed. With the help of this integral the flow structure near the flame front is determined, and a closed system of equations for the flame <b>front</b> <b>position</b> and a set of auxiliary quantities is obtained. This system is shown to be quasi-local, and its transverse representation is found. This representation allows reduction of the system to a single equation for the flame <b>front</b> <b>position.</b> The developed approach is applied to the case of zero-thickness flames.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present some {{improvements}} in the metrology of forest fire flames by coupling image processing and radiative heat flux measurement. A new metrological tool using a visual video camera and a specific multiple thermal sensors is proposed. By means of an appropriate segmentation algorithm and the Direct Linear Transformation, the image processing methodology gives the forward or the backward fire <b>front</b> <b>positions</b> as input data to a radiative heat flux approach. Using a simplified flame model, this technique provides fire <b>front</b> <b>positions</b> versus time, and average values for the flame length, flame depth, flame tilt angle, apparent flame temperature and flame emissivity. The rates of spread, obtained by a linear regression of the determined fire <b>front</b> <b>positions,</b> as well as the thermal and radiative properties of the flame, are compared favorably to those given in the literature...|$|R
30|$|Even though {{driving into}} sidings/the depot is a {{frequent}} task for drivers working shifts around rush hours, it {{does not account for}} a significant percentage of their shift. Hence, when the large percentage of all category A SPaDs and the low percentage of the shift spent in these locations are considered, this suggests that there are issues {{in the design of the}} locations and operational procedures. The signalling is the main difference at the depot and the sidings compared to the rest of the network with the majority of the signals being ground <b>position</b> <b>lights.</b> Even though the majority of the drivers disagree with added complexity of those locations and ground <b>position</b> <b>lights,</b> they gave this type of signals the lowest mark. Moreover, participants’ involvement in category A SPaDs does not influence the attitudes of the drivers towards the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> (U =  28, p =  0.663). The respondents mention that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are hard to see at times due to low brightness and a poor choice of location. It is possible that the drivers do not see any hazard in this type of signalling in the context of day-to-day driving. However, when compared with different types of signals, they perceive the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> as the hardest to interact with. It is also possible that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are the hardest to interact with in the beginning of a shift before driving in passenger service.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> {{consists of}} two heads; the bottom head can remain dark unless it is needed. In addition to the high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals the PRR developed a dwarf <b>position</b> <b>light,</b> as with many railroads, these dwarf signals are {{also referred to as}} a [...] "pot," [...] a tradition carried over from the 19th century revolving [...] "Pot Type Signal." [...] Four plain white lamps are able to display four low-speed aspects each with two lamps. In 1930, close clearances of the Philadelphia Suburban Station complex spurred development of the pedestal-type position, which consisted of two position dwarf signals in a common cast backing.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} red lenses in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these red lenses to high <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use red and green lenses in the upper head Stop and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of A+B->C fronts is analyzed theoretically {{in the presence}} of passive advection when A is injected radially into B at a constant inlet flow rate Q. We compute the long-time evolution of the <b>front</b> <b>position,</b> rf, of its width, w, and of the local production rate R of the product C at rf. We show that, while advection does not change the well-known scaling exponents of the evolution of corresponding reaction-diffusion fronts, their dynamics is however significantly influenced by the injection. In particular, the total amount of product varies as Q^{- 1 / 2 } for a given volume of injected reactant and the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> as Q^{ 1 / 2 } for a given time, paving the way to a flow control of the amount and spatial distribution of the reaction front product. This control strategy compares well with calcium carbonate precipitation experiments for which the amount of solid product generated in flow conditions at fixed concentrations of reactants and the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> can be tuned by varying the flow rate. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
