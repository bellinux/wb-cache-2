Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National <b>Fruit</b> <b>Collection,</b> which {{is the responsibility of}} the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent. The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} made {{on the island of}} Kauai using hydrolyzed protein traps, fruit traps and monthly <b>fruit</b> <b>collections</b> to {{determine}} the distribution, abundance, and host preferences of Bactrocera latifrons Hendel. No B. latifrons were found in protein bait traps that caught B. dorsalis Hendel, B. cucurbitae Coquillet, and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). Fruit traps baited with eggplant, Solanum melongena L., and zucchini squash, Cucumis melo L., were used {{for the first time to}} detect B. latifrons. B. latifrons was found for the first time on Kauai infesting tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum Miller. In addition to tomato, the fly was found infesting home garden eggplant and pepper, S. nigrum L. B. latifrons was found jointly infesting <b>fruit</b> <b>collections</b> of eggplant, and tomato with B. dorsalis and B. cucurbitae, and pepper with B. dorsalis. Also, for the first time in Kauai, B. dorsalis and B. cucurbitae were recovered from lei kikania, S. aculeatissimum Jacq. Distribution of the fly was confined primarily to the arid west side of Kauai in low numbers in the towns of Kekaha, Waimea, and Hanapepe. <b>Fruit</b> <b>collections</b> were the most sensitive and reliable indicators of B. latifrons occurrence and host utilization. Niche biology and ecology of B. latifrons is discussed in relation to distribution, habitat and host sharing between species of tephritid fruit flies...|$|R

The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was {{purchased}} by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. The staff of the (now) National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there.

Sampling methods in this study were <b>fruit</b> host <b>collection</b> (rearing) and trapping using Steiner-type trap that were set in 48 locations in several villages in Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan, and Sumenep regencies. Steiner traps were combined with 2 different attractants, such as methyl eugenol (ME) and Cue Lure (CL). There were 5 species of fruit flies obtained from trapping and rearing, namely Bactrocera carambolae, B. papayae, B. umbrosa, B. albistrigata, and B. cucurbitae. Results indicate that the distribution, diversity, and abundance of fruit flies were influenced by the diversity of fruit host, air temperature, and relative air humidity.

Quality and Health - by its Working Group 1 named âFrom genome to berry fruitâ has {{as major}} task an {{inventory}} of the berries genetic resources in Europe. The goal of this work {{is to establish a}} gene database for all berry species under study in the âex situâ locations. This study will provide a helpful tool for gene banks, breeders and other users in order to ensure safety of germplasm and to build up a European representative berries collection. A first overview of the small <b>fruits</b> <b>collections</b> included 1944 entries of 13 species of the genera: Fragaria, Ribes, Rubus, Vaccinium, Sambucus, Hippophae, Lonicera, Cornus and Rosa from 13 sites of 9 countries.

Also, a number of 277 entries of minor small fruits: seabuckthorn (46 ac.), elderberry (95 ac.), blue honeysuckle (28 ac.), cornelian cherry (66 ac.) and Rosa spp. (22 ac.) are maintained in two locations. Of the total entries, cultivars represent the largest part (82. 7 %), followed by clones, hybrids, lines (16. 8 %) and wild species (0. 5 %).

Information on frugivorous flies in cultivated or wild host plants and their parasitoids in the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul is presented and discussed. Fruit fly {{samples were collected}} weekly in specific fruit trees, and McPhailÂ® traps were installed in the same trees {{for a period of}} two years. The fruit flies infested ripe and unripe fruits of Averrhoa carambola L., Schoepfia sp., Psidium guajava L. and Pouteria torta (Mart.) Radlk and mature fruits of Anacardium occidentale L. and Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. Nineteen fruit fly species were obtained with the combination of sampling methods (collecting fruits and trapping), nine of them obtained with both methods, five found only in fruits and five only in traps. This is the first record of Anastrepha striata Schiner in a species of Sapotaceae, as well as for A. castanea Norrbom and A. daciformes Bezzi in Schoepfia sp. (Olacaceae), and for A. distincta Greene in fruits of P. guajava in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. <b>Fruit</b> <b>collections</b> simultaneously associated with capture of fruit flies by McPhail traps in the same host plants are essential to understand the diversity of fruit flies and their relationship with hosts and parasitoids.
