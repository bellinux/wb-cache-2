40|$|The {{problem of}} vehicle yaw control is {{addressed}} in this paper using an active differential and yaw rate feedback. A reference generator, designed to improve vehicle handling, provides the desired yaw rate value to be achieved by the closed loop controller. The latter is designed using the second-order sliding mode (SOSM) methodology to guarantee robust stability in front of disturbances and model uncertainties, which are typical of the automotive context. A feedforward control contribution is also employed to enhance the transient system response. The control derivative is constructed as a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>signal,</b> attaining an SOSM on a suitably selected sliding manifold. Thus, the actual control input results in being continuous, as it is needed in the considered context.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} a practical phase unwrapping method for real-time phase-contrast flow MRI using {{temporal and spatial}} continuity. Methods: Real-time phase-contrast MRI of through-plane flow was performed using highly undersampled radial FLASH with phase-sensitive reconstructions by regularized nonlinear inversion. Experiments involved flow in a phantom and the human aorta (10 healthy subjects) with and without phase wrapping for velocity encodings of 100 cm. s(- 1) and 200 cm. s(- 1). Phase unwrapping was performed for each individual cardiac cycle and restricted to a region of interest automatically propagated to all time frames. The algorithm exploited temporal continuity in forward and backward direction for all pixels with a "continuous" representation of blood throughout the entire cardiac cycle (inner vessel lumen). Phase inconsistencies were corrected by a comparison with values from direct spatial neighbors. The latter approach was also applied to pixels exhibiting a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>signal</b> intensity time course due to movement-induced spatial displacements (peripheral vessel zone). Results: Phantom and human flow MRI data were successfully unwrapped. When halving the velocity encoding, the velocity-to-noise ratio (VNR) increased {{by a factor of}} two.

40|$|In this proposal, we {{consider}} boundary control problems for {{two types of}} parabolic distributed parameter systems; namely the heat conduction systems and the diffusion-advection systems. Both the system internal parameter variations and the external disturbances (which enter from the boundary condition of the control end) are taken into account. We aim to develop sliding mode control laws which can maintain system stability with robustness against the above uncertainties. By applying the Volterra integral transformation, a stabilizing boundary control law can be obtained to achieve exponential stability in the ideal situation. The associated Lyapunov function is then used for designing an infinite-dimensional sliding manifold, on which the system exhibits {{the same type of}} stability. Simulation results are demonstrated and compared with the other outstanding back-stepping control schemes. The proposed method can be applied to both the Dirichlet type and the Neumann type of actuators. In our preliminary results, we discovered a sliding manifold, which has relative degree - 1 with respect to the boundary control variable.

40|$|The {{standard}} tools for analyzing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), {{a key component}} for making cosmological inferences, are usually of global sampling type. Such a methodological bias may preclude the development of important techniques for cosmology. This thesis develops local, real-space tools for CMB analysis which may be complemented using harmonic space techniques or provide useful signal diagnostics on their own. Particularly, finite-difference schemes for performing local derivatives are investigated. One can define derivatives which extract the primordial polarization modes from the measured CMB Stokes parameters by constructing real scalar and pseudo-scalar fields. The detection of a primordial curl-like (‘B’-mode) CMB polarization signal would imply {{the existence of a}} background of primordial gravitational waves, the ‘smoking gun’ signal of an inflationary cosmology. On an obscured (masked) sky, the gradient-like (‘E’-mode) signal leaks into the B-mode signal when the standard harmonic E/B signal decomposition is performed — using local techniques instead, this leakage can be reduced since the masked region is not sampled from. An algorithm and a software package are developed for just such a calculation. Furthermore, differencing errors in the presence of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>signals</b> are utilized to produce the ‘Laplacian-difference’ method, which enhances pathological and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>signals.</b> Such signals, in the absence of systematics, might reveal the presence of cosmic defects. The scalar and pseudo-scalar fields produced will feature self-coupled modetransfer due to masking; the mode-transfer matrices are related to the optimal apodization schemes for extracting power spectra. The transfer matrices for various spectral operations on scalar fields are presented, which for the polarization spectra provide important computational advantages over the direct utilization of the E- and B-modes.

40|$|Robust {{model fitting}} {{essentially}} requires {{the application of}} two estimators. The first is an estimator for {{the values of the}} model parameters. The second is an estimator for the scale of the noise in the (inlier) data. Indeed, we propose two novel robust techniques: the Two-Step Scale estimator (TSSE) and the Adaptive Scale Sample Consensus (ASSC) estimator. TSSE applies nonparametric density estimation and density gradient estimation techniques, to robustly estimate the scale of the inliers. The ASSC estimator combines Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) and TSSE: using a modified objective function that depends upon both the number of inliers and the corresponding scale. ASSC is very robust to <b>discontinuous</b> <b>signals</b> and data with multiple structures, being able to tolerate more than 80 % outliers. The main advantage of ASSC over RANSAC is that prior knowledge about the scale of inliers is not needed. ASSC can simultaneously estimate the parameters of a model and the scale of the inliers belonging to that model. Experiments on synthetic data show that ASSC has better robustness to heavily corrupted data than Least Median Squares (LMedS), Residual Consensus (RESC), and Adaptive Least K’th order Squares (ALKS). We also apply ASSC to two fundamental computer vision tasks: range image segmentation and robust fundamental matrix estimation. Experiments show very promising results.

40|$|A new filter is {{presented}} which has better edge and detail preserving properties than a median, noise reduction capability {{similar to a}} Gaussian, and is applicable to many signal and noise types. It is built on a definition of signal as bitonic, i. e., containing only one local maxima or minima within the filter range. This definition is based on data ranking rather than value; hence, the bitonic filter comprises a combination of non-linear morphological and linear operators. It has no data-level-sensitive parameters and can locally adapt to the signal and noise levels in an image, precisely preserving both smooth and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>signals</b> of any level {{when there is no}} noise, but also reducing noise in other areas without creating additional artifactual noise. Both the basis and the performance of the filter are examined in detail, and it is shown to be a significant improvement on the Gaussian and median. It is also compared over various noisy images to the image-guided filter, anisotropic diffusion, non-local means, the grain filter, and self-dual forms of leveling and rank filters. In terms of signal-to-noise, the bitonic filter outperforms all these except non-local means, and sometimes anisotropic diffusion. However, it gives good visual results in all circumstances, with characteristics which make it appropriate particularly for signals or images with varying noise, or features at varying levels. The bitonic has very few parameters, does not require optimization nor prior knowledge of noise levels, does not have any problems with stability, and is reasonably fast to implement.
