2500|$|In 2013, Blampied was {{contacted}} by her agent informing her that producers {{wanted her to}} reprise her role of Bree. Beforehand she had been hearing rumors of the return but nothing official. She signed a [...] "Major Guest" [...] contract that would see her reprise her role late in the year.

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{volume of the}} book A Positively Final Appearance (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an {{autograph}} to a young fan {{who claimed to have}} watched Star Wars over a hundred times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film because [...] "this {{is going to be an}} ill effect on your life". The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: [...] "'Well', I said, 'do you think you could promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew herself up to an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing to say to a child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. Maybe she was right but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hope</b> the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of second hand, childish banalities." [...] Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from Star Wars fans without reading it.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 November 2012, Cleverly {{traveled}} to the United States to make a third title defence against American boxer Shawn Hawk (23-2-1, 17 KOs) at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The fight took place on 10 November. Prior to the fight, Hawk had never been stopped as a professional and was a former sparring partner of Cleverly. Cleverly was originally scheduled to defend his title against Ryan Coyne, but the fight was called off due to contract disputes involving infamous promoter Don King. Hawk was unranked by the WBO, however, they sanctioned the bout, only if Cleverly would fight a mandatory challenger next. Cleverly retained the WBO title with an 8th round stoppage against Hawk. Prior to the stoppage, Hawk was dropped twice in round 7. Cleverly used his hand speed and worked Hawk down to the body shots, but carelessly took some shots himself. As referee Tony Crebs stepped in to halt the fight, Hawk's corner also threw in the towel, to avoid their man receiving any more punishment. Cleverly spoke to BBC Wales after the fight, [...] "This proves I'm ready for the States, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hope</b> their best fighters are ready to fight me," [...] Cleverly was next ...|$|E
