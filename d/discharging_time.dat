50|$|Battery life {{is limited}} because the {{capacity}} drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after {{as little as}} a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>time.</b> Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.|$|E

40|$|Since {{crosswalk}} {{width and}} pedestrian green time directly affect {{the safety of}} signalized crosswalks, modeling an exact total crossing time model to estimate those two variables is imperative. The total crossing time needed {{by a group of}} pedestrians to cross a signalized crosswalk contains the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> and the crossing <b>time.</b> The <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> depends primarily on the maximum queue length, which is determined by pedestrian arrival rate, red interval, waiting position distribution, and the crosswalk width. Crossing time increases when interactions between bidirectional pedestrian flows become more serious. Thus, quantifying the impacts of the start-up process on the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> and the effects of the interactions on the crossing time is a prerequisite for optimizing the design of signalized crosswalks. This paper establishes a modified total crossing time model consisting of modified pedestrian <b>discharge</b> and crossing <b>time.</b> <b>Discharge</b> <b>time</b> is modeled by applying traffic wave theory, and crossing time is modeled based on drag force theory.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} paper thermal performance of an air-phase change material (PCM) unit has been experimentally studied. The influences of the air inlet temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. Air inlet temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and air inlet velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the air inlet velocity reduced the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>time,</b> however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The air inlet temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the <b>discharging</b> <b>time.</b> For lower air inlet velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant {{over a longer period}} of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the air inlet velocity of 0. 6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that <b>discharging</b> <b>time</b> can be extended by reducing the air inlet velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings. A simplified methodology is proposed for the analysis of the PCM charging and discharging process through the identification of the critical points as result of the heat transfer behaviour in the air- PCM unit...|$|E

40|$|Bench scale {{tests are}} {{proposed}} {{to study the}} performance of a water mist fire suppression system on plastic fires. The effects of water mist on burning solid polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) are compared with a cone calorimeter. A scaled nozzle developed earlier for discharging water mist in a cone calorimeter was used. Operating pressures of 0. 2 - 0. 7 MPa, corresponding to water flow rates of 68 mL/min and 134 mL/min, were used. It was observed that PMMA samples could be ignited easily and liberated significant amounts of heat at high release rates. PVC was more difficult to ignite, but gave out large quantities of smoke. Discharging water to both did not increase the heat release rate significantly. However, both smoke quantity and carbon monoxide concentration increased. This was more obvious for PMMA fires. Hazard assessment parameters for thermal aspects and smoke were measured and presented as a 'hazard diagram' to understand the action of water mist and the potential for re-ignition. It is suggested that bench scale tests can also give useful results for designing water mist systems. The <b>discharging</b> <b>time</b> of water mist is a key factor in controlling PMMA fires.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new working method of controllable Electro-Chemical Honing (ECH) of gears as follows. A gear shaped cathode which is meshing with a workpiece gear during machining is exposed as cathode pole {{only on a}} strip on the tooth dank. By varying the center distance between the cathode and the gear slowly, the electrolysis zone sweeps over the tooth flank from root to tip (slow scanning as we call it). Since the center distance is varied by a step motor, so the time of dwelling of the pole, and hence the amount of metal removal on different spots of the profile can be controlled by programming. An on-line profile error measuring device is provided. The computer calculates the required <b>discharging</b> <b>time</b> which has a relationship with dwelling time, and sends out the programming to control the metal. removing rate so as to cancel the error or to produce profile correction needed by silent transmission.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{operative}} data and early postoperative outcomes of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and vaginal hysterectomy (VH). One hundred and eight women requiring hysterectomy for enlarged myomatous uterus were randomly allocated into three treatment arms: TLH (n = 36); LAVH (n = 36); VH (n = 36). Randomization procedure {{was based on}} a computer-generated list. The primary outcome was the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> comparison. The secondary outcomes were operating time, blood loss, paralytic ileus time, intraoperative complications, postoperative pain, and early postoperative complications. The mean <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> was shorter after VH than after LAVH and TLH (P = 0. 001). Operating time significantly influenced the <b>discharge</b> <b>time,</b> considered as a dependent variable in general linear model analysis (P = 0. 006). In contrast, blood loss did not influence the <b>discharge</b> <b>time</b> (P = 0. 55). The mean operating time was significantly shorter in VH than in TLH and LAVH groups (P = 0. 000). The intraoperative blood loss was greater during LAVH than during TLH and VH (P = 0. 000). Paralytic ileus time was shorter after VH than after TLH and LAVH (P = 0. 000).
