25|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a toxic {{chemical}} compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings {{and transferred to}} canned food. The inside of the can is coated with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>coating,</b> {{in an attempt to}} prevent food or beverage from coming into contact with the metal. The longer food is in a can, and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part <b>epoxy</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its <b>epoxy</b> <b>coating.</b> Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} use of Scotchlite 213 <b>epoxy</b> <b>coated</b> {{reinforcement}} in Oregon coastal environments. There is an extensive body of knowledge documenting <b>epoxy</b> <b>coated</b> reinforcement research in North America in the last 20 years. The research has produced mix results. However, recent studies conducted by Clear and others for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, by Kessler and others for the Florida Department of Transportation and by Weyers and others in Virginia, provide evidence of poor performance of <b>epoxy</b> <b>coated</b> reinforcement in coastal bridge structures. In 1989, the Oregon Department of Transportation removed a concrete test beam reinforced with Scotchlite 213 <b>epoxy</b> <b>coated</b> reinforcement after nine years of service from Yaquina Bay in Newport, Oregon. Results of the testing and evaluation showed that there was adhesion loss of the coating attributed to low blast profile of the steel and low coating thickness. There was observed corrosion along the longitudinal bars and hoop reinforcement that were located within the tidal zone. Another concrete beam reinforced with Scotchlite 213 <b>epoxy</b> <b>coated</b> reinforcement was removed from Yaquina Bay in 1998 after eighteen years of exposure. The testing and evaluation showed that: 1. Half-cell potential measurements within the beam’s tidal zone exceeded the 90 % probability threshold (- 0. 35 V) for corrosion to occur...|$|R
