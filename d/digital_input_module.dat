40|$|A {{portable}} 8 -channel wireless {{data acquisition}} and processing system (WLS) {{was developed to}} acquire unsteady pressure data on a model inside the fully enclosed metallic 1. 2 m trisonic wind tunnel at NAL, Bangalore. Analog signals from pressure transducers mounted on the model were suitably amplified, filtered, digitized and encrypted using NI and DLINK wireless hardware modules placed inside a pod located near the model. As the test section is fully metallic and absorbs the wireless signals, the digitized signals were transmitted {{out of the tunnel}} using an RF antenna. A wireless repeater was configured using an access point and a router to transmit the signals to the laptop placed in the control room of the wind tunnel. A separate NI wireless <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> <b>module</b> along with DLINK USB DWA 140 was used to interface with integrated tunnel control system (ITCS) of the tunnel to start the acquisition when the tunnel total pressure (Po) is established. Even though the system is capable of acquiring signals of 8 channels simultaneously upto 20 KHz, as part of the system validation, unsteady pressure data up to 1 kHz from two channels on a 10 ° cone model were acquired in the wind tunnel in the Mach number range of 0. 7 to 4. 0. In parallel, the unsteady pressure data from the same transducers were acquired up to 40 kHz from a hardwired and proven 32 -channel unsteady pressure data acquisition, processing and analysis system (HFDAQ). For the purpose of comparison of data from WLS, data from the HFDAQ has been reduced to 1 kHz. The comparisons were excellent, with the WLS showing improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) up to about 15 dB...|$|E

50|$|Fault {{tolerance}} in the Tricon {{is achieved}} {{by means of a}} Triple-Modular Redundant(TMR) architecture. The Tricon provides error-free, uninterrupted control in the presence of either hard failures of components, or transient faults from internal or external sources.The Tricon is designed with a fully triplicated architecture throughout, from the <b>input</b> <b>modules</b> through the Main Processors to the output modules. Every I/O module houses the circuitry for three independent legs.Each leg on the <b>input</b> <b>modules</b> reads the process data and passes thatinformation to its respective Main Processor. The three Main Processors communicate with each other using a proprietary high-speed bus system called the TriBus. Once per scan, the three MainProcessors synchronize and communicate with their two neighbors overthe TriBus. The Tricon votes <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> data, compares output data, and sends copies of analog input data to each Main Processor.The Main Processors execute the userwritten application and send outputs generated by the application to the output modules. In addition to voting the input data, the TriBus votes the output data. This is done on the output modules as close to the field as possible, in order to detect and compensate for any errors that could occur between the Tricon voting and the final output driven to the field.|$|R

40|$|The rise in {{complexity}} of SOC (System-on-Chip) architectures has brought into focus {{the need for}} better communication models for SOCs. The traditional bus based approach is reaching its limit {{with the emergence of}} high core count SOCs. The theory and practices of wired communication networks is being applied to tackle communication issues in complex SOCs. This {{is referred to as the}} Network on Chip (NOC) model. Routers are one of the most important elements of an on chip network. The underlying architecture of a router is based on a crossbar switch as it offers higher throughput and lower latency due to point-to-point architecture. Homogenous sizes of the <b>input</b> <b>module</b> in the router may not be efficient as some cores may be underutilized while some of them may be overloaded. A heterogeneous size of the <b>input</b> <b>module</b> is preferred for the predicted traffic but bursty in nature.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the {{scheduling}} problem for Clos-network switches with no buffers {{at the central}} stage. Existing scheduling (dispatching) algorithms {{for this type of}} switch, such as CRRD and CMSD, are too complex for implementation. We consider efficient and practical dispatching algorithms and propose the k-selector based dispatching (KBD) algorithm. The KBD algorithm differs from other dispatching algorithms in the phase of matching within <b>input</b> <b>modules.</b> In KBD, only one k-selector is used at each <b>input</b> <b>module</b> to select m out of nk requests to send to the corresponding central modules. As such, the interconnection wires are totally removed in <b>input</b> <b>modules</b> and the required time for the first phase is improved significantly.
