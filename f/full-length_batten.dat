50|$|Junk rigs feature <b>full-length</b> <b>battens</b> that {{facilitate}} short-handed sail handling, including reefing. The battens are attached loosely to the mast with lines called batten parrels that allow fore-and-aft motion as the sail {{is controlled by}} individual sheets leading to multiple battens.|$|R
50|$|A junk is {{an ancient}} Chinese sailing ship design that is still in use today. Junks were used as {{seagoing}} vessels {{as early as the}} 2nd century AD and developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Their rigs featured <b>full-length</b> <b>battens</b> that facilitated short-handed sail handling, including reefing.|$|R
25|$|Recreational {{and sport}} {{catamarans}} typically {{are designed to}} have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and <b>full-length</b> <b>battens</b> on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.|$|R
50|$|In-boom roller-reefing, with a {{horizontal}} foil inside the boom. This method allows for standard- or <b>full-length</b> horizontal <b>battens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of sail battens {{is in the}} roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have <b>full-length</b> <b>battens,</b> as well, that allow for better sail shape. Batten length near {{the head of the}} sail is limited by the need for the roach to pass ahead of the backstay, when tacking or jibing. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans.|$|R
50|$|A {{sail batten}} is a {{flexible}} insert in a fore-and-aft sail that provides added stiffness and definition to the sail's airfoil cross-section. The most common use of sail battens {{is in the}} roach of a mainsail. The batten extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six battens. Racing sailboats may have <b>full-length</b> <b>battens,</b> as well, that allow for better sail shape. Battens are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Most battens are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section.|$|R
50|$|The Stratos can be reefed in {{less than}} a minute to reduce the amount of power from the mainsail. The Stratos' Combi-Tec Mainsail {{includes}} short <b>battens</b> and a <b>full-length</b> top <b>batten.</b> The Stratos also has a furling jib, which means the Stratos can be fully depowered {{in less than}} ten seconds.|$|R
