The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a Daisy Duck tale ("The Dainty Daredevil") published in Walt Disney Comics Digest issue 5 (Nov. 1968).

25|$|In turn, 20th Century Fox {{handed the}} project to William Dozier and his {{production}} company, Greenway Productions. ABC and Fox were expecting a hip and fun—yet still serious—adventure show. However, Dozier, who had never before read comic books, concluded, after reading several Batman comics for research, {{that the only way}} to make the show work was to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pop-art campy comedy. Originally, espionage novelist Eric Ambler was to have scripted a TV movie that would launch the television series, but he dropped out after learning of Dozier's campy comedy approach. Eventually, two sets of screen tests were filmed, one with Adam West and Burt Ward and the other with Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, with West and Ward winning the roles.|$|E
500|$|The {{operetta}} Candide {{was originally}} conceived by playwright Lillian Hellman, as a play with incidental music. Leonard Bernstein, the American composer and conductor {{who wrote the}} music, was so excited about the project that he convinced Hellman to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "comic operetta". Many lyricists worked on the show, including James Agee, Dorothy Parker, John Latouche, Richard Wilbur, Leonard and Felicia Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Hellman. Hershy Kay orchestrated all the pieces except for the overture, which Bernstein did himself. [...] Candide first opened on Broadway as a musical on 1 December 1956. The premier production was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and conducted by Samuel Krachmalnick. While this production was a box office flop, the music was highly praised, and an original cast album was made. The album gradually became a cult hit, but Hellman's libretto was criticised as being too serious an adaptation of Voltaire's novel. Candide would be more popular seventeen years later with a new libretto by Hugh Wheeler.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E

Williams used a Triton Extreme, Triton Pro and Pro Tools {{in the production}} of the album, while Hugo worked in Access Virus TI, Roland JV-1080, JV-2080, XV-5080, TR-808 and TR-909 as beatboxing was provided by Haley. Rock band Spymob further assisted production with guitar and drums. Production revolved around heavy rock, funk and soul music, which was first introduced in their debut album, In Search Of.... Hugo described the album as going back to the band's roots, combining a classic rock sound with a 1970s funk swing. The typical process of recording was described as [...] "Williams arrives at the studio, ideas in full flower, and lays down both a beat (either programmed or played on an assortment of buckets) and vocals." [...] Hugo then would add extra instrumentation. In an interview with MTV, Williams said that the band [...] "didn't care about genres; we're not doing this for the money. We're doing this for people who pledge allegiance to our movement." [...] Hugo {{went on to say that}} they [...] "just want to make people move". On the album he said, [...] "We had anger, quiet angst. We had something to get off our chest. And we wanted to show we could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> band." [...] Don Was, a musician and record producer, thought that the band was on a creatively fulfilling path, calling their musical style [...] "really innovative".|$|E

Kevin McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously {{been part of the}} group Not Like Them. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: [...] "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R Even the musical theatre stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it." [...] Jane Lynch was originally supposed to have a recurring role as Sue Sylvester, but was made a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through. The cast is contracted for a potential three Glee films, with their contract stating that [...] " [...] hereby grants Fox three exclusive, irrevocable options to engage [...] in up to, respectively, three feature-length motion pictures."

500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when you know you are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "The Erotic as Power," [...] written in 1978 and {{collected}} in Sister Outsider, Lorde theorizes the Erotic {{as a site}} of power for women only when they learn to release it from its suppression and embrace it. She proposes that the Erotic needs to be explored and experienced wholeheartedly, because it exists not only in reference to sexuality and the sexual, {{but also as a}} feeling of enjoyment, love, and thrill that is felt towards any task or experience that satisfies women in their lives, be it reading a book or loving one's job. She dismisses [...] "the false belief that only by the suppression of the erotic within our lives and consciousness can women be truly strong. But that strength is illusory, for it is fashioned within the context of male models of power." [...] She explains how patriarchal society has misnamed it and used it against women, causing women to fear it. [...] Women also fear it because the erotic is powerful and a deep feeling. Women must share each other's power rather than use it without consent, which is abuse. [...] They should <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> method to connect everyone in their differences and similarities. Utilizing, the erotic as power allows women to use their knowledge and power to face the issues of racism, patriarchy, and our anti-erotic society.|$|E

2500|$|In Kalamazoo, {{with cold}} weather around 40 degrees and windy, both teams’ {{managers}} agreed {{to play the}} Game 2 in just seven innings. Risinger started for the Chicks and pitched {{one of the best}} games of her career. Grand Rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning, and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth, keyed by a two-run double off the bat of Ricketts. Risinger gave up a RBI single to Jean Lovell, and yielded only one extra-base hit, a solo home run by Doris Sams during Kalamazoo's two-run rally in the sixth inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Lassies tried to rally again. Fern Shollenberger opened with a single, but Risinger retired the next two batters.
