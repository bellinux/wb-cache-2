5000|$|Molecular imaging {{differs from}} {{traditional}} imaging in that probes known as biomarkers {{are used to}} help image particular targets or pathways. Biomarkers interact chemically with their surroundings and in turn alter the image according to molecular changes occurring within the area of interest. This process is markedly different from previous methods of imaging which primarily imaged differences in qualities such as density or water content. This ability to image fine molecular changes opens up an incredible number of exciting possibilities for medical application, including early detection and treatment of disease and basic pharmaceutical development. Furthermore, molecular imaging allows for quantitative tests, imparting {{a greater degree of}} objectivity to the study of these areas. One emerging technology is MALDI molecular imaging based on mass spectrometry. Many areas of research are being conducted in the field of molecular imaging. Much research is currently centered on detecting what is known as a predisease state or molecular states that occur before typical symptoms of a disease are detected. Other important veins of research are the imaging of gene expression and the development of novel biomarkers. Organizations such as the SNMMI Center for Molecular Imaging Innovation and Translation (CMIIT) have formed to support research in this field. In Europe, other [...] "networks of excellence" [...] such as DiMI (Diagnostics in Molecular Imaging) or EMIL (European Molecular Imaging Laboratories) work on this new science, <b>integrating</b> <b>activities</b> and research in the field.

The aim of the current theoretical paper was to estimate 18 F-FDG <b>integrated</b> <b>activity</b> using one standardized uptake value (SUV). Methods: A further kinetic model analysis allowed us to derive an analytical solution for <b>integrated</b> <b>activity</b> determination, involving both irreversible and reversible trapping. It only uses SUV, which is uncorrected for 18 F physical decay (SUVuncorr, in g. mL − 1) and is assessed about its peak value. Measurement uncertainty of the estimate was also assessed. Results: In a tissue (volume V, in mL) that irreversibly traps 18 F-FDG, {{the total number of}} disintegrations can be estimated as: ÃC = 162 * 10 5 * SUVuncorr * V * ID / W (ID, injected dose, in MBq; W, patient’s weight, in kg), where SUVuncorr is a mean over V and is assessed between 55 and 110 min after tracer injection. The relative uncertainty ranges between 18 % and 30 % (the higher the uptake, the lower the uncertainty). Comparison with the previous Zanotti-Fregonara’s model applied to foetus showed less than 16 % difference. Furthermore, calculated <b>integrated</b> <b>activity</b> estimates were found in good agreement with Mejia’s results for healthy brain, lung and liver that show various degrees of tracer trapping reversibility and various fractions of free tracer in blood and interstitial volume.

In comparison, {{the aim of the}} present theoretical work was to investigate whether an estimate of 18 F-FDG <b>integrated</b> <b>activity</b> in an arbitrary tissue can be computed by only using SUV obtained from a single static acquisition.
