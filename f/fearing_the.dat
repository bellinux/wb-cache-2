5|$|East of Porus' kingdom, {{near the}} Ganges River, were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal {{region of the}} Indian subcontinent). <b>Fearing</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fearing</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of French Revolutionary ideals, {{particularly those of}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Trimmer emphasized orthodox Anglicanism and encouraged the perpetuation of the contemporary social and political order. Despite her conservatism, however, she agreed with Rousseau and other progressive educational reformers on many issues, such as the damaging effects of rote learning and the irrationalism of fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fearing</b> <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} {{would bring}} the countryside down on the Mormons, the Nauvoo city council declared the Expositor a public nuisance and ordered the Nauvoo Legion to destroy the press.

5|$|Meanwhile, Polish forces led {{by general}} Stefan Czarniecki ravaged {{southern}} Swedish Pomerania, and destroyed and plundered Pasewalk, Gartz (Oder) and Penkun.

5|$|National {{and state}} AFL-CIO officials, <b>fearing</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey law might {{open the door}} to {{extensive}} new state regulation of labor unions, asked Local 54 to test the New Jersey law in court.

5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, <b>fearing</b> <b>the</b> show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.|$|E

50|$|Lesson 2 Self-Confidence {{will help}} you master <b>the</b> six basic <b>fears</b> with which every person is cursed: <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Poverty, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Ill Health, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Old Age, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Criticism, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Loss of Love of Someone, and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Death.

50|$|There is a {{fear that}} is unlike all other fears. It has a special, clammy chill, a deadly gift for inspiring deeper, darker dread. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of unentered rooms, of bends in lonely roads. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> phone call {{in the middle of}} the night, of the {{stranger}} you recognize, perhaps from a nightmare.

5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. <b>Fearing</b> <b>the</b> prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Derfflinger and Von der Tann went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald's {{influence}} {{was less than}} his father's, but Kent was powerful enough to be omitted {{from the list of}} kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria. Edwin's marriage to Eadbald's sister, Æthelburg, established a good relationship between Kent and Northumbria which appears to have continued into Oswald's reign. When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin's death in about 633, she sent her children to Francia for safety, <b>fearing</b> <b>the</b> intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald. The Kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over the succeeding years, including the marriage of Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, to Oswiu, and of Eorcenberht to Seaxburh, daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fearing</b> <b>the</b> Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|Some {{possible}} explanations of gephyrophobia may be <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of driving off <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of {{a gust of}} wind taking one off <b>the</b> bridge, a <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> structural integrity of the bridges itself, or <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that <b>the</b> bridge will collapse if they try to cross it. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> overlaps with acrophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of heights, as gephyrophobia tends to be exacerbated in tall bridges vs. ones close to the water/ground beneath.|$|R
5|$|In early 1257, Aybak {{was killed}} in a conspiracy, and was succeeded by his 15-year-old son, al-Mansur Ali, while Saif ad-Din Qutuz held an {{influential}} position. Soon after al-Mansur Ali's ascendancy rumors of another conspiracy to which an-Nasir Yusuf had an alleged connection emerged. The accused conspirator, al-Mansur Ali's vizier, Sharaf ad-Din al-Fa'izi, was strangled by Egyptian authorities. The Bahri Mamluks in Syria led by Baibars pressured an-Nasir Yusuf to intervene by invading Egypt, but he would not act, <b>fearing</b> <b>the</b> Bahri dynasty would usurp his throne if they gained Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, for example, mayor Robert Wagner {{ordered an}} {{increase}} in the New York City Transit Police force from 1,219 to 3,100 officers. During the hours at which crimes most frequently occurred (between 8:00p.m. and 4:00a.m.), the officers went on patrol in all stations and trains. In response, crime rates decreased, as extensively reported by the press. In July 1985, however, the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City published a study showing riders abandoning the subway, <b>fearing</b> <b>the</b> frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. <b>Fearing</b> <b>the</b> spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
