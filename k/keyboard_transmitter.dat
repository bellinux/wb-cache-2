50|$|Kleinschmidt {{began working}} with nascent {{communications}} technology in 1893 while still in his teens. He first patented a Morse <b>keyboard</b> <b>transmitter,</b> in 1895 (Patent No. 964,372; filed February 7, 1895; issued January 11, 1910) and later a Morse keyboard perforator. Keyboard perforators were a development from Charles Wheatstone's perforator of 1858 http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1859-Wheatstone/, a hand-operated device which produced a punched paper tape for use in automatic telegraph transmitters.|$|E
50|$|Royal Earl House {{developed}} and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic <b>keyboard</b> for the <b>transmitter</b> and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver, and followed this {{up with a}} steam-powered version in 1852. Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors. The House machine was used on four main American telegraph lines by 1852. The speed of the House machine was announced as 2600 words an hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} {{printed a}} series of ticker symbols (usually shortened forms of a company's name), followed by brief information {{about the price of}} that company's stock; the thin strip of paper on which they were printed was called ticker tape. The word ticker comes from the distinct tapping (or ticking) noise the machines made while printing. Pulses on the telegraph line made a letter wheel turn step by step until the correct symbol was reached and then printed. A typical 32-symbol letter wheel had to turn on average 15 steps until the next letter could be printed resulting in a very slow printing speed of one character per second. In 1883, ticker <b>transmitter</b> <b>keyboards</b> resembled the keyboard of a piano with black keys indicating letters and the white keys indicating numbers and fractions, corresponding to two rotating type wheels in the connected ticker tape printers.|$|R
