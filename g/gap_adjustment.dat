A narrow gap may give too small and weak a spark to {{effectively}} ignite the fuel-air mixture, but the plug will almost always fire on each cycle. A gap that is too wide might prevent a spark from firing at all or may misfire at high speeds, but will usually have a spark that is strong for a clean burn.

Small access plates were provided {{on the sides of the}} cylinder block, giving access to the gap between the valves and tappets. Some tappets had a threaded adjuster, but simpler engines could be adjusted by grinding down the ends of the valve stem directly. As the adjustment gap need only be expanded over the engine's working life (re-grinding valves into their valve seats during de-coking makes them sit lower, thus closing up the tappet <b>gap),</b> <b>adjustment</b> by removing metal was acceptable. Care was obviously needed, to not remove too much. Eventually the valves would be replaced entirely, a relatively common operation for engines of this era.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit cross-sectional area by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit cross-sectional area variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i. e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece while the roll gap changed. To predict the amount of roll <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment</b> that compensates wear, a model for roll <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent roll <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment,</b> which reduces the increased exit cross-sectional area owing to wear up to a base exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit cross-sectional area calculated by the roll <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment</b> model is in good agreement with the exit cross-sectional area measured. It has been found from the pilot hot rolling test that variation in exit cross-sectional area is almost linearly proportional to roll gap change while the roll gap decreases from a datum roll gap to about half of the datum one...|$|E

In particular we demonstrate: • An efficient application of ICP-CVD and PECVD techniques {{for the improvement}} of the passivation quality and the minority carrier lifetime; • Efficient band <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment</b> at sophisticated interfaces at low temperatures, low RF powers and short processing times. Abstract A comparative study on the application of two quite different plasma-based techniques to the preparation of amorphous/crystalline silicon (a-Si:H/c-Si) interfaces for solar cells is presented. The interfaces were fabricated and processed by hydrogen plasma treatment using the conventional plasma-enhanced chemical vacuum deposition (PECVD) and inductively coupled plasma chemical vapour deposition (ICP-CVD) methods The influence of processing temperature, radio-frequency power, treatment duration and other parameters on interface properties and degree of surface passivation were studied. It was found that passivation could be improved by post-deposition treatment using both ICP-CVD and PECVD, but PECVD treatment is more efficient for the improvement on passivation quality, whereas the minority carrier lifetime increased from 1. 65 × 10 − 4 to 2. 25 × 10 − 4 and 3. 35 × 10 − 4 s after the hydrogen plasma treatment by ICP-CVD and PECVD, respectively.

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that for short gaps between 2 to 5 ms, the {{perceived}} loudness is higher than for uninterrupted noise presented to the ear. Other studies have also shown that the present temporal integration models for the calculation of time varying loudness do not adequately account for short duration phenomena. It has been proposed that the multiple look approach is a more applicable method for describing these short term circumstances. This approach breaks a sound into small durations or looks having length of 1 ms which allows for the intelligent processing of the looks and decision making depending {{on the nature of the}} stimulus. However, present technologies (i. e. FFT) are not adequate to deal with short duration sounds across the entire frequency spectra. A compromised approach is taken here to account for perceived loudness levels for sounds in the presence of gaps while using an integration model. This approach is referred to as a multiple look <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment</b> model. A model and software code was developed to take a recorded sound presented to the ear and process it into individual looks which are then examined for the presence of gaps ranging in length between 1 to 10 ms. If gaps are found, an appropriate <b>gap</b> <b>adjustment</b> is applied to the sound. The modified stimulus is subsequently evaluated for loudness level using a model which relies on temporal integration. The multiple look model was tested using several sounds including mechanical and speech sounds and was found to perform as intended.

40|$|Cooper and Willis (2003) is {{the latest}} in a {{sequence}} of criticisms of our methodology for estimating aggregate nonlinearities when microeconomic adjustment is lumpy. Their case is based on "reproducing" our main findings using artificial data generated by a model where microeconomic agents face quadratic adjustment costs. That is, they supposedly find our results where they should not be found. The three claims on which they base their case are incorrect. Their mistakes range from misinterpreting their own simulation results to failing to understand the context in which our procedures should be applied. They also claim that our approach assumes that employment decisions depend on the gap between the target and current level of unemployment. This is incorrect as well, since the 'gap approach' has been derived formally from at least as sophisticated microeconomic models as the one they present.

A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is a visualization tool that utilizes the quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron tunneling to image features and structures at these small scales. Tunneling results when a metallic probe tip is brought sufficiently close to an electrically conducting, biased sample without making physical contact. A small current is drawn as electrons jump (tunnel) across the gap between the tip and the sample. This current is so small that the medium between the tip and the sample does not break down and become electrically conducting. Once a tunneling current is drawn between the tip and the sample, which are separated by a gap, feedback controls in conjunction with piezoelectric actuators adjust the gap distance {{in such a way as}} to maintain a constant tunneling current as the tip scans across the sample surface.

Actuated traffic controllers are intended to determine traffic conditions, in real-time by means of vehicle detection, and respond accordingly {{in order to maintain the}} highest reasonable level of efficiency under varying conditions. However, modern traffic controllers are essentially sophisticated electronic timers. Rather than merely responding to detector ablations, it is desirable to improve this system such that the controller has a goal to be achieved and acquires information about the present state of the system in the same units. The goal of this research was to develop an actuated traffic control process that could use estimated volumes in order to optimally operate the traffic signal in real- time in response to actual traffic demands, or a reasonable estimate of demand. Once the present and desired states of the system are known, the control changes necessary to move from the present state to the optimal target state can be determined. A further goal of this research was to establish the relationship between the traditional control parameter, passage gap and key operating parameters, in order to allow changes in signal operations to be made by means of passage <b>gap</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The relationships between passage gap and cycle length, green splits, and interval length were studied, and the cycle length relationship was formalized mathematically. The quantified form can then be used as a tool to adjust the signal performance to approach the desired operating state. Research was conducted with computer simulation, using both stand-alone software and a hardware-in-the-loop setup. Testing and comparison between methods validated the use of these models. Results indicated that the volume estimation methodology could be readily calibrated to provide good estimates of traffic volumes by movement. Furthermore, simulation results quantified the relationship between passage gap and cycle length, thereby establishing a mechanism by which to directly implement signal operating changes at an actuated traffic signal. The scope of the research dealt with only one traffic control sensor design configuration - that of 6 th-foot stapling detection. The overall study results suggest that this design is operationally very efficient for minimizing delay, but provides little "dilemma zone'' protection for arriving motorists at low-volumes and high-speeds. The research results suggest that the operational results may have been different had other high-speed detection options been considered.

Presently, the efficiency of H 2 production using transition metal-oxide and non-metal oxide photocatalysts via water splitting is quite low. The main issues reported are low light absorption and poor charge separation. The reasons for these two issues are the large band gaps and band edge positions of the present photocatalysts used for H 2 production. To produce H 2 to a larger extent from the decomposition of water, the present photocatalysts have been modified by co-catalysts or dopants using different techniques, including the reduction of the band <b>gap</b> and <b>adjustment</b> of the morphology, band edge positions, crystallinity, surface structure, etc., such that these photocatalysts can absorb sufficient light in the visible-light region. This type of modified nanostructured photocatalysts (both oxide and non-oxide) can enhance the efficiency of H 2 production via absorbing sufficient light in the visible-light region of the solar spectrum and improving the charge separation by suppressing charge recombination. In this regard, we reviewed both UV- and visible-light active nanostructured photocatalysts and modified photocatalysts reported in theoretical studies...|$|R
