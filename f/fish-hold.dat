40|$|The {{fisheries}} {{sector in}} Sri Lanka has been expanding during past decade with growing local demand and export of fish. In order {{to cope with}} the demand, the size of fishing boat used for multi-day, deep-sea fishing has now increased up to 60 ft. There are more than 1700 such boats working around Sri Lanka and building of such boats progress continuously. Most of these designs are based on the extension of small multi-day boats but no attention is paid to the technical feasibility of increasing boat capacity by scaling up the dimension to make the boat bigger. Although there are important factors and views to be discussed with regard to altering a design, such factors are {{beyond the scope of this}} research. In view of the operation of these boats at least 2 - 3 weeks are needed to complete one voyage of fishing. However, the concept of fish preservation still remains conventional by using the ice cold fish hold that was used for small multi day boats. This method offish preservation would have been economical for small boats that carry about 2 - 5 tonne of fish but as the boat size increases, preservation by ice may have following disadvantages. a. Full capacity offish hold cannot be used for storing fish b. High fuel consumption at departure condition to carry considerable amount of ice. c. Impossible to maintain an acceptable temperature inside the <b>fish-hold.</b> d. Duration of fishing and amount of the catch is limited depending on available ice. e. Operating cost of the vessel increases and the quality of fish becomes poor due to the all above factors. Although there are refrigeration systems available in the foreign market, the cost and compatibility of such systems to local requirement are questionable. A system that satisfies required refrigeration capacity for a 40 ft boat costs about 1. 5 million rupees. Intention of this research is to investigate the economical feasibility of designing and construction of suitable refrigeration system to overcome the above problem...|$|E

50|$|The task {{of fishing}} Greenwood is pretty {{straight}} forward {{in comparison to}} similar bodies of water. There is plenty of <b>fish-holding</b> structure present all over the lake. These structures include stump fields, submerged timber, brush piles, rocky reefs and points, coves, steep rocky bluffs, weedy drop-offs, and deep holes; none of which are difficult to locate.|$|R
5000|$|Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (commonly {{known as}} {{freshwater}} white spot disease, freshwater ich, or freshwater ick) {{is a common}} disease of freshwater fish. [...] It {{is caused by the}} protozoan Ichthyopthirius. Ich {{is one of the most}} common and persistent diseases in fish.The protozoan is an ectoparasite. White nodules that look like white grains of salt or sugar of up to 1 mm appear on the body, fins and gills. Each white spot is an encysted parasite. It is easily introduced into a fish pond or home aquarium by new fish or equipment which has been moved from one <b>fish-holding</b> unit to another. When the organism gets into a large fish culture facility, it is difficult to control due to its fast reproductive cycle and its unique life stages. If not controlled, there is a 100% mortality rate of fish. With careful treatment, the disease can be controlled but the cost is high in terms of lost fish, labor, and cost of chemicals.|$|R
40|$|Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus were housed {{individually}} during 7 days in {{a continuous}} flow-trough respirometry system and daily exposed {{to one of three}} treatments: (1) a series of knocks {{on the side of the}} aquarium, (2) a series of photo-flashes and (3) control group. Exposure to photo-flashes did not change locomotor activity but decreased both nighttime and daytime oxygen consumption throughout the experiment. Knocking induced a shortlived increase in locomotor activity and tended to increase oxygen consumption, but this latter effect was not significant. Night-time oxygen consumption was not affected by knocking exposure. Cortisol levels assayed from <b>fish-holding</b> water collected at the end of the experiment were significantly lower in subjects exposed to photo-flashes than in subjects exposed to knocks or controls. Males did not respond differently than females to the treatments in any of the measurements taken. In summary, the data reported here suggest that exposure to repetitive photo-flashes, but not knocking, suppressed normal energy metabolism and cortisol levels. These effects were present hours to a half day after exposure to the flashes...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{investigated the}} androgen responsiveness of males to simulated partner and territory intrusions in five African cichlid species (Neolamprologus pulcher, Lamprologus callipterus, Tropheus moorii, Pseudosimochromis curvifrons, Oreochromis mossambicus; Hirschenhauser et al., 2004). Here we re-analysed data on 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) levels in holding water {{to compare the}} free (presumably from the gills) and conjugated (presumably from urine and faeces) 11 -KT fractions. We sampled (i) pre-test baseline control levels from individual males in social isolation and (ii) response levels released after social interactions, either with an ovulating female or a male territory intruder. In {{four out of five}} species, conjugated metabolites contributed to the observed total 11 -KT responses in water during social context, which was particularly apparent in peak responsive individuals exposed to male intruders. Thus, in water from males sampled in isolation immunoreactive 11 -KT seemed to derive both from gills and urine, whereas the urinary 11 -KT component apparently increased in the social context, particularly when a male was challenged by a same-sex intruder. These results suggest that (i) the social context may affect urine release patterns of males and (ii) 11 - KT data acquired by using <b>fish-holding</b> water may not simply reflect the passive transmission of steroid hormones via the gills...|$|R
40|$|In male birds, the {{responsiveness}} of androgens {{to sexual}} and territorial behaviour {{is predicted to}} vary with mating system {{and the degree of}} paternal investment (‘challenge hypothesis’, CH; Wingfield et al. 1990, American Naturalist, 136, 829 – 846). The CH predicts a higher and longer lasting ‘breeding baseline’ androgen level in males of polygynous species with no or only short-term paternal investment than in males of monogamous species {{with a high degree of}} paternal investment. Since the applicability of the CH to nonavian vertebrates has been unclear, we experimentally tested its predictions in several cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher, Lamprologus callipterus, Tropheus moorii, Pseudosimochromis curvifrons and Oreochromis mossambicus) using a simulated territorial intruder protocol. Androgens (11 -ketotestosterone: 11 -KT; testosterone: T) were measured from <b>fish-holding</b> water. In all species sampled, the 11 -KT patterns confirmed the predictions of the CH originating from the avian literature, but T patterns did not. Males of all species sampled were highly responsive to territorial intrusions; however, the magnitude and duration of this response, that is, the rapid return to baseline 11 -KT levels, could not clearly be explained by the degree of paternal care. 11 -KT responses to interactions with ovulating females were observed in maternal mouthbrooders but not in biparental species (e. g. Lamprologini). At the interspecific level, androgen responsiveness was greater among males of monogamous species, as predicted, but also in species wit...|$|R
40|$|We made a {{comparative}} anatomical study of entobdelline monogenean skin parasites from the blotched fantail ray, Taeniura meyeni (= T. melanospila) from public aquaria and <b>fish-holding</b> facilities distributed widely across the western Pacific Ocean. These facilities {{were located in}} Australia (Mooloolaba, southern Queensland; Cairns, northern Queensland), Taiwan and Japan. The capture localities of the aquarium fishes are unknown to us, {{with the exception of}} the individual fish from northern Queensland which came from Sudbury Reef, a local inshore reef. Entobdellines from southern Queensland differed morphologically from those from northern Queensland and Taiwan and the 2 new monogenean species are described and named Neoentobdella garneri sp. nov. and N. taiwanensis sp. nov., respectively. We determined that an entobdelline collected by Dyer and co-workers from a ray identified as T. melanospila (= T. meyeni) from an aquarium in Okinawa, Japan and identified by them as Entobdella squamula (Heath, 1902) Johnston, 1929 was misidentified and is tentatively assigned to N. taiwanensis sp. nov. The male copulatory organ of each new species resembles a penis, but evidence that these organs are eversible like a cirrus is presented. Caution is advised in deciding whether the male copulatory organs of capsalids may function as a penis or as a cirrus and we suggest that possession of a penis versus a cirrus may not necessarily indicate wide evolutionary divergence. In N. garneri, spermatophores consist of a sausage-shaped capsule and a long hollow stalk. A spermatophore received from a donor is anchored in the vagina by means of the stalk, with the capsule protruding outside the body. Ian D. Whittington and Graham C. Kear...|$|R
40|$|Systemic ciliatosis {{caused by}} histophagous ciliates {{constitutes}} a serious disease of cultured turbot. Six ciliate isolates {{were obtained from}} parasitized turbot during six epizootics at four different farms located in Spain, France and Portugal. Axenic cultures of the six isolates were obtained by periodical subculturing in ATCC 1651 MA or supplemented L- 15 media. In basal media or seawater, the parasites could survive starving for long periods with no apparent proliferation. In adequate media, growth kinetics {{was found to be}} very similar for isolates A and B, with a clear influence of temperature. Morphological studies demonstrated that all isolates share common features that allows their assignment to either Philasterides Kahl, 1931 or Miamiensis Thompson et Moewus, 1964. However, statistically significant differences were evident in pairwise comparisons of the isolates from the four farm sites in 16 taxonomically relevant morphometric features. This could allow the discrimination of different species or strains. Virulence of isolates A and B for healthy turbot was tested in several experiments. Differences in the virulence were especially evident after long-term in vitro culturing, isolate A being clearly attenuated after 35 - 42 passages, whereas isolate B became more virulent after 20 - 42 passages. The need of further studies to confirm such virulence variability and its implications in pathogenesis and prevention of turbot scuticociliatoses is stressed. This study was partly funded by project PTR 1995 - 0604 -OP from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología. Additional support was obtained from Stolt Sea Farm, S. A. and Isidro de la Cal, S. L.
