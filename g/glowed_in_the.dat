5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted {{to look like a}} fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of phosphorus, the first element {{to be discovered}} that was not known since ancient times, is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669, although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time. Brand experimented with urine, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. Working in Hamburg, Brand attempted to create the fabled philosopher's stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine, {{and in the process}} produced a white material that <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark and burned brilliantly. It was named phosphorus mirabilis ("miraculous bearer of light").|$|E
2500|$|Brand's process {{originally}} involved letting urine {{stand for}} days until it {{gave off a}} terrible smell. Then he boiled {{it down to a}} paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, [...] While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about [...] of urine to make about 60g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|Both blacklight and <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark inks {{have been}} used for tattooing. <b>Glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark ink absorbs and retains light, and then <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> darkened {{conditions}} by process of phosphorescence. Blacklight ink does not <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, but reacts to non-visible UV light, producing a visible glow by fluorescence. The resulting glow of both these inks is highly variable.|$|R

60|$|The day {{had been}} brilliantly fine.

Then all at once a dim figure was outlined against the sky only a few paces from him.|$|E
