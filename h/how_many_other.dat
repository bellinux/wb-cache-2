A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E

25|$|Each {{instance}} {{of an object}} that is created stores its name, parameters that are passed to the object creation function, security attributes and a pointer to its object type. The object also contains an object close procedure and a reference count to tell the object manager <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> objects in the system reference that object and thereby determines whether the object can be destroyed when a close request is sent to it. Every named object exists in a hierarchical object namespace.|$|E

25|$|Cockroaches {{are mainly}} nocturnal and will run away {{when exposed to}} light. A study tested the {{hypothesis}} that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented {{so that they would}} be accepted by the real roaches.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, RTÉ debuted its new {{afternoon}} show {{which featured}} {{a mixture of}} daytime chat and children's television. In September the channel aired Live at 3 broadcasting from 15:00 each weekday. This {{was followed by a}} new children's series Dempsey's Den. Live at 3 was presented by Derek Davis and Thelma Mansfield from 1986 to 1997. It included a broad range of topics (healthcare, cookery, DIY, fashion and culture). It was a major departure for the daytime schedule and in an interview with TV Now Derek Davis described <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> European broadcasters were travelling over to Ireland to visit this mix genre daytime TV chat show.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} part of the country, water {{ownership}} is controlled by the appropriative system. This system states that the owner of a piece of land does not automatically own the rights to water found on that land. Rights to water belong to the first user who puts the water to beneficial use. The first people to become appropriators of the water source have the right to continue using the water in the same quantity as always as long as they continue putting the water to good use. This holds true no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> people wish to use the water. The latest water appropriator loses all of their water rights before any water rights are taken from the next latest appropriator. The Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, which had been created by the government in 1888, experienced issues with the appropriative water system when water flow to their reservation was being diverted to settlements of non American Indians.|$|E

Killing other players also rewards characters with a [...] "PvP ranking", permanently shown beside the player's name, which represent <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> human players they have killed. Player versus player combat {{is controlled by the}} percentage of [...] "suppression gas" [...] in the area that dictates whether a player can start combat unprovoked with another player.

Although the game does not feature a ranking system for online matches, matchmaking between players of similar skill levels was introduced. Online also features Spectator Mode, where spectators can place bets on other players to win more gold, and Conquest, in which players can support selected characters by playing as them online, earning rewards if their supported team wins, and earning bonus rewards for going on a win streak.|$|E

In a subsequent interview, the Zone Quality Standards Manager said, [...] "I do not have knowledge of railway engineering nor railway safety", which was completely contrary to the written requirements for the role. In May 1999, the Head of Track had said that insufficiently skilled work was causing more rails to break. Railtrack did not know <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> cases of rail fatigue around the network {{could lead to a}} Hatfield-like accident and consequently imposed over 1,800 emergency speed restrictions and instigated a nationwide (and costly) track replacement programme.

500|$|As {{part of the}} work, an earth mound, or motte, [...] high, was {{piled up}} {{around the base of}} the tower. The {{original}} ground floor of the castle was now an underground cellar, probably used as a puteus, or pit, for detaining low status prisoners and reached by ladder from the first floor. Some infilling of the ground floor occurred in order to equalise the pressure on the walls from the mound. It is uncertain <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> towers or keeps have similar mounds, as excavation is usually required before the foundations can be examined, but Totnes and Farnham castles are known to have mottes build against the walls of the keep. The reason for building the mound is uncertain, but it was almost certainly not designed as a serious defensive feature. It was instead probably intended as to superficially imitate older motte and bailey designs, with the completed castle echoing these former symbols of power and reinforcing the current political status of its owner.|$|E

These intruders are actually other {{players of the}} game; likewise, the player can invade others' houses and steal their money—presented in a list rather than found through exploration—in the same way. This list shows a pre-determined three-name pseudonym of each player, the number of dollars contained in their vault, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> have tried to rob it, and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{have died in the}} process.

2500|$|Heirens {{was given}} an {{institutional}} parole for the Degnan murder in 1965, and in 1966 he was discharged on that case and began serving his second life sentence. Although not freed, parole policies of the day meant that he was considered rehabilitated by prison authorities and that the Degnan case could no longer legally be put forward {{as a reason to}} deny parole. Based on the regulations of 1946, Heirens should have been discharged from the Brown murder in 1975 and from all remaining charges in 1983. However, in 1973 the focus moved from rehabilitation to punishment and deterrence, which blocked moves to release Heirens. In 1983, the Seventh District U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that it was unconstitutional to refuse parole on deterrence grounds to inmates convicted before 1973. Magistrate Gerald Cohn ordered Illinois to release Heirens immediately. The brother and sister of Suzanne Degnan went public, pleading with authorities to fight the ruling. Attorney General Neil Hartigan stated [...] "Only God and Heirens know <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> women he murdered. Now a bleeding-heart do-gooder decides that Heirens is rehabilitated and should go free... I'm {{going to make sure that}} kill-crazed animal stays where he is," [...] a sentiment supported by the media. The Illinois Senate passed a resolution that as the [...] "confessed murderer of Suzanne Degnan, a 6-year-old girl whom he strangled in 1946... that it is the opinion of the chamber that the release of William Heirens at this time would be detrimental to the best interests of the people of the state."

40|$|Entry {{decisions}} in market entry games usually {{depend on the}} belief about <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> are entering the market, the belief about the own rank in a real effort task, and subjects' risk preferences. In this paper I am able to replicate these basic results and examine two further dimensions: (i) the level of strategic sophistication, which has {{a positive impact on}} entry decisions, and (ii) the impact of time pressure, which has a (partly) negative influence on entry rates. Furthermore, when ranks are determined using a real effort task, differences in entry rates are explainable by higher competitiveness of males. Additionally, I show that individual characteristics are more important for the entry decision in more competitive environments...|$|R
