Engineering of memristive nano devices with specific functionalities for the implementation of synaptic operation and their integration into high density parallel network are still two big challenges for the development of neuromorphic hardware. We focus on a particular class of CB-RAM, the atomic switch that is composed by an <b>ionic</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>material,</b> the Ag 2 S, sandwiched between two metal electrodes (Ag and Pt). We characterize the tunable device volatility due to the formation/disruption of silver filaments into the ionic-conductor material under applied bias leading to short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM).

40|$|Oxide {{interfaces}} {{can introduce}} properties {{that are different}} compared to the corresponding crystal bulk properties. The properties can be tuned by changing the structure. It has become clear that these oxide interface systems are potentially suitable for future electronic devices with unique and tailored properties. The fine scale structure of the interfaces affects the properties and enables the control of them provided that a knowledge about the correlation between structure and properties has been established. In this thesis work, the microstructure of oxide interfaces has been correlated to the electrical transport properties mainly by imaging and spectroscopy using transmission electron microscopy. SrTiO 3 (STO) and LaAlO 3 (LAO) are well-studied dielectric materials with wide band gaps of about 3. 2 and 5. 6 eV respectively. A highly conducting layer forms at the interface between thin films of these insulators under certain circumstances. The induced electrical conductivity is proposed {{to be due to}} oxygen vacancies, intermixing and/or a polar discontinuity at the LAO/STO interface. In order to further clarify the mechanisms that occur at the interfaces, details about the atomic structure at interfaces between LAO and (001) STO have been studied by atomic number contrast in HAADF STEM. In addition to the perovskite oxide systems, also the combined fluorite/perovskite heterostructures have attracted interest. There is a need to increase understanding for the electrical transport properties in heterostructures between large misfit structures. These nanostructured systems have already showed potential to be used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) as well as gas sensors. Bulk Yttrium stabilized Zirconium (YSZ) is a widely used <b>ionic</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>material</b> at elevated temperatures in solid electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells.

40|$|Solid-state {{electrolytes}} {{have the}} potential to dramatically improve the safety and longevity of state-of-the-art battery technology by replacing the flammable organic electrolytes currently employed in Li-ion batteries. Recent advances in the development of new thiophosphate electrolytes have reenergized the field by achieving room temperature conductivities exceeding those liquid electrolytes, but a number of practical challenges to their widespread adoption still exist. This thesis applies ab initio computational methods based on density functional theory to investigate the structural origins of high conductivity in <b>ionic</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>materials</b> and provides a thermodynamic explanation of why the integration of these newly developed thiophosphates into high-rate cells has proven difficult in practice, often resulting in high interfacial resistance. As a result of these computational investigations, we report the prediction and synthesis of a new high performance sodium-ion conducting material: NaioSnP 2 S 12, with room temperature ionic conductivity of 0. 4 mS cm- 1, which rivals the conductivity of the best sodium sulfide solid electrolytes to date. We computationally investigate the variants of this compound where Sn is substituted by Ge or Si and find that the latter may achieve even higher conductivity. We then investigate the relationship between anion packing and ionic transport in fast Li-ion conductors, finding that a bcc-like anion framework is desirable for achieving high ionic conductivity, and that this anion arrangement is present in a disproportionately high number of known Li-conducting materials, including Na 10 SnP 2 S 12 and its structural analog Li 10 GeP 2 S 2. Using this bcc anion lattice as a screening criterion, we show that the I 4 material LiZnPS 4 also contains such a framework and has the potential for very high ionic conductivity. While the stoichiometric material has poor ionic conductivity, engineering of its composition to introduce interstitial lithium defects is able to exploit the low migration barrier of the bcc anion structure. Thermodynamic calculations predict a solid-solution regime in this system that extends to x = 0. 5 in Li 1 + 2 xZn-xPS 4, thus it may yield a new <b>ionic</b> <b>conductor</b> with exceptionally high lithium-ion conductivity, potentially exceeding 50 mS cm- 1 at room temperature. Finally, we develop a computational methodology to examine the thermodynamics of formation of resistive interfacial phases through mixing of the electrode and electrolyte. The results of the thermodynamic model of interfacial phase formation are well correlated with experimental observations and battery performance, and predict that thiophosphate electrolytes have especially high reactivity with high voltage oxide cathodes and a narrow electrochemical stability window. We also find that a number of known electrolytes are not inherently stable, but react in situ with the electrode to form passivating but ionically conducting barrier layers. by William D. Richards.

The isotopic fraction of oxygen in a dense sample {{as a function of}} distance from the surface, before and after the second exchange step, could then be used to determine the surface exchange coefficient in each atmosphere.

The high stiffness and electrochemically stability against metallic Li also make oxide-type Li-ion conductors as a perfect Li anode protector when using in Li-S or Li-air batteries. The use of Tantalum-substituted Li 7 -xLa 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZ:Ta) as solid electrolyte for solid-state battery has been reported in several papers. The reported solid-state batteries were all constructed with a thin film cathode which was made either by physical vapor or sol-gel deposition [1 - 2]. In order to realize a Li-ion battery based on an oxide conductor as solid electrolyte, LLZ:Ta powder was synthesized via different synthesis routes including solid-state reaction. LLZ:Ta pellets with optimized sintering parameters exhibit a high Li-ion conductivity of 7. 8 x 10 - 4 S cm- 1 at 30 oC with a relative density of ~ 94 %. The material was further implanted as a solid electrolyte by using screen printing to put on thick LiCoO 2 (> 50 micrometers) as cathode and subsequently tested versus Li metal.

It is also pointed out that the band gap energy and the linear refractive index in superionic conductors are relatively weakly correlated when compared with non-superionic materials. The development of a new field of study that could be called photoionics is suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} {{model was}} proposed to describe relaxations in complex correlated systems of which ionic conducting glass {{is a special}} case. The model is capable of explaining both the structural and the conductivity relaxations of ionic conducting glasses. Recent results from Monte Carlo simulations of ionic motion in glasses are shown to be in total agreement with the predictions of the coupling model. Experimental data from nuclear spin relaxation in poor <b>ionic</b> <b>conductors</b> and quasielastic neutron scattering in fast <b>ionic</b> <b>conductors</b> provide also {{strong support for the}} validity of the coupling model. A correlation between the stretch exponent of conductivity relaxation with the decoupling index proposed by Angel 1 is discussed {{in the light of the}} coupling model.

40|$|Electrode {{polarization}} is {{the main}} drawback when measuring the conductivity on solid <b>ionic</b> <b>conductors.</b> To overcome this inconvenience, a two-terminal pulsed method was used to measure, under strong electrode polarization, the dc conductivity on Na-[beta]-alumina samples. The results agree well with those obtained with impedance spectroscopy. [URL]...|$|R
