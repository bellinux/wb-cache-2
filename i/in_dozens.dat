5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names {{many years ago}} tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E

5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. <b>In</b> <b>dozens</b> of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities in November 1918 the role of the AN in the former German colonies in New Guinea had become primarily one of civil administration, although it continued to provide a garrison for the next two and a half years. The military government continued until 1921 when Australia received a mandate from the League of Nations to govern the territory. Despite the AN having seen no further action {{following the}} initial seizure of the colony, {{in the years that followed}} the climate and a range of tropical diseases, such as malaria, had resulted <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of fatalities before the deployment concluded. Although interrupted by Japanese occupation between 1942–45, Australian administration lasted until 1975 when Papua New Guinea gained its independence.|$|E

Later in the 1950s followed publications in Chile and Portugal, and Spain followed in the 1960s. In the following years, Vandersteen's comics and especially Suske en Wiske were published <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of languages, but in most cases only one or a few albums are translated. More 9 albums were published in the United States, and in Sweden 69 albums were published, accompanied by merchandising. The Finnish series experienced success as well.|$|E

Approximately 13,000 Australian airmen served <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF Bomber Command between 1940 {{and the end of}} the war. Australians took part in all of Bomber Command's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. Australian aircrew in Bomber Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat; 3,486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner. Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|Ahn's co-founding of the Association for Teachers of English in Korea (ATEK), and {{subsequent}} {{development of a}} controversial public information campaign protesting government discrimination against foreign teachers resulted <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of foreign teachers filing formal complaints against the Korean government with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Parties opposing Ahn's work countered with a smear campaign against him, spreading completely fabricated allegations of sex crimes in order to discredit him. After a stint in China he moved to Metro Manila, Philippines, establishing the country's first reputation management consultancy {{and two years later}} establishing the country's first digital public relations agency. Ahn taught a graduate-level course on digital public relations at De La Salle University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject. He also contributes occasional news features to a number of national media outlets and writes literary fiction.|$|E

5|$|As {{it moved}} ashore, Iris damaged houses and schools <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of villages. In 35villages, the storm {{destroyed}} more than 95% of the buildings. Its small size confined the worst damage largely to Toledo and Stann Creek districts, {{which are the}} two southernmost and poorest districts of the country. The percentage of damaged houses was 72% in Toledo district and about 50% in Stann Creek, leaving about 15,000people homeless. In both districts, the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies. In the worst-affected areas, poor Mayan people living on farms lost {{much of what they}} owned. At Placencia near the coast, about 80% of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage, with downed power poles in the streets. About 90% of the houses in nearby Seine Bight were destroyed, and where Iris made landfall, over 90% of the homes were destroyed throughout Monkey River Town. The storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern Belize. Iris also damaged tourism facilities, including minor impact to the Maya ruins of Belize, and damaged 20% of the hotel rooms in the country, accounting for $37million in losses. The remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated {{that there was an}} audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of the}} genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed <b>in</b> <b>dozens</b> of classic films noir.|$|E
