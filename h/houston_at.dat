5|$|As the {{hurricane}} moved inland, {{the city of}} Houston was hit especially hard. Three {{people in the area}} died and several others were injured. Winds blew at up to , catching many off-guard after a previous forecast that deemed the region was safe. Some sections of the city were left without power. The winds destroyed poorly built structures and damaged others, and some streets were flooded. An athletic stadium was demolished by the storm, and glass windows were shattered in downtown stores. A preliminary estimate placed the damage in <b>Houston</b> <b>at</b> $500,000. In the aftermath of the storm, fifteen truckloads of shattered glass were removed.|$|E
5|$|He {{resigned}} the vicarage of Maybole {{through a}} proxy (Patrick de <b>Houston)</b> <b>at</b> the papal court on 16 February 1398, in exchange with Gilbert Adounane {{for the church}} of Kirkcolm in Wigtownshire. Sweetheart Abbey, overlords of Kirkholm parish, dispossessed him briefly of this benefice, but Thomas obtained papal restitution in a papal mandate dated 13 October 1410. He got papal provision on 5 December 1412, to the politically important vicarage of Dundonald in Kyle, but this was unfruitful as the previous vicar turned out still to be alive. Presumably in its place he obtained the vicarage of Abernyte in the diocese of Dunkeld on 30 January 1413, but despite promising annates, failed to obtain possession.|$|E
