Stock options granted with an exercise price below the then current fair market value have intrinsic value equal to the difference between the market price and the strike price. Such backdating may be construed as illegally avoiding <b>income</b> <b>recognition</b> because falsely under-reporting the market price of such stocks makes them appear to have no value in excess of the strike price at the time the option is granted.|$|E

5000|$|In United States {{income tax}} law, an {{installment}} sale is generally a [...] "disposition of property {{where at least}} 1 loan payment is to be received after {{the close of the}} taxable year in which the disposition occurs." [...] The term [...] "installment sale" [...] does not include, however, a [...] "dealer disposition" [...] (as defined in the statute) or, generally, a sale of inventory. [...] The installment method of accounting provides an exception to the general principles of <b>income</b> <b>recognition</b> by allowing a taxpayer to defer the inclusion of income of amounts that are to be received from the disposition of certain types of property until payment in cash or cash equivalents is received. [...] The installment method defers the recognition of income when compared with both the cash and accrual methods of accounting. Under the cash method, the taxpayer would recognize the income when it is received, including the entire sum paid {{in the form of a}} negotiable note. [...] The deferral advantages of the installment method are the most pronounced when comparing to the accrual method, under which a taxpayer must recognize income as soon as he or she has a right to the income.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economics}} of Kalecki was based, more explicitly and systematically {{than that of}} Keynes, {{on the principle of}} the circular flow of income that goes back to the Physiocrat François Quesnay. According to that principle, income is determined by expenditure decisions, not by the exchange of resources (capital or labor). Kalecki and Keynes claimed that in capitalist economy, production and employment levels (economic equilibrium) are determined foremost by the magnitude of investment by business enterprises (the crucial [...] "driver of the business cycle"), not by price and wage flexibility. Savings are determined by investments, not the other way around. Contrary to the Ricardian, Marxian and Neoclassical economics, they asserted that higher wages lead to fuller employment. Kalecki's monetary theory was rooted in the business cycle theory of Knut Wicksell. Quesnay's circular flow of income fell into disrepute in the political economy of the 19th century, when the idea that prices integrate exchange decisions gained ground, but was revived by Joseph Schumpeter, who pointed out the necessity of considering the circular flow of <b>income</b> (<b>recognition</b> of the economic cycle) as an integrating factor in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the total economic process in a given period. The principle was discarded again with the arrival of neoliberal domination in economics and its main current defined by prices of economic equilibrium. Economist Jan Toporowski said that Kalecki's theory of the business cycle remains [...] "the most serious challenge to general equilibrium macroeconomics", which has prevailed since the late 19th century. More than Keynes, Kalecki was skeptical about government's ability to sustain fiscal and monetary stimulus policies or of business support for full employment.|$|E

Nevertheless, post-modern business world embraces International Financial Reporting Standards (IRFS) for reporting for which in contrary is insufficient to cover certain elements of Islamic practice.

Investor firms with passive equity in-vestments recognize investment income when investee dividends ure de-clared, whereas investors with nonpassive equity investments recognize investment income as investee income is earned. To determine whether market participants associate investor income realization with the <b>income</b> <b>recognition</b> events, investor and investee security return correlations are examined around investee dividend and earnings announcements.

Here, we investigate the impact of the incentive motive on the optimal hierarchy using the Auriol-Renault [2000] framework which highlights the role of recognition in the work place. This framework provides a rationale for using promotions as an incentive device which relies on a complementarity between recognition and income: those who earn more should also earn more recognition. We identify factors which affect the hierarchy in terms of number of ranks, population size at each rank and the extent of the differentiation between ranks. We show that the harder it is for an employee to improve performance through effort the more pyramid-like is the hierarchy, {{with a small group of}} successful individuals at the top earning high <b>income</b> and <b>recognition.</b> If a high performance may be easily achieved, a seniority based promotion system may be optimal. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pediatric obesity {{has become}} a global public health problem. Data on the {{lifestyle}} behaviors, dietary habits, and familial factors of overweight and obese children and adolescents are limited. The present study aims to compare health-related factors among normal-weight, overweight, and obese Chinese children and adolescents. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study consisted of 4262 children and adolescents aged 5 – 18 years old from rural areas of the northeast China. Anthropometric measurements and self-reported information on health-related variables, such as physical activities, sleep duration, dietary habits, family <b>income,</b> and <b>recognition</b> of weight status from the views of both children and parents, were collected by trained personnel. Results The prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were 15. 3 and 6. 4 %, respectively. Compared to girls, boys were more commonly overweight (17. 5 % vs. 12. 9 %) and obese (9. 5 % vs. 3. 1 %). Approximately half of the parents with an overweight or obese child reported that they failed to recognize their child’s excess weight status, and 65 % of patients with an overweight child reported {{that they would not}} take measures to decrease their child’s body weight. Obese children and adolescents {{were more likely to be}} nonsnackers [odds ratio (OR) : 1. 348; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 039 – 1. 748] and to have a family income of 2000 CNY or more per month (OR: 1. 442; 95 % CI: 1. 045 – 1. 99) and less likely to sleep longer (≥ 7. 5 h) (OR: 0. 475; 95 % CI: 0. 31 – 0. 728) than the normal-weight participants. Conclusions Our study revealed a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in a large Chinese pediatric population. Differences in sleep duration, snacking, family <b>income,</b> and parental <b>recognition</b> of children’s weight status among participants in different weight categories were observed, which should be considered when planning prevention and treatment programs for pediatric obesity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the policy consequences of expensing stock-based compensation in Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected on listed firms from 2006 to 2008 and a goodness-of-fit of accounting earnings valuation model was used to investigate the incremental information content of expensing stock-based compensation. In addition, two sensitivity indexes were used to investigate the sensitivity between compensation and firm performance before and after <b>income</b> statement <b>recognition</b> of stock-based compensation. Findings – It was found that the association between earnings and abnormal returns is stronger after expensing compensation. In addition, the relationship between compensation variables, especially stock compensation, and firm performance is stronger after 2008, indicating that expensing compensation reinforces the relationship between compensation and performance. Practical implications – The findings suggest that disclosure and recognition are not substitutes. The findings also have implications for standard setters and for investors attempting to mitigate managers' self-interested behavior. Originality/value – The accounting treatment of employee stock-based compensation is a controversial issue among academics, regulators, managers, auditors, and investors.

The first {{is an appropriate}} definition of profit; this is addressed through an economic-value accounting method which minimizes distortions due to the timing of <b>income</b> <b>recognition.</b> Return on equity is the basic profitability gauge used to compare results between profit centers. The second problem is that, in comparing results between branches, different levels of risk will produce an uneven chance of error in measuring true performance vs. reported results.

To develop the internal reinsurance concept, a Poisson claim frequency and a Pareto claim severity model is constructed. Finally, in order to recognize the credibility of each profit center's actual experience, a canpromise is made to the equal-variance prin-ciple. The analysis concludes that branch office profit measurement is best served when the branch network has minimal variation in size and product mix...|$|E
