40|$|In {{addition}} to foraging individually {{several species of}} ants guide nestmates to a goal by tandem running. We found that the Australian ant, Camponotus consobrinus, forages both individually and by tandem running {{to head to the}} same goal, nest-specific native Australian trees on which they forage. While paths of solitary foragers and initial paths of tandem followers showed no differences in heading directions or straightness, tandem followers moved at about half the speed of solitary runs. When leaders were experimentally removed, follower ants initially engaged in a systematic search around the point of interruption, following which they either (a) headed directly towards and successfully reached the <b>foraging</b> <b>trees,</b> or (b) continued searching or (c) returned to the nest.

After a uniform cut at the end of January 1990 (mid-dry season), the trees were cut according to the following cutting regimes; one cut after a 12 -month regrowth (12 M); two cuts after three - and nine-month regrowth (9 - 3 M); three cuts, two cuts every three months and the third cut after a six-month regrowth (3 - 3 - 6 M), and four cuts every three months (3 - 3 - 3 - 3 M).

The aim of this study was to evaluate soil carbon stocks and changes after the clearing of the native forest, the establishment of pastures and the reclamation of the degraded pasture, in Caquetá, Colombia. We compared the contents of Total C, Oxidizable C and Non-Oxidizable (stable) C in four different land use systems, namely Monoculture (Brachiaria grassland), Association (Brachiaria + Arachis pintoi), Forage Bank (a mixture of <b>forage</b> <b>tree</b> species), and Natural Regeneration of the pasture in both a flat area and a sloping one. The Degraded Pasture was the reference. Results showed that in the sloping area all treatments have higher Total Carbon stocks than the Degraded Pasture, while three of the treatments significantly increased the stocks of Non-Oxidizable C. In the flat landscape, only the Association significantly increased Total C stocks. Plowing and fertilization cause significant increases in Oxidizable carbon and decreases in Non-Oxidizable carbon. This effect needs further research, as C stability will influence equilibrium stocks. In the sloping area, improved pastures and fodder bank rapidly increased Total Carbon contents and stocks, with increases as large as 10 ton. ha- 1 yr- 1. In the Traditional Fodder Bank, which showed the largest increase, this is partially due to the application of organic manure. Surprisingly, also C stocks under Natural Regeneration were significantly higher than under the original Degraded Grassland. This increase was fully due to Non-Oxidizable Carbon, which is difficult to explain. Stable isotope analysis indicated that under improved grassland, especially Brachiaria monoculture, up to 40 % of the original C in the upper 10 cm was replaced in 3. 3 years...|$|E

40|$|Trees with high-protein Ieaves {{are proving}} to be a {{valuable}} and practical feed resource for cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs in several Caribbean countries. In many instances one or more of a range of nitrogen-fixing species are grown to complement high energy diets based on chopped sugar cane or cane Juice. The trees and the cane have been shown to provide locally available, economical balanced rations for ruminants and pigs, and to offer ecological benefits: both crops can remain in the ground for long periods, being ratooned and coppiced respectively and do not require much, if any, disturbance of the soil. The soil conservation benefit is enhanced by the deep-rooting trees drawing nutrients and moisture from previously untapped soil profiles. in Jamaica, the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Developrnent Institute (CARDI) has demonstrated several alternative ways of utilising leucaena and gliricidia for supplementary cattle at pasture. Foliage can be stall-fed or lopped straight on to the ground in pasture where the branches are picked dean. This is particularly useful as a dry season protein reserve. Alternatively, branches may be cut and stacked to dry on a suitable surface for two or three days. The leaves drop off and be swept up to provide a leaf protein concentrate which can be stored for future use. The leaf contains 25 % crude protein, which can be mixed with cereals; a normal dairy ration contains 16 % crude protein. The system is very simple and can be done on a lugs or small scale. One smallholder dairy farmer in Jamaica is growing leucaena and making leaf protein concentrate entirely by hand. Others are mechanizing the process. In Trinidad, the Sugar Feed Centre (SFC) has developed feeding systems where leaf protein from coppiced Leuceaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium supplements chopped cane fed to growing calves and dairy animals. In Colombia, however, the preferred tree species is Trichantera gigantea, known locally as Nacedero, a <b>forage</b> <b>tree</b> of this Acathaceae family originating in the Andes. It can grow at elevations of up to 2500 metres. The leaves are highly digestible and contain a low level of non-nutritional factors, with the result that they are readily acceptable to pigs. T. gigantea has a large leaf area, rapid regrowth and 16 - 20 % crude protein. At 10, 000 trees/ha the yield is 40 - 50 tonnes of fresh matter/ha. Dr T R Preston and a team at CIPAV in Colombia have developed a system for feeding pigs and hair sheep on sugar cane for energy end T. gigantea leaf for protein (See Spore 31 page 12). The trees can be harvested for the first time eight months after planting and are then chopped every three months. This system is claimed to yield 3000 kg of meat/ha/year.

In recent years he has managed agricultural research and development projects in the Caribbean for several international and regional organizations. He is currently the Deputy Executive Director (Development) of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). Livestock development contributes to national agricultural output, so saving foreign exchange on imports, and {{can be a powerful}} stimulus to change among small and subsistence farmers. Small-scale dairying {{has been shown to be}} a harbinger of new disciplines and management practices that can be applied with great benefit in other agricultural enterprises. Agriculture in the Caribbean, in common with most ACP countries, is based mainly on crops rather than livestock. In the recent past, export crops have been predominant in terms of national priority and farmer prestige. Except in a few countries, livestock have been relegated to marginal lands and they have been farmed mostly in traditional ways to produce meat, hides and a little milk. Only in rare instances have they received supplementary feeding and other improved management techniques, such as pest and disease control on a sustained basis. Nor has livestock performance been recorded so as to permit more selective breeding and more advantageous feeding. Yet, in the Caribbean certainly, and possibly in many countries in Africa and the Pacific, the potential for improving livestock output is substantial and, with the improvement of livestock, comes the potential for the improvement of under-developed agriculture in general. As a result of the Caribbean region's specialization in export crops such as sugar, bananas, cotton, cocoa, coconut and spices, food self-sufficiency has suffered and costs of imported foods have risen. Livestock products, and feeds for livestock, now account for 53 % of the total food import bill. These imports include meat, and the full range of dairy products: liquid milk, butter and cheese. Grains and soya beans are also imported at considerable cost to feed the relatively modest livestock sector that does exist. Only recently have we begun to realise that the Caribbean is quite capable of growing excellent pasture grasses and legumes and in addition has available a range of suitable animal feed from byproducts of our traditional export crops and their associated industries. Also, the Caribbean has long had its own breeds of cattle and sheep adapted to the region and with a proven track record as milk and meat producers: the Jamaica Hope and Jamaica Red cattle, the Barbados Blackbelly sheep and the Buffalypso, a beef strain of water buffalo developed in Trinidad. Resource-poor farmers wisely avoid overdependence on any single farm enterprise and so initially livestock are required for more than one purpose: and in the case of cattle, for meat and milk. But it is milk production which may have the most interesting potential. Dairying is a challenge in that it requires high standards of management to breed and feed animals in order to achieve regular and sustained production of a sufficient quantity and quality of milk. Dairying also demands development of a collection, processing and distribution infrastructure if it is to go beyond the level- of localized self-sufficiency. But if these twin challenges (on and off the farm) are met, the benefits permeate other sectors of agricultural production, processing and distribution. Experience in Western Europe and in North America showed that the development of milk production for urban centres provided the financial, technical and management catalyst to farming in general. The most immediate benefit of milk production is the regular income it provides virtually all-year-round. To produce milk of saleable quality, disciplines of regular milking and hygiene must be practiced. Records must be kept to itemize milk sold and to identify high-yielding animals that need supplementary feeding and whose female calves should be retained for breeding. To be productive, pastures need year-round management including timely grazing, cutting for conservation and fertilizing. Since milk should be produced throughout the year, cows must be mated so that calving and lactations are spread. The farmer who is introduced to these disciplines will surely also apply them to his or her other farm enterprises. CARDI has identified three main problems that must be addressed if the Caribbean States are to achieve their potential in livestock production: the improvement of management of all classes of livestock, including control of parasites; the upgrading of livestock, particularly sheep and goats, by crossing with improved breeds; and the development of our pasture grasses, legumes and <b>forage</b> <b>tree</b> species to substitute for imported feedstuffs. A new generation of young people is entering agriculture in the Caribbean. They are open to new ideas and will respond to farming systems that offer the stimulus of more technical inputs in place of the drudgery of past agricultural practices. Where governments have provided the right incentives by managing imports and encouraging infrastructure, the signs are that our farmers are interested in developing livestock, particularly dairying, as part of their farm production and that, as a result, the entire farm output will benefit.

40|$|Floyd Neckles, a Grenadian, is a {{livestock}} feed and farm management specialist {{and has been}} a consultant with regional and international agencies in the Caribbean. Since 1981 he has been Project Director of the Sugarcane Feeds Centre in Trinidad. 'Modern', developed agriculture reflects modern life in its high consumption of energy and natural resources. Waste products are produced that are at best an embarrassment or nuisance and at worst serious pollutants. Such systems of production are not sustainable in the long-term and it is possible to develop integrated systems where local inputs are optimized and recycled, with a reduction in external inputs. Soil, sun and water are the raw materials for agriculture and in most ACP countries they are abundant. In warmer, wetter regions the sugar-cane plant, a forage grass and fast-growing leguminous tree species can thrive together. The demand for cane sugar has declined dramatically in recent years and much cane land has gone out of production. Alternative crops have been successfully introduced in some countries but too often sugarcane cultivation has been replaced literally by nothing and agriculture has declined. Yet sugar-cane is a C 4 photosynthetic plant, one of the most efficient at converting the sun's energy into metabotisable carbohydrate, and there are more potential uses for sugarcane than processing into sugar for direct human consumption. The Sugarcane Feeds Centre (SFC) in Trinidad is an institution of applied research, development, demonstration and training whose objective is to investigate these uses in relation to animal production. Our facilities are on 60 hectares of poor quality, non-agricultural acid utisol land at Longdenville in central Trinidad, where we have got a fairly wide programme of alternative uses for our sugarcane. We experiment with, and demonstrate, feeding under an intensive management system using available products and byproducts of agriculture and industry. Some twelve different projects run concurrently at SFC. These include aquaculture, a small dairy herd and heifer replacement rearing unit, beef feedlot, sheep and goats, pigs, ducks, rabbits, an abattoir used semi-commercially and for training, and an offal processing facility, the energy for which is supplied by a small biogas plant. Crops grown are sugarcane, elephant grass (Pennisetum) and two <b>forage</b> <b>tree</b> species, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangum. Fresh whole cane yields in excess of 80 tonnes per hectare per year have been obtained when animal manure is recycled. Four or five cuttings of leucaena per year yields 15 - 20 tonnes fresh matter per hectare. Obviously few, if any, farmers would contemplate operating so many enterprises on a commercial scale. However, the system can be related to 'traditional', integrated farming of an earlier generation. 'Modern' agriculture, even in the tropics, has moved into specialization and monoculture (even of animals!). We envisage farmers typically choosing one or more additional enterprises to complement their present activity. For example, a broiler producer may have land not devoted to housing or other activities. He can grow not only crops of various kinds, but can also rear sheep, goats and/or cattle, using broiler litter as the basis of the feeding system, perhaps ending up with three, four or five integrated enterprises. What we highlight to visitors is that they may have more options open to them and that there are techniques for utilizing land intensively, yet on a sustainable basis. It is possible to reduce external inputs to a minimum and yet produce good quality milk, meat and fish for use or additional income. We also face the problem in Trinidad and Tobago, as do many ACP countries, that by-products which were dumped or given away by processors are offered to live-stock producers at high prices as soon as farmers begin to use them. Transportation costs have also been rising, which reinforces the need for as much input as possible to be farm-produced. There are two other important factors. The systems of animal production that were introduced {{in the early decades of}} agricultural modernization have tended to promote the use of imported feeds. Secondly, local production often has to compete with imports from developed agricultural countries that are produced and exported with high government subsidies. My interpretation of unfolding events is that the day will come, and it is not too far away, when these high subsidies will be removed. Increasing concern for the damaged environment will also result in less excess 'cheap' food being either available or cheap. We are then going to find it was a mistake for our farmers to depend on getting their animal feed needs from abroad. Even worse, as nations we would have failed to pursue the option of producing more of our basic food needs by working more consciously to develop our agricultural potential. With generally weakening currencies and difficulty in maintaining prices of our exports of any type, we will find it increasingly difficult to pay for imports. When that happens, I believe that farmers, consumers and governments will look increasingly to the integrated low-input, recycling systems such as those we demonstrate. We know we have the land resource and the people, we know we have the sun, soil, rain and water. We have the crops and, increasingly, the knowledge and ability to use them. We must set about doing more with our agricultural resources guided by policies that are forward looking. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA.

50|$|The chestnut-headed oropendola inhabits forest canopy, {{edges and}} old plantations. It is a quite common bird {{in parts of}} its range, seen in small flocks <b>foraging</b> in <b>trees</b> for large insects, fruit and berries.|$|R
50|$|These birds <b>forage</b> in <b>trees</b> and bushes, {{sometimes}} on the ground. They mainly eat seeds, berries, and insects. Outside of the nesting season they often feed in flocks. Sometimes, they will swallow fine gravel.|$|R
50|$|The olivaceous woodcreeper is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} bird of forests and other woodlands. It feeds on insects and spiders. It normally <b>forages</b> on <b>tree</b> trunks or large branches or on the ground, usually singly.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of foraging ants on the insect fauna within {{the canopy of}} the tree species Terminalia sericea, Burkea africana and Ochna pulchra was studied {{in an area of}} typical South African savanna, over a two year period. The number of individual insects and their species composition was compared on unbanded, ant-infested plants and on banded plants where ants had been excluded. Differences in the level of herbivory recorded on banded and unbanded trees were related to the guild composition of insects within the canopy, and the results are discussed in terms of plant protection as a consequence of ant - insect interactions. Twenty-six ant species were recorded on the study trees at Nylsvley, with individuals belonging to the genus Crematogaster being numerically abundant and dominant within the canopy of each species of tree. These dominant ant species influenced the insect fauna by their strong dependence on honeydew, encouraging a build up in numbers of Homoptera on the branches and leaves of <b>foraged</b> <b>trees,</b> and supporting homopterous populations within the confines of their nest compartments. The exclusion of ants from trees led to fewer "mobile" homopterans (Aphididae, Membracidae, Psyllidae and Cicadellidae) and "sessile" homopterans (mainly Coccidae but also Pseudococcidae). Pyrethrum spraying showed that the guild composition of non-homopterous insects was similar on banded and unbanded trees. Differences in the level of herbivory on banded and unbanded trees suggested that, although slight, <b>foraged</b> <b>trees</b> were protected from some damage by the presence of ant species within the canopy. A trend did exist towards a greater number of insect individuals and species on unbanded trees, and it is postulated that during the period 1982 1984 when drought conditions prevailed over Nylsvley, ants do not reduce insect numbers through predation or disturbance but simply deter phyllophagous feeding. A separate experiment showed that Crematogaster constructor would feed on the eggs and early instar larvae of the saturnid moth, Cirina forda, but low numbers of lepidopterous larvae on the trees may have forced ants to seek honeydew. The negative impact of large homopterous populations on <b>foraged</b> <b>trees</b> was only seen in an isolated field observation where Polyrachis schistacea was found to associate with the lac insect Tachardina sp.. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} where homopterans are not the dominant phyllophages, plants do benefit from foraging populations of ants in that damage to the leaves is reduced...|$|R

50|$|Black-tailed gnatcatchers live {{in pairs}} all year, {{defending}} their territory and <b>foraging</b> in <b>trees</b> and low shrubs {{for a wide}} variety of small insects and some spiders. Unlike the blue-gray gnatcatcher, the black-tailed variety rarely catches insects in midair.|$|R
50|$|This bird <b>forages</b> high in <b>trees,</b> {{sometimes}} in the undergrowth. They mainly eat insects and berries.|$|R
25|$|Golden mice are {{granivorous}} and eat mostly seeds. They <b>forage</b> among <b>trees</b> for buds, berries, seeds, fruits, leaves, {{and some}} insects. It prefers sumac seeds and honeysuckle. They also consume berries from plants like dogwood, greenbrier, blackberry and wild cherry.|$|R
