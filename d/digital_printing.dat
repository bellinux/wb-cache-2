5|$|In 1999, he {{launched}} Injet, an advertising and <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> company that quickly grew in prominence with its expansion of billboard advertising throughout the capital. The business {{was the first}} to make <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> technology available on the island. Local magazine Echo Australe, which named then-mayor of Antananarivo Marc Ravalomanana their Entrepreneur of the Year in 1999, bestowed the same honor on Rajoelina in 2000. Following Rajoelina's marriage in 2000, his wife's wealthy parents invested in Injet and allowed Rajoelina in 2001 to acquire Domapub, a competing Antananarivo-based billboard advertising business that they owned. The couple worked together to manage the family businesses, with Rajoelina responsible for Injet and his wife handling the affairs of Domapub. A competition organized by French bank BNI Crédit Lyonnais awarded first prize for best young entrepreneur in Madagascar to Rajoelina in 2003.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{collaborative}} production {{of fine art}} <b>digital</b> <b>prints</b> for artists,a process which is used by many contemporary practitioners including Richard Hamilton and Damien Hirst. <b>Digital</b> <b>print</b> as a fine art process has emerged over the last twenty years, and as yet, there is no in depth evidence on the collaborative endeavour and production process which {{is central to the}} digital Master Printer’s role. The investigation first establishes the historical context and significance of the Master and Printer in traditional printmaking, and the more recent development of the <b>digital</b> <b>print</b> studio and the <b>digital</b> <b>print</b> pioneers of the 1990 s. A series of seven artists’ case studies {{in the context of the}} collaborative <b>digital</b> <b>print</b> studio are then offered to demonstrate the working process. The analysis of these proposes a best practice model for Master Printers working with contemporary artists to produce high quality, fine art, wide format inkjet <b>digital</b> <b>prints.</b> The study also compares production methods at the cutting-edge digital facility of the Rijksakademie in The Netherlands, to assess the validity of the practices proposed through a facility closest to the study’s research base at the CFPR’s digital studio. The comparative study also explored the expanding digital production process and the role of the Master Printer. Evolving production processes are also considered in this study as a response to the advancement of <b>digital</b> <b>print</b> technology alongside a practical exploration of what actually constitutes a <b>digital</b> <b>print</b> in this rapidly expanding field of fine art printmaking. This study aims to reveal the inner workings of the digital collaborative process between the artist and Master Printer, and appraise the digital Master Printer’s role. It offers a set of best practice methods for the digital Master Printer developed from this research. The study also considers how the <b>digital</b> <b>print,</b> and the <b>digital</b> <b>print</b> studio may evolve in line with current and future developments in new technologies.

25|$|Professional <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> (using toner) {{primarily}} uses {{an electrical}} charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto {{which it is}} printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.|$|E

25|$|Frescography is {{a method}} for reproduction/creation of murals using <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> methods, invented in 1998 by Rainer Maria Latzke, and {{patented}} in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a database. CAM software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with low resolution motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural. Once a design is finished, the low resolution motifs are converted into the original high resolution images and are printed on canvas by Wide-format printers. The canvas then {{can be applied to}} the wall in a wall-paperhanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.|$|E
25|$|Although Wang's Nong Shu {{was mostly}} printed {{by use of}} woodblock printing, his {{innovation}} of wooden movable type soon became popularly used {{in the region of}} Anhui. Wang's wooden movable type was used to print the local gazetteer paper of Jingde City, which incorporated the use of 60,000 written characters organized on revolving tables. During the year of 1298, roughly one hundred copies of this were printed by wooden movable type in a month's time. Following in the footsteps of Wang, in 1322 the magistrate of Fenghua, Zhejiang province, named Ma Chengde, printed Confucian classics with movable type of 100,000 written characters on needed revolving tables. The process of metal movable type was also developed in Joseon Korea by the 13th century, while metal movable type was not pioneered in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) printer Hua Sui used bronze movable type in 1490. Although metal movable type became available in China during the Ming period, wooden movable type persisted in common use even until the 19th century. After that point, the European printing press machine first pioneered by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century became the mainstay and standard in China {{and for the most part}} the global community until the advent of <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> and the modern computer printer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>prints</b> {{refers to}} images <b>printed</b> using a <b>digital</b> printer {{instead of a}} {{traditional}} printing press. These images can be printed {{to a variety of}} substrates including paper, cloth, or plastic canvas. Accurate color reproduction and the type of ink used (see below) are key to distinguishing high quality from low quality <b>digital</b> <b>prints.</b> Metallics (silvers, golds) are particularly difficult to reproduce accurately because they reflect light back to digital scanners. High quality <b>digital</b> <b>prints</b> typically are reproduced with very high-resolution data files with very high-precision printers. The substrate used has an effect on the final colors and cannot be ignored when selecting a color palette.|$|R

2500|$|Israeli hi-tech firms {{originally}} {{began to}} form in the 1960s. In 1961 ECI Telecom was founded, followed in 1962 by Tadiran and Elron Electronic Industries regarded {{by many to be}} the [...] "Fairchild of Israel." [...] The number of internationally successful firms grew slowly, with only one or two new successful firms each year until the early 1990s. Motorola was the first US corporation to set up an R unit in Israel, in 1964. The center initially developed wireless products including remote irrigation systems and later developed leading chips such as the 68030. Following the 1967 French arms embargo, Israel was forced to develop a domestic military industry, focusing on developing a technological edge over its neighbors. Some of these military firms started to seek and develop civilian applications of military technology. In the 1970s more commercial innovations began, many of which were based on military R, including: Scitex <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> systems, which were based on fast rotation drums from fast-rotation electronic warfare systems, and Elscint, which developed innovative medical imaging and became a leading force in its market.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, the {{registration}} number is embossed – or, more rarely, impressed – onto the license plate. Other identifying information, such as {{the name of the}} issuing jurisdiction and the vehicle class, can be either surface-printed or embossed; Virginia, for example, does the former for passenger cars and the latter for most non-passenger vehicles. [...] However, it is increasingly common in the U.S. for {{the registration}} number to be surface-printed using <b>digital</b> <b>printing</b> technology. [...] Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington do so only for certain types of license plates, such as vanity plates and special issues; Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia have switched to the so-called [...] "flat plate" [...] technology for all their license plates. Nevada formerly issued flat plates but has returned to making embossed plates. Delaware license plates have not been embossed for several decades. Wyoming normally issues flat plates but also issues embossed license plates for an extra fee.|$|E
