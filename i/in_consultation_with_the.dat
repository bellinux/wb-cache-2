5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States and the United Kingdom, {{decided that it was}} necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E
5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chief Justice of India and {{the governor of the}} state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian order of precedence. The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, whichever is higher.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E

Fifthly, the commitment to building a Partnership which would be tailored to the different needs of individual Partners was reaffirmed. In this respect, NATO's intention to place a special focus on relations with {{the states of the}} Caucasus and Central Asia was welcomed, including the decision by the Alliance to appoint one liaison officer for each region. They also welcomed the launching of the Individual Partnership Action Plan process by several states of these two regions. Sixthly, NATO's Policy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, which was developed <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> EAPC partners, was endorsed.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{consists}} of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and not less than 10 nor more than 25 other members as the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts may {{from time to time}} determine. The members of the Board are appointed by the Minister, and hold office for such term as the Minister may determine unless they resign during their term of office or their appointment is revoked by the Minister. The Minister is not required to provide any reason for revoking the appointment of a board member. The Minister may, <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Board or otherwise, give the Board directions as he thinks fit that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act concerning the exercise and performance by the Board of its functions, and the Board is required to give effect to such directions.|$|E

Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention.

5|$|When a {{squadron}} wishes {{to create a}} cadet band, the decision to do so must be made <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sponsoring committee responsible for provision and maintenance of musical instruments. The cadet music program recognizes two types of bands: military bands and pipe bands. Military bands' instrumentation includes woodwinds, brass, and/or percussion, while pipe bands' instrumentation includes pipes and drums. The Regional Support Cadet Unit should provide instruments on loan to their squadrons to maximize {{the use of the}} instruments held by the region and CSTCs and to better support squadron training. The music proficiency levels are recognized on the cadet uniform using a system of badges based on the music training programs; the military band badge represents a lyre, while the pipe band badge represents either a pipe or a drum, depending on the instrument played.|$|E
5|$|In 1531, Renjun, {{a son of}} Rennyo, emerged victorious in the Kaga {{civil war}} and {{established}} a much tighter Hongan-ji hegemony over the province. The leaders of the opposition, including Togashi Taneyasu, where expelled from Kaga, though those who supported them were allowed to return. Without any central governing body, Kaga was consumed by political instability. The Asakura clan {{to the south and}} Uesugi to the north posed threats of invasion for Kaga, so the ji-samurai established a centralized authority at the Kanazawa Midō in Oyama Gobo. The Midō oversaw four district organizations of hatamoto – prominent local warlords. Each hatamoto commanded a group, kumi, of which there were roughly twenty in total. These kumi in turn ruled over regional groups of local warriors, priests, and the heads of village communes. The highest political organization of the ikki in Kaga was a committee of hatamoto, and the only permanent political body were the twenty kumi. Important matters would be settled at the meetings of the local hatamoto <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local Hongan-ji priests. However, these meetings were sporadic and held at the county, rather than provincial, level, and thus, according to Davis, would probably rarely have involved more than five hatamoto and one or two Hongan-ji priests. Kumi meetings were probably similar, with the exception that a hatamoto present at a kumi meeting would have held great respect.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{criticism}} of the design, its height and the proposed location, both from local councillors (of all parties) and from people in the local community. Planning permission was denied in April 2005, but the Beetham Organization lodged an appeal and a public inquiry was held in November 2006. Ruth Kelly, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, was responsible for deciding whether to overrule the council's decision and approve the tower. A final decision on the site was initially expected in February 2007, but the inquiry eventually continued until 17 May 2007, when the decision to refuse planning permission was upheld. As well as agreeing with the council's original argument that the tower would not fit into the local area and would have a harmful effect on surrounding conservation areas (such as the North Laine and St Bartholomew's Church), Kelly stated that the proposal would give insufficient benefit in terms of regeneration of the area, and did not offer enough outdoor leisure and recreation space. The future of the Block J site is undecided {{as a result of}} this; however, within four days of the decision, the Beetham Organization announced that it intended to submit plans for an alternative scheme, which it would develop <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> city council.|$|E

5|$|The International Bowl had {{contracts}} with the Big East and Mid-American Conferences {{that allowed them to}} select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl learned {{that they would not be}} allowed to select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December7,2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.|$|E

50|$|Since Goa was an {{acquired}} territory, {{it was not}} given immediate statehood but was incorporated as a Union Territory, expectedly for a decade. Unlike other Union Territories, which were directly administered by the central government in New Delhi, Goa {{was not allowed to}} have its own state legislature but elections were conducted though Goa did not belong to India. It was only after the Luso-Indo treaty that Goa became a part of India. That too the treaty was not <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Goans, the indigenous people.
