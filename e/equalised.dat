5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and two minutes later they <b>equalised</b> with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United <b>equalised,</b> Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May, Juventus hosted reigning champions Real Madrid at Juventus Stadium. Morata {{opened the}} scoring against his former team, and Cristiano Ronaldo <b>equalised</b> before half time. Tevez scored the winning goal from the penalty spot {{after he was}} fouled by Dani Carvajal. Eight days later, the two teams drew at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium: Ronaldo scored a penalty after Giorgio Chiellini fouled James Rodríguez, but {{in the second half}} Morata <b>equalised.</b> Juventus {{advanced}} to the final 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|United {{were denied}} victory by Bayern Munich twice, home and away. In Munich, the home side <b>equalised</b> with {{two minutes to}} go with United leading 2–1, after Schmeichel uncharacteristically went for and missed Bixente Lizarazu's throw-in, {{allowing}} Giovane Élber to tap in from a few yards out and score his second of the match. The return leg ended in a stalemate; Roy Keane scored just before half-time via a low header before Hasan Salihamidžić <b>equalised</b> for the visitors.|$|E
50|$|An <b>equalising</b> beam, <b>equalising</b> lever or <b>equalising</b> bar (Ausgleichshebel or Ausgleichhebel) {{links the}} {{suspension}} {{of two or more}} adjacent axles of a vehicle with more than two axles, especially railway locomotives. Its job is to provide 'compensated' springing, i.e. to ensure an even and statically determinate distribution of load to all the axles on uneven terrain or poorly laid track. The function of an <b>equalising</b> lever thus corresponds roughly to that of axle compensators or rockers (Achswippen).|$|R
50|$|It is {{relatively}} easy for Black to <b>equalise</b> in this opening, for example, 2...Nf6, 2...Nc6, and 2...d5 all <b>equalise,</b> although Black should be careful to avoid being caught by surprise by an eventual f2-f4.|$|R

5|$|A 2–1 away {{victory over}} Weymouth saw York secure {{survival}} from relegation, with their opponents facing relegation as a result. Brodie gave York a 14th-minute lead, and after Cliff Akurang <b>equalised</b> for Weymouth {{late in the}} first half, Boyes scored the winning goal 13 minutes from time. York's last league match was a 1–1 away draw with bottom placed Lewes, Greaves scoring on 80 minutes before the home team <b>equalised</b> three minutes from time. This result saw them finish the season 17th the table. York were defeated 2–0 by Stevenage in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley, who scored with second-half goals from Steve Morison and Lee Boylan.|$|E
5|$|A league {{finish of}} fifth in 1977–78 proved {{sufficient}} {{to qualify for}} Europe. Dutchmen FC Twente were the first opposition. In Enschede, Dave Watson gave City the lead. Twente <b>equalised</b> {{in the second half}} from a free kick.|$|E
5|$|Mike Summerbee {{opened the}} scoring on 13 minutes, but Newcastle soon <b>equalised.</b> Neil Young made it 2–1, but again Newcastle <b>equalised.</b> A second strike by Young was {{disallowed}} for offside, and at half-time {{the score was}} 2–2. Straight after half-time Young scored again, and Francis Lee scored a fourth on 63 minutes. A late Newcastle goal set up a nervy finish, but City held on to win 4–3 and secure the title. The win was compounded by a 2–1 victory by Sunderland over Manchester United, giving City the title. Liverpool won one of their remaining games but lost the other, missing their chance to leapfrog United into second by one point.|$|E

His second goal came in similar {{circumstances}} in a UEFA Cup match in March 2007, against CA Osasuna, scoring to <b>equalise</b> in injury time.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} consisted of <b>equalising</b> beams with coil springs; the <b>equalising</b> beams were {{located within the}} bogie 'sandwich type' side frame, whilst the secondary suspension utilised a two bolsters per bogie incorporating four transverse leaf springs. The locomotive weight was carried on four sliding elements on the bolster, with a center pivot used to transfer tractive forces.|$|R
5|$|Porto {{were unable}} to hold onto their lead for long; two minutes after the restart, Celtic <b>equalised</b> when Henrik Larsson met Didier Agathe's cross to send a looping header in over Porto's goalkeeper Vítor Baía to get his tenth goal of the tournament and his 200th Celtic goal. However, within five minutes, it was 2–1 to Porto when Deco's through ball found Dmitri Alenichev, who scored with a low shot. Just three minutes later, Celtic <b>equalised</b> once again through Henrik Larsson when he headed in Alan Thompson's corner. After this, the game stagnated {{until a couple of}} minutes {{from the end of the}} game when Jackie McNamara's errant pass found Alenichev, who shot over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|The first final of the UEFA European Football Championship (then {{referred}} to as the European Nations' Cup Final) was contested in July 1960 in Paris between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Milan Galić scored for Yugoslavia just before half-time but Slava Metreveli <b>equalised</b> soon after the break, and the scores remained level, sending the game into extra time. With seven minutes left, Viktor Ponedelnik won the match for the Soviet Union, scoring the winner with a header. The 1960 champions qualified for the final of the 1964 tournament, where they faced hosts Spain. Jesús María Pereda scored early for the home side, but the match was levelled two minutes later when Galimzyan Khusainov <b>equalised.</b> Nearly 80,000 spectators at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid had to wait for the winner which came six minutes from time, courtesy of a header from Spaniard Marcelino.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 71,140, West Ham {{took the lead in}} the first half when Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher scored an own goal, and striker Dean Ashton scored a few minutes later to make it 2–0 to West Ham. Liverpool scored, {{courtesy}} of Djibril Cissé, to make the score 2–1 at half time. They <b>equalised</b> not long after the restart via a Steven Gerrard goal.

Wenger made six changes to the team which started at Southampton in the league, {{including}} Cole replacing Clichy at left-back after serving his three-match suspension. After eight minutes, Leeds went ahead when Lehmann's goal clearance hit striker Mark Viduka and rebounded into the net. Arsenal <b>equalised</b> through Henry, who converted Ljungberg's cross from the right on a volley. Additional goals from Edu, Pirès and Touré inflicted a third consecutive 4–1 defeat for Leeds against Arsenal at Elland Road. At home to Middlesbrough in the fourth round, Bergkamp opened the scoring for Arsenal, following good play from Parlour.
