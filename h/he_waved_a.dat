[...] In rehearsal one day, Singer told the tubaist John Richards, [...] "I can't hear you". On the next run-through, Richards blasted the note louder. [...] "Still can't hear you", said Singer. The next time, Richards blew the tuba with both lungs. [...] "I still can't hear you", said Singer.

2500|$|On November 27, 1949, Rushmore {{published}} in the Journal-American allegations of communist infiltration of US naval vessels. Though {{the facts of the}} article were invented by Rushmore, by coincidence the FBI was conducting its own investigation on the same matter. Initially, J. Edgar Hoover thought that Rushmore had access to genuine intelligence. Hoover then had Rushmore's telephone tapped. Later in Olympia, Washington, Rushmore testified before the Canwell Committee, a state committee to investigate subversive activities at the University of Washington. Rushmore switched the subject to Washington, D.C. <b>He</b> <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> piece of paper that he claimed was an FBI report that named 150 federal employees that were members of a Soviet spy ring. When FBI agents intercepted him in a hotel lobby and asked about the document, he showed them a four-page letter that he typed himself. Then in the spring of 1953, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy asked Hoover about Rushmore's bonafides. The FBI's reply warned against relying on Rushmore's veracity. [...] " [...] writings have proved unreliable, due to his tendency to sensationalize and blow up fragments of information." [...] Though the FBI regarded Rushmore as a publicity seeker, McCarthy hired Rushmore anyway.|$|E
