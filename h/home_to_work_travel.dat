In the first step, the reasons for changing commuting time are explored initially in relationship to urban structure. Added explanation then considers the gender, tenure type, income, occupation and commuting type. The result related with gender {{is consistent with the}} previous studies however income is not. Occupation and commuting type appear to be strongly affected on differences on commuting time. In the second step, the <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> pattern is explored whether it reflects consistency with the standard urban economic theory. Results reflect that the behavioral assumption of cost minimization for the journey to work in the standard model is inadequate when explaining the relation between job and housing location. In the third step, the <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> pattern is investigated in local context in terms of spatial distribution of workers both on working and residential areas. While living and working at the same geographic part of the metropolitan area or the district decreases the commuting time, living and working at the different geographic part of the metropolitan area or the district significantly increases the commuting time. ...|$|E
40|$|The daily commute {{is still}} {{the main source of}} traffic congestion. Despite {{transport}} research emphasis on commuters, the work end of <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> receives less attention. However, employers influence the commute behaviour of employees in different ways. The Belgian database Home-to-Work-Traffic (HTWT) contains information on accessibility, work regimes and mobility management initiatives of 7460 worksites of large employers in Belgium. In a spatial multilevel regression model both contextual and worksite factors are incorporated to investigate the share of cycling employees. While controlling for different economic, physical and other factors, the provision of bicycles by the employer seems to be successful, while the effect of bicycle facilities is less clear, partly {{due to the fact that}} bicycle facilities are more popular in less cycle-friendly areas...|$|E
40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> {{remains the}} prime focus of {{mobility}} management policies, {{in which the}} promotion of carpooling {{is one of the}} main strategies. Besides governments, employers are key players in this strive for a more sustainable commute. However, commuting research tends to focus on individual commuters and their place of residence, rather than on workplaces and company-induced measures. Therefore, this paper takes the workplace as research unit to analyse the popularity of carpooling in Belgium. After an exploratory (spatial) data analysis, we incorporate three groups of factors in a multilevel regression model which predicts the share of carpooling at large workplaces: location (accessibility), organisation (activity sector), and promotion (carpool-oriented mobility management measures). Higher levels of carpooling are found at less accessible locations, and in the activity sectors construction, manufacturing and transport. This analysis gives insight in the determinants of carpooling, and may thus contribute to the development of sustainable transport policies...|$|E
40|$|EMPLOYER MOBILITY PLANS: ACCEPTABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND COSTS The {{concentrated}} {{and repeated}} nature of commuting traffic offers action potentials to control or {{reduce the number}} of single-occupant vehicles commuting during the peak hours. As source of the home-to-work journeys, the companies have a ringside seat to promote sustainable mobility and the last years paid an always growing attention to that mobility issue. Though, the research literature have brought only few attention to the employer mobility plans (EMPs) implemented by the companies. The question about the effectiveness of the measure taken by the companies remains so open, as well as questions about their costs and benefits to the company. What is the impact of EMPs? Do they change the commuting behaviour of the workers? What are their costs and benefits for a company? Hence, the main objective of this paper is twofold: first evaluating the effectiveness of policy measures making up EMPs, and secondly assessing their costs and benefits at the company level. To achieve this aim 60 employees transport coordinators (ETCs) will be interviewed. Even if the literature is almost silent about this topic, the paper starts with a state of the art of the literature. This will help top define the different concepts and to classify the policy measures companies can take. The latter are called either push or pull measures. The Belgian <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travels</b> survey conducted every 3 years by the FPS Mobility and Transport will then be presented. This survey is focused on the companies located in Belgium and employing at least 100 workers. The database contains 8820 workplaces. Each record describes the commuting behaviour of the employees as well as the mobility policy that is implemented by the firm. The database will be used to identify clusters of companies, based on the success of the implemented EMP. Considering this criteria, it comes out that only few EMPs can be considered as successful. ETCs of the latter will then be interviewed to lead to an in-depth understanding of the causes and effects of EMPs...|$|R
40|$|Title: Business {{travel in}} {{everyday}} life: Mobility, presence and absence. Written in Swedish and English. 248 pages. Author: Gunilla Bergström Casinowsky Doctoral Dissertation at the Department of Sociology, University of Gothenburg, Box 720, SE 40530 Göteborg, Sweden ISBN: 978 - 91 - 975405 - 8 - 2 ISSN: 1650 - 4313 Göteborg 2010 In this thesis, current debates on mobile lifestyles and the work-life interface are woven together and studied {{from the perspective}} of frequent business travellers. The overreaching aim is to investigate the significance of <b>travel</b> at <b>work</b> in people’s everyday lives. More specifically, the main objective is to shed some light upon emotional and practical consequences of travel-related absence from home for friendship and family relations. The thesis consists of four papers based on two different empirical studies: one qualitative study comprised by two sets of observations and 15 interviews, and one quantitative study based on survey data. The analysis of the qualitative data resulted in two papers written in Swedish (papers I and II). The results from the quantitative study are presented in two papers written in English (papers III and IV). Paper I is an exploratory study with the purpose of discovering focal dimensions of the work-life interface from a business traveller’s perspective. The second paper further explores gendered experiences of overnight <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> revealed in the first paper. Whereas the women’s experiences are characterized by feelings of loneliness, guilt and a sense of vulnerability, the men’s experiences are less negative and they also call attention to some positive sides of being cut off from everyday life at home. The gendered experiences have practical implications for how the respondents organize their mobile life. In prioritizing being at home, the female strategy aims at reducing the amount of nights away and, consequently, leads to comparatively many hours on the road. In contrast, the male strategy is more focused on minimizing the hours on the road with the purpose of actively “being there” for the family while at home and taking advantage of the “free” time while away. Questions about implications of overnight <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> in terms of the traveller’s ability {{to keep in touch with}} locally based as well as long-distance friends, and the opportunities that the travel might offer as a source of geographically extended social networks, are elaborated through analysis of the survey data (paper III). The benefits of mobility in terms of extended social networks represent the main social consequences of <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> as established in the analyses. Staying away from <b>home</b> due <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> is also seen as potentially facilitating the coordination with friends living elsewhere. Some downsides are reported as well. The most frequent travellers feel negatively affected by mobility, reporting problems hampering coordination with friends close <b>to</b> <b>home.</b> Following up one thread noticed in the qualitative study, one issue explored by the quantitative data is the significance of work-related travel for the gendered division of domestic responsibility (paper IV). The results reveal a clear pattern in two key respects. When the work traveller is a woman, the allocation of home-based responsibility seems to remain unaffected. By contrast, the effect of the business trips when the travellers are men is a reduction in their relative share of responsibility for the home and the family...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an overall picture of demographic and socio-economic characteristics {{as well as}} journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> behavior characteristics in Florida. In addition, detailed comparisons of journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> private vehicle occupancy distribution, travel time distribution, mode choice and departure time distribution by household and individual characteristics are also provided based on three data files: American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Samples data file, Summary File 3 Public Use Microdata Samples 1 % and Public Use Microdata Samples 5 % data files. Utilizing the three data files, this thesis not only investigates current commuting patterns but also provides more reliable information on current journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> characteristics and helps to gain knowledge that is useful to identify problems and provide creative solutions on related transportation issues {{in the state of}} Florida. In analyzing the data, several socio-economic and journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> behavior characteristics were identified. Interesting findings include the lower utilization of transit, the lower private vehicle occupancies for individuals in Florida, and different journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> departure time distribution by gender, by young people and by senior citizens from other adult categories. The data analysis shows that the three data files reflect acknowledged demographic trends and capture known changes such as aging of population, smaller household size, and increasing car ownership. The comparison analysis shows that in most cases, ACS PUMS data files approximate SF 3 PUMS 1 % and 5 % data files very well. The detailed comparison of the three data files regarding journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> behavior characteristics in Florida is important to decision makers who will make informed choices when evaluating alternative transportation programs and related policy issues. The knowledge of reliability of data regarding journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>travel</b> behavior will also help transportation professionals for travel demand modeling, transportation and land use planning and related studies...|$|R

Multi-function bike, ridden either by one or two riders and its aesthetic part of interior element can be an attractive offer. Identification of marketing objectives and observation of comparable products were a crucial step in the initial process of tandem bike design. The use of bicycle in urban areas can overcome a number of motorized vehicles operating wherever the using of them may create issues such as traffic jam and air pollution. This study aims to adjust the tandem bike which can be produced commercially for the apartment residents. Stated in the research problems, the design process was successfully fulfilled. Fabrication and product testing were positively completed. A concise and comfortable bike to carry from the lobby to the apartment unit, or vice versa, was successfully created...|$|E

40|$|Walking is {{the main}} mode of {{transportation}} {{for many of the}} world’s people, particularly those in cities of the majority world. In the metropolitan region of Jakarta, walking in the public realm constitutes the main transportation mode for almost 40 percent of trips—a massive contribution to urban mobility. On the other hand, there is no comprehensive planning for pedestrians in an analogous manner to other modes of transportation. Pedestrian facilities are often dilapidated, damaged, dangerous, or missing completely. Additionally, there is no process for assessing the inventory of pedestrian facilities, planning pedestrian facilities at a region-wide level, or even identifying the location of vernacular pedestrian routes in low-income and informal areas. Provincial pedestrian planning focuses on piecemeal, symbolic spaces such as monumental plazas that serve the nation-building project, but overlooks the functional network of routes that address the daily needs of the city’s residents. This dissertation examines the issue of walkability planning in Jakarta by investigating what matters to pedestrians and how pedestrian space is produced. The research employs mixed methods, including pedestrian network groundtruthing, structured streetscape observations, multimodal traffic counts, pedestrian activity mapping, pedestrian surveys and interviews with policy-makers. Data is analyzed through a combination of in-depth qualitative analysis as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. Based on this research, six key elements of walkability planning are proposed for Jakarta: multidisciplinarity, ethnography, accessibility, legibility, integrated activity, and shared streets. A literature review of walkability metrics reveals that walking is a highly multidisciplinary activity, with very different metrics emerging from different fields. In order to effectively encourage pedestrian activity, new multidisciplinary metrics should integrate the perspectives of all of these related disciplines and pedestrian planning should occur through inter-agency coordination. In Jakarta, interviews with policy-makers suggested that pedestrian planning is hindered by {{the fact that there is}} no lead agency for pedestrian planning, and there is a lack of cooperation between the different agencies that plan and produce urban public space. Pedestrian planning is also hindered by a discursive framework that is both modally and geographically biased—favoring motorized, long-distance modes of transportation and employing method derived from a Western research and planning norms. In order to overcome this discursive bias, ethnography should become a standard part of urban research, planning and design. The need for ethnography and qualitative analysis was made visible by the mismatch between standard transportation terminology, and prevailing practices observed in pedestrian mapping exercises and raised by pedestrians in on-the street interviews. For example, standard survey categories do not account for informal or integrated activity patterns like mobile street vending. From surveys conducted with mobile street vendors, it was difficult to separate their pedestrian activities into categories of <b>travel</b> from <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> business-related <b>travel,</b> and visiting friends and relatives. In fact, it was difficult to even separate their travel from their activities since many vendors carried out business as they made their way through the neighborhood. With a large portion of the population engaged in the informal sector, the discrepancy between assumed and actual behavior severely compromises the quality of transportation-related research that is conducted in Jakarta and many other majority world cities. Ethnographic and qualitative research methods may therefore assist in producing more context-sensitive planning data and outcomes. These context-sensitive methods could include new analytical methods that focus on integrated activity, rather than trip-based or activity-based analysis. In relation to pedestrian activity, context-sensitive planning encompasses new approaches to accessibility that combine the notion of transportation accessibility with disabled access and universal access standards. The need for such an approach was revealed during interviews with policy-makers, who described accessibility in terms of market goods rather than human rights. Within the market for urban public space, ordinary pedestrians were unable to compete with other modes of transportation; within the market for urban impressions, ordinary pedestrian spaces were outcompeted by prominent, symbolic spaces; and within the market for cultural capital, ordinary pedestrians were excluded from planning processes because even the discourse of pedestrian planning was inaccessible to regular residents. In response to this problem of exclusion, integrated accessibility may facilitate inclusion in both planning processes and urban spaces within the city. In particular, integrated accessibility would aim to provide comprehensive routes of travel for all pedestrians, rather than isolated pockets of so-called accessible (yet unreachable) facilities. More context sensitive planning would also be facilitated through greater legibility of fine-grained and vernacular pedestrian networks that were missing from standard planning maps. These fine-grained networks represent highly connected facilities that serve much of Jakarta’s pedestrian transportation task. While the current synoptic illegibility of these areas may conveniently allow some communities to avoid state intrusion, it also means that low-income populations are chronically under-served with respect to basic urban planning and services. Increased legibility therefore allows for improvement and maintenance of urban systems like safe, functional pedestrian networks, and it may also play a role in increasing tenure security for Jakarta’s significant floating population. In many of these vernacular spaces, new street design approaches would also benefit pedestrians, who tend to use the streets as shared spaces, rather than spaces that are rigidly segregated by mode. Pedestrian activity mapping revealed that only an overwhelming majority of pedestrians used streets as hybrid spaces, with activity types falling into the categories of surface sensitive, risk-averse, distance-minimizing and stationary pedestrians. More realistic shared street designs would therefore accommodate —rather than ignore—the types of activities that occur along Jakartan streets. Design standards for “great streets” in Jakarta would also emphasize the safe sharing of streets through self-enforcing approaches to speed limits, and the integration of various urban elements like drainage, mobility and public-private interaction. While walkability planning in Jakarta displays many “wicked problem” features, there is much that can be done to improve, if not resolve, conditions for pedestrians within the region. Recommended strategies for walkability planning in Jakarta include a regional walkability plan and environmental policy developed using participatory planning, reformed governance and institutional arrangements, and a constituency building approach. The strategies also include expansion of road designations and an integrated accessibility strategy that draws upon new data sources from a WikiPlaces network map, an integrated activity study and pedestrian network cost-benefit analysis. In addition to Jakarta specific proposals, a number of proposals are made to advance discourse on walkability more generally. These approaches include decentered analysis of integrated activity, informal economic activity analysis, vernacular placemaking and Asian shared street design. Pedestrians and pedestrian plans traverse diverse physical, administrative and disciplinary spaces in cities of the world. Integrated and multidisciplinary approaches are therefore required to understand and accommodate these key users of public space. In Jakarta, walkability planning has potential to improve urban transportation efficiency while contributing to traffic safety, economic vitality, environmental quality and democratic governance. Successful walkability planning in Jakarta may also provide a model for planning in other cities where Western models of planning are unrealistic, inequitable and inappropriate. Jakartan lessons on walkability planning are particularly relevant, and improvements in walkability are particularly powerful, for cities characterized by relatively low median incomes, high land use densities, a substantial informal sector, rapid urbanization and rapid motorization. By improving walkability planning in Jakarta and other cities of the majority world, policy-makers and planners can move toward more sustainable, socially equitable and efficient cities...|$|R
