5|$|After a brief {{preliminary}} hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly {{showed no signs}} of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>jury</b> under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under the {{chairmanship}} of the Lord High Steward, acted as <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>jury.</b> By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>jury.</b> Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E

Unit attorneys provide quality responses that aid the court in ruling on issues of law and in the development of new legal precedents.|$|R

I examine child sexual assault cases of Dallas County 1999 - 2005, I look at both legal and extralegal factors including case characteristics, institutional characteristics and characteristics of the defendants and the victims.

25|$|After a {{stint in}} the {{gambling}} industry, he began serving as the editor of The Town newspaper. It typically covered scandals in London high society. A public feud later erupted between Nicholson and another editor, Barnard Gregory, who published a competing paper. Nicholson also published other periodicals and several literary works, including an autobiography. After leaving the newspaper industry, Nicholson began operating a hotel. There Nicholson began his <b>Judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jury</b> Society performances, which lasted for two decades. These acts mocked and satirised members of London society and the preoccupations of the popular press. Though his acts were derided by some for their crudeness, they were attended by many aristocrats, politicians, and other prominent citizens. He hosted the performances at other venues in London and around England, producing the <b>Judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jury</b> Society for almost two decades.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{thousands}} of trials from a substantial {{fraction of the}} nation’s most populous counties {{as well as a}} smaller sample of less populous counties. Evidence from four major Civil Justice Survey data sets spanning more than a decade establishes that: (1) compensatory awards are strongly associated with punitive awards and (2) the punitive-compensatory relation has not materially changed over time. But (3) 2005 data suggest, for the first time, systematic differences between <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> <b>juries</b> in the punitive-compensatory relation. Despite claims that the Supreme Court’s State Farm decision changed the punitivecompensatory relation, we present evidence that the 2005 shift is not attributable to the State Farm case or to other possibly relevant likely factors such as the relative flow of personal injury cases to <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> <b>juries,</b> inclusion of 110 small counties in the 2005 data, or changes in the 2005 data coding. The judge-jury difference more likely turns on unobserved factors driving the selection of cases for adjudication before <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> jurors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we build on {{neuroscience}} evidence to model belief formation and study decision-making by <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> <b>juries.</b> We show that physiological constraints generate posterior beliefs with properties that are qualitatively different from traditional Bayesian theory. In particular, a decision-maker will tend to reinforce his prior beliefs and to hold posteriors influenced by his preferences. We study {{the implications of the}} theory for decisions rendered by <b>judges</b> <b>and</b> <b>juries.</b> We show that early cases in a judge’s career may affect his decisions later on, and that early evidence produced in a trial may matter more than late evidence. In the case of juries, we show that the well-known polarization effect is a direct consequences of physiological constraints. It {{is more likely to be}} observed when information is mixed, as behavioral evidence suggests, and when prior beliefs and preferences are initially more divergent across jurors...|$|R

25|$|The {{committee}} {{takes the}} role of prosecutor, <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>jury</b> when handling its cases. After the hearing is opened with a prayer, the accused is invited to make a personal statement. If there is no admission of guilt, the individual is informed {{of the source of}} the charges and witnesses are presented one at a time to give evidence. Witnesses do not remain present for the entire hearing. Once all the evidence is presented, the accused and all witnesses are dismissed and the committee reviews the evidence and the attitude of the accused.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{remained}} at the Coal Hole tavern until 1858, {{when he moved to}} the Cider Cellar on Maiden Lane. At the Cider Cellar, he continued staging the <b>Judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jury</b> Society and poses plastiques. There he produced one of his most successful events, an 1858 production of a mock trial satirizing the public attention that was given to prostitution. This was a topic that many newspapers were devoting a significant amount of coverage to at that time, and the address given by Nicholson's primary lawyer was later printed and sold well in London. The trial was accompanied by a poses plastiques performance.|$|E

25|$|Galway's District Court is {{the main}} court of summary {{jurisdiction}} and hears minor cases without a jury. It is responsible for hearing small civil claims, certain family law cases, administers the liquor licensing laws and is responsible for indicting the accused and sending them forward for trial at the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court. The Circuit Court in Galway tries all indictable offences (those cases triable by a <b>judge</b> <b>and</b> <b>jury),</b> except murder, rape, treason, piracy and genocide, which are reserved to the Central Criminal Court. It can also hear appeals from the District Court. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Civilly, the court is limited to compensation claims of not more than €75,000. Both parties may waive this amount and grant the court unlimited jurisdiction. Divorce, Judicial Separation and probate cases can be heard provided they are within the financial parameters of the courts jurisdiction. Decisions in civil cases can be appealed to the High Court.|$|E
