500|$|The band took {{a relaxed}} {{approach}} to recording. For five months, the trio stayed at a Hollywood hotel during the recording sessions, {{where they would}} often play loud music late at night, prompting complaints. The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment: [...] "For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how {{we were supposed to}} behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars." [...] American Idiot took ten months to complete, at a cost of $650,000. By the end of the process, Armstrong felt [...] "delirious" [...] regarding the album: [...] "I feel like I'm on the cusp of something with this.

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I {{know a lot of people}} have already given up, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good.

[...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I just felt like people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} for the publication, Hollis explained {{the title of}} the song: [...] "It's called 'Watch n' Learn,' and people will understand what it's about once it comes out. It's a very sexy record, but it's fun. It's [...] great melodies; it's catchy; the beat knocks. It's so many different elements to it." [...] When asked how is he satisfied with Rihanna's vocals and his prediction on the song he further stated: [...] "She definitely murdered it vocally. I was just at the studio last week listening to a mix of it, and man, she killed it. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like, this song, it's going to be big. I'm really excited about it." [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] was recorded at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and at Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg in Paris. The song was mixed by Marcos Tovar. Its vocal production was completed by Kuk Harrell and assisted by TT. and Jennifer Rosales.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like.

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Move {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} release, with many critics praising the album's overall sound. Andree Farias of Allmusic gave the album three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying [...] "After a number of career moves attempting to position themselves as {{the next big thing}} in rock, Third Day appear resigned to their place as one of the biggest rockers in Christian music: nothing more, nothing less. Move... reveals that much, as it finds the group embracing, hopefully definitively, that midpoint between spiritual fervor and Southern rock passion that suits them so well". Chris Carpenter of cbnmusic.com gave it four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining that [...] "The charismatic [...] Powell, along with guitarist Mark Lee, bassist Tai Anderson, and drummer David Carr, have crafted a project that is as musically stimulating as it is lyrically diverse... It's raw, passionate, and track after track is filled with uncompromising truth". Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave Move three out of five stars, noting an overall southern rock sound to the album and saying that it [...] "recalls 1999's treasured Time". C. E'Jon Moore of The Christian Manifesto gave the album three out of five stars, saying [...] "In the end, Move is a good album. It’s not a great album... Some will feel it’s a progression, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> as if this is more of the same from a band who has proven that they are capable of giving us more than the status quo". Andrew Greer of Christianity Today gave the album four out of five stars, praising it as [...] "Magically marrying deep soul with melodic rock throughout the entire twelve-track list" [...] and saying that it [...] "is yet another attractive release in an illustrious discography certain to be celebrated for years to come".|$|E

500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

[...] In this same interview, she criticized conservatives for creating what she called the [...] "deep divide" [...] in the Anglican church regarding homosexuality. Clarkson was also noted for visiting Anglican churches around Canada on her many tours, saying that she enjoyed seeing how the church fit in communities in all parts of Canada. Her public faith, however, was also the cause of controversy: She received particular criticism when she was seen taking communion in a Catholic church since that denomination does not permit open communion.|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at other times <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} of Tykwer's films since 1997's Winter Sleepers, the musical score for Perfume was {{composed}} by Tykwer {{and two of his}} friends Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil. The score was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic and State choir Latvija under the direction of conductor Simon Rattle. Tykwer began composing the score with Klimek and Heil the very day he started working on the screenplay. Tykwer said, [...] "I feel like I understand very much about the structure and the motivations of the characters when I'm writing the script, but I really do understand the atmosphere and the emotional and the more abstract part of the film when I'm investigating the music, and when I'm planning the music for it. ... When I then come to the shooting, having worked for three years on the music and three years on the script, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like I know exactly the two worlds and how to combine them." [...] By the time it came to shooting the film, a substantial portion of music had been composed. Tykwer hired a small orchestra and recorded them performing the score. Tykwer played the recorded music on set so people could explore the atmosphere and the acoustic world of the film while they were acting in it. The music was also used instead of temp music during editing.|$|E
