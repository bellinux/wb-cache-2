25|$|Williams's {{objection}} {{has turned}} out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence does indeed make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature. These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory. Another problem with Medawar's theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available. It turns out that the genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been around as long as eukaryotic life. Baker's yeast, worms, fruit flies, and mice all share some of the same ageing genes.|$|E

500|$|When {{the book}} was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. [...] The {{first part of the}} novel {{concerns}} the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. [...] Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. [...] One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. [...] This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (<b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. [...] This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of [...] "fine folks" [...] being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. [...] The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.|$|E

Due to their overwhelming numbers in comparison with the Celestial Exalted (Terrestrial Exalted numbering around ten to twenty thousand as compared to the hundreds of Celestial Exalted), they were able to overthrow the Solar Exalted at the height of their power with the help and guidance of the Sidereal Exalted, thus ending the First Age.|$|E

2500|$|A graph family F has bounded local treewidth if the graphs in F obey a {{functional}} relationship between diameter and treewidth: {{there exists a}} function [...] such that the treewidth of a diameter-d graph in F is at most (d). The apex graphs do not have bounded local treewidth: the apex graphs formed by connecting an apex vertex to every vertex of an n'n grid graph have treewidth n and diameter 2, so the treewidth is not bounded by a function of diameter for these graphs. However, apex graphs are intimately connected to bounded local treewidth: the minor-closed graph families F that have bounded local treewidth are exactly the <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> an apex graph {{as one of their}} forbidden minors. A minor-closed family of graphs that has an apex graph as one of its forbidden minors is known as apex-minor-free. With this terminology, the connection between apex graphs and local treewidth can be restated as the fact that apex-minor-free graph families are the same as minor-closed graph families with bounded local treewidth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994 a law {{was passed}} in Pennsylvania which {{proposed}} to pay $300 for room and board and $3,000 for funeral expenses to an organ donor's family. Developing the program was an eight-year process; {{it is the first}} of its kind. Procurement directors and surgeons across the nation await the outcomes of Pennsylvania's program. There have been at least nineteen <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> signed up for the benefit. Due to investigation of the program, however, there has been some concern whether the money collected is being used to assist families. Some organizations, such as the National Kidney Foundation, oppose financial incentives associated with organ donation claiming, [...] "Offering direct or indirect economic benefits in exchange for organ donation is inconsistent with our values as a society." [...] One argument is it will disproportionately affect the poor. The $300–3,000 reward may act as an incentive for poorer individuals, as opposed to the wealthy who may not find the offered incentives significant. The National Kidney Foundation has noted that financial incentives, such as this Pennsylvania statute, diminish human dignity.|$|E
2500|$|Not all graph {{families}} have local structures. For some families, a simple counting argument proves that adjacency labeling schemes do not exist: only [...] bits {{may be used}} to represent an entire graph, so a representation of this type can only exist when the number of -vertex graphs in the given family [...] is at most [...] Graph <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> larger numbers of graphs than this, such as the bipartite graphs or the triangle-free graphs, do not have adjacency labeling schemes. However, even families of graphs in which the number of graphs in the family is small might not have an adjacency labeling scheme; for instance, the family of graphs with fewer edges than vertices has [...] -vertex graphs but does not have an adjacency labeling scheme, because one could transform any given graph into a larger graph in this family by adding a new isolated vertex for each edge, without changing its labelability. Kannan et al. asked whether having a forbidden subgraph characterization and having at most [...] -vertex graphs are together enough to guarantee the existence of an adjacency labeling scheme; this question, which Spinrad restated as a conjecture, remains open.|$|E

60|$|Lest {{the habits}} of this {{generation}} should pass away and be forgotten, of which I see some evidence, I will mention a usage that was quite common among the Dutch, and which has passed in some measure, into the English <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> formed connections with the children of Holland. Two of these intermarriages had so far brought the Littlepages within the pale, that the usage to which I allude was practised in my own case. The custom was this: when {{a child of the}} family reached the age of six, or eight, a young slave of the same age and sex, was given to him, or her, with some little formality, and from that moment the fortunes of the two were considered to be, within the limits of their respective pursuits and positions, as those of man and wife. It is true, divorces do occur, but it is only in cases of gross misconduct, and quite as often the misconduct {{is on the side of}} the master, as on that of the slave. A drunkard may get in debt, and be compelled to part with his blacks this one among the rest; but this particular negro remains with him as long as anything remains. Slaves that seriously misbehave, are usually sent to the islands, where the toil on the sugar plantations proves a very sufficient punishment.|$|E
