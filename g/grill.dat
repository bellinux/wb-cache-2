5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop <b>grill</b> from a storage cylinder atop the <b>grill.</b> The <b>grill</b> was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot <b>grill,</b> the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the <b>grill.</b> After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E

50|$|Like most {{traditional}} smokers, early pellet <b>grills</b> {{were limited to}} indirect cooking methods such as smoking, roasting, and baking. However, thanks to improvements in construction and advancements in digital controllers, modern pellet <b>grills</b> can produce higher temperatures. Whereas early units struggled to reach 450 °F, some pellet <b>grills</b> can now easily achieve temperatures in excess of 550 °F. Louisiana <b>Grills,</b> Fast Eddy's by Cookshack, and Yoder Smokers YS Series have pellet <b>grills</b> with an upper limit of 600 °F. Some pellet <b>grills</b> can reach 600-700 °F, depending on the model. The ability to achieve high temperatures has enabled some manufacturers to design pellet <b>grills</b> that can handle both indirect and direct cooking. Brands such as Memphis Wood Fire <b>Grills,</b> Fast Eddy’s by Cookshack, Louisiana <b>Grills,</b> Yoder Smokers, and FireCraft make pellet <b>grills</b> that offer the option of open fire grilling.31 This is usually accomplished through a removable or adjustable plate that allows flames through {{a portion of the}} pellet <b>grill's</b> deflector plate.|$|R

50|$|Flattop <b>grills</b> can be {{contrasted with}} open-flame <b>grills,</b> which cook food over a grate with direct or {{indirect}} flame. Flattop <b>grills</b> avoid the problem of smaller or delicate food falling through the grate like open-flame <b>grills.</b> In addition, closed-flame flattop <b>grills</b> are more energy efficient because they capture the heat under the steel cook surface rather than letting it escape through the grates into the atmosphere. This design also requires less time to heat up and uses less fuel to cook a meal. Also, flattop <b>grills</b> release less smoke and particulates into the atmosphere because foods and juices are prevented from dropping directly onto burner elements, eliminating flare-ups and reducing smoke.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>grilling</b> and brining on the sensory properties, the fillet fatty acid composition and the cardio-protective activity of sardine (Sardina pilchardus), studying the in vitro activity against Platelet-Activating-Factor (PAF) induced platelet aggregation. Sensory evaluation of <b>grilled</b> and brined sardine showed that <b>grilled</b> sardine had higher scores for the attributes: <b>grilled</b> fish, marine and fresh fish whereas brined sardine had higher scores for the attributes: salty, iodine, oily and bitter. <b>Grilled</b> sardine exhibited significantly increased fillet fatty acid content while the brined fish sample significantly decreased fatty acid levels. Polar lipids of all specimens (raw, <b>grilled</b> and brined) showed strong inhibitory activity against PAF action indicating that <b>grilling</b> and brining have not diminished the cardio-protective properties of sardine. </p...|$|R

5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas <b>grill</b> that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted <b>grill</b> lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal <b>grill.</b> The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E
