The paramagnetic properties have been confirmed by magnetotransport measurements on undepleted ZnCoO films without Schottky <b>gate</b> <b>contacts.</b> The Au/AgxO Schottky <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> were processed by optical lithography and metallization. Below 50 K, the MESFET characteristics are persistently changed from a low resistance state (LRS) to high resistance state by an external magnetic field. The MESFET can be switched back into the LRS only by heating it up to room temperature.

50|$|A {{possible}} application would be, for example, {{dividing the}} contact layer into two separate groups: <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> and source/drain contacts, each defining its own mask. IMEC recently used an approach {{like this to}} demonstrate a 45 nm node 6-transistor SRAM cell using dry lithography.|$|R
50|$|Device {{fabrication}} {{begins by}} first wrapping CNTs in a gate dielectric and <b>gate</b> <b>contact</b> via atomic layer deposition. These wrapped nanotubes are then solution-deposited on an insulating substrate, where the wrappings are partially etched off, exposing {{the ends of}} the nanotube. The source, drain, and gate contacts are then deposited onto the CNT ends and the metallic outer gate wrapping.|$|E
50|$|Wrap-around gate CNTFETs, {{also known}} as gate-all-around CNTFETs were {{developed}} in 2008, and are a further improvement upon the top-gate device geometry. In this device, instead of gating just {{the part of the}} CNT that is closer to the metal <b>gate</b> <b>contact,</b> the entire circumference of the nanotube is gated. This should ideally improve the electrical performance of the CNTFET, reducing leakage current and improving the device on/off ratio.|$|E
50|$|The JFET {{is a long}} {{channel of}} {{semiconductor}} material, doped to contain an abundance of positive charge carriers or holes (p-type), or of negative carriers or electrons (n-type). Ohmic contacts at each end form the source (S) and the drain (D). A pn-junction is formed on one or {{both sides of the}} channel, or surrounding it, using a region with doping opposite to that of the channel, and biased using an ohmic <b>gate</b> <b>contact</b> (G).|$|E
40|$|New {{approaches}} towards high reliable thermal stable ohmic and Schottky contacts for GaN/AlGaN-HFETs {{have been}} developed and implemented in device structures. The contact technology has been systematically optimized towards i) good electrical properties, ii) superior contact morphology and contour definition and Hi) high reliability and thermal stability. HFETs employing source/drain contacts based on WSiN diffusion barriers sandwiched between an Ti/Al/Ti/Au internal layer system and an overlayer metal as well as WSiN/Au and Ir/Au <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> have demonstrated long term stability at 400 °C, Even after temperature storage tests at 500 °C no significant device degradation could be detected. Ir/Au Schottky gates have found to be stable at the rather high level of Schottky barrier height of about 1. 1 eV resulting in dramatically reduced leakage currents as compared to standard Pt/Ti/Au <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> to GaN-HFETs...|$|R

50|$|The <b>gate</b> <b>contact</b> {{may be of}} {{polysilicon}} or metal, previously polysilicon {{was chosen}} over metal because the interfacing between polysilicon and gate oxide (SiO2) was favourable. But the conductivity of the poly-silicon layer is very low {{and because of this}} low conductivity, the charge accumulation is low, leading to a delay in channel formation and thus unwanted delays in circuits. The poly layer is doped with N-type or P-type impurity to make it behave like a perfect conductor and reduce the delay.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{researchers}} {{migrated from}} the back-gate {{approach to a}} more advanced top-gate fabrication process. In the first step, single-walled carbon nanotubes are solution deposited onto a silicon oxide substrate. Individual nanotubes are then located via atomic force microscope or scanning electron microscope. After an individual tube is isolated, source and drain contacts are defined and patterned using high resolution electron beam lithography. A high temperature anneal step reduces the contact resistance by improving adhesion between the contacts and CNT. A thin top-gate dielectric is then deposited {{on top of the}} nanotube, either via evaporation or atomic layer deposition. Finally, the top <b>gate</b> <b>contact</b> is deposited on the gate dielectric, completing the process.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} TFT was first {{proposed}} by Paul Weimer in 1962. This {{is illustrated in}} Figure 1c. Here the source and drain electrodes are directly deposited onto the conducting channel (a thin layer of semiconductor) then a thin film of insulator is deposited between the semiconductor and the metal <b>gate</b> <b>contact.</b> This structure {{suggests that there is}} no depletion region to separate the device from the substrate. If there is zero bias, the electrons are expelled from the surface due to the Fermi-level energy difference of the semiconductor and the metal. This leads to band bending of semiconductor. In this case, there is no carrier movement between the source and drain. When the positive charge is applied, the accumulation of electrons on the interface leads to the bending of the semiconductor in an opposite way and leads to the lowering of the conduction band with regards to the Fermi-level of the semiconductor. Then a highly conductive channel forms at the interface (shown in Figure 2).|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen-terminated diamond {{surfaces}} are very attractive for devices based on surface electronics. The hole channel that governs the surface conductivity and {{the simplicity of}} the surface patterning are key features which allow a large flexibility for device design. In-plane gate field effect transistors have been fabricated with the conductive channel separated from the ohmic <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> by insulating thin lines, obtained by using a combination of electron beam lithography with surface oxidation. Depletion regions spreading from the highly resistive oxidized lines which separate the channel and gate regions can be controlled by applying a voltage to both lateral <b>gate</b> <b>contacts.</b> A wire structure has been designed {{in such a way that}} the gate voltage effectively modulates the conductance of the channel. The channel modulation is discussed in terms of a quasi two-dimensional surface carrier density. The effect of surface defects on the transistor properties has also been investigated.

50|$|Arrays of top-gated CNTFETs can be {{fabricated}} on {{the same}} wafer, since the <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> are electrically isolated from each other, unlike in the back-gated case. Also, due to the thinness of the gate dielectric, a larger electric field can be generated {{with respect to the}} nanotube using a lower gate voltage. These advantages mean top-gated devices are generally preferred over back-gated CNTFETs, despite their more complex fabrication process.|$|R
40|$|A simple, non-equilibrium {{model is}} used to {{evaluate}} the likely DC performance of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors. It is shown that, by appropriate work function engineering of the source, drain and <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> to the device, the following desirable properties should be realizable: a sub-threshold slope close to the thermionic limit; a conductance close to the interfacial limit; an ON/OFF ratio of around 10 3; ON current and transconductance close to the low-quantum-capacitance limit...|$|R
50|$|An organic field-effect {{transistor}} device {{consists of three}} major components: the source, the drain and the gate. Generally, a {{field-effect transistor}} has two plates, source in contact with drain and the gate respectively, working as conducting channel. The electrons move from source to the drain, and the gate serves to control the electrons’ movement from source to drain. Different types of FETs are designed based on carrier properties. Thin film transistor (TFT), among them, is an easy fabricating one. In a thin film transistor, the source and drain are made by directly depositing {{a thin layer of}} semiconductor followed by a thin film of insulator between semiconductor and the metal <b>gate</b> <b>contact.</b> Such a thin film is made by either thermal evaporation, or simply spins coating. In a TFT device, there is no carrier movement between the source and drain. After applying a positive charge, accumulation of electrons on the interface cause bending of the semiconductor and ultimately lowers the conduction band with regards to the Fermi-level of the semiconductor. Finally, a highly conductive channel is formed at the interface.|$|E
5000|$|An example band-bending diagram {{is shown}} in the figure. For convenience, energy is {{expressed}} in eV and voltage is expressed in volts, avoiding the need for a factor q for the elementary charge. In the figure, a two-layer structure is shown, consisting of an insulator as left-hand layer and a semiconductor as right-hand layer. An example of such a structure is the MOS capacitor, a two-terminal structure made up of a metal <b>gate</b> <b>contact,</b> a semiconductor body (such as silicon) with a body contact, and an intervening insulating layer (such as silicon dioxide, hence the designation O). The left panels show the lowest energy level of the conduction band and the highest energy level of the valence band. These levels are [...] "bent" [...] by the application of a positive voltage V. By convention, the energy of electrons is shown, so a positive voltage penetrating the surface lowers the conduction edge. A dashed line depicts the occupancy situation: below this Fermi level the states {{are more likely to be}} occupied, the conduction band moves closer to the Fermi level, indicating more electrons are in the conducting band near the insulator.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} and widely used FET in modern microelectronics is the MOSFET. There are different kinds in this category, such as MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor), and IGFET (insulated-gate FET). A schematic of a MISFET {{is shown in}} Figure 1a. The source and the drain are connected by a semiconductor and the gate is separated from the channel by a layer of insulator. If there is no bias (potential difference) applied on the gate, the band bending is induced due to the energy difference of metal conducting band and the semiconductor Fermi level. Therefore a higher concentration of holes is formed on the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator. When an enough positive bias is applied on the <b>gate</b> <b>contact,</b> the bended band becomes flat. If a larger positive bias is applied, the band bending {{in the opposite direction}} occurs and the region close to the insulator-semiconductor interface becomes depleted of holes. Then the depleted region is formed. At an even larger positive bias, the band bending becomes so large that the Fermi level at the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator becomes closer {{to the bottom of the}} conduction band than to the top of the valence band, therefore, it forms an inversion layer of electrons, providing the conducting channel. Finally, it turns the device on.|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of commercially available AlGaAs/GaAs HEMTs four different suppliers {{has been investigated}} by means of high temperature storage tests and biased life test. The main reliability problems have been detected in Schottky <b>gate</b> and ohmic <b>contacts</b> due to thermally activated metal-metal and metal-semiconductor interactions. In particular, Al/Ti <b>gate</b> <b>contacts</b> show a decrease of barrier height with the activation energy E/sub a/= 1. 3 eV, while Al/Ni Schottky contact shows an increase of barrier height with E/sub a/= 1. 8 eV. An increase of source and drain parasitic resistances has been detected in devices of two suppliers with E/sub a/= 1. 6 eV. Comparison with tests on low-noise MESFETs does not show major reliability problems for heterostructure devices...|$|R
40|$|AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are devices {{which are}} {{strongly}} influenced by surface properties such as donor states, roughness {{or any kind of}} inhomogeneity. The electron gas is only a few nanometers away from the surface and the transistor forward and reverse currents are considerably affected by any variation of surface property within the atomic scale. Consequently, we have used the technique known as conductive AFM (CAFM) to perform electrical characterization at the nanoscale. The AlGaN/GaN HEMT ohmic (drain and source) and Schottky (<b>gate)</b> <b>contacts</b> were investigated by the CAFM technique. The estimated area of these highly conductive pillars (each of them of approximately 20 - 50 nm radius) represents around 5 % of the total contact area. Analogously, the reverse leakage of the <b>gate</b> Schottky <b>contact</b> at the nanoscale seems to correlate somehow with the topography of the narrow AlGaN barrier regions producing larger currents. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In {{staggered}} {{thin film}} transistors, the injection length is {{the fraction of}} the <b>gate</b> to <b>contact</b> overlap that is effectively involved in current injection. Its assessment is important to properly downscale device dimensions. In fact, {{in order to increase}} transistor operation speed, the whole device footprint should be downscaled, which means both the <b>gate</b> to <b>contact</b> overlap and the channel length, as they affect the relative weight of <b>gate</b> to <b>contact</b> parasitic capacitances and the carrier transit time along the channel respectively. Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make the <b>gate</b> to <b>contact</b> overlap smaller than the injection length, because this negatively affects contact resistances. Suitable figures of merits are introduced to quantify these aspects, and a method is proposed to extract the injection length from electrical measurements. As an example of application, transistors based on the prototypical n-type polymer poly[N,N′-bis(2 -octyldodecyl) -naphthalene- 1, 4, 5, 8 -bis(dicarboximide) - 2, 6 -diyl]-alt- 5, 5 ′-(2, 2 ′-bithiophene) (P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) are analyzed. When the channel length is scaled while driving voltages are kept constant, in P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) the injection length decreases as well, thus proving that the downscaling of the whole device footprint is feasible. The physical origins of this finding are analyzed and traced back to material properties, in order to suggest general guidelines for a successful transistor downscaling...|$|R
