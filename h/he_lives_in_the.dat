Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether <b>he</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school or parents working there. In {{the event of a}} tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place.

5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though <b>he</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E

500|$|From : Pennsylvania {{has never}} used the name [...] "mansion" [...] to {{describe}} the governor's official home.

[...] Even during the 79 years that [...] was used, it was known simply as that, Keystone Hall. Even today, the home located at 2035 North Front Street [...] is officially known as [...] "The Governor's Residence" [...] not [...] "The Governor's Mansion." [...] The distinction may be both psychological and historical. It may help to remind the governor that <b>he</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> people's house. It may also remind the electorate that the we, as citizens, own the home and allow the individuals we choose to reside there only temporarily.|$|E
