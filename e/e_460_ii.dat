40|$|Full {{penetration}} {{butt weld}} joints between a tube and its flange are considered, subjected to pure bending, pure torsion and {{a combination of}} these loading modes. The model treats the weld toe like a sharp V-notch, in which mode I and mode III stress distributions are combined to give an equivalent notch stress intensity factor (N-SIF) and assess the high cycle fatigue strength of the welded joints. The N-SIF-based approach is then extended to low/medium cycle fatigue, considering fatigue curves for pure bending and pure torsion having the same slope or, alternatively, different slopes. The expression for the equivalent N-SIF is justified {{on the basis of the}} variation of the deviatoric strain energy in a small volume of material surrounding the weld toe. The energy is averaged in a critical volume of radius R-C and given in closed form as a function of the mode I and mode III N-SIFs. The value of R-C is explicitly referred to high cycle fatigue conditions, the material being modelled as isotropic and linear elastic. R-C is thought of as a material property, independent in principle of the nominal load ratio. To validate the proposal, several experimental data taken from the literature are re-analysed. Such data were obtained by testing under pure bending, pure torsion and combined bending and torsion, welded joints made of fine-grained Fe <b>E</b> <b>460</b> steel and of age-hardened AlSi 1 MgMn aluminium alloy. Under high cycle fatigue conditions the critical radius R-C was found to be close to 0. 40 mm for welded joints made of Fe <b>E</b> <b>460</b> steel and close to 0. 10 mm for those made of AlSi 1 MgMn alloy.

The enzyme efficiency (k(cat) /K-m) of the E 323 A and E 519 A mutants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type due to a substantial decrease in k(cat), but not due to variations in K-m, consistent with their putative roles as nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, respectively. The D 460 A mutant was totally inactive, whereas the D <b>460</b> <b>E</b> and D <b>460</b> N mutants were active to some extent, revealing Asp 460 as a catalytic residue and demonstrating that the presence of a carboxylate group in this position is a prerequisite for catalysis. The pH-dependence studies indicated that the pK(a) of the acid/base catalyst decreased from 9. 2 for the wild-type enzyme to 7. 0 for the D <b>460</b> <b>E</b> mutant, implicating Asp 460 as the residue that interacts with the acid/base catalyst Glu 519 and elevates its pK(a).

The design was both experimental and descriptive, differing from prior methodological comparisons in {{that a more}} sophisticated test statistic {{was used in the}} analysis of the data. Whereas most similar studies used t tests, or at best analysis of variance, this study incorporated the use of the Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, The subjects for the experimental aspect of the study were 67 undergraduate students enrolled in <b>Ed.</b> <b>460,</b> Psychology of Childhood, at Oregon State University for the spring term 1970. The 19 graduate students enrolled in the course were included in the descriptive aspect of the study as it was thought that their criticism and insight would add additional depth and understanding to the experimental finding s The School and College Ability Test (SCAT) was administered to the subjects in the sample {{at the beginning of the}} study in order to control for differences in academic potential. The second test was the dependent variable for the study. It consisted of 100 objective items and was constructed by an independent psychometrist from materials current in the field. There were two questionnaires given in the study. The first solicited general information about each subject, and the final questionnaire provided the opportunity for the students to express their likes and dislikes concerning the course. In order to encourage candid responses complete anonymity was emphasized. The hypothesis tested was: There is no significant difference in achievement between Class E₁ (lecture) and Class E₂ (discussion). Of the variables tested with the stepwise, three were significant for the regression: GPA, method, and SCAT verbal raw score. The null hypothesis was not rejected given that α =. 18 is too high. Graphs of the variables indicated anomalies present in the sample. Four of the sample did not perform up to the level of their predicted potential. These outlying observations were dropped and another regression was made on the adjusted sample. There was a difference in treatments indicated at the. 05 level of significance. The conclusions of this study indicate a difference in favor of the lecture section at the. 18 level of significance. The regression run on the adjusted sample indicated a difference at the. 05 level. It is the belief of the investigator that variables were in operation that could not be controlled for experimentally, and, consequently, effected the outcome of the study. As the data from the final questionnaire yielded a total of 71 respondents, or 81 percent of the sample electing combination of lecture and discussion, this would be the most valid approach, from the students' point of view, to constructive revitalization of <b>Ed</b> <b>460,</b> Psychology of Childhood, at Oregon State University...|$|R

Here, we assessed, for the first time, sex differences at the transcriptome level in the auditory brainstem. To this end, microarray experiments covering the whole rat genome were performed in the superior olivary complex (SOC) of 16 -day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Sexually dimorphic genes were identified using two criteria: a >= 2 -fold change and a P-value < 0. 05. Only 12 out of 41, 374 probes (0. 03 %) showed sexually dimorphic expression. For companson, pituitaries from 60 -day-old female and male rats were analyzed, as this gland is known to display many sex-specific features.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{chikungunya}} virus outbreak of unprecedented magnitude is currently ongoing in Indian Ocean territories. In Réunion Island, this alphavirus has already infected {{about one-third of}} the human population. The main clinical symptom of the disease is a painful and invalidating poly-arthralgia. Besides the arthralgic form, 123 patients with a confirmed chikungunya infection have developed severe clinical signs, i. e., neurological signs or fulminant hepatitis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We report the nearly complete genome sequence of six selected viral isolates (isolated from five sera and one cerebrospinal fluid), along with partial sequences of glycoprotein E 1 from a total of 127 patients from Réunion, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Mayotte islands. Our results indicate that the outbreak was initiated by a strain related to East-African isolates, from which viral variants have evolved following a traceable microevolution history. Unique molecular features of the outbreak isolates were identified. Notably, in the region coding for the non-structural proteins, ten amino acid changes were found, four of which were located in alphavirus-conserved positions of nsP 2 (which contains helicase, protease, and RNA triphosphatase activities) and of the polymerase nsP 4. The sole isolate obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid showed unique changes in nsP 1 (T 301 I), nsP 2 (Y 642 N), and nsP 3 (<b>E</b> <b>460</b> deletion), not obtained from isolates from sera. In the structural proteins region, two noteworthy changes (A 226 V and D 284 E) were observed in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E 1. Homology 3 D modelling allowed mapping of these two changes to regions that are important for membrane fusion and virion assembly. Change E 1 -A 226 V was absent in the initial strains but was observed in > 90 % of subsequent viral sequences from Réunion, denoting evolutionary success possibly due to adaptation to the mosquito vector. CONCLUSIONS: The unique molecular features of the analyzed Indian Ocean isolates of {{chikungunya virus}} demonstrate their high evolutionary potential and suggest possible clues for understanding the atypical magnitude and virulence of this outbreak...|$|R

40|$|Flange-tube joints from {{fine grained}} steel Fe <b>E</b> <b>460</b> with as-welded and {{machined}} welds were investigated under biaxial constant and variable amplitude loading (bending and torsion) {{in the range of}} 10 " 3 to 5. 10 " 6 cycles to crack initiation and break-through, respectively. In order not to interfere with residual stresses they were relieved by a heat treatment. In-phase loading can be treated fairly well using the conventional hypotheses (von Mises or Tresca) on basis of nominal, structural or local strains or stresses. But the influence of out-of-phase loading on fatigue life is severely overestimated if conventional hypotheses are used. However, the introduced hypothesis of the effective equivalent stress (EESH) leads to fairly well predictions. For this, the knowledge of local strains or stresses is necessary. They are determined by boundary-element analyses in dependency of weld geometry. This hypothesis considers the fatigue-life reducing influence of out-of-phase loading by taking into account the interaction of local shear stresses acting in different surface planes of the material. Further, size effects resulting from weld geometry and loading mode were included. Damage accumulation under a Gaussian spectrum can be assessed for in- and out-of-phase combined bending and torsion using an allowable damage sum of 0. 35 for weldments in the as-welded state and 0. 16 for joints with machined weldments with a lower notch factor of the critical area. As an interim design approach, the present and relevant published results indicate that Eurocode 3 /IIW S-N curve FAT 80 / 3 (negative inverse slope of 3) is suitable for combined nominal normal and nominal shear stresses acting in-phase, and possibly out-of-phase bending and shear. However, lower curve FAT 56 / 5 is necessary for out-of-phase torsion and bending or tension. Both curves are used in conjunction with the nominal maximum principal stress range occurring during the loading cycle. (orig.) 43 refs.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an {{opportunistic}} {{bacterial pathogen}} responsible for causing several human diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumococcus {{is also a}} major cause of human ocular infections and is commonly isolated in cases of bacterial keratitis, an infection of the cornea. The ocular pathology that occurs during pneumococcal keratitis is partly due to the actions of pneumolysin (Ply), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by pneumococcus. The lytic mechanism of Ply is a three step process beginning with surface binding to cholesterol. Multiple Ply monomers then oligomerize to form a prepore. The prepore then undergoes a conformational change that creates a large pore in the host cell membrane, resulting in cell lysis. We engineered a collection of single amino acid substitution mutants at residues (A 370, A 406, W 433, and L 460) that are crucial to the progression of the lytic mechanism and determined the effects that these mutations had on lytic function. Both Ply(WT) and the mutant Ply molecules (Ply(A 370 G), Ply(A 370 E), Ply(A 406 G), Ply(A 406 E), Ply(W 433 G), Ply(W 433 E), Ply(W 433 F), Ply(L 460 G), and Ply(L <b>460</b> <b>E))</b> were able to bind to the surface of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) with similar efficiency. Additionally, Ply(WT) localized to cholesterol-rich microdomains on the HCEC surface, however, only one mutant (Ply(A 370 G)) was able to duplicate this behavior. Four of the 9 mutant Ply molecules (Ply(A 370 E), Ply(W 433 G), Ply(W 433 <b>E),</b> and Ply(L <b>460</b> <b>E))</b> were deficient in oligomer formation. Lastly, all of the mutant Ply molecules, except Ply(A 370 G), exhibited significantly impaired lytic activity on HCECs.

The average trichome length was 410 ± 200 mum for the upper epidermis and 460 ± 190 mum for the lower epidermis. Cuticle thickness was not considerably different between lower and upper epidermis. The leaflet blade consisted basically of two layers (upper and lower) of unicellular epidermis, two layers of palisade parenchyma and one layer of spongy parenchyma. One layer of paraveinal mesophyll was found between palisade and spongy parenchyma. In conclusion, leaflets of kudzu present anatomical characteristics that might contribute to the broad physiological plasticity shown by kudzu. Kudzu é uma cultura de cobertura que se tornou invasiva em algumas regiões subtropicais e temperadas. Kudzu tem demonstrado ampla plasticidade fisiológica quando coloniza novos ambientes. Este trabalho teve por objetivo investigar características da anatomia foliar de kudzu que poderiam contribuir para seu hábito invasivo e também para sua propagação em ambientes distintos do ponto de vista climático. Foram analisados cortes frescos e permanentes de lâminas foliares de plantas crescidas no campo. A epiderme inferior tipicamente apresentou maior freqüência de estômatos (147 ± 19 estômatos mm- 2) do que a epiderme superior (26 ± 17 estômatos mm- 2). O número médio de tricomas por milímetro quadrado foi 8 para ambas, epiderme superior e epiderme inferior. O comprimento médio dos tricomas foi 410 ± 200 mim para a epiderme superior <b>e</b> <b>460</b> ± 190 mim para a epiderme inferior. A espessura da cutícula não diferiu significativamente entre as epidermes inferior e superior. A lâmina foliar consistiu basicamente de duas camadas de parênquima paliçádico e uma camada de parênquima lacunoso. Uma camada de mesófilo paranerval foi encontrada entre os parênquimas paliçádico e lacunoso. Concluindo, folíolos de kudzu apresentam características anatômicas que podem contribuir para a ampla plasticidade fisiológica demonstrada pela espécie...|$|R

Utilizou-se o delineamento em blocos casualizados com quatro repetições, sendo os tratamentos distribuídos em esquema fatorial 2 x 5. No primeiro fator foram alocados os cultivares e, no segundo, as subdoses do glyphosate (0, 57, 6; 115, 2; 230, 4; <b>e</b> <b>460,</b> 8 g ha- 1). No dia da aplicação e também aos 45 e 120 dias após aplicação (DAA), avaliaram-se a altura, a área foliar, o diâmetro do caule, o número de ramos plagiotrópicos e de folhas; aos 10, 45 e 120 DAA foram avaliados os sintomas de intoxicação nas plantas e, aos 120 DAA, o acúmulo de massa seca de caule, folhas e raízes. Os sintomas de intoxicação nas plantas de café causados pelo glyphosate foram caracterizados por clorose e estreitamento do limbo foliar nos dois cultivares estudados. Todavia, sintomas mais severos foram verificados no cultivar Acaiá a partir de 10 DAA, como necrose de folhas mais novas da parte mediana da planta. Conclui-se que o cultivar Acaiá é menos tolerante ao glyphosate, quando comparado ao Catucaí, pois apresentou menor crescimento que o Catucaí quando submetidos ao tratamento com o herbicida, ou seja, pode ocorrer tolerância diferencial entre cultivares de crescimento distinto. This study {{aimed to}} evaluate the effects of simulated glyphosate drift on the growth of two cultivars with distinct growing patterns. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, with four repetitions, and the treatments were distributed in a factorial scheme 2 x 5, with two cultivars in the first factor and the glyphosate subdoses (0, 57. 6; 115. 2; 230. 4 and 460. 8 g ha&# 8209; 1) in the second factor. On the day glyphosate was applied and at 45 and 120 days after application (DAA), height, leaf area, stem diameter, and number of plagiotropic branches and leaves were evaluated; at 10, 45 and 120 DAA, plant intoxication symptoms were visually evaluated and at 120 DAA, dry mass accumulation of the stem, leaves, and roots was evaluated. The intoxication symptoms of the coffee plants caused by glyphosate were characterized by chlorosis and leaf narrowing in the two cultivars studied. However, more severe symptoms were verified in the Acaiá cultivars from 10 DAA on, such as necrosis of younger leaves in the median part of the plant. It was concluded that Acaiá cultivar is less tolerant to glyphosate than Catucaí cultivar, since it showed lower growth when submitted to herbicide treatment, i. e., tolerance can vary between cultivars with distinct growing patterns...|$|R

O sistema de resfriamento com ar forçado operou com um fluxo de ar de 1933 m³ h- 1, a 1 ºC e umidade relativa (UR) de 88, 4 % ± 2, 0, com velocidade do ar em torno de 1 m s- 1. Nos experimentos com água gelada foi utilizado um sistema de imersão, com capacidade de 0, 23 m³ de água, a 1 ºC. A câmara de resfriamento utilizada tinha capacidade de 2, 90 J s- 1. O tempo de meio e de sete oitavos do resfriamento foi determinado partindo-se das leituras da temperatura no centro dos frutos, com duas repetições. O resfriamento do leito de frutos com ar forçado não se mostrou homogêneo, obtendo-se tempos que variaram de 107 a 170 min, dependendo da posição do fruto no {{interior}} da embalagem. No sistema com água gelada o resfriamento acontece uniformemente em todo o leito de frutos, sendo o tempo médio de resfriamento de 57 min. Quando os frutos foram resfriados no sistema convencional, o tempo de resfriamento oscilou de 362 <b>e</b> <b>460</b> min, oito vezes maior que o obtido com água e três vezes maior com ar forçado. This work {{presents a}} study to compare the cooling of oranges with room cooling, forced-air cooling and hydrocooling systems of the Valência orange (Citrus Sinensis Osbeck). The forced-air cooling system operated with an air flow of 1933 m³ h- 1, at 1 ºC, relative humidity (RH) of 88. 4 % ± 2. 0 and air velocity around 1 m s- 1. In the experiments with cold water an immersion hydrocooling system with a capacity of 0. 23 m³ of water was used at a temperature of 1 ºC, approximately. The half cooling time and seven-eighths cooling time were determined from the temperature data, with two replications. The {{results showed that the}} cooling of the bed fruits with forced air is not homogeneous, obtaining a mean between 107 a 170 min, depending on the position of the fruit in the package. In the hydrocooling system, the cooling of the fruits occurs uniformly in the bed, with a mean cooling time of 57 min.

Nowadays the development of ballistic tests aimed to design a bullet-proof material {{to be able to}} reduce as much as possible bullets energy which generated by the firing process. 3 D simulation has been performed to study the ballistic resistance of ductile target collides with projectile with conical nose at normal collision. The angle formed between the target sheet and the projectile is 90 o. The first simulation used 81, 06 grams 4340 aluminum steel projectile which has Caliber-Radius-Head (CRH) 3, 0, with 88. 9 mm long and 12. 9 mm in diameter. This projectile collides with the target plate which has a 6061 -T 6 aluminum material with a thickness of 26. 3 mm. The second simulation used Weldok <b>460</b> <b>E</b> steel plate as a target with a thickness of 12 mm and a diameter of 500 mm, collides with hardened Arne projectile with 20 mm in diameter and 98 mm in length. The third simulation used 608 mm aluminum plate with 608 mm length of the plate. The results of this simulation are the ballistic limit velocities, and the results are later compared with the reference journal. The simulation of aluminum plate had 233 m/s ballistic limit velocity, the simulation of Weldox <b>460</b> <b>E</b> plate had 227 m/s ballistic limit velocity, and the simulation of 608 mm aluminum plate had 230 m/s ballistic limit velocity. Failures that occur on the aluminum plate 608 mm is because the rear surface of the plate occurs wave reflection. For further research is expected to examine ballistic limit velocity with other firing angl...|$|R

Utilizou-se o esquema fatorial (3 x 5) em delineamento de blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições, sendo os tratamentos compostos por três cultivares de café: Catucaí Amarelo (2 SL), Oeiras (MG- 6851) e Topázio (MG- 1190) e cinco doses de glyphosate (0; 57, 6; 115, 2; 230, 4; <b>e</b> <b>460,</b> 8 g ha- 1). O herbicida foi aplicado quando as plantas de café se apresentavam com 21 pares de folhas e de forma que não atingisse o terço superior delas. Aos 45 e 120 dias após a aplicação do glyphosate (DAA), avaliaram-se os incrementos na altura, na área foliar, no diâmetro do caule, no número de folhas e nos ramos plagiotrópicos, sendo eles mensurados inicialmente no dia da aplicação do herbicida; aos 10, 45 e 120 DAA, avaliou-se a porcentagem de intoxicação das plantas. A massa da matéria seca de folhas, raízes e caule, a densidade e o comprimento radicular foram avaliados aos 120 DAA. Os sintomas de intoxicação das plantas de café causados pelo glyphosate foram semelhantes nos diferentes cultivares, sendo caracterizados por clorose e estreitamento do limbo foliar. Os incrementos no número de folhas e ramos plagiotrópicos e no diâmetro do caule, independentemente do cultivar, não foram alterados pelo glyphosate. O cultivar Topázio foi o mais sensível ao glyphosate quanto a acúmulo de área foliar, de massa de matéria seca e densidade radicular. This study {{evaluated the}} effects of glyphosate on the growth of three arabica coffee cultivars. A factorial (3 x 5) was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications, with treatments consisting of three coffee varieties: Catucaí Amarelo (2 SL), Oeiras (MG- 6851) and Topázio (MG- 1190) and five glyphosate doses (0, 57. 6, 115. 2, 230. 4 and 460. 8 g ha- 1). The herbicide was applied when the coffee plants reached 21 pairs of leaves, before reaching their upper third ones. At 45 and 120 days after glyphosate application (DAA), increase in leaf area, stem diameter, number of leaves and plagiotropic branches was evaluated, being initially measured {{on the day the}} herbicide was applied, and plant intoxication rate at 10, 45 and 120 DAA. Dry matter of leaves, roots and stem, and root length and density were measured at 120 DAA. Symptoms of coffee plant intoxication caused by glyphosate were similar in different cultivars, being characterized by chlorosis and leaf narrowing. Increase in the number of leaves, plagiotropic branches and stem diameter, regardless of the cultivar, was not affected by glyphosate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the meat mineral composition from different genetic groups’ cattle with distinct ages. The samples were obtained from sixteen castrated Nellore and F 1 Sindi x Nellore cattle with 36 and 48 months of age. The animals were finished in feedlot in the UFRuralRJ, received the same diet and presented average weights of 318, 8 (± 17, 8) kg and 460, 0 (± 10, 1) kg at the beginning of the experimental period and slaughter, respectively. After the carcass colding, was collected a portion of Longissimus dorsi between the 12 ª and 13 ª ribs to the analysis of the mineral composition. The experimental design was the completely randomized in factorial arrangement 2 x 2 with two genetic groups (Nellore and F 1 Sindi x Nellore) and two ages (36 and 48 months). F 1 Sindi x Nellore bovines present major sodium (122, 86 g/kg vs 104, 16 g/kg) and potassium (19, 56 mg/kg vs 16, 96 mg/kg) contents in their meats in relation to Nellore. There was no influence of age in the meat mineral contents from the evaluated animals. In these experimental conditions, it is concluded that the inclusion of the Sindi breed in crossbreed programs with Nellore bovines results in increasing of sodium and potassium contents in the meats from F 1 Sindi x Nellore animals. Objetivou-se avaliar a composição mineral da carne de bovinos de diferentes grupos genéticos com idades distintas. As amostras foram obtidas de dezesseis bovinos castrados Nelore e F 1 Sindi x Nelore com 36 e 48 meses de idade.

Após o resfriamento da carcaça, foi coletada uma porção do músculo Longissimus dorsi entre a 12 ª e 13 ª costelas para análise da composição mineral. O delineamento experimental foi o inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 2 x 2 com dois grupos genéticos (Nelore e F 1 Sindi x Nelore) e duas idades (36 e 48 meses).

The Johnson-Cook constitutive relation coupled with the Johnson-Cook failure criterion have been applied to analyse penetration of the target and also the failure process. The analysis has been focussed on the influence of the projectile diameter on the perforation process, assuming the same projectile mass. The aim was to preserve the same initial kinetic energy and identical nose angle.
