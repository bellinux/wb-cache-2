2500|$|Big N' Tasty/Big Tasty – the Big N' Tasty, {{introduced}} in 1997, was a [...] beef patty with ketchup, cheese, mayonnaise with a grill diced onions, pickles, leaf lettuce, and tomatoes. It was devised to resemble Burger King's Whopper sandwich. It {{is also known}} as the Big Xtra in Slovenia and most of Canada; the McXtra in Quebec, Canada; the McFeast Deluxe in Australia; the Big Tasty (without the 'N') in Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy (without ketchup), Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom; the Quarter Pounder Deluxe in South Africa; and the McNifica (a play on Spanish magnifica, 'wonderful') in Mexico and Latin America. The Big Tasty configuration is somewhat different, consisting of a third-pound (150 g) beef patty, sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheese,</b> and Big Tasty sauce (which has a smoke flavor). The Big Tasty Bacon variant also contains strips of bacon. This variant was sold in the US until 2009; it is now sold internationally only.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} study {{concerning}} the biotechnical production of enzyme modified cheese flavours, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for objective measurement of cheese aroma characteristics. In order to obtain the necessary reference information for steering the biotechnical process towards typical cheese flavour characters, such as Gouda and Emmental, the volatile fractions of three Gouda cheeses from different producers and three <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> from different origins (Swiss, French and Austrian) were studied. The volatile fractions of the different cheeses were composed of fatty acids, methylketones, lactones, aldehydes and alkenes. Principal component analysis was used for interpretation of the complex semi-quantitative data matrix and allowed classification of the different cheeses. It was observed that the Gouda cheeses from different producers had similar aroma patterns; while more differences were observed between the <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Austrian <b>Emmental</b> was clearly differentiated from the French and Swiss products.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for the determination of chemical parameters of <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> from different geographic origins of Europe. A total of 91 <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> produced during the winter in Austria (n = 4), Finland (n = 6), Germany (n = 13), France (n = 30) and Switzerland (n = 38) were investigated. Fat, total nitrogen (TN), water-soluble nitrogen (WSN), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), sodium chloride (NaCl) and pH were analysed by reference methods. The diffuse reflection of different cheeses was measured by a Buchi NIRLab N- 200 spectrometer using a rotating measuring cell between 1000 and 2500 nm. The best results for fat content (R- 2 = 0. 92; ratio of standard deviation to {{root mean square error}} of prediction (RPD) = 3. 61) and NaCl (R- 2 = 0. 39; RPD = 1. 28) were obtained after maximum normalisation and smoothing, whereas the best results for TN (R- 2 = 0. 82; RPD = 2. 34), WSN (R- 2 = 0. 77; RPD = 2. 08), NPN (R- 2 = 0. 80; RPD = 2. 17) and pH (R- 2 = 0. 43; RPD = 1. 32) were obtained when the spectra were subjected to the first derivation between maximum normalisation and smoothing. It can be concluded that NIR spectroscopy can be used for the determination of fat, TN, WSN and NPN of European <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> with varying degrees of accuracy. However, the NIR failed to determine NaCl and pH parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} {{use of the}} mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy in transmission mode for determining some chemical parameters of European <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses.</b> A total of 91 <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> produced during the winter in Austria (n = 4), Finland (n = 6), Germany (n = 13), France (n = 30) and Switzerland (n = 38) were investigated. Fat, total nitrogen (TN), water-soluble nitrogen (WSN), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), sodium chloride (NaCl) and pH were analysed by the reference methods. The MIR transmission of different cheeses was also measured by a Nicolet Magna 750 IR spectrometer in a measurement range of 4000 - 600 cm(- 1). Partial least square analysis together with the leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to develop calibration models for different cheese parameters. The best results for NPN (R- 2 = 0. 85; ratio of standard deviation to {{root mean square error}} of prediction (RPD) = 2. 58), pH (R- 2 = 0. 82; RPD = 2. 34), WSN (R- 2 = 0. 80; RPD = 2. 26), NaCl (R- 2 = 0. 70; RPD = 1. 91), fat (R- 2 = 0. 69; RPD = 1. 87), TN (R- 2 = 0. 62; RPD = 1. 60), WSN/TN (R- 2 = 0. 83; RPD = 2. 81) and WSN/NPN (R- 2 = 0. 57; RPD = 1. 52) were obtained when the spectra were subjected to the first derivation and smoothing after maximum normalisation. It can be concluded that MIR-transmission spectroscopy can be considered as a suitable technique for the prediction of NPN, pH, WSN and WSN/ TN of European <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> with different origins.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{classify}} European <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> according to their geographic origin using analytical approaches. Twenty-five analytical parameters (factors) were measured in 183 samples. Results were combined by multivariate statistical analysis. Discriminant analysis (DA) and an artificial neural network (ANN) delivered similar results when all regions and factors were included; 95 % and 91 %, respectively, of the samples were correctly classified in the validation procedure. To reduce the analytical costs {{and the risk of}} overfitting, a DA based on a selection of only 11 factors was calculated. In this case, the Jackknifed validation delivered 95 % correct assignments. Finally, a system was optimised to discriminate between the Swiss samples and cheeses from other regions. Building a new model for each of the six pairs, Switzerland vs. another region, 100 % correct classification could be achieved for the Swiss samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of Swiss-type cheeses with a typical number, size, {{and distribution of}} eyes is a difficult task, especially when bactofuged or microfiltrated milk is utilised. In this study, the potential of microparticles (plant origin) to influence eye formation in cheese, was assessed. Eight experimental <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> were produced with one replicate from microfiltrated milk with addition of 0. 0625 – 4. 000 mg of powdered hay to the milk (90 L) and ripened for 130 days. Eye formation was quantified by means of X-ray computed tomography (between 30 and 130 days). The contents of fat, water, citric acid, lactic acid, and volatile carboxylic acids were determined at 130 days.

40|$|The present work {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in predicting some sensory attributes of 20 <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> originating from different European regions. For {{the purpose of this}} study four appearance and texture attributes, namely, adhesivity, friability [...] elasticity and firmness and six olfacto-gustatory attributes namely, aroma intensity, odour intensity, bitterness, saltiness, acidity and sweetness were selected by the sensory panel. Calibration models between sensory properties and NIR spectra were developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The squared correlation coefficients (R- 2) were greater than 0. 5 for adhesivity, elasticity, firmness. aroma. bitterness, saltiness, acidity and sweetness. In addition, a good correlation between sensory attributes and NIR spectra was found using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Therefore, this work demonstrates the feasibility of NIR to predict some sensory attributes since a relatively high correlation between sensory data and NIR spectra was found. However, further research with a large data bases will be needed in order to validate the method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of winter cheese chemical properties, namely, fat, sodium chloride (NaCl), pH, {{non protein nitrogen}} (NPN), total nitrogen (TN) and water soluble nitrogen (WSN) was done using spectroscopic technologies with different wavelength zones. The <b>Emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> provided from different European countries were studied. A total of 91 cheeses produced during the winter time in Austria (n= 4), Finland (n= 6), Germany (n= 13), France (n= 30) and Switzerland (n= 38) were analysed by near infrared (NIR) and mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopies. The combination of these two spectral regions (sum of their spectra) was also studied. The partial least square (PLS) regression with the leave one-out cross validation technique was used to build up calibration models using data set designated as calibration set. These models were validated with another data set designated as validation set. The obtained results suggest {{the use of the}} NIR for the {{determination of}} fat and TN contents, and the MIR for NaCl and NPN contents {{as well as for the}} pH.

Regardless of the casein origin, the number of different peptides containing more than 20 amino acids was greater in cheeses manufactured with strain ITGLH 77. This accumulation of large peptides, including those from αs 1 - and αs 2 -caseins, was in agreement with the lower overall extent of proteolysis obtained in ITGLH 77 cheeses, which {{can be attributed to the}} presence of one cell envelope proteinase of the lactobacilli strains or lesser release of intracellular peptidases into the cheese aqueous phase. In parallel, stretchability was measured throughout ripening time. Emmental strands observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed microstructure similar to that of mozzarella strands.

40|$|Cobalamin (vitamin B 12) occurs {{naturally}} in some animal-derived foods and is produced exclusively by microorganisms. An optimised protocol {{was used for}} extraction of cobalamin from cheese matrixes. No pseudocobalamin was detected {{in any of the}} examined samples. Cobalamin levels (mg/ 100 g FW) detected in commercial <b>emmental</b> <b>cheeses</b> of three ripening stages did not alter significantly (P> 0. 05). Similar results were observed during the ripening of experimental semi-hard cheeses with or without propionibacteria. Existence of propionibacteria as adjunct culture in experimental cheeses did not alter significantly contribution on cobalamin levels of the cheese (P> 0. 05). The findings indicate that in the studied cheese matrixes the presence of propionibacteria did not affect the amount of cobalamin. The conditions to which propionibacteria are subjected during cheese manufacture and ripening and the presence of adenosyl-cobalamin in milk may be factors that repress cobalamin synthesis in Swiss- type cheeses. To date, the only known food grade microorganism that can produce cobalamin is Propionibacterium freudenreichii. This microorganism can also produce small amounts of pseudocobalamin, a compound structurally similar to cobalamin. BluB/CobT 2 fusion gene is the factor that differentiates the two compounds upon their biosynthesis, by synthesizing and binding 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMBI) to the final molecule of cobalamin. In the present study, attempts to inactivate this gene were performed in order to investigate the existence of an alternative enzyme, capable of activating adenine for attachment as a lower ligand in pseudocobalamin, instead of DMBI. An electroporation protocol was implemented in order to transform plasmids containing bluB or cobT 2 fragments and gene encoding erythromycin resistance in propionibacteria. Following transformation plasmid carrying bacteria were selected by cultivation in medium containing erythromycin. Homologous recombination of the bacterial genome and the non-replicative plasmid was expected to occur, leading to insertional mutagenesis. Colonies appeared after 7 and 11 days and were identified as propionibacteria but the disruption of bluB/cobT 2 gene could not be verified. Inefficient transformation protocol, satellite colonies, low transformation efficiency, or choice essentiality of the bluB/cobT 2 are among the possible explanations for the outcome of the experiment. Electroporation conditions should be optimized towards a more efficient P. freudenreichii transformation...|$|R
