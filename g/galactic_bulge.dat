5|$|Within {{a billion}} years of a galaxy's formation, key {{structures}} begin to appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black hole, and a <b>galactic</b> <b>bulge</b> of metal-poor Population II stars form. The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to {{play a key role}} in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added. During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The <b>galactic</b> <b>bulge,</b> for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic {{habitable}} zone {{was further}} developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the galactic halo would lack the heavier elements required to produce habitable terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} the galactic habitable zone. Being too close to the galactic center, however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the <b>galactic</b> <b>bulge.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the <b>galactic</b> <b>bulge</b> had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E
25|$|Only about 20% of {{planetary}} nebulae are spherically symmetric (for example, see Abell 39). A {{wide variety of}} shapes exist with some very complex forms seen. Planetary nebulae are classified by different authors into: stellar, disk, ring, irregular, helical, bipolar, quadrupolar, and other types, {{although the majority of}} them belong to just three types: spherical, elliptical and bipolar. Bipolar nebulae are concentrated in the galactic plane, likely produced by relatively young massive progenitor stars; and bipolars in the <b>galactic</b> <b>bulge</b> appear to prefer orienting their orbital axes parallel to the galactic plane. On the other hand, spherical nebulae are likely produced by the old stars similar to the Sun.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} {{it has been argued}} that an AGN must be powered by {{accretion}} of mass onto massive black holes (106 to 1010 times the Solar mass). AGN are both compact and persistently extremely luminous. Accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation, and a massive black hole has a high Eddington luminosity, and as a result, it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity. Supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the velocity dispersion of the <b>galactic</b> <b>bulge</b> (the M-sigma relation) or with bulge luminosity. Thus AGN-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole.|$|E

40|$|The {{hierarchical}} build-up of <b>galactic</b> <b>bulges</b> {{should lead}} to the build-up of present-day supermassive black holes by a mixture of gas accretion and merging of supermassive black holes. The tight relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion is thereby a strong argument that the supermassive black holes in merging <b>galactic</b> <b>bulges</b> do indeed merge. Otherwise the ejection of supermassive black holes by gravitational slingshot would lead to excessive scatter in this relation. At high redshift the coalescence of massive black hole binaries {{is likely to be}} driven by the accretion of gas in the major mergers signposted by optically bright QSO activity. If massive black holes only form efficiently by direct collapse of gas in deep galactic potential wells with v_c > 100 km/s as postulated in the model of Kauffmann & Haehnelt (2000) LISA expects to see event rates from the merging of massive binary black holes of about 0. 1 - 1 yr^{- 1 } spread over the redshift range 0 5.

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} an analytic {{form for}} a triaxial potential {{that describes the}} dynamics {{of a wide variety}} of astrophysical systems, including the inner portions of dark matter halos, the central regions of <b>galactic</b> <b>bulges,</b> and young embedded star clusters. Specifically, this potential results from a density profile of the form ρ (m) ∝ m^- 1, where the radial coordinate is generalized to triaxial form so that m^ 2 = x^ 2 /a^ 2 + y^ 2 /b^ 2 + z^ 2 /c^ 2. Using the resulting analytic form of the potential, and the corresponding force laws, we construct orbit solutions and show that a robust orbit instability exists in these systems. For orbits initially confined to any of the three principal planes, the motion in the perpendicular direction can be unstable. We discuss the range of parameter space for which these orbits are unstable, find the growth rates and saturation levels of the instability, and develop a set of analytic model equations that elucidate the essential physics of the instability mechanism. This orbit instability has a large number of astrophysical implications and applications, including understanding the formation of dark matter halos, the structure of <b>galactic</b> <b>bulges,</b> the survival of tidal streams, and the early evolution of embedded star clusters.
