25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the <b>first,</b> <b>you</b> have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down <b>first.</b> <b>You</b> have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|On Tatooine, {{there is}} a droid factory that the Galactic Empire has set up, So the {{rebellion}} sends C-3PO and R2-D2 and you, a rebel agent disguised as a Jawa to complete missions leading to the secret droid factory and to reprogram the evil droid army, but <b>first,</b> <b>you</b> must win the trust of your fellow Jawas. To proceed to the droid factory, the player must complete eight training missions and four top-secret missions with task-specific requirements, Such as 'Droid must be magnetic, Droid {{must be able to}} see in the dark, or Droid must weigh less than 100 kilograms. This allows you to complete the mission. Through experiential learning, players learn about and apply the scientific principles of energy, force, light, engineering, and magnetism. In addition, the game encourages players to apply math, logic, and critical thinking skills. The game contains 87 droid parts which can be combined in 25 million different combinations for manufacturing. In the Jawa Droid Workshop, players can paint and name their creations, and make them dance, while a holographic design grid lets players have a 360 degree view of their work in progress. In in-game InDex provided players with encyclopedic explanations on the science used in the game to help players; it could also link to the internet for access to further links.|$|E

500|$|For King Robert the Bruce of Scotland, {{the spider}} is {{depicted}} as an inspirational symbol, according to an early 14th-century legend. [...] The legend tells of Robert the Bruce's encounter with a spider {{during the time of}} a series of military failures against the English. One version tells that while taking refuge in a cave on Rathlin Island, he witnesses a spider continuously failing to climb its silken thread to its web. However, due to perseverance the spider eventually succeeds, demonstrating that, [...] "if at <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, try, try and try again". [...] Taking this as being symbolic of hope and perseverance, Bruce came out of hiding and eventually won Scotland's independence.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment <b>first.</b> <b>You</b> shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E

Against Slavia Prague at the Emirates, Arsenal equalled their best ever victory in a European competition, scoring seven goals. Walcott, who scored his first two goals {{of the season in}} the match, earned the praise of manager Wenger: [...] "Once Theo scored his <b>first,</b> <b>you</b> saw him much more. When they opened up the space, you could see his runs and pace, and the fact he is clinical in front of goal." [...] Qualification into the knockout stages was ensured with a draw away to Slavia Prague on 7 November 2007. Defeat against Sevilla at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium was Arsenal's first loss since April 2007, ending a run of 28 matches undefeated in all competitions. The result moved them down into second place, and in spite of winning their final group match against Steaua at home, Arsenal ended two points behind group winners Sevilla.|$|E

500|$|Adenhart {{made his}} Major League debut as the {{starting}} pitcher against the Oakland Athletics at home in Angel Stadium of Anaheim. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the major leagues. In his debut, he gave up five earned runs and walked five in two innings, earning a no-decision in a 15–8 loss. Adenhart was disappointed in his first appearance, saying, [...] "I let down the team <b>first.</b> <b>You</b> always {{want to go out}} and prove yourself to your teammates and your manager and your coaches. I was a disappointment to myself also." [...] His second start was against the Kansas City Royals, where he earned another no-decision, allowing three earned runs and striking out three over 4⅓ innings in a 5–3 win by the Angels. The reaction to his second start was more positive, with manager Mike Scioscia saying that [...] "it was definitely a start in the right direction." [...] Adenhart earned his only career decision, a victory, on May 12, 2008, against the Chicago White Sox in Anaheim, giving up four earned runs in 5⅔ innings en route to a 10–7 Angels victory. After the win against the White Sox, Adenhart was sent back down to the Salt Lake Bees. He spent the rest of the 2008 season at Salt Lake, amassing a 9–13 record with a 5.76 ERA in 26 games.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason <b>first,</b> <b>you</b> are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E

2500|$|An anti-proverb or a perverb is the {{transformation}} of a standard proverb for humorous effect. Paremiologist Wolfgang Mieder defines them as [...] "parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom". They have also been defined as [...] "an allusive distortion, parody, misapplication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect". To have full effect, an anti-proverb {{must be based on}} a known proverb. For example, [...] "If at <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, quit" [...] is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb [...] "If at <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, try, try again". Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as [...] "Put your burger where your mouth is" [...] from Red Robin. Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as [...] "Taste makes waist" [...] and [...] "If at <b>first</b> <b>you</b> don't succeed, skydiving is not for you".|$|E
