Immunohistochemistry of atypical oncocytomas had higher expression against proliferating cell nuclear antigen and more d. iscontinuous, immunostaining against laminin than typical ones. Flow cytometry revealed one or two aneuploid peaks in five typical and two atypical cases, although the latter had a higher proliferative fraction than typical oncocytomas. Cytogenetics of one typical oncocytoma showed a normal diploid karyotype; one atypical case resulted in a diploid karyotype but with <b>endoreduplications</b> in 13 % of metaphases, and a second atypical oncocytoma became hypodiploid without structural anomalies.

40|$|The {{extremely}} {{rapid growth}} of feeding larvae of Calliphora is achieved with a hypertrophy of larval epidermal cells and concomitant polytene specialization of their nuclei. Within the epidermis of each abdominal segment are differentiated sense organs of the campaniform and a more complex- possibly chemosensory- kind in a constant pattern; there is no post-embryonic differentiation of new sense organs before metamorphosis, while the cuticle-secreting cell of these sense organs also becomes polytene. The polytene organization of epidermal nuclei differs from the classical giant chromosome structures of lower dipteran larval cells. Calliphora epidermal polytene chromosomes irregu-larly fragment into oligotene or smaller fibrils which, through apparently non-specific reasso-ciations, form a nuclear reticulum of which the banded polytene regions are a part. This loose reticular organization is unlikely to reflect a condition of genetic activity. Photometric densitometry shows the period of polytene DNA replication in general epidermal nuclei is closely correlated with the period of larval growth. At hatching, epidermal nuclei are diploid, with the 2 C DNA content. Through a series of <b>endoreduplications,</b> such that at any stage nuclei tend to fall {{into a series of}} DNA classes with a percentage falling in between, the largest polytene nuclei reach about 256 C {{by the end of the}} feeding stage. During the feeding stage, whole mount autoradiography shows a very slow continuation of DNA synthesis in some epidermal nuclei; that is, after cessation of larval growth. DNA synthesis in cupologen nuclei of the campaniform organs ceases after secretion of the third instar cuticle at the end of the second instar. The polytene cycle responsible for nuclear DNA increase is discussed in the context of these data, and a functional correlation drawn for the rate of polytene increase in the epidermal nuclei and the cupologen nuclei. This correlation suggests active control of the cycle, and raises the question of the significance of the polytene cell cycle...|$|R
50|$|Polyploidy occurs {{commonly}} in plants, {{but rarely}} in animals. Even in diploid organisms, many somatic cells are polyploid {{due to a}} process called <b>endoreduplication</b> where duplication of the genome occurs without mitosis (cell division).|$|E
50|$|Because triploids discard this genome, {{which is}} {{available}} in one copy and leave two copies of second genome, they dont perform <b>endoreduplication.</b> Moreover, this not eliminated genome is transmitted to haploid gametes sexually, not clonally (recombined between two Ls or between two Rs), {{in contrast to the}} genome of diploid hybrids.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{chromosome}} number is generally reduced {{only by the}} specialized process of meiosis, the somatic cells of the body inherit and maintain the {{chromosome number}} of the zygote. However, in many situations somatic cells double their copy number by means of <b>endoreduplication</b> as an aspect of cellular differentiation. For example, the hearts of two-year-old children contain 85% diploid and 15% tetraploid nuclei, but by 12 years of age the proportions become approximately equal, and adults examined contained 27% diploid, 71% tetraploid and 2% octaploid nuclei.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to increasing {{the volume of}} the cells' nuclei and causing cell expansion, polytene cells may also have a metabolic advantage as multiple copies of genes permits a high level of gene expression. In Drosophila melanogaster, for example, the chromosomes of the larval salivary glands undergo many rounds of <b>endoreduplication,</b> to produce large amounts of glue before pupation. Another example within the organism itself is the tandem duplication of various polytene bands located near the centromere of the X chromosome which results in the Bar phenotype of kidney-shaped eyes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Endoreduplication</b> (also {{referred}} to as endoreplication or polytenization) is replication of the nuclear genome {{in the absence of}} cell division, which leads to elevated nuclear gene content and polyploidy. Endoreplication can be understood simply as a variant form of the mitotic cell cycle (G1-S-G2-M) in which mitosis is aborted prior to cytokinesis or circumvented entirely, due in part to modulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. [...] Examples of endoreplication characterized in arthropod, mammalian, and plant species suggest that it is a universal developmental mechanism responsible for the differentiation and morphogenesis of cell types that fulfill an array of biological functions. While endoreplication is often limited to specific cell types in animals, it is considerably more widespread in plants, such that polyploidy can be detected in the majority of plant tissues.|$|E
50|$|Females {{can produce}} full clones of {{themselves}} through {{a modification of}} the normal meiosis process used to produce haploid egg cells for sexual reproduction. The female's germ cells undergo a process of premeiotic genome doubling, or <b>endoreduplication,</b> so that two consecutive division cycles {{in the process of}} meoisis result in a diploid, rather than haploid, genome. Whereas homologous chromosomes pair and separate during meiosis I in sexual species, identical duplicate sister chromosomes, produced through premeiotic replication, pair and separate during meiosis I in true parthenotes. Pairing of identical sister chromosomes, in comparison to the alternative of pairing homologous chromosomes, maintains heterozygosity in obligate parthenotes. Meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids in both sexual and parthenogenetic species. This method of parthenogenesis is observed in obligate parthenotes, such as lizards in the genus Cnemidophorus and Lacerta, and also in certain facultative parthenotes like the Burmese python.|$|E

40|$|In many {{developing}} plant tissues and organs, differentiating cells switch from the classical cell cycle to an alternative partial cycle.

This partial cycle {{is referred to as}} <b>endoreduplication.</b> Cell division and <b>endoreduplication</b> are important processes for biomass allocation and yield in tomato. Quantitative trait loci for tomato fruit size or weight are frequently associated with variations in the pericarp cell number, and due to the tight connection between <b>endoreduplication</b> and cell expansion and the prevalence of polyploidy in storage tissues, a functional correlation between nuclear ploidy number and cell growth has also been implicated (karyoplasmic ratio theory).

Investigating the inheritance of variation in <b>endoreduplication</b> in maize endosperm will begin to elucidate the genetic mechanisms controlling it. It has been hypothesized that retinoblastoma-related proteins (RRBs) negatively regulate the G 1 /S transition during both mitotic and <b>endoreduplication</b> cell cycles. Testing this hypothesis in both mitotic cells and endoreduplicating endosperm cells will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating <b>endoreduplication.</b> Flow cytometry was used to assess the variability of <b>endoreduplication</b> in endosperms of maize inbred lines.

Although the role of <b>endoreduplication</b> is unclear, it is thought to provide a mechanism that increases cell size and enhances gene expression. To investigate this process, we reduced <b>endoreduplication</b> in transgenic maize endosperm by ectopically expressing a gene encoding a dominant negative mutant form of cyclin-dependent kinase A.

Although epidermal cells require <b>endoreduplication</b> to enhance cellular expansion, the issue of whether this mechanism is sufficient for explaining cell {{size distribution}} remains unclear {{due to a lack of}} quantitative understanding linking the occurrence of <b>endoreduplication</b> with cell size diversity. Here, we addressed this question by quantitatively summarizing ploidy profile and cell size distribution using a simple theoretical framework. We first found that <b>endoreduplication</b> dynamics is a Poisson process through cellular maturation. This finding allowed us to construct a mathematical model to predict the time evolution of a ploidy profile with a single rate constant for <b>endoreduplication</b> occurrence in a given time. We reproduced experimentally measured ploidy profile in both wild-type leaf tissue and endoreduplication-related mutants with this analytical solution, further demonstrating the probabilistic property of <b>endoreduplication.</b> We next extended the mathematical model by incorporating the element that cell size is determined according to ploidy level to examine cell size distribution. This analysis revealed that cell size is exponentially enlarged 1. 5 times every <b>endoreduplication</b> round. Because this theoretical simulation successfully recapitulated experimentally observed cell size distributions, we concluded that Poissonian <b>endoreduplication</b> dynamics and exponential size-boosting are the sources of the broad cell size distribution in epidermal tissue.

40|$|<b>Endore{{duplication}}</b> is {{a process}} of genome duplication without mitosis. Although <b>endoreduplication</b> is common among plants and animals, the molecular mechanisms involved with this process are not fully understood. Two strategies were used to determine the genetic components involved with <b>endoreduplication.</b> One, based on QTL analysis and the other strategy involved identifying cell cycle candidate genes, and characterizing them in regard to <b>endoreduplication.</b> To map genes influencing <b>endoreduplication,</b> four backcross populations were created from crosses between a high (Sg 18) and a low (Mo 17) <b>endoreduplication</b> inbred and their F 1 (Sg 18 x Mo 17) progeny. In all, fourteen quantitative trait loci were identified that affect the degree of <b>endoreduplication</b> in maize endosperm. Six QTLs were mapped with a triploid mode of inheritance in the endosperm. Two QTLs were mapped with parent-of-origin effect inheritance. Six QTLs were mapped using a model that considers genetic interaction between embryo and endosperm. Previous studies with maize endosperm showed that accumulation of a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor is coincident with the onset of <b>endoreduplication,</b> but the identity of this inhibitor is unknown. We therefore tried to determine if cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) activity is required for the occurrence of <b>endoreduplication</b> in maize endosperm. The expression of two maize CKI genes, Zeama;CKI; 1 and Zeama;CKI; 2, were characterized in developing endosperm. The accumulation of Zeama;CKI; 1 RNA is not developmentally regulated, and its expression encompasses the period in which <b>endoreduplication</b> takes place. In contrast, Zeama;CKI; 2 gene expression is developmentally regulated in the endosperm, since its protein level decreases after 13 DAP. Both proteins were able to inhibit the maize Cdc 2 /CDK kinase activity associated with p 13 Suc 1. They also specifically inhibited cyclin A 1; 3 / and cyclin D 5; 1 /-associated CDK activities, but not cyclin B 1; 3 /CDK. Although Zeama;CKI; 1 was found {{to be associated with the}} endosperm CKI activity, it did not account for all of the CDK inhibitor. Over-expression of ZeamaCKI 1 in maize embryonic calli that ectopically expressed the wheat dwarf virus RepA protein, which counteracts retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR) function in the cell cycle, led to an additional round of DNA replication without nuclear division.

In the process of searching for regulatory factors of <b>endoreduplication,</b> the promoter of an Arabidopsis thaliana cyclin A gene, CYCA 2; 3, was revealed to be active in developing trichomes during the termination period of <b>endoreduplication</b> as well as in proliferating tissues. Taking advantage of the situation that plants encode highly redundant cyclin A genes, we were able to perform functional dissection of CYCA 2; 3 using null mutant alleles. Null mutations of CYCA 2; 3 semidominantly promoted endocycles and increased the ploidy levels achieved in mature organs, but they did not significantly affect the proportion of cells that underwent <b>endoreduplication.</b> Consistent with this result, expression of the CYCA 2; 3 –green fluorescent protein fusion protein restrained endocycles in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, a mutation in the destruction box of CYCA 2; 3 stabilized the fusion protein in the nuclei and enhanced the restraint. We conclude that CYCA 2; 3 negatively regulates endocycles and acts as a key regulator of ploidy levels in Arabidopsis <b>endoreduplication...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractEntry into S {{phase of}} the mitotic cell cycle is {{normally}} strictly dependent on progression through the preceding M phase. In contrast, during <b>endoreduplication,</b> which accompanies post-mitotic cell growth in many organisms, repeated S phases occur without intervening M phases. Upon transition from mitotic to <b>endoreduplication</b> cycles in Drosophila embryos, expression of the mitotic cyclins A, B and B 3 is terminated and Cyclin E expression is changed from a continuous into a periodic mode [1 – 3]. Here, we address whether these changes in cyclin expression are required for <b>endoreduplication</b> by continuously expressing Cyclin A, B, B 3 or E in the salivary glands of Drosophila throughout late embryonic and larval development. With the exception of Cyclin A, expression of which inhibited <b>endoreduplication</b> effectively but only in a few, apparently randomly distributed, cells of the salivary gland, mitotic cyclin expression {{was found to have}} no effect. In contrast, Cyclin E expression resulted in a striking inhibition of <b>endoreduplication</b> and growth, preceded initially by an ectopic S phase occurring just after the onset of ectopic Cyclin E expression. This observation is consistent with our previous findings that Cyclin E is required, and pulses of ectopic expression are sufficient, for triggering <b>endoreduplication</b> S phases [4]. Our results indicate that Cyclin E activity, which triggers DNA replication, needs to be down-regulated to allow a subsequent S phase in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Genome <b>endoreduplication</b> during {{mammalian}} {{development is}} a rare event for which the mechanism is unknown. It first appears when fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF 4) deprivation induces differentiation of trophoblast stem (TS) cells into the nonproliferating trophoblast giant (TG) cells required for embryo implantation. Here we show that RO 3306 inhibition of cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDK 1), the enzyme required to enter mitosis, induced differentiation of TS cells into TG cells. In contrast, RO 3306 induced abortive <b>endoreduplication</b> and apoptosis in embryonic stem cells, revealing that inactivation of CDK 1 triggers <b>endoreduplication</b> only in cells programmed to differentiate into polyploid cells. Similarly, FGF 4 deprivation resulted in CDK 1 inhibition by overexpressing two CDK-specific inhibitors, p 57 /KIP 2 and p 21 /CIP 1. TS cell mutants revealed that p 57 was required to trigger <b>endoreduplication</b> by inhibiting CDK 1, while p 21 suppressed expression of the checkpoint protein kinase CHK 1, thereby preventing induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, Cdk 2 −/− TS cells revealed that CDK 2 is required for <b>endoreduplication</b> when CDK 1 is inhibited. Expression of p 57 in TG cells was restricted to G-phase nuclei to allow CDK activation of S phase. Thus, <b>endoreduplication</b> in TS cells is triggered by p 57 inhibition of CDK 1 with concomitant suppression of the DNA damage response by p 21...|$|E
30|$|<b>Endoreduplication</b> {{serves as}} the {{speeding}} process of the development and growth of floral organs, even though the changes in endopolyploidy of flowers of T. pratense during their development are almost negligible. Thus, we assume, while endopolyploidy definitely plays its role during the developmental process of T. pratense flowers, the quantitative changes do not speak of significant differences. Recent studies (Kocová and Mártonfi 2011; Straková et al. 2014; this study) provide a comprehensive insight into the <b>endoreduplication</b> pattern of T. pratense, thus proving permanent presence of <b>endoreduplication</b> {{in the life of}} plants, starting with seedlings throughout the aging of flowers.|$|E
