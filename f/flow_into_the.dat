5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the new course caused more {{pollution}} to <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay near the Ashbridges' land.

The home which was once next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water.|$|E

5|$|The main valleys {{between the}} hills {{are filled with}} {{alluvial}} deposits from the hills or sea. The county has many small rivers, most of which <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Channel. Many of the latter rivers now have clysts (the local name for a sluice) on them to control the sea, but formerly they were tidal for some way inland. The main exception to this is the River Parrett, which still has a tidal bore. However the Chew and the Frome <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Avon which forms most of the northern county boundary with Gloucestershire. The Cale flows into Dorset through the Blackmore Vale, while the Exe flows into Devon. The (Dorset) Axe, the Culm and the Otter rise in Somerset but flow into Dorset.|$|E
5|$|The salt-tolerant {{mangrove}} margin {{has expanded}} inland as freshwater <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay has been channelized, replacing freshwater sawgrass marshes. The L-31E coastal storm surge levee inland of the park's western boundary {{has played a}} significant role in isolating former freshwater marshlands from their water sources. At the same time, tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Early {{maps and}} deeds {{indicate}} that <b>the</b> Stony Clove <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Warner Bushkill, or alternatively named, the Barber Bushkill, before <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Esopus.

5|$|The {{waters of}} the Severn Estuary, which are heavily laden with silt, <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower reaches of the Parrett and the Tone on each tide. This silt can rapidly gather {{on the banks of}} the rivers, {{reducing}} the capacity and performance of the channel, and increasing the risk of flooding of surrounding land.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wings.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth {{lies between}} the River Plym {{to the east}} and the River Tamar to the west; both rivers <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> natural harbour of Plymouth Sound. Since 1967, the unitary {{authority}} of Plymouth has included the, once independent, towns of Plympton and Plymstock which lie along the east of the River Plym. The River Tamar forms the county boundary between Devon and Cornwall and its estuary forms the Hamoaze on which is sited Devonport Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{rivers in}} this list cross or form {{international}} boundaries. Two—the Yukon and Columbia rivers—begin in Canada and <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> United States. Three—the Milk and Saint Lawrence rivers and the Red River of the North—{{begin in the}} United States and flow into Canada. Of these, only the Milk River crosses the international border twice, leaving and then re-entering the United States. Two rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, begin in the United States and flow into or form a border with Mexico. In addition, the drainage basins of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers extend into Canada, and the basin of the Gila River extends into Mexico.|$|E
