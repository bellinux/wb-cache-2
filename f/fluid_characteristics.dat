25|$|The {{materials}} balance method for an oil field uses an equation that relates {{the volume of}} oil, water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in reservoir pressure to calculate the remaining oil. It assumes that, as fluids from the reservoir are produced, {{there will be a}} change in the reservoir pressure that depends on the remaining volume of oil and gas. The method requires extensive pressure-volume-temperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field. It requires some production to occur (typically 5% to 10% of ultimate recovery), unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and <b>fluid</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E

40|$|Swirl {{turbulent}} flow is intensively {{used by the}} industrial equipments such as combustion, separation and heat transfer equipments. The <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> of this flow {{are influenced by the}} chamber’s geometries and the operating conditions. One of the important operating condition variables which greatly affects the <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> is initial tangential intensity (ITI) or often known as swirl number. This study is aimed to quantify the effect of the initial tangential intensity on the <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> in a tangential burner. The method of the study is based on the computational fluid dynamic simulation under the Ansys Fluent CFD engine. The <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> were modeled using the standard k-ε turbulent model. The simulation results exhibited that the three dimensional flow structure in a tangential burner is dominated by the tangential flow. The fluid dynamic simulations also showed that the effect of the ITI on the mean turbulence intensity and the mean residence time begin to be significant at the ITI values ≥ 1. 1 and ≥ 4. 5 respectively, while at low ITI values, its effects on both variables are insignificant. The lowest pressure drop obtained in this study was found on the burner with ITI value of 3. 2...|$|R

The <b>fluid</b> <b>characteristics</b> of winter diesel are also extended allowing a diesel type of CFPP -15 °C to be operated safely in -24 °C weather conditions.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a counter-rotating fan was conducted with {{special attention to the}} effects of the supporter shape of the electric motor and the distance between two rotors on the fluid dynamic and fan noise characteristics. A comparison of the fan noise and the <b>fluid</b> dynamic <b>characteristics</b> between the counter-rotating fan and a two-stage rotor fan was also made.

The larger the distance between two rotors is, the lower the fan efficiency and the fan noise are.

In comparison with blending diesel fuel with lighter fuel (that has a lower CFPP) the usage of additives is cheaper and gas stations in cold regions offer diesel fuel with additives {{at no extra cost}} (see below). If the gas station offers winterized diesel you should not add additional additives - the <b>fluid</b> <b>characteristics</b> may deteriorate due to incompatible additives and the CFPP enhancement may be reversed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the field}} of cryogenics, helium He is {{utilized}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. The combination of helium’s extremely low molecular weight and weak interatomic reactions yield interesting properties when helium is cooled below its critical temperature of 5.2 K to form a liquid. Even at absolute zero (0K), helium does not condense to form a solid. In this state, the zero point vibrational energies of helium are comparable to very weak interatomic binding interactions, thus preventing lattice formation and giving helium its <b>fluid</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Within this liquid state, helium has two phases referred to as helium I and helium II. Helium I displays thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of classical fluids, along with quantum characteristics. However, below its lambda point of 2.17 K, helium transitions to He II and becomes a quantum superfluid with zero viscosity.|$|E
5000|$|The CrCL is {{composed}} of two bands, a craniomedial band and a caudolateral band. It functions to stop cranial (anterior) movement of the tibia {{with respect to the}} femur, hyperextension of the stifle joint and internal rotation of the tibia. The cranial cruciate ligament is thought to be able to resist a force equivalent to four times the weight of the dog before it ruptures, but often the ligament is weakened by arthritis that is present in the joint. Arthritis infers inflammation of the joint; in this condition there is the production of a joint fluid that is less viscous and therefore less able to absorb shock than normal fluid. Joint fluid's other role is to provide nutrition to the cartilage and the cruciate ligaments. The situation is a little like a chicken-and-egg scenario: it is usually accepted that the CrCL ruptures because arthritis has caused the ligament to weaken because of poor joint <b>fluid</b> <b>characteristics,</b> but what causes the arthritis in the first place - a partial cruciate tear? ...|$|E

30|$|Liquid-rich gas {{reservoirs}} {{are abundant}} in condensate content despite its classification as gas reservoirs. Undersaturated liquid-rich gas reservoirs are presented initially in a gaseous phase. Once depletion is undertaken {{and the pressure}} drops below dew point, condensate will drop out and accumulate near the production channels. The accumulation period is relevant to the <b>fluid’s</b> <b>characteristics</b> and depends on the production settings. During the accumulation period, the productivity declines due to the impairment of flow near the flowing channels. The severity of such experience becomes significant in tighter formations.
