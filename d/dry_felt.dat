40|$|Many {{elements}} are rapidly released from oxide matrices. Some oxide powder targets show a fast sintering, thus losing their favorable release characteristics. Loosely packed oxyde fiber targets are less critical since they may maintain their open structure even when starting to fuse together at some contact points. The experience with various oxyde fiber targets (titania, zirconia, ceria and thoria) {{used in the}} last years at ISOLDE is reviewed. For short-lived isotopes of Cu, Ga and Xe the zirconia and ceria targets respectively provided significantly higher yields than any other target (metal foils, oxide powders, etc.) tested before. Titania fibers, which were not commercially available, were produced in a relic process by impregnation of a rayon felt in a titanium chloride solution and subsequent calcination by heating the <b>dried</b> <b>felt</b> in air. Thoria fibers were obtained either by the same process or by burning commercial gas lantern mantle cloth. In the future a beryllia fiber target could be used to produce very intense ^ 6 He beams (order of 10 ^ 13 ions per s) via the ^ 9 Be(n, alpha) reaction using spallation neutrons...|$|R

50|$|Wool {{has also}} been {{traditionally}} used to cover cloth diapers. Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and {{the interior of the}} wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain <b>dry.</b> Wool <b>felted</b> and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} electrode {{having a}} gold coating {{for use in}} the anode compartment of a REDOX cell is described. The anode fluid utilizes a chromic/chromous couple. A carbon felt is soaked in methanol, rinsed in water, dried and then heated in KOH after which it is again washed in deionized water and <b>dried.</b> The <b>felt</b> is then moistened with a methanol water solution containing chloroauric acid and is stored in a dark place while still in contact with the gold-containing solution. After all the gold-containing solution is absorbed in the felt, the latter is dried by heat and then heat treated at a substantially greater temperature. The felt is then suitable for use as an electrode and is wetted with water or up to two molar HCl prior to installation in a REDOX cell. The novelty of the invention lies in the use of KOH for cleaning the felt and the use of alcohol as a carrier for the gold together with the heat treating procedure...|$|R

5000|$|Especially in the 19th century, {{inorganic}} {{mercury in}} the form of mercuric nitrate was commonly used in the production of felt for hats. [...] During a process called carroting, in which furs from small animals such as rabbits, hares or beavers were separated from their skins and matted together, an orange-colored solution containing mercuric nitrate was used as a smoothing agent. The resulting felt was then repeatedly shaped into large cones, shrunk in boiling water and <b>dried.</b> In treated <b>felts,</b> a slow reaction released volatile free mercury. Hatters (or milliners) who came into contact with vapours from the impregnated felt often worked in confined areas.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the practical investigation {{and analysis of}} traditional materials and processes used {{in the production of}} hand made felt. Specifically, the research examines the potential of certain British wool types that are currently undervalued (and often overlooked in the production of fine craft felt). These wools are frequently referred to as ‘waste’ wools. The research further explores aspects of the UK’s wool economy and the problematic issue of waste wool. The aim being to locate and articulate the creative potential of a selection of these wools within the field of fine felt craft practice, and in so doing raise an awareness of their potential diversity and relevance. The investigation questions felt’s marginal status within the textile hierarchy, and problematizes notions of the familial and self-conscious attributed to felt craft by some of its makers. By examining distinctions between craft and industrial felt production, the research considers both the opportunities and limitations of these relationships within the context of designer maker practice. The purpose and focus of this material-led examination is to develop inventive, progressive methods in fine felt craft and couture application seeking material currency with appropriate use of waste wools for handwork production. The practical experimentation was conducted using a practice-led research approach through which materials and sampling methods emerged within a studio-based environment. The study focuses on the use of carding, wet and <b>dry</b> <b>felting</b> and post felting manipulation of surface design using hand-pleating applications. Whilst not specifically suggesting new techniques in felt-making, the modification of existing processes has formed a central part of the contribution to new knowledge created within the work. Therefore the qualitative nature of the research methodology establishes a new perspective on both the value and integrity of British waste wools for the production of fine craft felt-making. The portfolio of fabrics produced confirmed the suitability of materials for fine craft felt-making and further suggested their appropriateness for product development and use. The fabric prototypes and exposition collection evidence new design concepts, situating the practical investigations in a cultural and critical context and in so doing reposition the material in a more valuable and original light. The sampling process identified key areas for innovation and aesthetic appeal suggesting that further research could be developed using other wools and wool blends. From this thesis emerges a vibrant platform for fresh interpretation and potential for British waste wools in fine craft felt-making, further strengthening the creative interplay between material and technique.

40|$|Sheep wool is {{an ancient}} {{material}} of exceptional natural properties and has some advantages over synthetic materials that are widespread used, beside {{the impact on the}} environment {{is becoming more and more}} problematic. For this reason, knowledge about the wool in the kindergartens seems even more important. That way child can connect with the nature and the environment and can produce numerous useful products that wool technology allows. Because the usage of the wool is very broad, we believe it is very important for children in kindergarten to learn the wool harvest procedure and other wool related technological procedures. The goal of this thesis is to present the variety of activities with the sheep’s wool and to motivate other kindergartens to use this material. The problem is unfamiliarity with the material itself. In the theoretical part we introduce the wool processing and wool treatment, followed by introduction of different techniques and technologies that we can use in kindergarten. We also wrote a baseline of child development and games. The children showed great interest for the activities. We continued with <b>dry</b> <b>felting</b> making brooches which included felting with the needle. When children mastered wool handling each of them made a product on their own. Some help was necessary with young children, like making a bow tie and handling a needle. Wet felting proved to be the favourite activity for the children. With teacher's guidance they were able to make a product (felt-drawing). All products have been quality constructed. Children did pay attention to details like transparent parts which they connected with the wool on the base layer. Weaving proved to be more difficult for younger children. Children were able to detect possible problems with the yarn and the sticks and were able to fix it themselves. Younger children were not able to weave on their own yet. They were more interested in the process itself, than the product. With this kind of material children dealt the first time when making a bottom part of the handbags. The activity making a toy was done on their own as well. It proved that sewing a toy was not a difficulty. Proper environment, quiet space was all that children needed. The activity was implemented only with older children. Everyone was able to cut and sew. Filling up the toy with wool to stand upright proved to be more challenging. After trying out some options, most children have succeeded. During the activity children were persistent, accurate doing the fine work, creative, and overall most products were finished and put up on exhibition. The activity itself, material and technology all together proved to be suitable for creative activities in the kindergarten. ...|$|R

60|$|As he {{expected}} {{he found that}} it made an admirable burning-glass, its only drawback being {{that it was only}} available when the sun was overhead. Almost instantaneously as the focus fell upon the wood the latter began to smoke, and {{in less than a minute}} a flame sprang up. Some small splinters that he had got ready were placed on it, and in a very short time a fire was blazing. As soon as the wood was well alight he had poured off the water and very carefully wiped the glass and the rim that held it. He went a short distance away as soon as the fire was burning well, and was pleased to find that no smoke was given off, the sun having dried the wreckage until not the slightest particle of moisture remained in it. He now kept a sharp look-out along the shore, but it was not until nearly five o’clock that he saw his companions issue from the trees a mile and a half away and move along the sand. He went down to the well, took out the meat, and brought it up and laid it on the rock to <b>dry.</b> He <b>felt</b> sure that by this time the water would have removed the greater portion of the salt, and that he would now be able to roast it satisfactorily.|$|R

He lingered while Mary gathered together her music, and waited again to light his pipe, {{so that when they}} came out of the Vicarage gates the rest of the company were no longer in sight. The day had become overcast and sombre; on the even surface of the sky floated little ragged black clouds, like the fragments cast to the wind of some widowed, ample garment. It had grown cold, and James, accustomed to a warmer air, shivered a little. The country suddenly appeared cramped and circumscribed; in the fading light a dulness of colour came over tree and hedgerow which was singularly depressing. They walked in silence, while James looked for words. All day he had been trying to find some manner to express himself, but his mind, perplexed and weary, refused to help him. The walk to Mary's house could not take more than five minutes, and he saw the distance slipping away rapidly. If he meant to say anything it must be said at once; and his mouth was <b>dry,</b> he <b>felt</b> almost a physical inability to speak. He {{did not know how to}} prepare the way, how to approach the subject; and he was doubly tormented by the absolute necessity of breaking the silence.|$|R

60|$|This {{dialogue}} between Wallace and the Spaniard gave Spike a little leisure for reflection. As the day advanced the cruiser came {{more and more}} plainly in view, and his first business was {{to take a good}} survey of her.
