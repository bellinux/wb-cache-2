60|$|Bellamy <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door,--a man {{had looked}} in and departed.|$|E
60|$|Skim listened, with {{a nervous}} <b>glance</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> doorway. Then {{he shook his}} head.|$|R
60|$|He {{thanked her}} with a smile, and went on with a <b>glance</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> meadow.|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{ascended to}} the {{hurricane}} deck and cast a longing <b>glance</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pilot-house.|$|R

6000|$|... "Even Sir William?" [...] {{suggested}} Randolph, half smiling, yet wondering at her unlooked-for serious shrewdness as he <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sofa.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan stooped {{and picked}} up the dead man's weapon, a smile upon his face as he turned and <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> young Englishman.|$|E

6000|$|... "Unfortunately I had {{forgotten}} to put my translatophone into my pocket, and it was lying in full view on the table. Mary gave a scornful <b>glance</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> innocent tube.|$|R
60|$|Having {{concluded}} this sentiment, {{the marine}} again <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> blacksmith's daughter. Her eyes were slightly moist, {{and her face}} was glowing with a certain enthusiasm.|$|E
6000|$|Neither {{of the men}} <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> little group; but a {{bystander}} who {{had been}} present at the trial, said loud enough to be heard by both: ...|$|E
60|$|Louise {{paused for}} a moment in the act of helping herself to hors d'oeuvres. She <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> prince. He was busy {{studying}} the menu through his eyeglass.|$|E

60|$|COKESON. [Buttonholing him, and <b>glancing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> partners' room] Of course he's a young man. I've {{told him}} about it before now-- leaving space after his figures, but he will do it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw him <b>glance</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door of {{the room}} where Jack and Zilla were, and I knew then {{what it meant to}} be a man's friend from Bob's point of view." ...|$|R
60|$|Flora <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door of {{the room}} her father had entered with George. Edgar thought she had done so unconsciously; but it was {{somewhat}} suggestive, though {{he could not see}} what it implied.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{enterprise}} also exceedeth all {{the usual}} bounds of risks and adventures, Señora," [...] was the steady reply of Doña Beatriz, as she <b>glanced</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> countenance of Mercedes. [...] "Noble efforts deserve noble rewards." ...|$|E
