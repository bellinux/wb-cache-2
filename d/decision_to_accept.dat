5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in her <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the part by her husband's {{appreciation of the}} series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to accounting and auditing literature by addressing two empirical questions: (1) whether litigation environment affects auditors' <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> clients' aggressive reporting and (2) whether litigation environment, client business risk, and client retention pressure interact and jointly affect auditors' <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> {{go along with}} clients' preferred accounting choices. Fifty-nine (59) US and sixty-one (61) Hong Kong auditors employed by the Big- 4 accounting firms participated in this study. The result shows that litigation environment has {{a significant effect on}} auditors' decisions. Auditors who practice in more litigious environments tend to be less willing to go along with clients' aggressive reporting than those who practice in less litigious environments. This study also confirms that there is a significant interactive effect between litigation environment, client business risk, and client retention pressure on auditors' <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> clients' aggressive reporting choices. Implications of the empirical findings for policymakers, standard-setting organizations, and international accounting firms, as well as directions for future studies, are discussed.

5|$|Relations between Reddy and Desai soon soured {{over the}} latter's {{promotion}} of his son, Kanti Desai, {{in politics and}} over Desai's communication with Chief Ministers Vengala Rao and Channa Reddy {{on the issue of}} land ceilings in Andhra Pradesh. Following mass defections from the Janata Party and from the cabinet, Morarji Desai's 30-month-old government ended in July 1979 after he handed in his resignation to Reddy before a no-confidence motion could be tabled against his government in Parliament. Reddy's actions following Desai's resignation have been much debated. His <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Desai's resignation before an alternative government created a ministerial vacuum in the executive according to H. M. Seervai. The faction of the Janata Party supporting Desai continued to have the support of 205 MPs as opposed to Charan Singh's 80 MPs. Reddy used presidential discretion in choosing Charan Singh as the next Prime Minister over a contending claim from Jagjivan Ram, the leader of the Janata Party.|$|E

For many, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> polygamy and practice it was an agonizing and difficult process that brought them closer to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it.

The Welsh were victorious, and the battle ended the traditional hegemony of Mercia over north Wales and contributed to Æthelred's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex. This united the Anglo-Saxons who were not living under Viking rule under Alfred, and was a step towards the creation of the kingdom of England. Anarawd allied himself with the Vikings shortly after the battle, but he then abandoned this alliance to follow Æthelred in accepting Alfred's lordship.|$|E

The donor lung is placed, the blood vessels reattached, and the lung reinflated. To make sure the lung is satisfactory and to clear any remaining blood and mucus in the new lung a bronchoscopy will be performed.

25|$|Reserve auction is {{an auction}} where the item for sale {{may not be}} sold if the final bid is not high enough to satisfy the seller; that is, the seller {{reserves}} the right to accept or reject the highest bid. In these cases a set 'reserve' price known to the auctioneer, but not necessarily to the bidders, may have been set, below which the item may not be sold. The reserve price may be fixed or discretionary. In the latter case, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a bid is deferred to the auctioneer, who may accept a bid that is marginally below it. A reserve auction is safer for the seller than a no-reserve auction as they {{are not required to}} accept a low bid, but this could result in a lower final price if less interest is generated in the sale.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Kawasaki {{proposed}} {{the development of}} a utility-orientated derivative of the OH-1 in response to the fledgling UH-X programme, which intended to replace the JGSDF's outdated fleet of Fuji-built Bell UH-1J Iroquois helicopters. This variant, which would have used the OH-1 as a base, would have featured a new cabin, avionics, transmission and engines, but would have also retained a high level of commonality between the observation and utility models. In 2006, the Japanese government approved a request to fund development of a more powerful variant of the OH-1’s Mitsubishi TS1-10 engine. In March 2007, Kawasaki was reportedly close to finalizing its plans for the utility-orientated OH-1 derivative of the OH-1. In 2012, a refreshed proposal for the UH-X requirement was made by Kawasaki, emphasizing its use of OH-1 technology.

25|$|Following his {{imposition}} of a royal dictatorship, Carol II reconfirmed Gigurtu {{as a member of}} the Superior Economic Council in April 1938. He then made him Public Works and Communications Minister (November 1939June 1940), Foreign Minister (June 1June 28, 1940) and state secretary with ministerial rank (June 28July 4, 1940) in successive cabinets led by Gheorghe Tătărescu. This coincided with a dire situation, in which the Soviet Union pressured Romania into ceding the regions of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (see Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina). As a member of the specially-convened Crown Council, Gigurtu himself participated in the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Soviet demands. As the country was left isolated when its alliance with the United Kingdom and France crumbled, and came under increasing pressure from Nazi Germany, Carol dismissed Tătărescu. Earlier, Gigurtu's appointment as Foreign Minister had marked a turn toward Germany: he was replacing the Western-oriented Grigore Gafencu, who favoured a continuation of Romania's policy of official neutrality, and this immediately led to a treaty committing delivery of a fixed quantity of Romanian petroleum to Germany in exchange for military equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} of athletics stadiums in England is very poor compared to most other developed countries. The {{main reason for}} this is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the UK since the Second World War, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. The largest existing stadium is the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. London's largest athletics venue is Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. It will be superseded by the Olympic Stadium, which will be built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but will most likely be reduced to 60,000 seats after the Games with the London organising committee's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> West Ham United's bid to take over the stadium. There are two Athletic stadiums in Birmingham the Alexander Stadium (12,700 capacity) which is home to UK Athletics and there is also the National Indoor Arena (14,150) which is also used for other events.|$|E

We present a new randomized algorithm for this problem, and we prove matching upper and lower bounds to establish that the competitive ratio of this algorithm, against an oblivious adversary, is the best possible. We also observe that when the adversary is adaptive, no randomized algorithm can improve the competitive ratio of the optimal deterministic algorithm. Thus, our work completely resolves the question of what competitive ratios can be achieved by randomized algorithms for the matroid buyback problem. ...|$|R
