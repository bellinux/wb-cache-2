The authors entered upon the study through a conviction that serious international competition in this technology may appear in the next few years, and a desire to ensure for the United States as favorable an opportunity to meet this competition as research can make available. Both the ubiquitous nature of micro-electronics in defense applications and the particularly severe special defense requirements for complex, low-power, micro-miniaturized circuitry make a commanding lead in this technology very important. The authors wished to assure themselves and ARPA that the existing research programs provide adequately for the forthcoming needs of the nation. The report details some high-leverage research areas, not now receiving government or private support, where relatively small, advanced research efforts may have substantial payoff. No endorsement of the study conclusions by ARPA is implied or intended...|$|E
40|$|A {{hologram}} recording geometry {{that was}} {{total internal reflection}} of the reference and reconstruction beams from a photosensitive material surface is used to achieve 0. 5 -,um resolution at X = 457 nm in the readout of a reconstructed image on a photoresist. Such a geometry has demonstrated stable image quality for parallel displacement within the illuminated area and diffraction efficiency tolerance within a + 2 ' tilt about the axis of the reconstruction beam. The total-internal-reflection recording system provides double-fringe sets for each plane component inside the volume hologram; therefore, a diffraction efficiency as high as 80 % was observed. The result is applicable to high-volume submicrometer lithography and can be expanded to a 20 -cm (8 -in.) semiconductor submicrometer pattern.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomenon}} of periodic pulling which occurs in certain <b>integrated</b> <b>microcircuits</b> of relevant interest in applications, namely the injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFDs). They are modelled as second-order driven oscillators working in the subharmonic (secondary) resonance regime, i. e., when the self-oscillating frequency is close (resonant) to an integer submultiple n of the driving frequency. Under the assumption of weak injection, we find the spectrum of the system’s oscillatory response in the unlocked mode through closed-form expressions, showing that such spectrum is double-sided and asymmetric, unlike the single-sided spectrum of systems with primary resonance (n= 1). An analytical expression for the amplitude modulation of the oscillatory response is also presented. Numerical results are presented to support theoretical relations derived...|$|R

Reduction in system cost, volume and weight as well as increase in system performances are only few of the most obvious advantages. Sometimes, though, deciding to apply an ASIC design solution to an analogue or mixed-signal circuit can imply difficult decisions and trade-offs either in terms of technology and quality level offered on the market, or in terms of investments required to set-up a mixed-mode design environment and train enough resources.

40|$|In {{last few}} years the {{increase}} in the level of functions required of wireless communications has necessitated the use of higher frequency ranges. As a result of this progress a very rapid growth of applications of Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics in wireless communications has been observed recently. The Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) Technology has been extensively explored in the microelectronics industry as a ceramic packaging technology for <b>integrated</b> <b>microcircuits</b> [1 - 2]. Additionally, LTCC was applied for the production of sensors and actuators due to its very good electrical and mechanical properties, high reliability and stability as well as possibility of making three dimensional (3 D) integrated microstructures.

40|$|In August, 1998 a Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) {{instrument}} telemetry housekeeping parameter {{generated a}} yellow warning message that indicated an on-board + 15 V Data Acquisition Assembly (DAA) power converter deregulation anomaly. An exhaustive investigation was undertaken {{to understand this}} anomaly and the long-term consequences which have severely reduced CERES operations on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spacecraft. Among investigations performed were ground tests that approximated the on-board electronic circuitry using a small quantity of flight identical components exposed to maximum spacecraft bus over-voltage conditions. These components include monolithic <b>integrated</b> <b>microcircuits</b> that perform analog signal conditioning on instrument sensor signals and an analog- to-digital converter (ADC) for the entire DAA. All microcircuit packages have either a bipolar silicon design with internal current limiting protections or have a {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) design with bias protections. Ground tests that have been running for approximately 8 months have indicated that these components are capable of withstanding as much as twice their input supply voltage ratings without noticeable performance degradation. These data provide CERES operators with confidence of being able to continue science operations over the remaining life of the TRMM mission.

40|$|A two stream {{model of}} boron {{diffusion}} in silicon has been developed. The model {{is intended for}} simulation of transient enhanced diffusion including redistribution of ion-implanted boron during low temperature annealing. The following mechanisms of boron diffusion were proposed, namely: the mechanism of a long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron interstitials and the mechanism due to the formation, migration, and dissolution of the "impurity atom - silicon self-interstitial" pairs. Based on the model, simulation of the redistribution of boron implanted into silicon substrates for annealing temperatures of 800 and 900 Celsius degrees was carried out. The calculated boron concentration profiles agree well with the experimental data. It was shown that for a temperature of 800 Celsius degrees the transport of impurity atoms occurred due to the long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron interstitials generated during cluster transformation or dissolution. On the other hand, {{it was found that}} at a temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the pair diffusion mechanism played a main role in the significant transient enhanced diffusion. A number of parameters describing the transport of nonequilibrium boron interstitials and transient enhanced diffusion of substitutionally dissolved boron atoms were determined. For example, it was found that at a temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the time-average enhancement of boron diffusion was approximately equal to 44 times. The results obtained are important for the development of methods of transient enhanced diffusion suppression keeping in mind the scaling of the dimensions of silicon <b>integrated</b> <b>microcircuits.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of highly miniaturized electronic and mechanical systems will {{be accompanied by}} new problems and issues regarding the radiation response of these systems in the space environment. In this {{paper we discuss some}} of the more prominent radiation problems brought about by miniaturization. For example, autonomous micro-spacecraft will require large amounts of high density memory, most likely in the form of stacked, multichip modules of DRAM's, that must tolerate the radiation environment. However, advanced DRAM's (16 to 256 Mbit) are quite susceptible to radiation, particularly single event effects, and even exhibit new radiation phenomena that were not a problem for older, less dense memory chips. Another important trend in micro-spacecraft electronics is toward the use of low-voltage microelectronic systems that consume less power. However, the reduction in operating voltage also caries with it an increased susceptibility to radiation. In the case of application specific <b>integrated</b> <b>microcircuits</b> (ASIM's), advanced devices of this type, such as high density field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) exhibit new single event effects (SEE), such as single particle reprogramming of anti-fuse links. New advanced bipolar circuits have been shown recently to degrade more rapidly in the low dose rate space environment than in the typical laboratory total dose radiation test used to qualify such devices. Thus total dose testing of these parts is no longer an appropriately conservative measure to be used for hardness assurance. We also note that the functionality of micromechanical Si-based devices may be altered due to the radiation-induced deposition of charge in the oxide passivation layers...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{modeling}} {{is a new}} advanced {{methodology for}} investigating brain functions. Realistic modeling {{is based on a}} detailed biophysical description of neurons and synapses, which can be <b>integrated</b> into <b>microcircuits.</b> The latter can, in turn, be further integrated to form large-scale brain networks and eventually to reconstruct complex brain systems. Here we provide a review of the realistic simulation strategy and use the cerebellar network as an example. This network has been carefully investigated at molecular and cellular level and has been the object of intense theoretical investigation. The cerebellum is thought to lie {{at the core of the}} forward controller operations of the brain and to implement timing and sensory prediction functions. The cerebellum is well described and provides a challenging field in which one of the most advanced realistic microcircuit models has been generated. We illustrate how these models can be elaborated and embedded into robotic control systems to gain insight into how the cellular properties of cerebellar neurons emerge in integrated behaviors.

40|$|Abstract:- An {{integrated}} circuit (IC) dimensions continue to decrease, RC delay, crosstalk noise, and power dissipation of the interconnect structure become limiting factors for ultra-large-scale integration of <b>integrated</b> circuits. Modern <b>microcircuits</b> may have eight metal layers, each separated by only 0. 1 micrometers. RC delays and cross talk rather than transistor speed {{are now the}} major performance limitations. The semiconductor industry has responded by developing copper metallization to replace aluminum and lower dielectric constant materials to replace silicon oxide. Materials with different low dielectric constant are being analyzed to replace silicon dioxide as inter level dielectrics. In this paper, how the dielectric constant is affecting the threshold voltage is first discussed. The simulation works are carried using MATLAB, SCHRED software.

40|$|Abstract Amygdala {{activation}} {{is known}} to be critical for the processing of stressful events in brain. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} projection neurons (PNs) in amygdala, although architecturally intermingled, are <b>integrated</b> into distinct <b>microcircuits</b> and thus play divergent roles in amygdala-related behaviors. It remains unknown how stress regulates the individual amygdala PNs embedded in distinct microcircuits. Here, by using retrograde tracing and electrophysiological recording in in vitro slices, we explored the modulation of acute immobilization stress (AIS) on the basoamygdala (BA) PNs projecting either to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or elsewhere, which we designated as BA-mPFC and non-BA-mPFC PNs respectively. The results showed that in the control mice, both the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs/sIPSCs) were comparable between these two subsets of BA PNs. The influences of AIS on sEPSCs and sIPSCs were overall similar between the two neuronal populations. It markedly increased the sEPSCs amplitude but left unaltered their frequency as well as the sIPSCs amplitude and frequency. Despite this, several differences emerged between the effects of AIS on the distribution of sEPSCs/sIPSCs frequency in these two groups of BA PNs. Similar changes were also observed in the sEPSCs/sIPSCs of the two PN populations from mice experiencing forced swimming stress. Their intrinsic excitability, on the other hand, was nearly unaltered following AIS. Our results thus suggest that acute stress recruit both BA-mPFC and non-BA-mPFC PNs mainly through enhancing the glutamatergic transmission they receive...|$|R
