5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E

50|$|The Product Stewardship Institute claims {{local governments}} spend $54 {{million a year}} to dispose of {{unwanted}} phone books and $9 million to recycle them. Phone books use low grade <b>glues</b> <b>and</b> are therefore difficult to recycle, and they often clog recycling machinery. Publishers note that phone book directories are 100% recyclable and are made using soy-based <b>and</b> non-toxic inks, <b>glues</b> <b>and</b> dyes.|$|R
50|$|Stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> {{has become}} one of the {{dominant}} techniques in amateur boatbuilding. While the use of relatively few plywood panels (which minimizes the joints and makes the construction easier and faster) limits the shapes possible, the simplicity and low cost of the stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> technique makes it the method of choice among most amateur boatbuilders. Simple software CAD packages are available for designing stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> boats, <b>and</b> there are many Internet bulletin boards, newsgroups, and mailing lists dedicated to the subject of stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> boats <b>and</b> various popular stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> designs. Stitch <b>and</b> <b>glue</b> is not inherently limited to small designs though, as demonstrated by the boats made by Sam Devlin, who has applied the technique to making boats as long as 65 feet.|$|R
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of female insects {{consist of a}} pair of ovaries, accessory glands, one or more spermathecae, and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae. Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.|$|E

40|$|The <b>gluing</b> <b>and</b> {{tensor product}} constructions of lattices are reviewed. A third construction, called shifting, is defined and its {{relationship}} to <b>gluing</b> <b>and</b> rational equivalence is investigated. There follows a discussion of a method, based on gluing, for systematically generating theta function identities. Gluing is used also as a device for constructing phenomenologically realistic superstring theories. Finally, these lattice methods are applied to recent work concerning vanishing cosmological constants in string theories. In addition, scattered throughout the thesis are a number of smaller results on lattices...|$|R

25|$|The {{soundboard}} (Göğüs) is a rotund thin (2.5–3mm) flat three-, two- or single-piece {{plate of}} resonant wood (usually Nordmann, silver or Greek fir). This circular plate measuring about 30 to 35cm in diameter {{is mounted on}} the bottom wedge and the heel with simmering <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> encircled with a wooden ring. A soundhole is either wanting or consists of a very small unornamented opening (mostly in historical specimens), giving the instrument its peculiar sonority.|$|E

25|$|The {{ball was}} {{constructed}} {{using a new}} design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of the ball was textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove that was intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom. The balls were made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl acetate, isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> ink from China.|$|E

Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is fertilized.

25|$|In {{carnivorous}} plants, {{the leaf}} {{is not just}} used to photosynthesise, {{but also as a}} trap. Changing the leaf shape to make it a better trap generally makes it less efficient at photosynthesis. For example, pitchers have to be held upright, so that only their opercula directly intercept light. The plant also has to expend extra energy on non-photosynthetic structures like glands, hairs, <b>glue</b> <b>and</b> digestive enzymes. To produce such structures, the plant requires ATP and respires more of its biomass. Hence, a carnivorous plant will have both decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration, making the potential for growth small and the cost of carnivory high.|$|E

The approach is based on a generalisation of the de Rham complex to higher spin fields providing a parametrization of the set of constraints, as well as standard elliptic theory to prove the existence of a potential for solutions to the constraints for higher spin fields...|$|R
