5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide {{on the left}} where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to the}} byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining {{on the other side of}} the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was quick enough to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> put it in the back of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.|$|E

25|$|It was {{fashionable to}} pluck or shave the <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> raise the hairlines. The hair was tied tightly on the scalp and usually hidden inside the cone (possibly {{one end of}} the veil was tied to the hair and wrapped round, with the free end being pulled through the hole {{at the tip of the}} cone). However some images show long hair worn loose behind the hennin.|$|E

25|$|The fur of the Iriomote cat {{is mostly}} dark gray and light brown, with lighter {{hair on the}} belly and insides of the limbs. Hair along the jaw is white. There are two dark brown spots on each cheek. There are 5–7 stripes {{spanning}} from the <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of the}} head, but, unlike the leopard cat, the stripes stop before reaching the shoulders. Dark brown spots cover the sides of the body, and there are 3–4 bands of irregular stripes on the chest. The tail is dark brown; darker spots pattern {{the back side of the}} tail while the underside of the tail is solid. The tip of the tail is dark.|$|E
25|$|Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. For {{the pivotal}} role of Carlito's sleazy lawyer and best friend, Penn was lured back from early {{retirement}} by {{the challenge of}} playing the corrupt lawyer. Taking the role meant that he could finance his movie The Crossing Guard and work with Pacino. De Palma and Penn sat down and discussed what '70s mob lawyers looked like. Often, men {{in the entertainment business}} can look more bizarre than the talent they represent. Penn shaved the hair on the front of his <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> give the appearance of a receding hairline. He permed the rest. Alan Dershowitz, believing that Penn was attempting to look like him, threatened the filmmakers with a defamation lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|In {{this last}} and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret {{resisted}} {{the heat of}} thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his outstretched arms in {{the figure of a}} cross, but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account. The progress of an ulcer in his thigh might shorten, but it could not disturb, this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.|$|E

25|$|The {{conception}} of symmetry is {{explained in the}} following way: One imagines a man sitting in the paryanka posture, i.e. crossing the legs and placing the hands over the navel. If one imagines that the two knees are joined by a line, and from the right shoulder to the left knee, and from the left shoulder to the right knee, and from the <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> the hands, a straight line is drawn, one gets four lines. If these are equal to one another, symmetry is apparent; {{if they are not}} so, one of the other 5 samsthanas results. Gods have only the first symmetry, infernal beings and jivas who have been produced through coagulation only the 6th figure; in the case of animals and men (also of kevalins) all six samsthanas are to be found.|$|E
25|$|Outside of {{professional}} wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars over his head, and headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using {{his head to}} break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken {{over the side of}} his head using a sledge hammer, and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on his head from heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal. Ferraro first discovered this ability as a teenager when, while chasing younger brother around the house during an argument, crashed head first into a large oak door.|$|E
25|$|Davros is {{from the}} planet Skaro, whose people, the Kaleds, {{were engaged in a}} bitter thousand-year war of {{attrition}} with their enemies, the Thals. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one cybernetic eye mounted on his <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> take the place of his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile life-support chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair {{for more than a few}} minutes without dying. Davros' voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, staccatissimo speech of the Daleks.|$|E

500|$|Type B {{is smaller}} than type A. It has a large white eye patch. Most of the dark parts of its body are medium gray instead of black, {{although}} it has a dark gray patch called a [...] "dorsal cape" [...] stretching back from its <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> just behind its dorsal fin. The white areas are stained slightly yellow. It feeds mostly on seals.|$|E
500|$|The {{prominent}} {{facial features}} include the [...] long black tufts on the ears, two black stripes from the <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> the nose, the black {{outline of the}} mouth, the distinctive black facial markings, and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth. The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid, probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun's glare. The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages. The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings. The fur, soft, short and dense, grows coarser in the summer. The ground hairs (the basal layer of hair covering the coat) are denser in winter than in summer. The length of the guard hairs (the hair extending above the ground hairs) can be up to [...] long in winter, but shorten to [...] in summer. These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season, typically in October and November. The hindlegs are longer than the forelegs, so that the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.|$|E
500|$|... is the {{absolute}} pinnacle of medical ninjutsu, created by Tsunade, who {{is regarded as the}} greatest medical ninja in the ninja world. The user must first store a substantial amount of chakra to form the [...] at the <b>forehead.</b> <b>To</b> activate the technique, the user releases the seal to forcibly release the stored chakra to the body. Through the input of the user, proteins hasten the creation of new cells through cell division, which regenerates any injuries sustained by the user. Thus, as long as the user has enough chakra, they are able to regenerate even the most fatal injuries, essentially making them [...] "invincible" [...] in combat. However, because body cells can only divide a number of times in life, the user is basically shortening their lifespan by accelerating the process. Tsunade manages to counteract this to a certain extent through her long lifespan, thus she is able to live even after using the jutsu several times. The jutsu also has a variation, [...] Though it has the same effect as the original, the user does not need to input chakra to activate, and injuries are automatically regenerated as damage is done. Tsunade made the rule that prohibits any medical ninja to directly participate in battles if they had not mastered this technique to assure their own safety. Tsunade's student, Sakura Haruno, became able to use One Hundred Healings after having stored her chakra for three years to form the Byakugo Seal.|$|E

50|$|The Phantom Zone was {{discovered}} by Jor-El and used on the planet Krypton {{as a method of}} imprisoning criminals. Previously, criminals were punished by being sealed into capsules and rocketed into orbit in suspended animation with crystals attached <b>to</b> their <b>foreheads</b> <b>to</b> slowly erase their criminal tendencies; Klax-Ar was one criminal who received this punishment but escaped. Gra-Mo was the last to suffer the punishment, for it was then abolished in favor of the Zone.|$|R

Eventually Lever also removed his and lay the gauze on the ground near the stumps where it was noticed by the umpires and Indian team, but not before he had used sweat from his <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> shine the ball.|$|E
2500|$|In modern Western culture, kissing on {{the lips}} is {{commonly}} an expression of affection or a warm greeting.

The practice of kissing with an open mouth, to allow the other to suck their lips or move their tongue into their mouth, is called French kissing. [...] "Making out" [...] is often an adolescent's first experience of their sexuality and games which involve kissing, such as Spin the Bottle, facilitate the experience. People may kiss children on the <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> comfort them or the cheek or lips to show affection.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin {{has a long}} sagittal crest, consisting of white hairs, from <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> nape flowing over the shoulders. [...] The skin of the face is black with gray or white bands located above the eyes. These bands continue {{along the edge of}} the face down to the jaw. Tamarins are generally divided into three groups by their facial characteristics: hairy-faced, mottled-faced, and bare-faced. The {{cotton-top tamarin}} has fine white hairs covering its face, but they are so fine as to appear naked, thus is considered a bare-faced tamarin. Its lower canine teeth are longer than its incisors, creating the appearance of tusks. Like other callitrichids, the cotton-top tamarin has two molar teeth on each side of its jaw, not three like other New World monkeys.|$|E
2500|$|When {{there were}} rumours that Sun He {{could no longer}} secure his {{position}} as Crown Prince, Lu Xun wrote a memorial to Sun Quan: [...] "The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir apparent so he should have a foundation as solid as hard rock.

If both of them know their places, Your Majesty and all your subjects will have peace. I humbly kowtow and beg Your Majesty, {{to the point of}} bleeding (from my <b>forehead),</b> <b>to</b> (re)consider this issue carefully." [...] He wrote several memorials to Sun Quan and even requested to leave Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and go to the capital to speak up on this problem. Sun Quan denied him permission. Lu Xun's maternal nephews Gu Tan, Gu Cheng (顧承) and Yao Xin (姚信), who supported Sun He during the succession struggle, were sent into exile. Wu Can, the Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅), who had been exchanging letters with Lu Xun, was imprisoned and later executed.|$|E
2500|$|Asian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus): [...] In a study {{performed in}} 2006 three female Asian elephants {{were exposed to}} a large mirror to investigate their responses. Visible marks and invisible sham-marks were applied to the elephants' heads to test whether they would pass the MSR test. [...] One of the elephants showed mark-directed behaviour, though the other two did not. An earlier study failed to find MSR in two Asian elephants; it was claimed this was because the mirror was too small. The {{study was conducted with}} the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) using elephants at the Bronx Zoo in New York. All three Asian elephants in the study were {{standing in front of a}} 2.5m-by-2.5m mirror—they inspected the rear and brought food close to the mirror for consumption. Evidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when one (and only one) elephant, Happy, repeatedly touched a painted X on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her <b>forehead</b> <b>to</b> ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling. Frans De Waal, who ran the study, stated, [...] "These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex society and cooperation." ...|$|E
