5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{bites of}} other pets. This {{is because the}} teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus ernesti, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1894, is found from Indonesia to Philippines and south to Papua New Guinea {{and the nearby}} Bismarck Archipelago. Its geographical separation from nesiotes requires confirmation. It is non-migratory. It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nominate subspecies in the very dark, dense barring on its underside and its black ear coverts.|$|E
5|$|High in fiamme, {{the third}} tuff layer <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second {{in that it}} has even higher {{phenocryst}} content, but poor lithics. In the fiamme, phenocrysts constitute between 5 and 15 percent of the rock, increasing to 25 to 30percent near the caldera. In the younger emplacements, clinopyroxene is evident along {{with an increase in}} mafic content.|$|E

5|$|Janaki Mangal (जानकी मंगल), {{literally}} The {{marriage of}} Sita, is an Awadhi work of 216 verses describing the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama from the Ramayana. The work includes 192 verses in the Hamsagati metre and 24 verses in the Harigitika metres. The narrative <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ramcharitmanas at several places.|$|E
5|$|The al-Hakim mosque <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> al-Azhar and Ibn Tulun mosques {{in having}} two stone minarets {{at the corners}} of the stone façade, which has a monumental {{projecting}} portal like the Mosque of Mahdiya.|$|E
5|$|The {{paraphrase}} technique <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cantus-firmus {{technique in}} that the source material, though it still consists of a monophonic original, is embellished, often with ornaments.

5|$|The {{potential}} {{solar energy}} {{that could be}} used by humans <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.|$|E
5|$|The series <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} comics in that Valerian {{comes from}} the year 2417, instead of 2720, and meets Laureline in the year 912 instead of 1000. Whereas in the comics Valerian takes Laureline back to the 28th century without any trouble, in the animated series this results in Earth disappearing from the solar system.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Torpedo, the marbled {{electric}} ray belongs to the subgenus Torpedo, which <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other subgenus Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration.

5000|$|In {{the past}} tense, the {{singular}} {{form of the}} subjunctive of weak verbs (the vast majority of verbs) does not <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> indicative at all, so that for those verbs {{there is no difference}} between indicative and subjunctive whatsoever in the past tense. Only for strong verbs, the preterite-present verbs and some irregular weak verbs does <b>the</b> past subjunctive <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> past indicative, and only in the singular form. E.g., the subjunctive [...] "hadde", [...] "ware" [...] and [...] "mochte" [...] <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> indicative [...] "had", [...] "was" [...] and [...] "mocht" [...] (had, was and could).|$|R

5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known only from the type locality, <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales. Because {{it was based on}} an invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E
5|$|B. i. coromandus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, {{when the}} buff colour {{on its head}} extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cases in North America and Europe {{in that there}} is a case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading. A viewer {{complained that}} the celebrities were likely to have used the US version of Proactiv, which <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> UK version. According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE {{is mixed with}} a locally brewed sorghum lager, but it <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Nigerian version in that it {{contains}} no wheat and has {{a higher proportion of}} roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E
5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. In these cases, a serpin that {{has formed a}} complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence of}} protease activity. This <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E

50|$|However, both {{of these}} {{considerations}} pertain to Cook and Campbell's concept of generalizing to some target population rather than the arguably more central task of assessing the generalizability of findings from an experiment across subpopulations that <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> specific situation studied and people who <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> respondents studied in some meaningful way.|$|R
5|$|Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This external heating <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> internal heat source for volcanism on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope decay and residual heat from accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relatives}} may be O.concolor {{from the}} northern Amazon rainforest, including northwestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia, and O.mamorae from Bolivia, Paraguay, nearby Brazil, and possibly northeastern Argentina. The three share a particular configuration of the arteries in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, and a general similarity in other traits. However, O.sydandersoni <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters. Whether the three species are truly closely related needs to be determined using molecular data.|$|E
