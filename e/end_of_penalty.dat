In 2008, the Roman Catholic Church issued a statement which [...] "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [...]" [...] The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> against homosexuals in the world.

25|$|A major {{penalty is}} a {{stronger}} degree <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> {{for a more}} severe infraction of the rules than a minor. Most infractions which incur a major penalty are more severe instances <b>of</b> minor <b>penalty</b> infractions; one exception is fighting, which always draws a major. A player who receives a major penalty will remain off the ice for five minutes of play during which his team will be short-handed. A major penalty cannot end early even if a goal is scored against the short-handed team, unless the goal is scored during an overtime period (which ends the game). If major penalties are assessed to one player on each team at the same time, they may be substituted for, and teams will not be reduced by one player on the ice. The penalized players {{will remain in the}} penalty box until the first stoppage of play following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penalties.</b> This commonly occurs with majors for fighting.|$|R

5000|$|TV pickup is a {{term used}} in the United Kingdom {{to refer to a}} {{phenomenon}} that affects electricity generation and transmission networks. It often occurs when {{a large number of people}} watch the same TV programmes while taking advantage of commercial breaks to use toilets and operate electrical appliances, thus causing large synchronised surges in national electricity consumption. Electricity networks devote considerable resources to predicting and providing electricity supply for these events, which in the UK, for example, typically impose an extra demand of around 200-400 megawatts (MW) on the Grid. Short-term supply is often obtained from pumped storage reservoirs, which can be quickly brought online, backed up by the slower fossil fuel and nuclear power stations. The largest ever pickup was on 4 July 1990, when a 2800 MW demand was imposed by the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penalty</b> shootout in the England v West Germany FIFA World Cup semi-final. [...] In addition to pickups, the Grid also prepares for synchronised switch-offs during remembrance and energy-awareness events.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{punishment}} severity on jury decision-making using a large archival data set from the Old Bailey Criminal Court in London from 1715 to 1900. We take advantage of three natural experiments in English history, which result in sharp decreases in punishment severity: The offense specific abolition of capital punishment in the 1800 s, the temporary halt of penal transportation during the American Revolution, and the abolition of transportation in 1853. Using a difference-in-differences design to study the abolition <b>of</b> the death <b>penalty</b> and pre-post designs to study the temporary and permanent halts to transportation, we find that decreasing expected punishment (especially via the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the death <b>penalty),</b> had a large and significant impact on jury behavior, generally leading to the jury being ‘harsher’. Moreover, {{we find that the}} size of the effect differs with defendants’ gender and criminal history. These results raise concerns about the impartiality of juries as well as the implicit assumption often made when designing and evaluating criminal justice policies today – that the chance of conviction is independent of the harshness <b>of</b> the <b>penalty.</b> JEL: H 00, K 14, K 40, N 00, N 43, N 9...|$|R
