5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern of the trip {{was that he would}} be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen with Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing the fact that its clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E

25|$|With {{the rapid}} {{industrialisation}} {{and population growth}} of 19th century Glasgow great numbers were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released from the grimy city on Fast Days and during the annual Glasgow Fair week, went on a cruise down the Clyde to clean unspoilt scenery. Tiny villages, perhaps with a stone jetty, soon became resorts with wooden piers and villas, hotels and public houses. Local residents would let out rooms, and boarding houses developed. Established towns like Dunoon and Rothesay became major resorts. The wealthy built sandstone villas at places like Kilcreggan, Blairmore and Innellan to which they could commute daily, or weekly, during the summer.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{official}} visits to Western countries (including the US, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain) helped Ceaușescu to present {{himself as a}} reforming Communist, pursuing an independent foreign policy within the Soviet Bloc. He also became <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as an enlightened international statesman, able to mediate in international conflicts, and to gain international respect for Romania. Ceaușescu negotiated in international affairs, such as the opening of US relations with China in 1969 and the visit of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat to Israel in 1977. Also Romania was {{the only country in}} the world to maintain normal diplomatic relations with both Israel and the PLO. In 1980, Romania participated in the 1980 Moscow Olympics with its other Soviet bloc allies, but in 1984 {{was one of the few}} Communist countries to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics when most of the Eastern Bloc's nations boycotted this event.|$|E

25|$|Fiction {{and plays}} about pirates were {{ubiquitous}} in the 19th century. Walter Scott's The Pirate (1822) and James Fenimore Cooper's The Red Rover were key {{sources for the}} romanticised, dashing pirate image {{and the idea of}} repentant pirates. Both Gilbert and Sullivan had parodied these ideas early in their careers. Sullivan had written a comic opera called The Contrabandista, in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert's 1876 opera Princess Toto, the title character is <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated Jacques Offenbach's operetta Les brigands, in 1871. As in Les brigands, The Pirates of Penzance absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and tools of the trade such as the crowbar and life preserver.|$|E

King comes from a well-to-do family, with a long tradition of service to the British Empire. King and Singh go to the officer's club near the city of Oxford (formerly Srinagar).

Warburton arranges for King to meet him in Delhi in one week.|$|E
25|$|In November 1899, Vice President Garret Hobart died {{of heart}} failure, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican {{national}} ticket. Though Henry Cabot Lodge and others urged him to run for vice president in 1900, Roosevelt was reluctant to take the powerless position and issued a public statement saying {{that he would not}} accept the nomination. Additionally, Roosevelt was informed by President McKinley and campaign manager Mark Hanna that he was not being considered for the role of vice president due to his actions prior to the Spanish–American War. <b>Eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency. Roosevelt attended the 1900 Republican National Convention as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination if the convention offered it to him, but would otherwise serve another term as governor. Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss Matthew Quay to lead the campaign for Roosevelt's nomination, and Quay outmaneuvered Hanna at the convention to put Roosevelt on the ticket. Roosevelt won the nomination unanimously.|$|E

The canals seemed at first to work in lowering the water levels in the wetlands surrounding the rivers. Another dredged waterway between the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Okeechobee was built, opening the region to steamboat traffic.|$|E

Oil painting allowed for a blending of tones to produce {{a wide range of}} realistic, attractive colors, in a way not possible with traditional Chinese ink and brush painting.
