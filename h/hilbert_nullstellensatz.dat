40|$|AbstractGiven {{an ideal}} I in A, the {{polynomial}} ring in n-indeterminates, the affine variety of I is {{the set of}} common zeros in Cn of all the polynomials that belong to I, and the <b>Hilbert</b> <b>Nullstellensatz</b> states {{that there is a}} bijective correspondence between these affine varieties and radical ideals of A. If, on the other hand, one thinks of a polynomial as a (constant coefficient) partial differential operator, then instead of its zeros in Cn, one can consider its zeros, i. e., its homogeneous solutions, in various function and distribution spaces. An advantage of this point of view is that one can then consider not only the zeros of ideals of A, but also the zeros of submodules of free modules over A (i. e., of systems of PDEs). The question then arises as to what is the analogue here of the <b>Hilbert</b> <b>Nullstellensatz.</b> The answer clearly depends on the function–distribution space in which solutions of PDEs are being located, and this paper considers the case of the classical spaces.

In this way, a combinatorial problem is feasible (e. g. a graph is 3 -colorable, hamiltonian, etc.) if and only if a related system of polynomial equations has a solution.

For an infeasible polynomial system, the (complex) <b>Hilbert</b> <b>Nullstellensatz</b> gives a certificate that the associated combinatorial problem is infeasible.

Later, Lipman and Tessier observed that residue calculus could be used to obtain an alternative proof, and inspired by this approach they generalized the theorem to an algebraic setting. Berenstein-Yger et al. developed further this residue method by introducing a division formula by Berndtsson into the picture. The theory of tight closure, introduced by Hochster and Huneke, was motivated by, and has been used to prove, the Briancon-Skoda theorem.

40|$|Recent proofs of {{classical}} theorems in polynomial algebra and functional analysis are discussed, which use tools from the topology of real manifolds. Simpler proofs {{were discovered in}} the new century, of the <b>Hilbert</b> <b>Nullstellensatz,</b> and the Gelfand-Mazur Theorem. We give a related proof that an irreducible real polynomial has degree 2 or less, Gauss's form of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. It has been debated whether an elementary proof for FTA can be found, using the Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem as its "analytical" component. In the present case the analytic or topological tool employed is Brouwer's Theorem on Invariance of Domain, which derives from his Fixed-Point Theorem. A corollary of Domain Invariance is that an injective mapping of one compact manifold to another (connected) one of the same dimension, is in fact surjective and a homeomorphism. The desired result (FTA) {{comes from the fact}} that a real sphere and its (quotient) projective space of the same dimension are homeomorphic only when this dimension equals 1. This proof joins a class of proofs that depend on Euclidean fixed-point theory, and also the class of proofs that involve no field extensions or methods of complex analysis.
