5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry <b>Hooker,</b> a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. <b>Hooker</b> congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. <b>Hooker</b> fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. <b>Hooker</b> was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, <b>Hooker</b> suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E

5|$|The {{botanist}} Joseph Dalton <b>Hooker,</b> then aged 23 and {{the youngest}} person on the expedition, was assistant-surgeon to Robert McCormick, and responsible for collecting zoological and geological specimens.

McCormick had been ship's surgeon for the second voyage of HMS Beagle under Captain Robert FitzRoy, along with Darwin as gentleman naturalist.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{these early}} singles was <b>Hooker's</b> first {{recorded}} vocal performance, {{an interpretation of}} the blues classic [...] "Black Angel Blues". His vocals were more than adequate but lacked the power usually associated with blues singers. <b>Hooker's</b> [...] "Sweet Angel" [...] (1953, Rockin' 513) was based on Nighthawk's [...] "Black Angel Blues" [...] (1949) and showed that [...] "Hooker had by now transcended his teacher". (B.B. King later had a hit with his interpretation, [...] "Sweet Little Angel", in 1956.) One of <b>Hooker's</b> most successful singles during this period was [...] "Frog Hop", recorded in 1956 (Argo 5265), an upbeat instrumental in which the influence of T-Bone Walker's swing blues and chording techniques can be heard, but <b>Hooker's</b> own style is also apparent.|$|R

5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton <b>Hooker</b> went {{to visit}} Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by <b>Hooker.</b> Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had an empirical approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful {{for the development of}} Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In 1839 Buxton {{was invited}} to join the natural history class at the Manchester Mechanics' Institute where he helped compile the Flora Mancuniensis (1840) along with Leo Hartley Grindon, George Crozier and James Crowther under the editorship of John Bland Wood.

Although this never came about, <b>Hooker</b> gave Buxton a number of botanical books and, at some point, Buxton accepted the position of President of the Manchester Working Men's Botanical Society.|$|E

50|$|After Spenser's death, in April 1614, <b>Hooker's</b> {{papers were}} taken out of Jackson's custody, but he may have {{supervised}} the reprints by William Stansby, London, of <b>Hooker's</b> Works, in 1618 and 1622, which included the Opuscula and the first five books of the ‘Ecclesiastical Polity.’ The preface, with Stansby's initials, has been conjectured to be Jackson's. When <b>Hooker's</b> papers were taken from Jackson's care, he was engaged on an edition of the hitherto unpublished eighth book of the ‘Polity,’ and complained (December 1612) that the president (Spenser) proposed to put his own name to the edition. John Keble suggests that Jackson, aggrieved by Spenser's treatment, retained his own recension of <b>Hooker's</b> work when he delivered up the other papers, and that when his library at Meysey Hampton was plundered and dispersed by the parliamentarians in 1642, his version of book viii., or a copy of it, came into James Ussher's hands.
