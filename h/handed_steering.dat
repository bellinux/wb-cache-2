40|$|Tracing {{the link}} between {{population}} flux and the regulation of migration, this paper develops the argument that immigration status differentiations impact not only on categorical multiplicities but also on contingent dynamics in urban migration-related diversity. A better understanding of those contingencies is central to discussing processes of adaptation in contexts of superdiversity. I first point to the frequency of change in rules and regulations pertaining to a multiplicity of immigration statuses. I then emphasise the co-relevance of conditionalities of entry and parameters of presence, set out by those rules, as central components of legal status diversity. In a third part I consider the resulting differentiations in terms of information overload. Thinking about status differentiations as information contradicts devising ever more status tracks to order migration and optimise its economic and social implications. I then point to empirical patterns in legal status diversities emphasising spatiotemporal contingencies in admitting migrants through different immigration channels. Concurrently I highlight why the resulting patterns of change are relevant for local urban diversity dynamics. I conclude the paper by drawing parallels between on the one <b>hand</b> <b>steering</b> migration to optimise its implications {{and on the other}} <b>hand</b> <b>steering</b> adaptations in superdiverse contexts to optimise integration. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Active front {{steering}} is an emerging steering technology for passenger cars that realizes a mechatronic superposition of an {{angle to the}} <b>hand</b> <b>steering</b> wheel angle that is prescribed by the driver. This contribution describes algorithms, used to ensure – along with others – the overall safety of the system (i. e. preventing hazardous behavior). A kinematic constraint, modelled as a dynamic system, is used to estimate the steering wheel angle. This estimated signal is compared with the measured signal. Using change detection algorithms typical failure patterns of the steering wheel sensor are detected quite easily. Sample results and measurements from a prototype vehicle are presented.

Emdens gunners were firing rapidly, with a salvo every ten seconds; Müller hoped to overwhelm Sydney with a barrage of shells before her heavier armament could take effect. Two shells hit Sydney, one of which disabled the aft fire control station; the other failed to explode. It took slightly longer for Sydney to find the range, and in the meantime, Emden turned toward her opponent {{in an attempt to}} close to torpedo range. Sydneys more powerful [...] guns soon found the range and inflicted serious damage. The wireless compartment was destroyed and the crew for one of the forward guns was killed early in the engagement.

40|$|Many {{advanced}} robotic {{systems are}} subject to non-holonomic constraints, e. g. wheeled mobile robots, space manipulators and multifingered robot <b>hands.</b> <b>Steering</b> these mechanisms between configurations {{in the presence of}} perturbations is a difficult problem. In fact, the divide et impera strategy (first plan a trajectory, then track it by feedback) has a fundamental drawback in this case: due to the peculiar control properties of non-holonomic systems, smooth feedback cannot provide tracking of the whole trajectory. As a result, it would be necessary to give up either accuracy in the final positioning or predictability of the actual motion. We pursue here a different approach which does not rely on a separation between planning and control. Based on the learning control paradigm, a robust steering scheme is devised for systems which can be put in chained form, a canonical structure for non-holonomic systems. By overparametrizing the control law, other performance goals can be met, typically expressed as cost functions to be minimized along the trajectory. As a case study, we consider the generation of robust optimal trajectories for a car-like mobile robot, with criteria such as total length, maximum steering angle, distance from workspace obstacles, or error with respect to an offline planned trajectory...|$|R
