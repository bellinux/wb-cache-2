40|$|Oil shales are {{a diverse}} group of rocks that may become an {{important}} source of liquid fuel and chemical feedstocks. The bulk of the organic matter in oil shales is generally <b>exinite</b> derived from a variety of organisms ranging from terrestrial higher plants to freshwater and marine algae. In this study reflected light and fluorescence mode petrography provide data not readily available through chemical, transmitted light and palynological studies. The petrographic studies elucidate the mode of preservation and mineral-maceral relationships usually destroyed during mineralization and pyrolysis. Previous petrographic terminology for algal components is revised and two new terms, lamalginite and telaginite, are defined. Type of <b>exinite</b> is used to classify oil shales into three primary and six secondary groups. Telalginite derived from Reinschia and Pila, both related to the extant green alga Botryococcus braunii, is the major <b>exinite</b> in torbanite which is formed in shallow lakes associated with coal forming swamps. The reflectance of vitrinite in torbanite decreases as the alginite content increases. Lamosites are freshwater, laminated oil shales and are divided into Rundle type and Green River type. Australian Tertiary lamosites belong to the Rundle type and contain discrete lamalginite derived in part from the colonial green alga Pediastrum, the freshwater dinoflagellate Septodinium, and the acritarch Cleistosphaeridium. Botryococcus telalginite and huminite are minor constituents. Green River lamosite contains layered lamalginite with minor bitumen and huminite. Differences between the two forms of lamalginite in the Rundle and Green River type lamosites indicate that the environments of deposition were not the same for both types. Australian Tertiary lamosites were deposited in fresh to brackish water, probably nearshore lakes. Recognition of phytoplanktonic algae, but not benthonic or mat-forming algae, suggests that the bulk of the <b>exinite</b> in these lamosites was derived from planktonic precursors. The Rundle-Stuart and Byfield deposits have a brown coal unit overlying the lamosite units. In the Condor and Byfield deposits a brown coal unit underlies the lamosite units. The boundaries between the coal and lamosite units represent significant changes in the environments of deposition. The Duaringa deposit has brown coal interbedded with lamosite (as occurs in several of the Rundle-Stuart lamosite units) in a lower unit that is overlain by a younger lamosite unit containing a different assemblage of alginite to the older unit. Within the lamosite units of Australian Tertiary deposits the abundance of lamalginite changes vertically (but is not related to depth) but type does not. Lateral variation in the type of lamalginite was not observed in any deposit. Cannel coal contains abundant <b>exinite</b> derived from higher plants. Tasmanite, contains abundant telalginite derived from Tasmanites punctatus and related algae that have affinities with Pachysphaera pelagica. Lamalginite, derived from dinoflagellates, acritarchs and other algae, or bituminite is the dominant <b>exinite</b> in marinite. Marinite also contains tasmanitid telalginite and in some specimens, vitrinite-like organic matter of probable algal origin. Kukersite is composed of telalginite derived from Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, an alga that is closely related to Botryococcus. The classification and characterization of oil shales provides much-needed data from which a framework for further studies can develop. More meaningful comparisons of the chemical properties of kerogen and shale oil can be attempted and the behaviour of the oil shale during retorting can be more readily understood...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we have made}} an {{electron}} spin resonance (EPR) study of macerals obtained from the lithotype clarain separated from Polish medium [...] rank coal (85. 6 wt. % C). For three macerals: <b>exinite,</b> vitrinite, and inertinite, the temperature dependence of intensity of EPR spectra in the temperature range of 100 – 373 K was investigated. The experimentally obtained EPR spectra of macerals were fitted by curves of the derivatives of the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The best fitting was obtained, when the experi-mental EPR spectra were {{assumed to be a}} superposition of three lines, for <b>exinite</b> and vitrinite — a broad Gaussian (G), a broad Lorentzian (L 1) and a narrow Lorentzian (L 3) line, but for inertinite of two lines — a narrow Lorentzian (L 2) and a narrow Lorentzian (L 3) line. The computer-assisted fitting has shown that each individual component line has similar values of resonance field, but different linewidths and amplitudes. The tempera-ture dependence of line intensity I of the broad Gaussian (G) and narrow Lorentzian (L 2 and L 3) lines fulfils the Curie law in the form I = C/T or IT = C, whereas the broad Lorentzian (L 1) line does not fulfil the Curie law. In the last case the temperature dependence of the Lorentzian (L 1) component was fitted by the relation I = C/T + B/[T (3 + exp(J/kT)) ] or IT = C + B/[3 + exp(J/kT)) ], valid for thermally excited triplet states (S = 1). For <b>exinite</b> and vitrinite the curves presenting the temperature dependence of the product IT versus temperature T were resolved into two curves, one for paramagnetic centres in the doublet state (S = 1 / 2), and the other for paramagnetic centres in the thermally excited triplet state (S = 1).

40|$|The Early Permian coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from the Vasse Shelf, southern Perth Basin, located approximately 200 km south- west of Perth. The selected coal samples {{for the study}} were also obtained from the Premier Sub-basin of the Collie Basin and the Irwin Sub-basin of the Perth Basin. The Early Permian coal measures are described as the Sue Coal Measures from the Vasse Shelf, the Ewington Coal Measures from the Premier Sub-basin and the coal measures from the Irwin sub-basin are described as the Irwin River Coal Measures. The Vasse Shelf coal is finely banded and the dominant lithotypes are dull and dull banded types, followed by bright banded and banded types, with minor bright types. The variation of dull and bright lithotypes represents fluctuating conditions of water table level during the growth of peat in the swamp. The maceral composition of the coal is predominantly composed of inertinite, followed by vitrinite and minor <b>exinite</b> and mineral matter. The coal is characterized by very low to medium semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, supporting the deposition in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub- bituminous to high volatile bituminous of the Australian classification. In terms of microlithotype group, the predominance of inertite over vitrite suggests the coal was formed under drier conditions with high degree of oxidation during its deposition. On the basis of the interpretations of lithotypes, macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements, the depositional environment of the coal is braided and meandering deltaic-river system without any brackish or marine influence. The maceral composition of the Collie coal predominantly consists of inertinite and vitrinite, with low <b>exinite</b> and mineral matter. The very low to low semifusinite ratio and low to medium vitrinite content of ++the coal indicate that the coal was formed under aerobic dry to wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is categorized as sub-bituminous according to the Australian classification. The domination of inertite and durite over vitrite and clarite contents in the coal reflects the deposition under drier conditions with fluctuations in the water table. On the basis of the interpretations of macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements distribution, the depositional environment of the coal is lacustrine, braided to meandering fluvial system, without the influence of any marine influx. The maceral composition of the Irwin River coal consists predominantly of vitrinite and inertinite, and minor <b>exinite</b> and mineral matter. The coal has very low semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, suggesting the coal was deposited in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub-bituminous of the Australian classification. The predominance of vitrite and clarite over inertite and durite contents in the coal indicates that the coal was formed in wetter conditions and in high water covers with a low degree of oxidation. Based on macerals and microlithotypes contents, the depositional environment of the coal is braided fluvial to deltaic, which is in accordance with the interpreted non- marine and mixed marine environment of deposition in the sub-basin. The petrological comparisons of Vasse Shelf, Collie and Irwin River coals show that the average vitrinite content of the Irwin River coal is highest (49. 1 %) and of the Collie coal is lowest (37. 3 %) of the three. The inertinite content is highest in Collie coal (49. 1 %), followed by Vasse Shelf (46. 4 %) and Irwin River (39. 2 %) coals. The <b>exinite</b> content is low in Irwin River coal (6. 3 %) as compared with Vasse Shelf (9. 0 °/,) and Collie (8. 3 %) coals. The mineral matter content ++is relatively low for all the three coals. The rank of the Vasse Shelf coal is high as compared with the Collie and Irwin River coals, either due to tectonic uplift after the deposition in post-Permian in the southern Perth Basin, or due to the average depth of burial over Vasse Shelf which is much greater than that of Collie and Irwin River coals. The comparisons of the coal from Western Australia with the selected Gondwana coals show that the predominance of inertinite over vitrinite occurs in the Western Australian coals (Vasse Shelf and Collie Basin). On the other hand, the Brazilian, eastern Australian, Indian and Western Australian (Irwin Sub-basin) coals are dominated by vitrinite over inertinite. The <b>exinite</b> content is highest in the Indian coals and lowest in the eastern Australian coals. The mineral matter content is highest in the Brazilian and Indian coals, and lowest in Western Australian (Vasse Shelf) and eastern Australian (Sydney Basin) coals. The rank of the coals ranges from sub- bituminous to medium volatile bituminous according to the Australian classification...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMultiple sets {{of thick}} coal beds {{characterized}} by simple structure and shallow burial depth {{were developed in}} the Early and Middle Jurassic strata of the Ordos Basin, northwestern China. The huge reserves of this high quality coal have a high commercial value. We studied the coal’s petrologic characteristics and its maceral distribution to determine the maceral’s contribution to generation of oil and gas. The {{results show that the}} Jurassic coals in the Ordos Basin have special petrological features because of the Basin’s unique depositional environment which was mainly a series of high-stand swamps in the upper fluvial system. These petrographic features are a result of the development of typical inland lakes where some sand bodies were formed by migrating rivers. After burial, the peat continued to undergo oxidizing conditions, this process generated extensive higher inertinite contents in the coals and the vitrinite components were altered to semi-vitrinite. The macroscopic petrographic types of these Jurassic coals are mainly semi-dull coal, dull coal, semilustrous and lustrous coal. The proportions of semi-dull coal and dull coal are higher in the basin margins, especially in the area near the northern margin. The numbers of semilustrous and lustrous coals increase southwards and towards the central basin. This situation indicates that different coal-forming swamp environments have major controlling effects on the coal components. Another observation is that in the Ordos’ coal sequences, especially in the lower part, some sandstone beds are thick, up to 20  m with a coarse grain size. The higher fusinite content in the macerals accompanies a higher semi-vitrinite content with more complete and regular plant cell structure. The fusinite structure is clear and well preserved. After burial, the lithology of the roof and floor rocks can continue to affect the evolution of coal petrology. The sand bodies in the roof and floor exhibit good physical conditions so that pore water can maintain a long-term state of oxidation, circulation and connection to the coal. So coal components remain in an oxidation environment for a long time. Conversely, in the basin center, lacustrine facies developed and peat was rapidly covered by mudstone after burial and subsequent coal beds rapidly entered a reducing environment. As a result, abundant gelatification occurred and the vitrinite content increased. <b>Exinite</b> often accumulated in a specific position in the coal bed. Although the average <b>exinite</b> content is not high on the whole, it does significantly contribute to the total hydrocarbon generation. The <b>exinite</b> content has been underestimated, especially the amorphous bituminous fluid and its importance is emphasized here. The reason is that the fluid flows easily into fusinite which has strong rigidity, or flows into some fissures, where it is commonly neglected...|$|E

The maturity levels based on vitrinite reflectance [Ro (%)] and Tmax (C) and the occurrence different Maceral types, i.e., fluorescent amorphous organic matter (OM), <b>exinite</b> and alginite (Tables  3, 4) demonstrate that source rock maturity in both Sembar and Chiltan formation falls in the oil and gas generation zone to cracking of oil to gas condensate zone.|$|E
40|$|The {{major oil}} and gas fields in Australia produce from coal measure sediments, in {{contrast}} to the giant oil fields of the Northern Hemisphere which are associated with the marine rocks. The organic matter in the Australian fields is present both as coal seams and fragments of coaly material dispersed through the adjacent sediments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the organic matter in the coal seams and as dispersed fragments is the same, different or systematically related. The type of organic matter in each may indicate that one is better, or the same, as a source for hydrocarbons. The sedimentary sequences examined are those of the Permian- Triassic Cooper Basin, the Permian Pedirka Basin, the Triassic Simpson Desert Basin, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Eromanga Basin, all of which are located in central Australia. In addition, the relationship of organic matter type to the depositional environment for the Permian sequence in the Cooper Basin was investigated. AH of the studies were carried out using reflected and transmitted light microscopic techniques for analyses of the organic matter. Relationships have been found between the maceral types of the dispersed organic matter (DOM) and the maceral and microlithotypecompositions of the associated coals. <b>Exinite</b> (sporinite) DOM correlates with vitrinite and sporinite in the associated coals in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, <b>Exinite</b> (cutinite) DOM correlates negatively with cutinite in the coal in the Simpson Desert Basin, Sporinite DOM correlates with vitrite plus clarite and intermediate, microlithotypes (duroclarite, clarodurite and vitrinertite) in the coals of the Cooper Basin. Vitrinite DOM correlates with vitrinite and the intermediate microlithotypes in associated coal in the Cooper Basin, and with resinite in the coal of the Eromanga Basin, Inertinite DOM, mostly inertodetrinite, correlates with inertodetrinite and durite plus inertite in the associated coals in the Cooper Basin. The microlithotype compositions of coals formed in association with a large lake environment are distinctly different from the microlithotype compositions of coals formed on the lower coastal plain and in areasdominated by coal swamps in the Permian of the Cooper Basin, Channel belt coals are also distinct in type from those of the lower coastal plain, upper coastal plain and areas dominated by coal swamps. Lower coastal plain coals can be differentiated from upper coastal plain coals on the basis of their microlithotype compositions. Those coals with the highest vitrite plus clarite contents have formed in channel belts and associated with large lakes. Coals with the highest durite plus inertite contents have formed in the areas dominated by coal swamps. Given that <b>exinite</b> is the coal maceral richest in hydrogen, and therefore the best material for generating hydrocarbons, the best source rocks in the Permian of the Cooper Basin are those which have formed in the large lake and channel belt environments.

The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation. Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G 1 to G 6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the <b>exinite</b> and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47. 2 % to 73. 0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite.

The mineral matter dominated by clays and pyrite, ranges between 4. 5 % to 20. 6 %. The microlithotype analyses shows that the vitrite plus clarite content varies from 47. 0 % to 70. 0 %, intermediates between 8. 0 % to 26. 0 %, whilst inertite plus durite content is relatively low, varying from 6. 55 % to 14. 0 %. The maximum reflectance of vitrinite has a value between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 %, which represents rank at sub-bituminous level based on the Australian rank values and corresponding to the sub-bituminous A and B rank of the ASTM classification and to the metalignitous type of the Pareek classification.

The outcrop and Sann # 1 well data on the Sembar Formation reveals poor, fair, good and very good quality of the TOC, type II–III kerogen, immature–mature organic matter and an indigenous hydrocarbon generation potential. The outcrop and Sann # 1 well data on the Chiltan Formation show a poor–good quality of TOC, type II–III kerogen, immature–mature source rock quality and having an indigenous hydrocarbon generation potential. The vitrinite reflectance [Ro (%)] values and Maceral types [fluorescent amorphous organic matter, <b>exinite,</b> alginite and inertnite] demonstrate that maturity in both Sembar and the Chiltan formation at surface and subsurface fall in {{the oil and gas}} generation zone to cracking of oil to gas condensate zone. Recurrence of organic rich and poor intervals within the Sembar and Chiltan formation are controlled by the Late Jurassic thermal uplift preceding the Indo-Madagascar separation from the Afro-Arabian Plate and Early Cretaceous local transgressive–regressive cycles. From the current study, it is concluded that both Sembar and Chiltan formation can act as a potential hydrocarbon source rock in the study area.|$|E

Lake Barombi Mbo is {{situated}} in a maar crater of the Cameroon volcanic chain. Sediment cores were recovered with a Livingstone corer. This paper presents data on core BM 6, 23. 5 m long, from a water depth of 110 m. The sediments are mainly organic matter-rich clays (5 to 10 % total organic carbon) showing alternating brown and yellowish horizontal laminae on a cm-scale. The lower part of a couplet (basal sublamina) is rich in siliciclastic (quartz, mica) grains, sponge spicules and documents the deposition of flood detritus. The upper unit (upper sublamina) is composed of grey to bluish clay which becomes green toward the top with frequently yellow, layered concretions of siderite. It corresponds to quiet conditions with settling of fine clayey particles from suspension. The overall recurrence rate of these laminae is about 15 years. This frequency is similar to present-day large flood events in this intertropical zone. From 14, 000 to 20, 000 yrs BP, the sediment accumulation rate was quite low (15 - 30 g cm- ' low 3 yrs). With less abundant precipitation, pedogenic clay formed from mica-family minerals. From 12, 000 yrs BP throughout the Holocene, the rate of accumulation increased (> 40 g cm- ' yrs) and increasing precipitation favoured the pedogenic formation of kaolinites. Turbidity currents became less important to the overall sedimentation. Plankton production remained low, documented by organic matter which is more of the <b>exinite</b> than th...|$|E

30|$|Santanghu Coalfield is {{the largest}} {{integrated}} coalfield exploration area in China. The major coal seams developing in Xishanyao Formation (Middle Jurassic) are the high-quality steam coals characterized by large thickness, favorable horizontal continuity and high coal quality. In this paper, twenty-two samples were collected from the three typical boreholes in Hanshuiquan district, representing the 11 coal seam sequences (7 #, 8 #, 9 #, 13 #, 14 #, 15 #, 17 #, 18 #, 19 #, 20 #, 22 #), respectively. The petrographic characteristics of the coal-bearing sequence in Xishanyao Formation were firstly summarized systematicly, and then the coal-forming swamp characteristics and succession mechanism of the coal seam in Xishanyao Formation were defined by analyzing the samples. The maceral composition, structure, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of coal are included in original genetic criteria of coal-forming swamp analysis. And the composition of coal petrography, maceral and microlithotype are {{the most frequently used}} parameters. Coal is composed of microscopic constituents and inorganic substances. The Xishanyao Formation maceral mainly consists of vitrinite (65.74 %– 97.01 %), inertinite (1.93 %– 34 %), and the <b>exinite</b> shows the mode of regular change. The coal-forming swamp in Xishanyao Formation possesses the characteristics of mainly marsh, wet forest swamp facies, and shallow water covered forest swamp facies, and a few of coal seams distribute in the deep water covered forest swamp facies. In addition, the sporopollens in Xishanyao Formation are mainly Pinaceae evergreen broad leaf and needle-leaved plants, Osmundaceae, Cyatheaceae and Lygodiaceae, indicating that the warm and humid tropic-subtropical climate conductive to the persistent growth of coal-forming plants in the Middle Jurassic. The coal-forming swamp shows the characteristics of vertically upward fluctuation through the periodic transition. It indicates a shallow-deep-shallow change process of the water covered depth in the swamp. This is the principal factor for the formation of the high-quality and continuous coal seam in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield.|$|E
40|$|The late Altonian to Waiauan Rotokohu Coal Measures {{formed as}} a fault controlled, rapidly subsiding fan-delta/ delta sequence. The coal {{measures}} gradationally overlie rapidly shallowing-upward Waitakian to late Altonian sediments of the marine Inangahua Formation, and are unconformably overlain by Opoitian to Waipipian shallow marine to marginal marine sediments of the Giles Formation. Three members are recognised within the coal measures: a) the late Altonian to Clifdenian (?) Thomson Member occurs north of Inangahua Landing, and is interpreted as a marine influenced lower delta plain environment. b) the late Altonian to Waiauan (?) Camp Member occurs north of McMurray Creek, and is interpreted as a humid alluvial fan characterised by gravel-dominated "scott-type" channel sediments, and locally thick sequences of fine grained overbank sediments interbedded with thick conglomeratic crevassesplay deposits. c) the late Altonian to Waiauan (?) Donkey Member occurs in the southern Inangahua Valley, and is interpreted as a parallic alluvial plain characterised by low sinuosity, predominatly sandy rivers, and thick low sulphur coal. Microlithotype and maceral analyses suggest that Rotokohu coals were predominantly formed from "woody" vegetation under telmatic (i. e. periodically inundated) conditions. Five reactives-rich, inerts-poor coal types are recognised, and are related to possible paleoenvironmental settings. Coal type variation in <b>exinite</b> content and vitrinite chemistry appear to be major influences on volatile matter yields and specific energy, while variations in vitrinite chemistry are interpreted as {{a major influence on}} vitrinite reflectance. Vertical and lateral rank variations, weathering, and a possible variable marine influence are also probable influences on the analytical properties of the outcrop coal samples used in this investigation. Syngenetic mineral matter in Rotokohu coals consists predominantly of detrital quartz, kaolinite and locally muscovite, and dominates the ash mineralogy of most samples. organically bound elements, Ca, Mg, Na and Al are a major influence on the ash mineralogy of some low ash samples. Early diagenetic, low temperature silicification is relatively common, and is locally a major influence on the mineral matter content of some samples...|$|E
40|$|The weak {{luminescence}} {{shown by}} coals has {{been attributed to}} accessorial minerals and poly-nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as <b>exinite,</b> vitrinite or inertinite, while the luminescence quenching has been found in asphaltenes produced by coal hydrogenation or in pyridine extracts. Nowadays, the spatial resolution and the improved luminescence efficiency of the modern spectrometers allow some details of the luminescent emission centers to be explained. We have selected museum historical coal specimens with different rank, i. e., peat, lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, and anthracite to be analyzed by their spectra from cathodoluminescence probe (CL) of an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), with an energy dispersive spectrometry analyzer (EDS). Additional analytical controls were also performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Raman spectrometries. We conclude that coals may display different luminescence emission features coming from several different sources, as follows: (i) broadband of intense luminescence from polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, (ii) weakly visible broadband luminescence attributed to band-tail states caused by variations in the energy gap of individual sp 2 carbon clusters, which are different in size and/or shape, (iii) silicate impurities causing the common luminescence peak at 325 nm observed in coals. This peak is due to non-bridging oxygen hole centres (¿Si-O¿) probably generated by precursor Si-O-C species formed by ¿Si-O¿ defects and carbon atoms; (iv) a 710 nm CL emission commonly detected also in wood and ivory, which has been correlated with hydrocarbon groups of chlorophyll or lignine. Coals are very complex rocks, composed by both organic and inorganic phases with variable and complex spectra. More analyses are necessary and carbonaceous standards of graphite, silicon carbide, stuffed carbon silica and diamond at variable experimental conditions have to be developed.
