5|$|When Tintin in the Congo {{was first}} {{released}} by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E
50|$|Duckpin bowling has rules {{similar to}} ten-pin bowling. In a 10-frame game, bowlers try to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> pins in the fewest rolls per frame.

If a bowler <b>knocks</b> <b>down</b> all 10 pins with their first roll in a frame, it is scored as a strike. If all the pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> in two rolls, the bowler has made a spare.

40|$|Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) {{regulate}} {{virtually all}} biological processes. PTKs phosphorylate substrates in a sequence-specific manner and relatively short peptide sequences determine selectivity. Here, we developed {{new technology to}} determine PTK activity profiles using peptide arrays. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to investigate signaling in the whole organism, given its wealth of genetic tools, including morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> technology. We used zebrafish embryo lysates to determine PTK activity profiles, thus providing the unique opportunity to directly compare the effect of protein <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> on PTK activity profiles {{on the one hand}} and phenotypic changes on the other. Methodology. We used multiplex arrays of 144 distinct peptides, spotted on a porous substrate, allowing the sample to be pumped up and down, optimizing reaction kinetics. Kinase reactions were performed using complex zebrafish embryo lysates or purified kinases. Peptide phosphorylation was detected by fluorescent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding and the porous chips allowed semi-continuous recording of the signal. We used morpholinos to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> protein expression in the zebrafish embryos and subsequently, we determined the effects on the PTK activity profiles. Results and Conclusion. Reproducible PTK activity profiles were derived from one-day-old zebrafiish embryos. Morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> of the Src family kinases, Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes and distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles. Interestingly, the peptide substrates that were less phosphorylated upon Fyn and Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> were preferential substrates of purified Fyn and Yes. Previously, we demonstrated that Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> phenocopied Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> Interestingly, Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> The control Nacre/Mitfa <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> did not affect the PTK activity profile significantly. Our results indicate that the novel peptide chip technology can be used to unravel kinase signaling pathways in vivo...|$|R

Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face.

Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the 'Kara-Khitai', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets his eyes on world domination. The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in Persia would be the obvious choice, but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior Chinese Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where Genghis directs his next campaign. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the technology capable of <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.|$|E

A storm surge of 4.3ft (1.3m) flooded 20 {{homes in the}} parish. Winds in Jefferson Parish gusted up to 55mph (88km/h), causing minor roof damage and power outages. In Orleans Parish, a storm surge of 5.81ft (1.77m) {{destroyed}} 85 fishing camps constructed on wooden pilings. Winds gusting up to 68mph (109km/h) left 80,000 residences without power in the parish. Throughout the state, a total of 160,000 homes and businesses lost power due to the hurricane. Georges is blamed for three indirect fatalities; two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggravated by {{the stress of the}} evacuation, and another died {{as the result of a}} house fire sparked by an emergency candle that was tipped over.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle {{was able to}} apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked {{out of the ring}} by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw referee came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the referee, and {{executed}} an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led to Angle <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> the referee. As the other referee was knocked out, SmackDown referee Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on Angle, pinning him to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|Players control Conan the Barbarian from a third-person {{perspective}} {{while attempting}} to advance through the series of levels that subdivide the game. The gameplay {{is the same for}} each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until he reaches the end. At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called a boss. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing sequence that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle Prison {{was based on the}} Pentonville Prison in Britain, and it would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle Prison, including <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing internal walls in the main block to create four separate divisions.
