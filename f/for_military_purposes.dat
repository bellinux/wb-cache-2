5|$|The {{longtime}} {{association of}} San Diego with the U.S. military began in Point Loma. The southern {{portion of the}} Point Loma peninsula was set aside <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes</b> as early as 1852. Over the next several decades the Army set {{up a series of}} coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans. Significant U.S. Navy presence in San Diego began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma. The Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego was commissioned in 1921 and the San Diego Naval Training Center in 1923, both in Point Loma; the Naval Training Center was closed in 1997. During World War II the entire southern portion of the peninsula was closed to civilians and used <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> including a battery of coast artillery. Following the war the area retained multiple Navy commands, including a submarine base and a Naval Electronics Laboratory; they were eventually consolidated into Naval Base Point Loma. Other portions of Fort Rosecrans became Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and Cabrillo National Monument.|$|E

During the First World War, the Nevill Ground was requisitioned by the British army to graze cavalry horses. This damaged the pitch and it took a few years for it to recover. During the Second World War, the Nevill Ground was again requisitioned <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> this time to hold soldiers. In 1946, ownership of the ground was transferred from the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club to Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were {{taken aback by the}} request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes.</b> Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E

During his stay in Kirkwall he however fell ill, and died {{in the early hours}} of 16 December 1263. Haakon was buried in the St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall for the winter, and when spring came he was exhumed and his body taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the Old Cathedral in his capital Bergen. Centuries later, in 1531, the cathedral was demolished by the Danish feudal overlord Eske Bille <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes</b> in connection with the Protestant Reformation, and the graves of Haakon and other Norwegian kings buried there were apparently destroyed in the process.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique can be used <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1942, Prime Minister John Curtin {{announced}} the war cabinet decision {{to name the}} newly constructed road Forrest Highway, <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes.</b> Separately, the states' nomenclature committees were considering names for the road. A proposal for a single name {{to be used in}} both states was put by the Western Australian committee to the South Australian committee when the highway was completed. Two names were suggested: Great Western Highway, in line with similar directional names in Western Australia, and Eyre Highway, after the explorer. After several communications between the committees, both decided to use the name Eyre Highway. After a receiving a letter from the South Australian Premier in May 1943, supporting the nomenclature committee's recommendation, Curtin agreed to the name, subject to approval from the Western Australian government.|$|E

5|$|The Baths of Zeuxippus {{were popular}} public baths {{in the city}} of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. They were built between 100 to 200, {{destroyed}} by the Nika revolt of 532 and then rebuilt several years later. They were so called because they were built upon the site where a Temple of Jupiter (Zeus) had formerly existed. They were built around 500 yards south of the much older baths of Achilles of the earlier Greek Acropolis in Byzantion. The baths were famed primarily for the many statues that were built within, and the famous people they each represented. However, they were later used <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> during the seventh century. Excavations of the site and the Baths were made in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished. The ground floor and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes</b> and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|This ordinance, {{with the}} {{reorganisation}} of the islands, was enacted {{to provide a}} method for removing the Chagos Islanders so that the islands {{could be used by}} the United States as a military base, particularly the island of Diego Garcia. From 1964 onwards the United States and United Kingdom had been in talks about leasing Diego Garcia to the US <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> and by an exchange of notes dated 30 December 1966, the UK government transferred Diego Garcia to the US for the purpose of hosting a defensive communications base.

The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support a}} sizable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased castor sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships would be used <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>purposes,</b> the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's entrance channel, {{with the intention of}} preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to carry his raiding parties.|$|E
