40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} a MEMS stage in a vacuum environment. The stage is suspended by a flexure mechanism and is actuated by electrostatic comb-drives. The position of the stage is measured by an integrated sensor based on the conductance of heat through air. The vacuum behavior of the sensor and the stage is identified. A model for thermal conductivity and viscous damping {{as a function of}} the vacuum pressure is presented and validated by measuring the decreasing sensor response and the increasing Q-factor for decreasing pressure. We have identified the system in the frequency domain, which is used to compare the closed-loop behavior with three different controllers: an <b>integral</b> <b>controller,</b> an <b>integral</b> <b>controller</b> with low-pass filter, and an <b>integral</b> <b>controller</b> with notch filter. The <b>integral</b> <b>controller</b> can become unstable due to the high Q-factor in vacuum. Adding a low-pass or a notch filter improves the stability at low pressures. Since the <b>integral</b> <b>controller</b> with notch filter shows the lowest settling time, this is the preferred controller. Overall, we are able to control the position of the MEMS stage at a pressure of 1 mbar with a reduced resolution of approximately 1. 1 μm, but with a good settling time of 2. 2 ms...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a design framework for variable gain <b>integral</b> <b>controllers</b> {{with the aim}} to improve transient performance of linear motion systems. In particular, {{we focus on the}} well-known tradeoff introduced by integral action, which removes steady-state errors caused by constant external disturbances, but may deteriorate transient performance in terms of increased overshoot. We propose a class of variable gain <b>integral</b> <b>controllers</b> (VGICs), which limits the amount of integral action if the error exceeds a certain threshold, in order to balance this tradeoff in a more desirable manner. The resulting nonlinear controller consists of a loop-shaped linear controller with a variable gain element.

For the add-on part of the nonlinear variable gain part of the controller, we propose an optimization strategy, which enables performance-optimal tuning of the variable gain based on measurement data.

Among the available multilevel converter topologies, the cascaded multilevel converter constitutes a promising alternative, providing a modular design that can be extended to allow a transformer less connection.
