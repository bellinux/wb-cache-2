40|$|The {{characteristics}} of data monitoring {{and the need}} for the use of data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> in clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry differ from those of trials sponsored by government. Data monitoring is a continuous process in industry trials due to the regulatory requirements and the need to more thoroughly evaluate safety of new compounds. As part of this process, interim analyses are employed to make decisions about treatment effects. In some cases, such analyses may require the use of an external data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> to assist in the data review, analysis and decision making. A number of examples of interim analyses, with and without data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees,</b> are discussed. Issues surrounding the need for external data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> and recommendations are presented. In particular the issues of sponsor participation in the data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> and controls of the decision making process are considered...|$|R

25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|R
