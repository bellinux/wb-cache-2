5|$|He {{then used}} a <b>hypothesis</b> <b>of</b> local realism to {{conclude}} that the other particle had these properties already determined.

5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} <b>hypothesis</b> <b>of</b> constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current <b>hypothesis</b> <b>of</b> constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant.

5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's <b>hypothesis</b> <b>of</b> anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a <b>hypothesis</b> <b>of</b> cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

40|$|The {{validity}} {{problem for}} certain universal Horn formulas of Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) can be efficiently {{reduced to the}} equational theory. This reduction is known as elimination <b>of</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> Hypotheses are {{used to describe the}} interaction of atomic programs and tests and are an essential component of practical program verification with KAT. The ability to eliminate <b>hypotheses</b> <b>of</b> a certain form means that the Horn theory with premises of that form remains decidable in PSPACE. It was known (Cohen 1994, Kozen and Smith 1996, Kozen 1997) how to eliminate <b>hypotheses</b> <b>of</b> the form q = 0. In this paper we show how to eliminate <b>hypotheses</b> <b>of</b> the form cp = c for atomic p. <b>Hypotheses</b> <b>of</b> this form are useful in eliminating redundant code and arise quite often in the verification of compiler optimizations (Kozen and Patron 2000). ...|$|R
5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.

Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of psychological nativism.
