500|$|In September 2012, Minaj {{announced}} the reissue of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, containing an additional disc with eight newly-recording songs and an exclusive behind-the-scenes DVD {{to supplement the}} standard edition of the original album. Minaj commented at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, [...] "I'm putting lots of new songs on there and I'm actually going to <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> new single like next week. Barbz, you are gonna spaz. You are gonna love it. You are gonna go crazy!" [...] Production {{of the project was}} a main focus on Minaj's three-part E! special, Nicki Minaj: My Truth, which aired in November 2012. On On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Minaj stated that [...] "I feel like the music is such a better representation of me where I am now as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." ...|$|E
60|$|I found a mail-box on the corner, and <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> {{letter in}} it.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced around}} the room. We were {{absolutely}} alone, but I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> voice.|$|R
60|$|I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> glance, browbeaten for an instant. Then I {{looked at}} him again, and smiled.|$|R
2500|$|... "Satchel Ass" [...] or [...] "Bucket Butt" [...] or [...] "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he {{introduced}} me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
2500|$|The Manchester {{performance}} was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly {{placed at the}} Royal Albert Hall). The recording of this gig {{became one of the}} most famous of Dylan's career. In a 1971 review for Creem magazine, critic Dave Marsh wrote, [...] "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to <b>drop,</b> <b>my</b> body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable." [...] When it finally saw [...] in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record [...] "an important document of rock history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> point, sir! If {{you have}} been wrong, I am sure I am bound to ask your pardon for setting you so!" [...] says Mr. Hagan, with a fine bow.|$|E
60|$|Taking {{leave of}} me in my turn, the widow <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> hand, struck, to all appearance, by a new idea.|$|R
50|$|The label <b>dropped</b> <b>My</b> Passion after Inside This Machine, {{and as of}} now, My Passion are not on {{a record}} label.|$|R
60|$|The deeply planted {{instinct}} of gentleness {{and obedience}} prevailed; she <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> hand, {{but did not}} move away from me, even yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember," [...] said James, [...] "there {{will always}} be a knife and fork for you at our little nest. Grace is not the woman to want me to <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> {{bachelor}} friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you! But I {{should be}} obliged {{if you would}} <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> title now. I told you because you asked me, but I've left the quarter-deck, and I am plain Mr. Hay Denver now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Chronos. Weary, {{weary of}} my weight, [...] Let me, let me <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> freight, [...] And leave the world behind. [...] I could not bear, [...] 10 [...] Another year, [...] The load of human kind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} you, at least, are doing your part," [...] I rejoined gallantly, <b>dropping</b> <b>my</b> eyes on my companion's learned volume.|$|R
60|$|He <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> {{hand as if}} it {{had become}} {{suddenly}} red hot. A moment of profound silence ensued, as though something extraordinary had happened.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Parker, {{with the}} menu {{in front of}} him, was busy with the waiter and a maître d'hôtel. I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> voice a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, old Noel Hasluck's {{not exactly}} a fool," [...] he assented, [...] "but I'd like myself better if I could talk about {{something}} else than business, and didn't <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> aitches. And so would my little gell." ...|$|E
6000|$|Doctor Lagarde sighed, and {{reclined}} in his chair. [...] "My head is heavy," [...] he said; [...] "my {{spirits are}} dull. The darkness baffles me. I have toiled {{long enough for}} you. <b>Drop</b> <b>my</b> hand and leave me to rest." ...|$|E
60|$|My Lords, {{permit me}} {{for one moment}} to <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> {{representative}} character here, and to speak to your Lordships only {{as a man of}} some experience in the world, and conversant with the affairs of men and with the characters of men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{given out}} this trip," [...] he spluttered. [...] "I've <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> knife, though. Go on and try the cutting. I'll follow when I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> axe in the forest, bid your {{daughter}} go and fetch it, for mine {{has worked hard}} all day and is both wet and weary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{pushed off}} {{as quietly as}} {{possible}} and rowed swiftly down the river. When we had gone about a mile I suddenly <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> oar with an exclamation of dismay.|$|R
60|$|It {{was killing}} work. We had to rest every few steps. Often we would fall. Jim laughed, Jones swore, and I groaned. Sometimes I had to <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> things {{to help my}} companions. So we toiled wearily up the loose, steep way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} may," [...] said Angel. [...] "Was it not proved {{nineteen}} hundred years ago--if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should you think, Felix, that I am likely to <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> high thinking and my moral ideals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{feel that}} I have mistaken my sphere, shall <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> tools, veil my bust, and cast {{myself into the}} arms of Nature, since Art rejects me;" [...] replied Miss Larkins, with a tragic gesture and an {{expression}} which strongly suggested that in her eyes nature meant Theodore.|$|E
60|$|It was {{standing}} upon {{its hind legs}} waiting for me. As I scrambled to my feet to meet it, I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> gun {{in the snow and}} doubled up with laughter.|$|R
60|$|He <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> arm as {{suddenly}} as he had taken it--and {{looked at me with}} the air of a man whose mind was relieved of the last doubt that rested on it.|$|R
6000|$|As for me, {{having already}} <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> dignity, I {{determined}} to have the whole benefit of the sacrifice. [...] "So much for the Indians," [...] I said. [...] "What about Rosanna next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{colloquy}} {{which followed}} filled Victor with dismay. It appeared that Leo was really {{eager to get}} away, as if she felt herself {{to be in a}} false position. [...] "I can't afford to <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> daily affairs in the city. Why can't these experiments be put off for a day or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forward hussy!" [...] he ses. [...] "Forward hussy!" [...] And afore I could <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> broom {{he gave me}} a {{punch in}} the jaw that pretty near broke it. [...] "Say another word against her," [...] he ses, [...] "and I’ll knock your ugly ’ead off. How dare you insult a lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{whenever}} I go to feed him," [...] said Mary Anna, [...] "I call Mungo! Mungo! and <b>drop</b> <b>my</b> {{nuts and}} corn {{down through the}} wires into the hole. And now he begins to come down when he hears my voice, and the little rogue catches up a nut and runs off with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{laughed in}} a {{somewhat}} curious fashion. [...] "We'll let that go. In one sense, I've <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> profession. I had to, and it's scarcely likely that I shall take it up again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, my angel! The {{best and}} dearest Englishwoman {{in the world}} understands them." [...] With those words he <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> hand and quietly raised his wife's hand to his lips in place of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{nice and}} old-fashioned," [...] said Fleur calmly. [...] "You're frightfully silent, Jon. Still I like silence when it's swift." [...] She let go his hand. [...] "Did you think I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> {{handkerchief}} on purpose?" ...|$|R
