5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several <b>ethical</b> <b>issues.</b> The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and <b>ethical</b> <b>issues.</b> Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E
5|$|Due to the overshadowing {{issue of}} the Soviet vs. U.S. Space Race, the <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> raised by this {{experiment}} went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show, the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while the health and retrieval—or lack thereof—of Laika only became an issue later.|$|E
40|$|Race {{and racism}} has been {{increasingly}} implicated in known disparities {{in the health}} and health care of racial, ethnic and cultural minorities groups. Despite the obvious ethical implications of this observation, racism as an <b>ethical</b> <b>issue</b> per se has been relatively neglected in health care ethics discourse. In this paper consideration is given to addressing the following questions: What is it about racism and racial disparities in health and health care that these command our special moral scrutiny? Why has racism per se tended to be poorly addressed as an <b>ethical</b> <b>issue</b> in health care ethics discourse? And why, if at all, must racism be addressed as an <b>ethical</b> <b>issue</b> {{in addition to its}} positioning as a social, political, cultural and legal issue? It is suggested that unless racism is reframed and redressed as a pre-eminent <b>ethical</b> <b>issue</b> by health service providers, its otherwise preventable harmful consequences will remain difficult to identify, anticipate, prevent, manage, and remedy. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|Defining the Ethical Issue: Often {{the most}} misinterpreted step, with {{defining}} the <b>ethical</b> <b>issue,</b> an administrator is not charged with defining the problem. Instead, {{there is an}} examination of what is the underlying ethical value that is being addressed. Often, there is a decision made because of a problem, without examination of the <b>ethical</b> <b>issue.</b> This is damaging {{to the process of}} decision-making because it harms one's ethical analysis skills and ethical identity. This is true because situations can differ, and practical decision-making may lead to inconsistencies without an ethical base (1990, p. 20).|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal ethics and her exploration {{of animals in}} environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals. The latter topic {{was the focus of}} her co-authored text Companion Animal Ethics, which explores <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> concerning companion animals, including feeding, medical care, euthanasia and others.|$|E
5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his {{chairmanship}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force {{him out of his}} chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.|$|E

5|$|Sheryl Crow is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Sheryl Crow, {{released}} on September 24, 1996 by A Records. Unlike its predecessor Tuesday Night Music Club, which was written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians, Sheryl Crow was entirely produced by Crow, who wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana. The album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and moral and <b>ethical</b> <b>issues,</b> while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock, blues, alternative rock, country, and folk.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} <b>ethical</b> <b>issues,</b> it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E

50|$|In present-day {{terms the}} {{powerless}} may include the unborn, the terminally sick, the aged, the insane, and non-human animals. It is {{in these areas}} that ethical action in Hoy's sense apply. Until legislation or the state apparatus enforces a moral order that addresses the causes of resistance these issues remain in the ethical realm. For example, should animal experimentation become illegal in a society, it is longer be an <b>ethical</b> <b>issue</b> by Hoy's definition. Likewise, {{one hundred and fifty}} years ago, not having a black slave in America would have been an ethical choice. This later issue has been absorbed into the fabric of an enforceable social order, and is therefore no longer an <b>ethical</b> <b>issue</b> in Hoy's sense.|$|R
40|$|In the Brasilian Amazonia (Tapajos region), {{an ongoing}} applied {{research}} program aims at securing {{the health of}} small-scale farming populations of the humid tropics through primary prevention regarding two emergent problems related to the deforestation, mercury contamination {{of the river and}} the spread of Chagas disease.

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{published}} a book of short stories, The Voice of the Dolphins (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and <b>ethical</b> <b>issues</b> raised by the Cold War and his own {{role in the development}} of atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or <b>ethical</b> <b>issues.</b> Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E
