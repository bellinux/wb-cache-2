40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the project, there was no sufficient knowledge about possible chemical emissions of electronic instruments. The project was intended to develop and test a standardized method for the investigation of such emissions on the basis of test chamber investigations. With the exemplary examination of 10 TVs and video records each in new condition and after artificial aging, we established extensive knowledge about chemical emissions. The evident emissions were very varied in substance, ranging from very volatile solvents to less volatile <b>flame</b> <b>proofing</b> agents. Some of the emissions were of substances that cause health hazards. The results and conclusions from the project can be used for future reducing actions for developing 'low-emission' instruments.
