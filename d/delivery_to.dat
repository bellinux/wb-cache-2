5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E

50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{discredit}} the prosecution's contention that Black had been making <b>deliveries</b> <b>to</b> Ireland, Black's defence counsel, David Spens, suggested {{on the fourth day}} of the trial the Coventry petrol receipt could only indicate Black had been making <b>deliveries</b> <b>to</b> Coventry on the day after Cardy's murder; in rebuttal, Toby Hedworth questioned a colleague of Black's, who confirmed the firm did not make <b>deliveries</b> <b>to</b> Coventry in the early 1980s.|$|R

5|$|After her <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used}} to {{transport}} 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|At New York, West Lianga {{took on a}} load of 6,882 tons of {{materiel}} for the United States Army and a deck-load of 32 {{trucks and}} departed for France in a convoy.

5|$|Drukair {{became the}} launch {{customer}} for the Avro RJX-85 in April 2000 when it placed an order with BAE Systems for two aircraft, with deliveries initially {{scheduled to take}} place in November 2001 and January 2002. Delays in the first flight and certification of the RJX pushed back expected <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> Drukair to after April 2002. BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program in November 2002, due to receiving orders from only two airlines, Drukair and British European. With British European threatening legal action to enforce their contract with BAE Systems, the aircraft manufacturer offered to fulfil the contract for Drukair, although airline management decided against acquiring the aircraft, citing potential problems with sourcing spare parts for the aircraft in future.|$|E
5|$|Following the -100SR, Boeing {{produced}} the -100BSR, a 747SR variant with increased takeoff weight capability. Debuting in 1978, the -100BSR also incorporated structural modifications {{for a high}} cycle-to-flying hour ratio; a related standard -100B model debuted in 1979. The -100BSR first flew on November 3, 1978, with first <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> All Nippon Airways (ANA) on December 21, 1978. A total of twenty -100BSRs were produced for ANA and JAL. The -100BSR had a 600,000lb MTOW and was powered by the same JT9D-7A or General Electric CF6-45 engines used on the -100SR. ANA operated this variant on domestic Japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in March 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, Argentina made {{inquiries}} in Britain {{to buy a}} new, ocean-going capital {{ship for}} its navy, which to that point, had consisted of only coastal and riverine forces, centered on the two small s. Almirante Brown, the first large ironclad of the Argentine Navy, was ordered from the Samuda Brothers shipyard of London. She was launched on 6 October 1880, and cost the Argentine government £270,000. On 14 June 1881, she conducted speed trials on the Maplin Mile, and achieved her designed speed of 14knots at full power. Upon her <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> Argentina, she was the largest vessel in the Argentine fleet, and remained so until the four Garibaldi-class armored cruisers were acquired in the late 1890s. Almirante Brown was present during the ceremonies {{for the opening of}} the south basin in the harbor of Buenos Aires on 28 January 1889.|$|E

Nationwide availability is expected by mid 2012. The first <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> a fleet customer took place on December 8, 2011 in San Francisco. The first delivery went to City CarShare, a non-profit carsharing service that operates in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley. The first individual customer delivery took place on Honolulu, Hawaii, on December 12, 2011. Sales increased from 80 units in 2011 to 588 in 2012, and rose to 1,029 during 2013. Sales fell to only 196 in 2014. A total of 1,893 i cars have been sold in the U.S. through December 2014.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E

5|$|RNAi in vivo <b>{{delivery}}</b> <b>to</b> tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within}} the body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|The 10-month 767 {{flight test}} program {{utilized}} {{the first six}} aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.|$|E
