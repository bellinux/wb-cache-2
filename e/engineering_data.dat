25|$|The {{mission was}} jeopardised by a {{concurrent}} software bug in the lander, {{which had been}} found in preflight testing but was deemed a glitch and therefore given a low priority as it only occurred in certain unanticipated heavy-load conditions, and the focus was on verifying the entry and landing code. The problem, which was reproduced and corrected from Earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software, was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion. No scientific or <b>engineering</b> <b>data</b> was lost after a computer reset, but all the following operations were interrupted until the next day. Four resets occurred (on July 5, 10, 11 and 14) during the mission, before patching the software on July 21 to enable priority inheritance.|$|E
25|$|By 1943, the IPSFC {{had found}} 37 {{obstructions}} that were impeding the salmon run along Hells Gate. After receiving an official proposal from the IPSFC that included both biological and <b>engineering</b> <b>data,</b> both the Canadian and US governments approved {{a plan to}} construct a set of fishways at Hells Gate in 1944. In 1946, construction of the fishways on both banks was completed, offering easy passage for salmon at gauge levels between 23 and 54 feet. However, problems still remained at certain water levels. At high levels of 50–65 feet, {{and low levels of}} 11–17 feet, salmon encountered difficulty migrating upstream. In response, two high-level fishways were built beginning with one on the right bank in 1947 that operated between 54 and 70 feet as well as a fishway on the left bank that operated at the same levels and was completed in 1951. Yet some issues remained, and the fishway on the left bank was extended to operate at levels up to 92 gauge in 1965. The last addition was the construction of sloping baffles on the left bank in 1966 that aided salmon passage below gauge 24.|$|E

2500|$|On January 21, 2004 (sol [...] ), Spirit {{abruptly}} ceased {{communicating with}} mission control. The {{next day the}} rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed {{it was in a}} fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. Spirit was commanded to transmit <b>engineering</b> <b>data,</b> and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via X band to Mars Odyssey. The readings from the <b>engineering</b> <b>data</b> suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating – risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon.

The European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) is actively involved in the development and validation of these Standards. In this respect, the engineering materials database hosted by the JRC at [URL] has been enabled for these technologies, thereby facilitating innovative services in support of collecting, exchanging, and publishing <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data.</b> JRC.

2500|$|All reserve {{estimates}} involve uncertainty, {{depending on}} the amount of reliable geologic and <b>engineering</b> <b>data</b> available and the interpretation of that data. The relative degree of uncertainty can be expressed by dividing reserves into two principal classifications—"proven" [...] (or [...] "proved") and [...] "unproven" [...] (or [...] "unproved"). Unproven reserves can further be divided into two subcategories—"probable" [...] and [...] "possible"—to indicate the relative degree of uncertainty about their existence.

2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that wet 1-octanol {{solution}} is a poor approximation of proteins or biological membranes because it contains ~2M of water, and that cyclohexane would be a much better approximation. [...] Investigation of passive permeability barriers for different compounds across lipid bilayers led to conclusion that 1,9-decadiene {{can serve as a}} good approximations of the bilayer interior, whereas 1-octanol was a very poor approximation. [...] A set of solvation parameters derived for protein interior from protein <b>engineering</b> <b>data</b> was also different from octanol scale: it was close to cyclohexane scale for nonpolar atoms but intermediate between cyclohexane and octanol scales for polar atoms. [...] Thus, different atomic solvation parameters should be applied for modeling of protein folding and protein-membrane binding. [...] This issue remains controversial. [...] The original idea of the method was to derive all solvation parameters directly from experimental partition coefficients of organic molecules, which allows calculation of solvation free energy. [...] However, some of the recently developed electrostatic models use ad hoc values of 20 or 40 cal/(Å2 mol) for all types of atoms. The non-existent “hydrophobic” interactions of polar atoms are overridden by large electrostatic energy penalties in such models.|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} and research sectors make significant investments {{in developing and}} producing engineering materials. These materials are manufactured and qualified in accordance with a body of testing and product standards that have evolved over many decades to meet ever more demanding requirements. Yet the very significant volume of data that result from these activities remains largely unavailable. While efforts to establish a digital infrastructure for <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data</b> {{can be traced back}} more than three decades, widespread adoption of machine-readable formats to enable the routine transfer of <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data</b> has yet to be realized. Given the reliance on electronic systems in all aspects of engineering materials development, manufacture, and qualification, it is an anomaly that simply preserving and transferring <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data</b> remains an issue. This anomaly is accentuated by the fact that in recent years other business domains have benefited from the integration of web technologies into established business models. To address these shortcomings a digital infrastructure is needed that allows and encourages the seamless transfer of <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data</b> between different systems. It is in this context that renewed efforts to develop standard formats for <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data</b> are taking place in the frame of CEN Workshops. While building on prior activities at ASTM and ISO, this work leverages existing product and testing standards with a view to engaging the engineering materials community. With preliminary technical specifications having already been demonstrated to streamline the data transfer process, attention is turning to the long-standing challenge of promoting a culture of data sharing. Whereas previously the motivations for researchers and industrial organizations to share data were lacking, the initial impacts of the DataCite framework for data citation on the utilization of the European Commission materials database hosted at [URL] are suggestive of a sea-change in data sharing and reuse. This paper describes the status of the work to develop <b>data</b> formats for <b>engineering</b> materials in the frame of CEN Workshops and reports on the added value of data citation beyond simply ensuring that data creators are properly accredited for their work. The outcome of work to enable the European Commission materials database to support standards compliant data formats and data citation has been that barriers to systems integration have been considerably reduced and, irrespective of the level of confidentiality, organizations in both the {{industrial and}} research sectors now routinely enable their data sets for citation. Together with recent innovations in digital publishing, a renewed interest in the development of standards for <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data</b> offers new prospects for discovery, exchange, and reuse of <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data.</b> Taken along with other data centric initiatives, such as physics-based and multi-scale modelling, open data, and linked data, it can reasonably be argued that standard data formats and data publishing herald a transition towards a digital infrastructure for <b>engineering</b> materials <b>data.</b> JRC.
