40|$|Distributed Decision Making {{has become}} of {{increasing}} importance to get solution of different real life problems, where decision makers are in geographically dispersed locations. Application of agent and multi agent {{system in this}} Distributed Decision Support System is an evolving paradigm. One of such real life problem is medical diagnosis. For critical medical diagnosis, medical board is formed which is a coordinative discussion mechanism between a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> physicians to diagnose a patient. But always forming a medical board with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> physicians {{may not be possible}} due to lack of infrastructure, availability, time etc. In that situation the role of multi agent based distributed decision making can comes into play. In this paper we develop a Virtual Medical Board System in which a number <b>of</b> software agents (<b>expert</b> agents) act as a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> physician with knowledge base(KB), reasoning capability. They coordinatively discuss with each other to diagnose a patient. We represent the discussion module of the system in the form of Bayesian Network of Bayesian Agent (BNBA). In BNBA each BA is the expert software agent whose Knowledge Base (KB) is represented in the form of Bayesian Network (BN). Also the BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) model of each BA is represented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{are often}} three <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> {{involved}} {{in the design and}} implementation of business processes in a service oriented enterprise; business analysts, solution architects and system developers. They collaborate with each other to transform a high-level design created by a business analyst to a final executable workflow, based on a service composition language such as the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). In this paper, we present a new approach to support and semi-automate this transformation process, thus producing applications of higher quality in shorter time. The idea is to capture existing knowledge in the enterprise, which is required for transforming models from one abstraction level to another, as reusable, parameterized patterns. These patterns are used for tool based model transformations of the business processes. To support our approach, we shall make use of Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) designed for each enterprise to capture models of a business process at different levels of abstraction, each suitable for the use of one <b>of</b> the <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts.</b> The presented approach bridges the gap between business and IT by providing customizable language-, tool- and transformation support for the different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> within the enterprise and is illustrated by an example. ...|$|R

A wide variety of anthropogenic artifacts can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, buoys, rope, medical waste, glass bottles and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost fishing line and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference 1991, {{organised}} by the EUCC and the Dutch government, {{marked the}} start of the development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as a policy approach in the European Community.

EUCC was invited by the European Commission to join the EU ICZM Expert Group; Dr. Alan Pickaver was EUCC’s representative in this expert group until August 2013. As a result, a novel means for Member States to measure the progress they are making on ICZM implementation through the use of indicators was developed. This method was presented to the Working Group on Indicators and data and accepted by the <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> in 2006.|$|E
