5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. <b>He</b> <b>allowed</b> the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. <b>He</b> <b>allowed</b> Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|An FAA {{official}} {{requested a}} face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied. The refueling process was delayed {{because of a}} vapor lock in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism, and Cooper became suspicious; but <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third after the second ran dry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opener}} of the 2017 NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> four solo {{home runs in}} 6 innings but still picked up the win. The four home runs were tied for the most allowed in a postseason game. He made two starts in the 2017 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, both Dodgers wins, {{including}} the clinching game five. <b>He</b> <b>allowed</b> three runs in 11 innings in the two games with nine strikeouts and only two walks. Kershaw started the opening game of the 2017 World Series for the Dodgers against the Houston Astros. He struckout 11 batters in the game without walking anyone and only allowed one run (a solo homer) on three hits {{to pick up the}} win. His 11 strikeouts were the third most ever by a Dodgers pitcher in a World Series game, after Sandy Koufax (15 in 1963) and Carl Erskine (14 in 1953).|$|E
5|$|Kershaw pitched 18 innings {{during his}} second trip to Jacksonville (two starts and one seven inning relief appearance), winning two games. During this stretch, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> only two earned runs, {{lowering}} his ERA to 1.91. He was recalled on July 22.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, {{against the}} Boston Red Sox, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> 10 {{runs in the}} first inning (a team record). This was the first time a major league pitcher gave up at least 12 runs without taking a loss since Gene Packard of the St. Louis Cardinals did it on August 3, 1918).|$|E

Neither would <b>he</b> <b>allow</b> {{questions}} as to whether she'd had sexual intercourse with Carter or Gilley. During more cross-examination, Price looked at Knight so often Leibowitz accused her of looking for signals. Judge Callahan cautioned Leibowitz he would not permit [...] "such tactics" [...] in his courtroom.|$|R
5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. <b>He</b> <b>allowed</b> his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E

Frederick II (who had crowned himself king of Jerusalem in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) returned to Italy, forcing the papal troops to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy. On {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> for such trade to {{continue}} and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} lawyer and court clerk, White conducted {{the teaching of}} jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> his law students to reside during their studies.

White, and Philip B. Streit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his MLB debut, the league {{investigated}} Nova and fellow Yankees pitching prospect Wilkins de la Rosa for injecting each other with Vitamin B12. Overall, Nova made seven starts for the Yankees in 2010, pitching to a 1–2 record and a 4.50 ERA. Nova reached the sixth inning only once, however, as <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> a higher opponents' batting average and ERA in the fifth inning than in the first four. The Yankees did not include Nova on their postseason roster.|$|E

(1.) <b>He</b> cannot <b>allow</b> them to question his will; for he saith in the text, [...] "I WILL in no wise cast out." [...] (2.) <b>He</b> cannot <b>allow</b> us to question his power; for the Holy Ghost saith HE IS ABLE to save to the uttermost them that come. (3.) <b>He</b> cannot <b>allow</b> them to question the efficacy of his merit; for the blood of Christ cleanseth the comer from all sin, (1 John 1:7), therefore <b>he</b> cannot <b>allow</b> that <b>he</b> that is coming to him should once think that he will cast them out.|$|R

5|$|Blaine had {{considered}} {{running for the}} United States House of Representatives from Maine’s 4th district in 1860, but agreed to step aside when Anson P. Morrill, a former governor, announced {{his interest in the}} seat. Morrill was successful, but after redistricting placed Blaine in the 3rd district for the 1862 elections, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> his name to be put forward. Running on a campaign of staunch support for the war effort, Blaine was elected with an ample majority despite Republican losses across the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
