5|$|Sivaladapids of {{southern}} and eastern Asia are best known from the Miocene, and the only adapiforms to survive past the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~34mya). Their relationship to the other adapiforms remains unclear. They <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> {{before the end of}} the Miocene (~7mya).|$|E
5|$|Most {{new cars}} were sold through {{automobile}} dealerships in the 1950s, but Crosley automobiles {{were still on}} sale at any number of appliance or department stores, and Allstate (a rebadged Henry J) could be ordered at any Sears and Roebuck in 1952 and 1953. By mid-decade, these outlets <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The Dromaiidae were {{represented}} in Tasmanian territory by two species, both now locally extinct. The King Island emu became extinct around 1802, {{and the original}} populations of emus on Tasmania <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> by 1865. Whether or not the Tasmanian emu was a separate subspecies is unclear. The extant emus of Tasmania have originated from introduced emus from mainland Australia.|$|E

5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> completely.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 29 December, the naked body {{of a young woman}} was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a {{motorist}} who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper. Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he {{found that there was}} no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati <b>had</b> <b>vanished.</b> When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E

5|$|Wat'ul Chatel's last {{monument}} {{was erected}} in 889. This stela {{is also the}} last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route. Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord <b>had</b> <b>vanished.</b> By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.|$|E
5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire <b>had</b> <b>vanished,</b> and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E

5|$|Feijó's {{administration}} {{was unable to}} suppress the uprisings in both the north and south. By 1837, his government's credibility and support <b>had</b> <b>vanished.</b> Feijó resigned in August 1837 and Pedro de Araújo Lima (later the Marquis of Olinda), a Reactionary from Pernambuco Province, became interim regent and {{was elected to the}} office the next year. He appointed his colleagues to ministry portfolios. Honório Hermeto, who had been reelected to another term as general deputy until 1841, remained in the Chamber as the party's leader to bolster the new Reactionary cabinet. The ever-weak Moderate Party collapsed, and Feijo's Moderates allied with other groups with which they shared no common principles or ideology. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, this alliance evolved into the second Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, Plante {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil—their top goaltender—had {{fractured}} his jaw. Plante played for three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.|$|E

5|$|It {{would take}} until 1982 before serious {{consideration}} {{was given to}} any expressway plan. While most of the planned 1963 routes <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> from the drawing board, a north–south link through the Red Hill Valley Creek and an east–west route along the brow of the escarpment remained in place. An environmental assessment of both links began and was approved in 1985. However, expressway opponents launched {{an appeal to the}} provincial cabinet. This appeal was rejected in 1987, and engineering began. Preliminary designs were submitted to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth and approved in April 1990. Construction began immediately on structures to carry three routes (two road and one rail) over the future Red Hill Valley Parkway.|$|E
5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later {{he was charged with}} making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|Dales {{decides to}} {{investigate}} Exley's hometown of Macon, Georgia, and discovers that {{a boy with}} Exley's name <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> about five years previously. That night at the hotel, Dales hears noises from Exley's hotel room and breaks in, only to find Exley in his true form as an alien. Exley tells Dales that he was forbidden from intermingling with the human race but {{fell in love with}} the game of baseball and remained on Earth. Meanwhile, the Alien Bounty Hunter, who has been pursuing the renegade alien ever since he deserted his alien heritage, takes Exley's form and murders a scientist who is investigating the green ooze that Dales found. After learning of the attack, Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police, and Exley goes into hiding.|$|E

5|$|Following the Black Death, the {{invasion}} of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped. The inauguration of Sankta Karin in 1412 {{marks the end of}} church building activity in Visby. When troops from Lübeck pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, the social and economic rationale for sustaining them <b>had</b> <b>vanished.</b> With the advent of the Reformation soon afterwards, the religious rationale to sustain the upkeep of the many churches also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day Visby Cathedral) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as quarries. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated money for their conservation.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{chaos of}} the civil war brought the introduction of legal tender notes, backed only by the credit of the government, and by mid-1862, gold and silver coins <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> from circulation in much of the nation, their place taken by such makeshifts as fractional currency and postage stamps. The three-cent silver remained in circulation longer than the other silver coins, apparently because the public thought it was still made of debased silver, but by the autumn of 1862, it too was hoarded. With little point to issuing coins that would not circulate, mintage of the three-cent silver dropped from 343,000 in 1862 to 21,000 in 1863, a figure that would be exceeded only once (22,000 in 1866) {{during the rest of the}} series. In March 1863, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase wrote in a letter that the three-cent silver had entirely vanished from circulation, and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding.|$|E
5|$|The main Allied {{detector}} at {{this time}} was the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD). MAD entered service in 1943, only to find its targets <b>had</b> <b>vanished</b> from coastal waters. It was able to plot and recognise distortions in Earth's magnetic field caused by submarines. It took some skill to use and only worked if it was directly above the target. It also was only effective at low altitudes. It had some success in the Gibraltar strait, but was ineffective in British waters owing to different conditions. The only recorded MAD victory in British waters was the sinking of U-1055 on 30 April 1945 off Ushant. Another invention was the American 3-cm radar and sonobuoy. These devices, along with the Mark 24 Mine (Fido), {{was responsible for the}} destruction of U-905 and U-296, sunk by No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 120 Squadron RAF.|$|E
