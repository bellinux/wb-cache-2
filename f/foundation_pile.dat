50|$|Ground heat {{exchangers}} (GHEs), {{which are also}} called geothermal {{heat exchangers}}, have emerged as a promising and globally accepted way of exploiting shallow geothermal energy, for example ground-coupled heat pumps, ground heat storage. A GHE is essentially a pipe (e.g., U-, W-, or helical-shaped) in a vertical borehole or a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> of a building, in which a circulating heat-carrying fluid absorbs (or discharges) heat from (or to) the ground.GHEs can have various configurations. This article discusses two kinds of closed loop GHEs, i.e., borehole and <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> GHEs. The borehole type is the most common. It consists {{of one or two}} U-shaped pipes that are inserted into a vertical borehole and connected to a heat pump or a heating system to form a closed loop. A U-shaped channel usually comprises two small-diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes thermally fused to form a U-shaped bend at the bottom. The space between the wall of the borehole and the U-shaped tubes is usually grouted completely with grouting material or, in some cases, partially filled with groundwater. The depth of the hole (generally from 30 m to 200 m) depends strongly on local geological conditions and available drilling equipment.In a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> GHE (or energy pile), the heat transfer tubes are inside the steel frame of a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile.</b> There are various possible shapes. Foundation piles are usually much shallower than boreholes and have a greater radius. Since energy piles generally require less land area, this technology is evoking increasing interest in the ground-source heat pumps community.|$|E

Empty Tableau spaces are automatically filled with the top card from the Stock Pile. After the Stock Pile is emptied, any card from the Waste Pile can be moved to the Tableau.

50|$|The {{goal is to}} move {{cards from}} the tableau and the reserve piles to the {{foundation}} to form 4 piles from ace to king (1 for each suit) and 4 piles of king to ace (1 for each suit).

The surface casing serves as a <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> for the well which transfers the hanging load to the earth. The casing head is prepared with a bowl into which the slips sit and chuck the casing in place. Most casing heads allow for the pressure readings to be taken on the annulus and provide the means to pump out or into if necessary. The top of the casing string and annulus is usually sealed.|$|E

50|$|Statnamic testing {{works by}} {{accelerating}} a mass upward {{that in turn}} imparts a load onto the <b>foundation</b> <b>pile</b> below the Statnamic device. The load is applied and removed smoothly resulting in load application of 100 to 200 milliseconds. This is 30 to 40 times the duration of dynamic pile load testing. As {{the duration of the}} loading is relatively long, piles less than 40m in length remain in compression throughout resulting in negligible stress wave effects and potentially simpler analysis. For foundation design it is necessary to derive the equivalent static load-settlement curve from the Statnamic data. The simplest form of Statnamic analysis used to obtain equivalent static pile response is known as the unloading point method (UPM) The UPM analysis method was conceived to be simple and based on measured results alone (Middendorp et al., 1992).|$|E

50|$|Anton Strauss {{is famous}} for inventing an {{improved}} method of providing a water-tight vertical layer and simultaneously compressing portions of ground adjacent to the layer for use in dams, dikes and like structures or in the ground. The technology {{was used for the}} first time during construction of buildings of Russian South-West Railways in Kiev. Later the technology was applied to construct bridges, tunnels, ports and houses in Russia and abroad. Anton Strauss patented the technology on 18 May 1909 in the US, patent # 922,207. Anton Strauss supported various projects of his partner and close friend architect Vladislav Gorodetsky. Aton Strauss’s innovative solutions technically implemented the ideas of his famous colleague. For instance, because of a height difference, to construct the legendary House with Chimaeras in Kiev the engineer had to build special stepped <b>foundation,</b> <b>pile</b> on one side and tape on the other. As an engineer Anton Strauss participated in construction of the Museum of ancient history and arts (Grushevskogo str, 6), the Karaite Kenesa (Bolshaya Podvalnya str.7), the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral (Bolshaya Vasilkovskaya str. 75).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} defective piles with stem shrinkage on the working behavior of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> under vertical loadings, a numerical model was set up for the analysis of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations.</b> A series of contrastive analyses were made to a group <b>piled</b> <b>foundations</b> including a <b>pile</b> with defect of stem shrinkage in a shallow or a deeper depth and a <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> with normal <b>piles</b> with a three dimensional nonlinear finite-infinite element method. The basic working behavior of the <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> with a defective pile of stem shrinkage was initially revealed by the results of the analyses; and the basic rules of the affects of pile stem shrinkage defect on the distribution of axial forces among piles and the bending moments in pile caps were obtained. The results of this research are not only helpful for the understanding and rational judgment of the working mechanism, but also of practical importance in the assessment of the bearing behavior of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> including defective <b>piles</b> with stem shrinkage and in the structural designs of piles and pile caps...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{temperatures}} change {{daily and}} seasonally, the spans of integral bridges increase and decrease, pushing the abutment against the approach fill and pulling it away. As {{a result the}} bridge superstructure, the abutment, the approach fill, the <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> and the <b>foundation</b> soil are all subjected to cyclic loading, and understanding their interactions is important for effective design and satisfactory performance of integral bridges. In this study, a finite element analysis has been performed to gain insight into the interactions between integral abutments, approach fills, <b>foundation</b> <b>piles</b> and <b>foundation</b> soils. The finite element analyses indicate appreciable rotations occur in integral abutments, resulting in the shear and moment reductions in the piles...|$|R
