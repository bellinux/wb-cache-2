The permeabilizing behavior of the native binary toxin and its two individual components expressed as recombinant proteins was studied using calcein efflux determination in liposomes and by ion channel activity measurements in planar lipid bilayers (PLBs). Data obtained with solubilized native PS 149 B 1 binary protein revealed {{it to be a}} pore-forming toxin that can permeabilize liposomes and form ion channels (apprx 300 - 900 pS) in PLBs at pH 5. 5 but not pH 9. 0.

While the 44 -kDa moiety did seldomly form resolvable ion channels (apprx 15 - 750 pS) in PLBs, it did destabilize the membranes. It showed pH-dependent truncation to a stable 40 -kDa protein.

The final transport of these beams is challenging, since no focusing magnets can be placed inside the reactor chamber. Plasma channels are a solution: they can easily be created by discharges inside the chamber and they possess an azimuthal magnetic field of up to several tesla. Calculations with a hybrid magnetohydrodynamics and particle-in-cell code {{have shown that the}} fields created by a 60 kA discharge are sufficient to transport the ion beams over several meters inside the channel[1]. Naturally, kiloampere heavy ion beams are not available yet. Therefore our experiments at the UNILAC accelerator facility at GSI do {{not take into account the}} large spacecharge effects of a reactor beam. Nevertheless studies of the channel evolution and stability and proof-of-principle experiments regarding beam transport are possible. Our initial experiments used a 50 cm long chamber with a diameter of 60 cm[2]. Recently the chamber was prolonged to 1 m to be closer to the reactor parameters. This required electric field calculations to improve the chamber design. The gas breakdown depends on the electric field, the gas pressure and the initial ionization of the gas. A breakdown to the metallic chamber walls can therefore be prevented by reducing the gas density on the axis (laser <b>induced</b> <b>channels)</b> or by ionizing the gas before the discharge (ion beam <b>induced</b> <b>channels).</b> However, these methods still require a reasonable field distribution in the chamber.
