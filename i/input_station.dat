30|$|On the one hand, {{impediment}} can {{be caused}} by the presence of a self-loaded general cargo unit that has not yet left the input area in the moment when the next general cargo unit is ready to be placed on the conveyer belt. This phenomenon is called self-impediment. On the other hand, at subsequent <b>input</b> <b>stations</b> of a multistage feeder system, impediment may and usually will be caused by traversing general cargo from previous <b>input</b> <b>stations.</b> This article is largely focused on the latter type of impediment, mutual impediment (see Sect.  2).|$|R
30|$|The {{main focus}} of this article has been the {{theoretical}} investigation of the divided conveyer belt based on the probabilistic treatment of an idealized model with two <b>input</b> <b>stations.</b> The reduction of input performance has been quantified in terms of the worst-case average idle time that can occur due to mutual impediment. In good agreement with the experimental results discussed in Sect.  3, the model predicts substantial reduction of the deficiency caused by mutual impediment, when the <b>input</b> <b>stations</b> of the divided conveyer belt are equipped with input areas that permit spatially variable input. In particular, with an optimal choice of the acceleration factor of the divided conveyer belt feeding system (a = 2) in combination with an optimal choice of the width of the input area (b_E = 3 l_min), the effect of mutual impediment can be completely eliminated.|$|R

2500|$|The main {{displays}} {{were driven}} by the Coordinated Display Equipment (CDE). Inside the CDE, a [...] telephone stepper switch was used to periodically connect {{to each of the}} displays in turn. Depending on which button was being held down on the input console at that time, the switch connected the trackball to one of 96 pairs of servomotors connected to potentiometers that were used a storage mechanism. The output of the potentiometers was sent back to the input consoles, creating a [...] "blip" [...] on the screen that matched the underlying radar data but did not move, allowing the operators to choose which blips required updating. [...] In the prototype versions, there were only three <b>input</b> <b>stations</b> allowing a total of 24 targets to be tracked, but they could also read up to eight more inputs from external sources, nominally data from other ships.

30|$|In summary, {{the divided}} {{conveyer}} belt feeding system, {{which has been}} first presented by the author in 2003 [12], and its potential to reduce, respectively, eliminate the reduction of input performance caused by mutual impediment have been discussed in this article.

[...] They first originated in the 1960s, initially focusing on heavy pallet loads but with {{the evolution of the}} technology the handled loads have become smaller. The systems operate under computerized control, maintaining an inventory of stored items. Retrieval of items is accomplished by specifying the item type and quantity to be retrieved. The computer determines where in the storage area the item can be retrieved from and schedules the retrieval. It directs the proper automated storage and retrieval machine (SRM) to the location where the item is stored and directs the machine to deposit the item at a location where it is to be picked up. A system of conveyors and or automated guided vehicles is sometimes part of the AS/RS system. These take loads {{into and out of the}} storage area and move them to the manufacturing floor or loading docks. To store items, the pallet or tray is placed at an <b>input</b> <b>station</b> for the system, the information for inventory is entered into a computer terminal and the AS/RS system moves the load to the storage area, determines a suitable location for the item, and stores the load.

5000|$|The {{following}} is quoted from UT78:Calma's computer-aided design and drafting systems (also {{referred to as}} interactive graphics systems) are [...] component hardware modules, electronic interfaces, and software programs. Most of the systems sold are constructed by combining available components {{to meet the requirements}} of the customers' specific design or drafting application. Calma's systems enable customers to automate a wide variety of design and manufacturing processes which have previously been performed manually.The primary hardware components of a system are a central processing unit, operator stations and plotter outputs.Their GDS I and II software operated on Data General Corporation's Nova and Eclipse line of 16 bit mini Computers. Sketches or layouts of electronic system were first manually drawn on mylar or paper to scale and were placed on large backlit 48 by 60 inch table digitizers. Using a moving stylus, these layouts were organized in layers, first placing the smaller common and custom circuits, created in a library, then manually traced their interconnecting circuitry on further layers, the completed layout then stored in computer files. Printed Circuit Boards (PCB's) and Small Scale Integrated Circuits (SSIC) were manually traced buy an operator, usually a draftsman or electronic engineer then plotted on a large pen plotter (In later years to faster Electrostatic Plotters) to be visually inspected to confirm that the physical layout properly matched the schematic. Once the layout and schematics final edits were manually checked to confirm their accuracy, the multiple layers of the physical circuitry were sent to a film plotter to create masks for fabrication.The central processing unit consists of a minicomputer, a computer console and page printer, a magnetic tape transport and a magnetic disk memory unit.Other optional peripheral devices such as card readers and paper tape punches are also available. These components are interfaced with Calma-designed and manufactured controllers, and integrated into a single unit with system software designed and programmed by Calma.An operator station consists of a digitizing device, an interactive cathode ray tube (CRT) display unit, coordinate readouts and a keyboard. The main difference between stations is in the type of digitizing <b>input</b> <b>station</b> used. The Calma digitizer is a backlit 48 by 60 inch table. To digitize analog graphical data directly on computer-compatible medium, the operator of the digitizer manually traces graphical data with a moveable stylus. The graphic tablet has a smaller surface and is operated with an electromechanical graphic pen and were used primary to edit an electronic layout once it was digitized.The digitizing <b>input</b> <b>station</b> is linked by system software to the CRT display, which allows an almost instantaneous display of any segment of the source drawing or a graphic element from the library. The CRT display also has windowing and magnification capability.An alphanumeric keyboard is used for entering text, scaling information, dimensions and commands, and an optional functional keyboard is available for entering frequently used functions, symbols and macro commands.The output most commonly used in Calma's systems is a graphic plotter. Calma software supports both on and off-line pen and photo plotting devices.Calma's computer-aided design systems are used {{in a wide variety of}} applications. To date systems have been sold principally to electronics firms for use in the design of integrated circuits, printed circuit boards and electrical schematics; to governmental agencies and public utilities for use in cartographic applications; and to manufacturing companies for use in the design of mechanical parts and systems.|$|E

Based on priority rules, the model decides which one should dispatch the entity waiting for service to the associated depot. Each priority rule can lead to a different delivery schedule, which is evaluated by using several criteria. At the same time, the model allows to assess the punctuality in the fulfillment of terminal demands and the system response when unexpected events, like pipeline stoppages and product stock-outs, occur. In contrast to rigorous mathematical optimization tools, the proposed simulation technique makes use of a friendly user-interface to easily analyze and manage the monthly operation of real-world pipelines networks with very low computational effort...|$|E

PROBLEM STATEMENT The increasing use of flexible production environments poses high demands on production planners. Besides the necessity to optimize the stationary production over a long period it is more and more important to be able to change quickly and efficiently between different product modes. For plants with automated transport systems we have to find optimum control sequences for the transporter to meet the requirements. Therefore we have developed a simulation model to find control sequences both for stationary and for flexible production environments. The application considered is a line of basins containing chemical, electrolytic or rinsing bathes served by one or more transporters. The plant consists of m machines M 1, …, M m, an <b>input</b> <b>station</b> M 0 and an output station M m+ 1 sometimes combined at the same place. The <b>input</b> <b>station</b> contains a set of parts J.

40|$|A {{portable}} computer called BLASIM was developed at NASA LeRC to assess ice impact damage on aircraft engine blades. In addition to ice impact analyses, the code also contains static, dynamic, resonance margin, and supersonic flutter analysis capabilities.

The blade geometry {{can be defined}} using a series of airfoils at discrete <b>input</b> <b>stations</b> or by a finite element grid.
