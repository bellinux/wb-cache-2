40|$|The {{predominant}} North-South {{active power}} flows {{across the border}} between Scotland and England are currently limited by stability considerations. As the penetration of variable-speed wind power plants in Great Britain grows, {{it is imperative that}} stability limits, operational flexibility, efficiency and system security are not unnecessarily eroded as a result. The study reported in this paper illustrates the impacts on critical <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> and power transfer limits through this North-South corridor in the presence of increasing levels of wind power plants on the GB transmission system. By focussing on the behaviour of a representative reduced test system following a three-phase fault occurring on one of the two double-circuits of the B 6 boundary, the impacts on transient stability margins are qualitatively identified. By altering the immediate post-fault active power recovery ramp-rate of the wind power plants, the transient stability performance of the grid with additional wind power can be significantly improved. The outputs of the project are intended to provide a basis for further detailed studies on a more realistic network model...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} non-synchronous, renewable energy in modern power systems displaces synchronous generation and affects transient stability. This {{is just one}} of the factors that has led to preventive curtailment of renewable energy sources in an increasing number of electrical grids. Transient stability constrained optimal power flow (OPF) techniques provide a tool to optimize the dispatch of power systems while ensuring a secure operation. This work proposes a transient stability-constrained OPF model that includes non-synchronous generation with fault ride-through capability and reactive support during voltage dips. The model is applied it to the IEEE 39 Bus benchmark test case and to the power system of the Spanish island of Tenerife, and solved using the open-source library IPOPT that implements a primal-dual interior point algorithm. The solution of the model makes it possible to optimize the dispatch of conventional plants and the curtailment of non-synchronous generation, as well as to explore methods to reduce generation cost. Fault ride-through capability, synchronous inertia and <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> are identified as useful tools to reduce the curtailment of non-synchronous generation, especially during periods of low load and high availability of renewable energy sources...|$|R

Moreover the increasing interest around modern distribution systems automation for management purposes gives faults diagnostics more tools to detect outages precisely and in short times. In this paper, the applicability of an efficient fault location and characterization methodology within a centralized monitoring system is discussed. The methodology, appropriate for any kind of fault, is based on the use of the analytical model of the network lines and uses the fundamental components rms values taken from the transient measures of line currents and voltages at the MV/LV substations. The fault location and identification algorithm, proposed by the authors and suitably restated, has been implemented on a microprocessor-based device that can be installed at each MV/LV substation. The speed and precision of the algorithm have been tested against the errors deriving from the fundamental extraction within the prescribed <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> and against the inherent precision of the electronic device used for computation.

40|$|The {{electric}} market liberalization increases its importance, as economical {{pressure and}} intensified transactions tend to operate electric power systems {{much closer to}} their security limits than ever before. The trend to merge existing systems into much larger entities and to monitor them in shorter and shorter time horizons creates more difficulties. This holds true for analysis aspects and even more for control, in as much as, today; control actions must cope with considerably more stringent market requirements than in the past. The difficulties increase further {{when it comes to}} transient stability phenomena. This thesis has discussed some theory related to transient stability such as the swing equation, transfer reactance, power angle curve and equal area criterion. In this thesis two possible methods of transient stability have been discussed and they are step by step solution for swing curve and equal area criterion. Some MATLAB programs have been developed to study the transient stability cases by using these two methods. For first method, the transient studies are conducted in two cases. For case 1, the <b>fault</b> <b>cleared</b> at <b>time</b> t = 0. 2 second and the second case 2 where the <b>fault</b> <b>cleared</b> at <b>time</b> t = 0. 4 second. For second method of equal area criterion has three case studies. All the input are same accept for sudden increase in power generator which for case 3 is 0. 9 p. u, case 4 is 1. 099 p. u and case 5 is 1. 1 p. u. Lastly for case 6 and 7 the application of equal area criterion to three phase fault were investigate the fault at the sending end of the line and fault at some distance away from the sending end. These programs are helpful in determining critical power angle, critical <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> for circuit breaker, voltage level of systems and transfer capability between systems.

40|$|In the paper, {{a general}} {{analytical}} method for the probabilistic evaluation of power system transient stability is discussed {{and a new}} statistical inference approach for this evaluation is proposed. In particular, the transient stability probability (TSP) is defined and evaluated by {{taking into account the}} random nature of both the system loads and the <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> (FCT). The paper is focused upon the aspect of statistical estimation of the TSP - a topic generally neglected in literature - {{on the basis of the}} obvious consideration that the parameters affecting the TSP (e. g. mean value and variance of loads, FCTs, etc.) are not known, but must be estimated. New properties of point and interval estimations of the TSP are derived and, in particular, an efficient "lower confidence bound" for the TSP estimation is proposed, based upon a suitable Beta probability distribution. In order to show the feasibility of the proposed approach, a numerical application to the Cigre test network is illustrated. Moreover, extensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the estimator efficiency are performed. In the final part of the paper, also a practical example of possible application to the optimization of system design is illustrated. The application of the method is illustrated and performed by using the potential energy boundary surface method, but the estimation results hold their validity irrespective of the method adopted for the transient stability problem formulation and resolution...|$|R

40|$|The hazards from Earth Potential Rise (EPR) at {{existing}} distribution steel poles {{installed in}} a rural farming property were investigated. Different fault scenarios were identified {{as part of the}} project. The software package CDEGS was used to determine conservative allowable voltage criteria for the various fault scenarios and applicable <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times.</b> Touch voltages modelled in CDEGS were all below the allowable voltage criteria for the different size fault currents at all fault locations. Risk was calculated to quantify the hazard. The hazard from EPR can be considered low and the risk can be categorised as negligible. Voltages were modelled in CDEGS to assess the impact on animals, especially cattle. These voltages were also below the tolerable voltage criteria for the different fault scenarios, hence no mitigation was required. A safety analysis on the transfer to the Transmission Distribution -Multiple Earth Neutral (TD MEN) using the ARGON software package indicates that at the steel poles which have distribution transformers, the probability of fatality is already below 1 in 1, 000, 000 and can be further reduced by the installation of 6 m deep earth rods adjacent and bonded to the steel poles.

30|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{emerging}} DER technologies impose numerous challenges to modeling and calculations for current distribution systems, in both normal and faulted conditions. Traditional models for modeling all types of DERs are mostly applied by DMS software packages, including DFIMs and IBDERs, in both normal and faulted conditions [39, 40]. Models that inaccurately represent the distribution system are used and lead to high errors in calculated results, with a negative effect on the control and secure operation of the system. DMS software packages are a critical part for managing and controlling distribution grids. Inaccurate results caused by using inappropriate models could lead to incorrect decisions made by operators which may eventually lead to serious system faults. Examples of serious negative consequences due to inappropriate models can be found in [41, 42, 43, 44]. And the consequences include inaccurate input into the other, more advanced power applications, the false tripping of the protection equipment, prolonged <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times,</b> as well as wrong results of the fault location applications. Therefore, following the most recent literature on modeling and analysis of emerging technologies is crucial for DMS software developers, in order to integrate the appropriate models in their calculations and bridge the gap between new DER technologies and traditional modeling practices. We aim to point out challenges that exist in the integration of DER technologies with distribution system operations, and systematically present a list of potential solutions that could be implemented to avoid consequences caused by using inappropriate models.|$|R
40|$|International audienceStability is a {{primordial}} {{concern of}} power systems. From the generator point of view, {{it means that}} the machine must be able to attain an equilibrium state (possibly the pre-fault state) once the system is back to normal operation. For Synchronous Generators, the Equal Area Criterion (EAC) can be used to determine the maximum <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> also known as critical clearing time. Such criterion is not valid for Induction Generators. In fact, only a few works aimed for a stability criterion for Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG).

40|$|Abstract Electrical {{equipment}} poses {{a danger}} to maintenance personnel when the equipment must be serviced energized. While de-energized maintenance is preferred, for some tests, doing so will not provide the needed performance data to validate important performance metrics of the equipment. In particular, sites with a high cost of downtime (health care centers, data centers, continuous process manufacturing, etc.) identifying a problem that could affect series integrity of conductors (continuity) of service is critical. The infrared thermal imaging test is a common method of inferring the resistance of a connection by measuring the temperature of a component, and when normalized to current flow, {{can be used as}} a proxy for the effective resistance of the current path. Deviations from historical ratios of temperature to current may indicate a change in the junction resistance. The problem is that IR cameras require line-of-sight visibility with the energized electrical component to be tested. Many times due to available <b>fault</b> currents, <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> and/or voltage levels, this cannot be done from a far enough distance to afford the operator safety even when wearing the maximum available PPE (personal protective equipment). The challenge has been how to perform this measurement safely and accurately, but still recognize that capital (for specialized test equipment) and expenses (for labor to perform testing) are frequently limited. Therefore, having a method of performing these tests throughout a facility, ideally performed from a central location while not requiring specialized equipment (leveraging the already installed IEDs [intelligent electronic devices]), would be a valuable solution. This research discovered a solution that reads low-resolution data from legacy IEDs but processes it to improve resolution to a point where ultimately it can be used to measure junction-to-junction impedances to sufficient resolution to detect failing connections. The research outlines the statistical analysis, filter design and conductor temperature normalization algorithms necessary to achieve this goal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Turbine-generators have {{torsional}} {{natural frequencies}} due to physical properties of their long multi-element shafts. Series capacitor compensation in ac transmission networks {{has a tendency}} to reduce damping of torsional vibrations of nearby turbine generators. The phenomenon is called subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and it affects turbine-generators at subsynchronous frequencies that are specific to torsional oscillation modes of individual units. Series capacitors also have a tendency to amplify the shaft stress during major network transient events. The mechanism of the subsynchronous resonance is well understood. This paper first provides an overview of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) and the impact of series compensation on SSR, then other cases are mentioned other than series capacitor where it can also cause severe damages to machines and equipment. The paper also provides descriptions of technical methods for mitigating SSR problems. The subsynchronous resonance (SSR) for IEEE second benchmark system is simulated using Matlab based on the Power System Block-set in conjunction with Simulink.

40|$|High voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) grid {{protection}} must clear dc faults within a time-frame of milliseconds to avoid damages to power electronic components due to fast rising dc fault currents. If the breaker {{associated with the}} primary protection fails, backup must be provided to clear the faults which would otherwise persist. Backup relaying algorithms originally developed for ac systems delay the detection of primary protection failure until the expected primary fault clearance instant. Application of similar algorithms to HVDC grids results in a long <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>time,</b> which requires converters and breakers to withstand unrealistically large currents. To reduce the <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>time,</b> this paper proposes two fast backup relaying algorithms which detect local and remote breaker failure before the expected primary fault clearance instant. The proposed algorithms use thresholds on the voltage and current measurements to detect breaker failure. They are evaluated using a four-terminal HVDC grid test system implemented in PSCAD. The study {{results show that the}} proposed algorithms can reliably detect breaker failure within few milliseconds after fault inception. Furthermore, the algorithms provide faster backup protection compared to methods based on ac backup protection philosophy. The resulting decreased fault clearance time reduces the maximum dc fault current and consequently, leads to lower required ratings for HVDC grid equipment. status: publishe...|$|E

With such a large scale of penetration of converter-interfaced renewable energy sources and HVDC interconnectors, the existing power system, which is predominately supplied by synchronous generation presently, will face system operation challenges which are currently attracting the urgent attention of both industry and researchers. Studies {{have shown that the}} instantaneous penetration level limit of non-synchronous generation is approximately 65 % in the GB power system in context of first swing angular stability and susceptible to a range of factors. There has been a lack of investigation of the individual factors {{and the degree to which}} these factors influence the non-synchronous generation limit. While the general term penetration level is often used as an annual average rather than an instantaneous operational value in many papers, it has not been fully defined or a standard definition agreed to date.

It will also be illustrated that the conventional analysis method for angular stability is not applicable for future power systems with high penetration levels of NSG. Based on a simplified but high-fidelity power system model in Matlab Simulink, the penetration level limit and different factors that have the potential to influence it will be investigated and analysed.

40|$|Power systems {{stability}} {{is a complex}} problem which was first recognised in 1920 and has been widely investigated by power system engineers ever since. The first laboratory test on a practical power system was conducted in 1924, followed by the first field test in the following year. The models and method of analysis were relatively simple, with long <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> (0. 5 to 2. 0 seconds). In 1930, network analysers (which were analogue simulators of the power system) were developed and {{this led to the}} improvement of stability analysis. In early 1950 ’s, they were used to analyse problems which required detailed models of the synchronous machine, excitation system and speed governor. In the mid 1950 ’s, the first digital computer program for power systems stability was developed. Since the 1960 's most of the industry efforts and interests relating to system stability have been concentrated on transient stability. Power systems are designed and operated to criteria concerning transient stability (Kundur, 1994). There have been significant developments in equipment modelling and testing, for synchronous machines, excitation systems and loads. In addition, using high speed <b>fault</b> <b>clearing,</b> fast exciters and special stability aids have been used to improve the transient stability of power systems. The high speed exciters adversely affect the small signal stability associated with local plant mode of oscillations by introducing negative damping of the rotor angle oscillations. Such problems have been solved using power systems stabilisers (PSS). The incorporation of a power systems stabiliser (PSS) into the excitation controller is to improve the system’s performance where the system’s damping is low. At the same time, it can also combat the damping reductions introduced by an AVR (Hughes, 1991). The damping of the rotor angle oscillations can be improved by adding a supplementary signal to the excitation control system to produce a component of the electrical torque on the rotor in phase with speed variations (Larsen and Swann, 1981). Figure 5. 1 shows the block diagram of a power system stabiliser added to the excitation control system. The rotor angle oscillations of a generator feeding power to a large inter-connected power system occur in the frequency range of 0. 2 to 2 Hz. Different signals have been used as the input to the PSS including: the rotor speed deviation, the bus frequency, the electrical power deviation and the accelerating power (Padiyar, 1996). When a speed signal is employed as an input for the PSS, then a phase lead compensator is required to provide sufficient phase lead (Hughes, 1991). A transient gain or washout is normally used to remove any steady state offset in the speed signal. This filter acts as a high pass filter and is required to ensure that the stabilising signal (PSS output) does not affect the steady state regulation characteristics...|$|R
