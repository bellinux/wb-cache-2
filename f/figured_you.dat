2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I <b>figured</b> <b>you</b> needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "…two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal." [...] Richards' convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I never <b>figured</b> <b>you</b> {{had that}} many, and I don't quite {{see how you}} could have let them get away from you here. Something you didn't expect has happened?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Seem to {{know your}} voice now," [...] said the other, leaning farther out. [...] "Why, it's Curtis!" [...] He laid down the rifle and laughed. [...] "You were near getting plugged. <b>Figured</b> <b>you</b> were one of those blamed rustlers--the country's full of them--Barton back at the muskeg lost a steer last week.

6000|$|... "Then I'll {{have some}} {{pleasure}} in telling you. Soon {{after the last}} snow fell, two rustlers came up this trail--there were more of them, but they stayed down by the big one. When they went away, three of my horses went with them. Now, who caught those horses and had them ready? It's kind of curious, too, {{that they were the}} pick of the bunch, with good blood in them.

Know what I thought to-day? Mind you, Paul doesn't know a thing about this--doesn't know I was going to come see you. I got to thinking: Zilla's a fine? big-hearted woman, and she'll understand that, uh, Paul's had his lesson now. Why wouldn't it be a fine idea if you asked the governor to pardon him? Believe he would, if it came from you. No! Wait! Just think how good you'd feel if you were generous." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} Benoit?' she said; 'poor Benoit, {{who came to}} Normandy as my laquais? When I went back to Anjou he married a girl from Leurre, and went to aid his father at the farm. The poor fellow had imbibed the Baron's doctrine--he spread it. It was reported {{that there was a}} nest of Huguenots on the estate. My cousin came to break it up with his gens d'armes O Berenger, he would hear no entreaties, he had no mercy; he let them assemble on Sunday, that they might be all together. He fired the house; shot down those who escaped; if a prisoner were made, gave him up to the Bishop's Court. Benoit, my poor good Benoit, who used to lead my palfrey, was first wounded, then tried, and burnt--burnt in the PLACE at Lucon! I heard Narcisse laugh--laugh as he talked of the cries of the poor creatures in the conventicler. My own people, who loved me! I was but twelve years old, but even then the wretch would pay me a half-mocking courtesy, as one destined to him; and the more I disdained him and said I belonged to you, the more both he and my aunt, the Abbess, smiled, as though they had their bird in a cage; but they left me in peace till my uncle brought me to court, and then all began again: and when they said you gave me up, I had no hope, not even of a convent. But ah, it is all over now, and I am so happy! You are grown so gentle and so beautiful, Berenger, and so much taller than I ever <b>figured</b> <b>you</b> to myself, and you look as if you could take me up in your arms, and let no harm happen to me.' ...|$|E
