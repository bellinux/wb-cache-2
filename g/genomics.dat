5|$|Functional <b>genomics</b> using RNAi is a {{particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid, which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional <b>genomics</b> studies in bread wheat (which is hexaploid) {{as well as more}} common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize.|$|E
5|$|Genome-scale RNAi {{research}} {{relies on}} high-throughput screening (HTS) technology. RNAi HTS technology allows genome-wide loss-of-function screening and is broadly {{used in the}} identification of genes associated with specific phenotypes. This technology has been hailed as the second <b>genomics</b> wave, following the first <b>genomics</b> wave of gene expression microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism discovery platforms.|$|E
5|$|JMP {{consists}} of JMP, JMP Pro, JMP Clinical and JMP <b>Genomics,</b> {{as well as}} the Graph Builder iPad App. JMP Clinical and JMP <b>Genomics</b> combine JMP with SAS software.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatics is a {{field of}} study that {{includes}} the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, {{that can be used}} in studies of the human brain, particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression. Bioinformatics and studies in <b>genomics,</b> and functional <b>genomics,</b> generated the need for DNA annotation, a transcriptome technology, identifying genes, and their and location and function. GeneCards is a major database.|$|E
5|$|JMP is {{a desktop}} {{application}} with a wizard-based user interface, while SAS {{can be installed}} on servers. It runs in-memory, instead of on disk storage. According to a review in Pharmaceutical Statistics, JMP is often used as a graphical front-end for a SAS system, which performs the statistical analysis and tabulations. JMP <b>Genomics,</b> used for analyzing and visualizing <b>genomics</b> data, requires a SAS component to operate and can access SAS/Genetics and SAS/STAT procedures or invoke SAS macros. JMP Clinical, used for analyzing clinical trial data, can package SAS code within the JSL scripting language and convert SAS code to JMP.|$|E

5|$|<b>Genomics</b> {{is central}} to malaria research. With the {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied. Another new application of genetic technology {{is the ability to}} produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, <b>genomics</b> and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of <b>genomics.</b> Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural <b>genomics.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, SAS is {{the largest}} privately owned {{software}} company in the world. It develops, supports and markets a suite of analytics software also called SAS (statistical analysis system), which captures, stores, modifies, analyzes and presents data. The SAS system and SAS programming language are used {{by most of the}} Fortune 500. The SAS software includes a Base SAS component that performs analytical functions and more than 200 other modules that add graphics, spreadsheets or other features. SAS Institute also sells the JMP suite of statistical analysis software, which consists of JMP, JMP Pro, JMP Clinical and JMP <b>Genomics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gottesman first {{studied the}} {{genetics}} of schizophrenia {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and <b>genomics.</b> In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, new {{techniques}} were {{developed for the}} study of plants, including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging, electron microscopy, analysis of chromosome number, plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including <b>genomics</b> and proteomics and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; <b>genomics,</b> which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E
5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as <b>genomics.</b> It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial <b>genomics,</b> to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from <b>genomics</b> data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} {{can be purchased}} in any of five capability configurations: JMP, JMP Pro, JMP Clinical, JMP <b>Genomics</b> and the JMP Graph Builder App for the iPad. JMP can be automated with its proprietary scripting language, JSL. The software is focused on exploratory visual analytics, where users investigate and explore data. These explorations can also be verified by hypothesis testing, data mining, or other analytic methods. In addition, discoveries made through graphical exploration can inspire a designed experiment that can be both designed and analyzed with JMP.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{research}} institutes in Kolkata. The Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science is the first research institute in Asia. C. V. Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery (Raman Effect) done in IACS. The Bose Institute, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute, National Institute of Biomedical <b>Genomics</b> (NIBMG), Kalyani, and the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre are the most prominent.|$|E
5|$|U.S. News and World Report 2014–2015 survey ranked 4,743 {{hospitals}} in the United States in 16 specialized fields of care, and placed the Mayo Clinic in the top four in all fields except psychiatry, where it ranked seventh. The hospital ranked #1 in eight fields and #2 in three others. The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota are partners in the Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical <b>Genomics,</b> a state-funded program that conducts research into cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart health, obesity, and other areas.|$|E
5|$|Based on parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis, {{the most}} recent common {{ancestor}} of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; {{the absence of the}} pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one PIWI protein, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale comparative <b>genomics</b> study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome. This study also suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as Aquifex aeolicus), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the {{pulsed power}} {{electronics}} laboratory received $4million in federal funding. Among other things, {{the money will}} be used to create compact generators for weapon systems designed to destroy improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The College of Engineering’s Nano Tech Center has received approximately $20million in grants toward its work in applied nanophotonics, the creation and manipulation of advanced materials at the nanoscale that can produce and sense light. Texas Tech's Center for Advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence performs grid computing research through collaboration with the SAS Institute that seeks to improve the speed with which large quantities of data (such as those present in <b>genomics</b> and global economics) can be processed.|$|E
5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural <b>genomics</b> initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional <b>genomics,</b> proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignments}} {{can compare}} two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural <b>genomics</b> and proteomics efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{the site}} of most {{metabolism}} in prokaryotes, and {{a large proportion of the}} metabolism of eukaryotes. For instance, in mammals about half of the proteins in the cell are localized to the cytosol. The most complete data are available in yeast, where metabolic reconstructions indicate that the majority of both metabolic processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol. Major metabolic pathways that occur in the cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The localization of pathways can be different in other organisms, for instance fatty acid synthesis occurs in chloroplasts in plants to functional <b>genomics</b> |journal=Biochem. Soc.

25|$|As {{a pioneer}} of single-molecule biophysical chemistry, {{coherent}} Raman scattering microscopy, and single-cell <b>genomics,</b> he made major contributions {{to the emergence of}} these fields. Furthermore, he has made significant advances on medical applications of label-free optical imaging and single-cell <b>genomics.</b> In particular, his inventions in single-cell <b>genomics</b> have been used in in vitro fertilization to benefit hundreds of couples in China by avoiding the transmission of monogenic diseases to their newborns.|$|E
25|$|Functional <b>genomics</b> is a {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology that attempts {{to make use of}} the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Functional <b>genomics</b> focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, and protein–protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional <b>genomics</b> attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional <b>genomics</b> studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.|$|E
25|$|The <b>genomics</b> era {{began in}} the 1990s, with the {{generation}} of DNA sequences of many organisms. In the 21st century, {{the completion of the}} Human Genome Project enabled the study of functional <b>genomics</b> and examining tumor genomes. Cancer is a main focus.|$|E
25|$|A major {{branch of}} <b>genomics</b> is still {{concerned}} with sequencing the genomes of various organisms, but {{the knowledge of}} full genomes has created the possibility for the field of functional <b>genomics,</b> mainly concerned with patterns of gene expression during various conditions. The most important tools here are microarrays and bioinformatics.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>genomics,</b> {{referring}} to the organism’s whole genome, {{is also used to}} refer to gene informatics, or the collection and storage of genetic data, including the functional information associated with the genes, and the analysis of the data as combinations, patterns and networks by computer algorithms. Systems biology and <b>genomics</b> are natural partners, since the development of genomic information and systems naturally facilitates analysis of systems biology questions involving relationships between genes, their variants (SNPs) and biological function. Such questions include the investigation of signaling pathways, evolutionary trees, or biological networks, such as immune networks and pathways. For this reason, <b>genomics</b> and these approaches are particularly suited to studies in immunology. The study of immunology using <b>genomics,</b> as well as proteomics and transcriptomics (Includes gene profiles, either genomic or expressed gene mRNA profiles), has been termed immunomics.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{ink-jet printer}} {{technology}} {{has had a}} significant impact on <b>genomics,</b> biology, and medicine.|$|E
25|$|These new {{instruments}} had a {{major impact}} on the emerging fields of proteomics and <b>genomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Structural <b>genomics</b> {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination {{by a combination of}} experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural <b>genomics</b> and traditional structural prediction is that structural <b>genomics</b> attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large numbers of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allow scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs. Structural <b>genomics</b> involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure. As opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural <b>genomics</b> effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genomics</b> has {{provided}} applications in many fields, including medicine, biotechnology, anthropology {{and other social}} sciences.|$|E
25|$|Optimizing {{the speed}} and {{accuracy}} of these steps for use in large-scale automated structure prediction is {{a key component of}} structural <b>genomics</b> initiatives, partly because the resulting volume of data will be too large to process manually and partly because the goal of structural <b>genomics</b> requires providing models of reasonable quality to researchers who are not themselves structure prediction experts.|$|E
