The most commonly encountered of these are 6/9 chords, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th.

40|$|The {{standard}} approach to modeling consumption/saving problems is {{to assume that}} the decisionmaker is solving a dynamic stochastic optimization problem. However, under realistic descriptions of utility and uncertainty, the optimal consumption/saving decision is so difficult that only recently have economists managed to find solutions, using numerical methods that require previously infeasible amounts of computation. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that household behavior conforms fairly well with the prescriptions of the optimal solution, raising the question of how average households can solve problems that economists, until recently, could not. This paper examines whether consumers might {{be able to find a}} reasonably good rule-of-thumb approximation to optimal behavior by trial-and-error methods, as Milton Friedman proposed long ago. We find that such individual learning methods can reliably identify reasonably <b>good</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> only if the consumer is able to spend absurdly large amounts of time searching for a <b>good</b> <b>rule.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of your chin. If a board held next to the frontside of your body came to your chin then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. A <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is to stay within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers {{can use that}} utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at the}} University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most balanced table wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then multiply that number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be a <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after going through that formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|E
2500|$|Texas hold 'em {{is often}} {{associated}} with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the World Series of Poker's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with chips that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to [...] "buy-in" [...] for a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play or a deal is made among the remaining players to [...] "chop" [...] the remaining prize pool. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only {{a small percentage of the}} players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. [...] "The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table" [...] (usually nine players) [...] "to get paid for each 100 entrants," [...] according to poker author Andrew Glazer, in his book, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker. A <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is that close to 10% of players will be paid in a tournament. As a result, the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} problem solving of general {{practitioners}} (GPs), which is explored with different methods and from different perspectives. The general {{aim was to}} explore and describe <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and to analyse the management of respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTI and UTI) in general practice in Sweden. The results are based upon focus group interviews concerning <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and a prospective diagnosis-prescription study concerning the management of patients allocated a diagnosis of RTI or UTI. In addition unpublished data are given from structured telephone interviews concerning specific <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> in acute sinusitis and prevailing cough. GPs were able to verbalize their <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> which could be called tacit knowledge. A specific set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> was used for rapid assessment when emergency and psychosocial problems were identified. Somatic problems {{seemed to be the}} expected, normal state. In the further consultation the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> seemed to be used in an act of balance between the individual and the general perspective. There was considerable variation between the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>of</b> different GPs for patients with acute sinusitis and prevailing cough. In their <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> the GPs seemed to integrate their medical knowledge and practical experience of the consultation. A high number of near-patient antigen tests to probe Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A tests) and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests were performed in patients, where testing was not recommended. There was only a slight decrease in antibiotic prescribing in patients allocated a diagnosis of RTI examined with CRP in comparison with patients not tested. In general, the GPs in Sweden adhered to current guidelines for antibiotic prescribing. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV) was the preferred antibiotic for most patients allocated a diagnosis of respiratory tract infection. In conclusion, the use <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> might explain why current practices prevail in spite of educational efforts. One way to change practice could be to identify and evaluate <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> used by GPs and disseminate well adapted <b>rules.</b> The use <b>of</b> diagnostic tests in patients with infectious illnesses in general practice needs critical appraisal before introduction as well as continuing surveillance. The use <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> by GPs might be one explanation for variation in practice and irrational prescribing of antibiotics in patients with infectious conditions.
