Most of the metabolic pathways, which are {{the object of the}} majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetaseI; however, the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal <b>interdomain</b> gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s).|$|E

Calstabin2 is a protein that stabilizes RyR2 in its closed state, preventing Ca2+ leakage during diastole. When calstabin2 is lost, the <b>interdomain</b> interactions of RyR2 become loose, allowing the Ca2+ leak.

50|$|Vps26 is a 38-kDa subunit {{that has}} a two-lobed {{structure}} with a polar core that resembles the arrestin family of trafficking adaptor. This fold consist of two related β-sandwich subdomains with a fibronectin type III domain topology. The two domains are joined together by a flexible linker and are closely associated by an unusual polar core. Arrestins are regulatory proteins known for connecting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to clathrin during endocytosis. They play many critical roles in cell signalling and membrane trafficking. Both Vps26 and arrestins are composed of two structurally related β-sheet domains forming extensive interfaces with each other, using polar and electrostatic contacts to create <b>interdomain</b> interactions for ligand binding. However, there are significant structural differences between both Vps26 and arrestins. Vps26 protein has extended C-terminal tails that do not contain identifiable clathrin- or AP2-binding sequences, and therefore cannot form stable intramolecular contacts with clathrin and AP2, which has been observed for arrestins. Moreover, Vps26 does not have similar sequences as arrestins for GPCR and phospholipid interactions.|$|E
5000|$|The RID Master - (Relative ID) This FSMO role {{owner is}} the single DC {{responsible}} for processing RID Pool requests from all DCs within a given domain. It is also responsible for moving an object from one domain to another during an <b>interdomain</b> object move. When a DC creates a security principal object such as a user or group, it attaches a unique SID to the object. This SID consists of a domain SID (the same for all SIDs created in a domain) and a relative ID (RID) that is unique for each security principal SID created in a domain. Each DC in a domain is allocated a pool of RIDs that it is allowed to assign to the security principals it creates. When a DC's allocated RID pool falls below a threshold, that DC issues a request for additional RIDs to the domain's RID Master FSMO role owner, the RID Master FSMO role owner responds to the request by retrieving RIDs from the domain's unallocated RID pool and assigns them to the pool of the requesting DC.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of enzymatic catalysis by the BCKDC draws largely upon the elaborate structure of this large enzyme complex. This enzyme complex {{is composed of}} three catalytic components: alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (also {{referred to as the}} E1 component), dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2 component), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3 component). In humans, 24 copies of E2 arranged in octahedral symmetry form the core of the BCKDC. Non-covalently linked to this polymer of 24 E2 subunits are 12 E1 α2β2 tetramers and 6 E3 homodimers. In addition to the E1/E3-binding domain, there are 2 other important structural domains in the E2 subunit: (i) a lipoyl-bearing domain in the amino-terminal portion of the protein and (ii) an inner-core domain in the carboxy-terminal portion. The inner-core domain is linked to the other two domains of the E2 subunit by two <b>interdomain</b> segments (linkers). The inner-core domain is necessary to form the oligomeric core of the enzyme complex and catalyzes the acyltransferase reaction (shown in the [...] "Mechanism" [...] section below). The lipoyl domain of E2 is free to swing between the active sites of the E1, E2, and E3 subunits on the assembled BCKDC by virtue of the conformational flexibility of the aforementioned linkers (see Figure 2). Thus, in terms of function as well as structure, the E2 component plays {{a central role in the}} overall reaction catalyzed by the BCKDC.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{publication}} on the 2.5 Å {{crystal structure}} of PLCγ in complex with FGFR1 kinase (PDB: 3GQI) provides new insights {{in understanding the}} molecular mechanism of FGFR1's recruitment of PLCγ by its SH2 domains. Figure 1 on the extreme right shows the PLCγ-FGFR1 kinase complex with the c-SH2 domain colored in red, n-SH2 domain colored in blue, and the <b>interdomain</b> linker colored in yellow. The structure contains typical SH2 domain, with two α-helices and three antiparallel β-strands in each SH2 domain. In this complex, the phosphorylated tyrosine (pY766) on the C-terminal tail of FGFR1 kinase binds preferentially to the nSH2 domain of PLCγ. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 766 on FGFR1 kinase forms hydrogen bonds with the n-SH2 to stabilize the complex. Hydrogen bonds in the binding pocket help to stabilize the PLCγ-FGFR1 kinase complex. The water molecule as shown mediates the interaction of asparagine 647 (N647) and aspartate 768 (D768) to further increase the binding affinity of the n-SH2 and FGFR1 kinase complex. (Figure 2). The phosphorylation of tyrosine 653 and tyrosine 654 in the active kinase conformation causes a large conformation change in the activation segment of FGFR1 kinase. Threonine 658 is moved by 24Å from the inactive form (Figure 3.) to the activated form of FGFR1 kinase (Figure 4.). The movement causes the closed conformation in the inactive form to open to enable substrate binding. It also allows the open conformation to coordinate Mg2+ with AMP-PCP (analog of ATP). In addition, pY653 and pY654 in the active form helps to maintain the open conformation of the SH2 and FGFR1 kinase complex. However, the mechanism by which the phosphorylation at Y653 and Y654 helps to recruit the SH2 domain to its C-terminal tail upon phosphorylation of Y766 remains elusive. Figure 5 shows the overlay structure of active and inactive forms of FGFR1 kinase. Figure 6 shows the dots and contacts on phosphorylated tyrosine residues 653 and 654. Green dots show highly favorable contacts between pY653 and pY654 with surrounding residues. Red spikes show unfavorable contacts in the activation segment. The figure is generated through Molprobity extension on Pymol.|$|E

The distribution of the traffic received by the studied ISPs is uneven {{with respect to the}} "distance" from which the traffic is generated by the <b>interdomain</b> sources. There is some consistency between the actual distribution of the received traffic and the distribution of the number of <b>interdomain</b> traffic sources seen from the <b>interdomain</b> routing tables.

However, our understanding of <b>interdomain</b> dynamics is limited because a useful description of <b>interdomain</b> motions requires {{an estimate of the}} probabilities of <b>interdomain</b> conformations, increasing complexity of the problem. Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) has five tandem protein-binding domains and four <b>interdomain</b> linkers. The domains enable Staphylococcus aureus to evade the host immune system by binding to multiple host proteins including antibodies. Here, I present a study of the <b>interdomain</b> motions of two adjacent domains in SpA. NMR spin relaxation experiments identified a 6 -residue flexible <b>interdomain</b> linker and <b>interdomain</b> motions. To quantify the anisotropy of the distribution of <b>interdomain</b> orientations, we measured residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) from the two domains with multiple alignments. The N-terminal domain was directly aligned by a lanthanide ion and not influenced by <b>interdomain</b> motions, so it acted as a reference frame to achieve motional decoupling. We also applied de novo methods to extract spatial dynamic information from RDCs and represent <b>interdomain</b> motions as a continuous distribution on the 3 D rotational space. Significant anisotropy was observed in the distribution, indicating the motion populates some <b>interdomain</b> orientations more than others. Statistical thermodynamic analysis of the observed orientational distribution suggests that it is among the energetically most favorable orientational distributions for binding to antibodies. Thus, the affinity is enhanced by a pre-posed distribution of <b>interdomain</b> orientations while maintaining the flexibility required for function. The protocol described above can be applied to other biological systems in general. Protein molecule calmodulin and RNA molecule trans-activation response element (TAR) also have intensive <b>interdomain</b> motions with relative small intradomain dynamics. Their <b>interdomain</b> motions were studied using our method based on published RDC data. Our results were consistent with literature results in general. The differences could be due to previous studies' use of physical models, which contain assumptions about potential energy and thus introduced non-experimental information into the interpretations.

However, most previous studies focus only on stability, and only on a special class of routing protocols, namely BGP-type, path-vector protocols.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the recent discussion on unmet information security challenges for operating system designers. It focuses on the problem {{that in order to}} meet these challenges operating systems must be capable of supporting a multitude of information domains, each domain defined by its own and individual security policy. In such multi-domain systems, the inter-operability between different information domains constitutes a major problem. While the security policies of the system control the interactions within their domains, it is an unsolved problem how interactions between different domains can be made secure. In order to provide a precise foundation for the discussion of secure <b>interdomain</b> actions {{as well as for the}} development of concepts for their implementation, the paper proposes a classification of <b>interdomain</b> actions that clearly identifies two major types of <b>interdomain</b> actions: interactions that cause conflicts between the involved security policies and interactions for which none of the involved policies can provide any security rule.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} study, {{we showed that}} two-domain segment-swapped {{proteins}} can evolve by domain swapping and fusion, resulting in a protein with two linkers connecting its domains. We proposed that a potential evolutionary advantage of this topology may be the restriction of <b>interdomain</b> motions, which may facilitate domain closure by a hinge-like movement, crucial for the function of many enzymes. Here, we test this hypothesis computationally on uroporphyrinogen III synthase, a two-domain segment-swapped enzyme essential in porphyrin metabolism. To compare the <b>interdomain</b> flexibility between the wild-type, segment-swapped enzyme (having two <b>interdomain</b> linkers) and circular permutants of the same enzyme having only one <b>interdomain</b> linker, we performed geometric and molecular dynamics simulations for these species in their ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. We find that in the ligand-free form, <b>interdomain</b> motions in the wild-type enzyme are significantly more restricted {{than they would be}} with only one <b>interdomain</b> linker, while the flexibility difference is negligible in the ligand-bound form. We also estimated the entropy costs of ligand binding associated with the <b>interdomain</b> motions, and find that the change in domain connectivity due to segment swapping results in a reduction of this entropy cost, corresponding to approximately 20 % of the total ligand binding free energy. In addition, the restriction of <b>interdomain</b> motions may also help the functional domain-closure motion required for catalysis. This suggests that the evolution of the segment-swapped topology facilitated the evolution of enzyme function for this protein by influencing its dynamic properties. Proteins 2016; 85 : 46 - 53.
