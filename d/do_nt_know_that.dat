In 1910 the Queensland {{government}} {{adopted a}} significant {{plan to build}} a railway on the Queensland section of the alignment proposed from Bourke in western NSW, to Darwin in the <b>NT,</b> <b>known</b> as the ‘Great Western Railway’. To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21 km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.|$|R

This article was {{read in the}} medical section of the British Society of Psychology on December 14 th, 1949 and seen again there I shall enunciate first the essential points which contains this text, then I shall try to articulate them with freudian concepts and lacaniens, from psychoanalytic point of view, and with a cognitive concept post-piagétien from psychological point of view. Winnicott leaves Jones's purpose which, leaning on hypothesis that the irreducible psychical elements have forcing a (neurological) somatic equivalent, thinks that mind indeed does not exist as entity. Winnicott opposes to it, noticing from his part, in the grown-up clinical psychopathologie, that mind works so much décrit by the patients as a located entity. If cheval glass-soma, hear the newborn baby, develop "normally ", mind, for him, do not exist as entity; {{it is only when}} développementales tendencies are "abnormal « that mind can institute as a wrong entity and a wrong location. Mind has, Winnicott compares the psyche an imaginary elaboration of parties, feelings or of somatic functions of which he makes. This last, the psyche, subject would not know how to locate it, not even in the cerebrum. The correlation of the psyche and the soma constitutes the primitive stage of individual development. Finally, later, the body living with its borders differentiating inside outside, will be felt by subject as core of its imaginary Self. Here is therefore some preprefatory considerations advice from Winnicott is going to build its « theory of mind ». It is going to lean for it on patients' grown-up private hospital having regressed under transfer up to a very primitive stadium until <b>nt.</b> We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> for Winnicott, mental health rests on the feeling of a continuity of existence. Condition so that this feeling becomes established, is recovering, he says to us in this text, of what he names « a perfect environment », that is an environment which fits actively to needs A not perfect environment empiètera on the infant then forced to react to the detriment of its continuity of existence. This perfect environment will be assured by the good ordinary, capable mother to fit actively to the needs of his infant and whose this aptitude rests on the devotion which it dedicates him. Besides, this adaptation will be made easier by its own narcissism, its imagination and its memories, who, via identificatoires processes, will allow him the access to a knowledge on the needs of the infant. Here are therefore purposes which we can articulate to the defined mother as baby other one serving, at this logical time of subjective building, big Other one...|$|R
40|$|Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{endogenous}} small non-coding RNAs {{of about}} 20 – 24 <b>nt,</b> <b>known</b> to play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, {{that can be}} coded either by intergenic or intragenic loci. Intragenic (exonic and intronic) miRNAs can exert {{a role in the}} transcriptional regulation and RNA processing of their host gene. Moreover, the possibility that the biogenesis of exonic miRNAs could destabilize the corresponding protein-coding transcript and reduce protein synthesis makes their characterization very intriguing and suggests a possible novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This work was designed to carry out the computational identification of putative exonic miRNAs in 30 plant species and the analysis of possible mechanisms involved in their regulation. The results obtained represent a useful starting point for future studies on the complex networks involved in microRNA-mediated gene regulation in plants. </p...|$|R

Using consumer rejection threshold (CRT) method, this study aimed to assess whether systematic changes in the taste intensities of familiar foods would lead to earlier rejection of these products by PROP tasters than by PROP non-tasters. Subjects rated the intensity of PROP solution and were divided into tasters (Ts) and non-tasters (NTs). And Ts were further divided into medium-tasters (MTs) and super-tasters (STs). Difference thresholds and CRTs were then evaluated for caffeine in coffee, citric acid in orange juice, and for NaCl in beef soup. For each food, Ts were more sensitive to variations in tastants than NTs. Ts also rejected more bitter coffee, more sour orange juice, and less salty beef soup more readily than <b>did</b> <b>NTs.</b> Comparisons among NTs, MTs, and STs gave fewer clear differences...|$|R

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} colony-stimulating factor (CSF) {{have recently been}} described in human tissues and cultured cell lines. Antisera to purified type I and II CSF were prepared in rabbits. Anti-CSF I antibody inhibits CSF I, but {{has no effect on}} CSF II. It cross-inhibits CSF I from several other human sources, but does not inhibit CSF from mouse lung or mouse L cells. Anti-CSF II antibody inhibits the activity of CSF II, but has no effect on CSF I. A radioimmunoassay for CSF I has been established. Competitive binding assay further demonstrated the immunological differences between CSF I and II. When CSF II is used to stimulate human marrow cells fractionated by sedimentation velocity, two populations of CFU-C are separated, one sedimenting at 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 7, and a second sedimenting at 6. 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 13. In contrast, CSF I <b>does</b> <b>nt</b> stimulate colony growth by day 7 but does do so by day 13 in cells sedimenting between 7. 2 - 8. 5 mm/h.
