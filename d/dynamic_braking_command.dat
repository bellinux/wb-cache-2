40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedVarious {{methods have been}} introduced for <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of ships. Depending on the prime mover and transmission system, <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> is accomplished by electric power dissipation (in electric driven ships) or clutches and braked, or air compression (in diesel engine propulsion systems). In this study a gas turbine - electric drive combination is used as the means of propulsion; the usual method for <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> is the electric power dissipation method using resistors. This thesis is concerned with an investigation of different methods for <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> {{in an attempt to}} find a way to decrease the size of the braking resistors needed and their associated equipment, or to eliminate the need for these by using another type of <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking.</b> [URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R
50|$|The second {{locomotive}} in the head-end set, SP 7551, {{since it}} was dead-in-tow, did not have operative <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes,</b> just air brakes. The event recorder downloaded from unit SP 7549 (the third locomotive), showed that it was producing traction current in motoring but no current in <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking.</b> The <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> of the fourth locomotive, SP 9340, operated sporadically and were of limited use. Unit SP 8317 (of the two-unit helper engine set coupled {{to the rear of}} the train) also did not have an operative <b>dynamic</b> <b>brake.</b> Thus, among the four locomotives in front and the set of helpers on the end, only SP 8278 at the front of the train and SP 7443 at the back of the train had fully functioning <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes.</b> This information was not passed on to the train dispatcher. The train engineer knew only that the second unit of the head-end consist (SP 7551) had no brakes, but believed he had more than sufficient <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> to maintain the speed of 6,151 tons (as was still listed in the cargo manifest) because 6,151 tons would only require the <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> effort of five engines. With a true weight of 8,900 tons, however, the train would have needed the functioning <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> of at least six or seven engines (with moderate dependence on the air brakes), or five engines (with a heavy input from the air brakes) in order to maintain control.|$|R
50|$|Although blended <b>braking</b> {{combines}} both <b>dynamic</b> and air <b>braking,</b> {{the resulting}} braking force {{is designed to}} be the same as what the air brakes on their own provide. This is achieved by maximizing the <b>dynamic</b> <b>brake</b> portion, and automatically regulating the air brake portion, as the main purpose of <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> is {{to reduce the amount of}} air braking required. This conserves air, and minimizes the risks of over-heated wheels. One locomotive manufacturer, Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD), estimates that <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> provides between 50% to 70% of the braking force during blended braking.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of this and other runaway {{incidents}} involving locomotives with <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> the Federal Railroad Administration reversed its mandate that <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> be disabled when train brakes are placed in emergency.

50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> {{is the use}} of the {{electric}} traction motors of a railroad vehicle as generators when slowing the locomotive. It is termed rheostatic if the generated electrical power is dissipated as heat in brake grid resistors, and regenerative if the power is returned to the supply line. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> lowers the wear of friction-based braking components, and additionally regeneration can also lower energy consumption. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> can also be used on railcars with multiple units, light rail vehicles, trams and PCC streetcars.|$|R

50|$|Locomotive braking was by vacuum, air (high pressure) or dynamic (electrical {{regenerative}} resistive <b>braking),</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> were preferentially used at high speeds, {{with the}} air brake being activated at lower speeds where <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> was less effective; speed sensors automatically determined the braking type to be used.

5000|$|Upon {{retrieving}} the locomotives' [...] "black boxes" [...] (event recorders) and {{the recorded}} data therein, {{it was discovered}} that the third head end locomotive's <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> were not functioning at all, although the sound of the cooling fans misled crews into believing <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> was functional. It was also determined after the wreck that the engineer operating the helper locomotives knew of the faulty <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> on one of his units, but did not communicate that information to the head end crew. The combination of weight miscalculation, poor communication and faulty brake equipment resulted in a total train weight that was too great to adequately control on the down grade. Once <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> had been defeated by the helper engineer's emergency brake application the enormous weight of the heavily loaded cars caused rapid acceleration that could not be resisted solely by mechanical braking. The train catapulted from the 35 mph curve next to Duffy Street, scattering locomotives and cars, as well as lading.|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} that a wagon driven by a {{squirrel-cage}} induction motor is controlled {{to stop at the}} given position on a rail. The wagon is driven on the rail and arrives at the brake-start point. From this point, the motor should be braked corresponding to the load of the wagon. Therefore, the distance from brake-start point to the stop position must be constant. The brake of the 3 phase squirrel-cage induction motor is various method; <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> regenerative braking, plugging and single-phase braking etc. DC exciting method, so called <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> was used for this experiment. The peculiarity of this experiment is that the load was detected during the braking and braking current was decided. The method of this detection is as follows. At the first step, <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of which braking current is small was given on the motor from the brake-start point. In response to the ratio of speed down, the pulses were gained by phototransister which respond to light through the hole of disk installed on motor. The distance of pulse was converted into position stepping in the second <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of which braking current is large. This way was termed the second-step <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking.</b> By such a way, as the value of load increased, the braking quantity increased. Hence the difference of the given position and the stop position was small value in spite of the load variation...|$|R
