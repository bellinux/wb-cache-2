Hồ Chí Minh Highway, Road 20 crossing the edge zone and the connection road linking these two roads crossing the core zone also contribute danger to the wildlife in this national park, especially populations of <b>Hatinh</b> <b>langur</b> and black langur.

50|$|The Laotian langur or white-browed black langur (Trachypithecus laotum) is {{a species}} of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to Laos. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical dry forests. Genetically the Indochinese black and <b>Hatinh</b> <b>langurs</b> {{are very close to}} the Laotian langur, and consequently it has been suggested they should be considered subspecies of it.|$|R
25|$|The gaur and {{one species}} of eel have been {{discovered}} in this park. 10 new species previously unknown in Vietnam were discovered by scientists in the park. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is home as well to a significant population of primates in Vietnam, with ten species and sub-species. These include the globally vulnerable pig-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, stump-tailed macaque and white-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys and Nomascus leucogenys siki). The park is {{home to one of}} the largest populations of François' langur in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is known for its population of <b>Hatinh</b> and black <b>langurs.</b> 10 species of bats listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species are recorded in this park. Of the 59 recorded reptile and amphibian species, 18 are listed in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 6 are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. The 72 fish species include 4 species endemic to the area, including Danio quangbinhensis.|$|R

These include the globally vulnerable pig-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, stump-tailed macaque and white-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys and Nomascus leucogenys siki). The park is probably home to the largest population of François' langur in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is highly significant for its population of <b>Hatinh</b> <b>langur</b> and black langur. It is undoubtedly the largest population of these species in the world, and probably the only population represented in a protected area. Other endangered large mammals include the mainland serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), giant muntjac (Megamuntiacus vuquangensis) and possibly the saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis). The Asian black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus) and sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) are confirmed. Other smaller mammals include Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) and the recently discovered striped hare, called locally [...] "tho van" [...] (Nesolagus timminsii). Ten bat species listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species have been recorded in this park.|$|E
50|$|Primates {{present in}} Laos include the <b>hatinh</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus hatinhensis), silvery lutung (Trachypithecus cristatus) and red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus), {{as well as}} seven species of gibbon; the lar gibbon (Hylobates lar), pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus), {{northern}} buffed-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus annamensis), black crested gibbon (Nomascus concolor), yellow-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae), northern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys) and southern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus siki).|$|E
50|$|This diurnal, largely {{arboreal}} langur {{is social}} and typically seen {{in groups of}} 2-15, but occasionally groups may number as many as 30 individuals. It has often been considered a subspecies of the François' langur, but was elevated to a full species by Bradon-Jones in 1995, and {{this was followed by}} Groves, 2005. Both, however, listed it as a subspecies in 2004, and genetic work suggest it should be considered a subspecies of the Laotian langur (T. laotum). Morphological and genetic data also suggests the Indochinese black langur (T. ebenus) is a morph of the <b>Hatinh</b> <b>langur.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Hatinh</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus hatinhensis) is {{a highly}} {{threatened}} Old World monkey found in limestone forests in Vietnam, primarily in the Quảng Bình Province. A recent survey discovered a small population living in the Quảng Trị Province. Contrary to its name, {{it is not known}} from the Hà Tĩnh Province. The local Van Kieu minority refer to this lutung as the 'Con Cung', which roughly translates as [...] "black, cliff-dwelling monkey with a long tail". It resembles the closely related François' langur (T. francoisi), but its white cheek-stripes typically extend behind the ears onto the nape (there are significant individual variations, however), and the overall black colour is non-glossy and has a brownish tinge.|$|E
50|$|The Vũ Quang National Park was {{formerly}} the Vũ Quang Nature Reserve. It covers {{an area of}} 29700 ha in Hương Sơn District of Hà Tĩnh Province, and was declared a national park in 2002. Topography of the park has an average elevation of 800 m experiences tropical monsoon climate with an annual temperature of 23 C. It receives an annual average rainfall of 2304.5 mm. The park has 36 endemic subspecies of plants of the North Truong Son forests. It is home for 60 species of mammals, 187 birds, 38 reptiles, 26 amphibians and 56 species of fish; of these 26 species of mammals, 10 species of birds, 16 species of cattle are rare requiring protection. Particular faunal species of note are the brown monkey langur, <b>Hatinh</b> <b>langur,</b> golden-cheeked gibbon, saola, and large cobra.|$|E
