5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and is gradually granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> his administrative skill is more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} book, Voldemort seeks the wand {{in order to}} defeat Harry – his {{previous}} wands having failed – and breaks into Dumbledore's tomb to claim the wand as his own. During the Battle of Hogwarts, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> the wand is not performing for him as legend says it should, and mistakenly concludes this is because it had become loyal to Snape when Snape killed Dumbledore, and would only become loyal to him upon his killing of Snape. He therefore kills Snape, and believes the wand will thereafter serve him and be unbeatable, but during his final duel with Harry his Killing Curse rebounds and he dies – as Harry had warned him – since the Elder Wand will not allow itself {{to be used by}} him against its true master.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{arrives in}} the middle of the night. They tell him the {{sequence}} of events and their suspicions regarding Mrs. Vanderlyn. Investigating the grass leading off the terrace, Poirot confirms that there are no footprints, which means that someone in the house committed the theft and the papers are still there. He questions each person in turn. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> Leonie saw no ghost; she screamed because Reggie sneaked up on her to snatch a kiss. Poirot suggests to Lord Charles that he end the party so that his guests will leave the house. The next morning the guests begin to leave. Lady Julia believes that her son Reggie stole the plans since he is very short of money and was not in his room for a period the previous evening. She promises Poirot that they will be returned within twelve hours if no further action is taken. Poirot agrees to this and they all depart.|$|E
25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only to be told that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> his daughter is strong and can take care of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E
500|$|Speaking in October 2016, Tsakalotos {{said that}} he wanted the IMF to join the bailout {{programme}} and that Wolfgang Schäuble's position on debt relief for Greece was untenable. Schäuble said that the bailout programme [...] "will work, the IMF will be on board and there won't be much debt relief." [...] However, Tsakalotos said that [...] "Something has to give there, and I think deep down in his heart <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that.</b> He's a wily politician. He's {{been around for a}} long time. I can't believe he doesn't understand you can't have all those three things." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolf, the {{companion}} {{and friend of}} the Boy, is highly intelligent and an excellent guard dog. The Boy is upset {{that he is not}} allowed to enter the dog shows, though <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> Wolf does not meet the breed standards. While the family is at a dog show with Bruce and Lad, Wolf is poisoned by an intruder. Having only eaten part of the tainted meat, Wolf is still alive when the thief returns to the house that night and is shot twice while protecting the Place. The thief escapes, but is later apprehended by the police while being treated for his bites. Wolf recovers and is given a [...] "Hero Cup" [...] trophy, to the Boy's delight.|$|E
500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you see that in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E

500|$|Lin {{considers}} himself {{a basketball player}} {{more than just an}} Asian American. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> there have not been many Asians in the NBA. [...] "Maybe I can help break the stereotype," [...] said Lin. [...] "I feel like Asians in general don't get the respect that we may deserve whether it comes to sports, basketball, or whatever it might be," [...] Lin said. Prior to the 2010–11 NBA season, Americans of Asian descent who played in the NBA included Wataru Misaka, Raymond Townsend, Corey Gaines, Rex Walters, and Robert Swift. [...] " [...] carrying the hopes of an entire continent. I only had to carry the hopes of Little Rock, Arkansas. He's accomplished a lot more than I have already," [...] said Derek Fisher, who had won five NBA championships with the Lakers, after his first game against Lin. Lin is setting an example for prospective Asian athletes in America who rarely see Asian-Americans playing on their favorite teams. [...] "I don't look Japanese," [...] Walters said, referring to his mother's ethnicity. [...] "When they see , it's an Asian-American." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bouncing Back" [...] {{opens with}} [...] "a mysterious flash-forward {{to three months}} in the future, showing an {{unidentified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agent seemingly dead in space." [...] Tancharoen called it [...] "the promise of something fairly ominous to come", and stated, [...] "We will be uncovering things from the midseason opener {{all the way to}} the finale. We will slowly be discovering what that image is." [...] She added that any [...] "clues" [...] would likely play out during present day sequences rather than further flash-forwards, such as when Johnson receives a vision of the flash-forward in [...] "Spacetime", an episode where she learns that [...] "she cannot change the outcome of these visions and the future is the future." [...] Whedon discussed this idea, and that of the [...] "theory behind the Inhumans that each one of them serves a purpose", saying, Inhumans [...] "are made, they're not random. There's a lack of something that needs filling and an Inhuman will be created that fills that niche. It's an interesting concept we like playing with, and that plays into the idea of fate, which with our future visions, we're hitting pretty hard." [...] On choosing Lincoln to be the one to die, which the executive producers knew going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward, Bell said he [...] "earned it" [...] adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon noting that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> Daisy has a different purpose. Whedon continued that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not [...] "want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there’s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn’t consider himself a hero. That’s the beauty of the moment—it’s not just for , but it is, and it’s not just for him, but it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{hearing that}} the people {{recorded}} on previous experiments are dead, one of the tourists guesses correctly they will die, too. The meeting ends abruptly as Morel leaves in anger. The fugitive picks up Morel's cue cards and learns the machine keeps running because the wind and tide feed it with an endless supply of kinetic energy. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> the phenomena of the two suns and two moons are a consequence {{of what happens when}} the recording overlaps reality [...] one is the real sun and the other one represents the sun's position at recording time. The other strange things that happen on the island have a similar explanation.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Sharpe {{states that}} [...] "Gerontion" [...] is the poem that shows Eliot [...] "taking on {{the mantle of}} his New England Puritan forebears" [...] as Gerontion views his life {{as the product of}} sin. Sharpe {{suggests}} that Christ appears to Gerontion as a scourge because <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> he must reject the [...] "dead world" [...] to obtain the salvation offered by Christianity. However, other critics disagree; Russell Kirk believes that the poem is [...] "a description of life devoid of faith, drearily parched, it is cautionary". Marion Montgomery writes that Gerontion's [...] "problem is that he can discover no vital presence in the sinful shell of his body".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} began recording with producer Brendan O'Brien, who {{had previously}} worked with the band on Light Grenades (2006) and A Crow Left of the Murder... (2004). Recording took place at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Henson Studios in Los Angeles and Casa Chica in Malibu. Vocalist Brandon Boyd discussed the decision to work with O'Brien once again, stating, [...] "We {{grew up listening to}} his records. We quickly became friends and that's been a catalyst for our success with him. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> we like to work quickly." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "I love Brendan and I consider him like a family member. Over the years he’s been like a musical confidante and he’s been very loyal and very helpful. He’s gotten involved in other stuff that he didn’t have to get involved with outside of the band." [...] Pasillas noted, [...] "He’s kind of like a sixth member." [...] Einziger recorded the majority of his guitar parts in his house.|$|E
2500|$|It {{turns out}} that Jenny is about to marry Walkinshaw, rather than Foggerty, {{although}} she does not love him. Foggerty sees Jenny in her wedding dress and tries to kiss her, annoying Walkinshaw. After Foggerty understands the situation, he tells Jenny that he loves her. She says that she has always loved him, but he never declared his feelings, {{and now it is}} too late. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> <b>that,</b> in his earlier reality, he had come together with Jenny only as a consequence of fleeing Spiff. Foggerty roughs up Walkinshaw for stealing his girl, but realises the cause and is dejected. Walkinshaw and Talbot doubt his sanity. Meanwhile, Jenny overhears Malvina calling her lawyer, who says that her 19th lover is to be married later that day, and so she is free to marry her number 20. She mentions her 19th lover's name: Walkinshaw! [...] Jenny terminates her engagement to Walkinshaw, throwing herself into Foggerty's arms. [...] Malvina sees Foggerty and tells him that she can marry him now – he is lover number 20. [...] Jenny faints, and Foggerty flees with Malvina in pursuit.|$|E

60|$|I {{expressed}} {{surprise and}} asked innocently {{if he had}} done any harm. The Boer replied <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> they had stolen some cattle, killed two white men, if not more, and burnt their house. He added, however, {{that he was not}} sure whether the white men had been killed by the Kaffirs or by other white men with whom they had quarrelled. There was a rumour to this effect, and <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> the magistrate of Barberton had gone with some mounted police and armed natives to investigate the matter.|$|R
