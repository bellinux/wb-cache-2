50|$|The {{first part}} of the contest were {{technical}} trials, starting on August 4. Unlike the following Challenges, it was not too complicated and consisted of a technical evaluation, quick engine start test, quick wing <b>folding</b> <b>test</b> and fuel consumption trial only.The first was a technical evaluation of competing planes' construction. Such features, like twin controls, rich set of controls, wheel brakes, fire safety devices and a room for parachutes, could bring up to 18 points. Most points was given to the Italian Breda Ba-15s (11.75 to 12 pts) and German all-metal Junkers A50s (11.75 pts). Very good result of 11.25 points was obtained also by the Italian Fiat AS.1s and Romeo Ro-5s. The German BFW M.23b were given only 9.5 points, DH-60s - from 9.5 to 10.5 points, and the lowest result was 8 points (Caudron C.113).After quick wings' folding and quick engine starting tests, the classification leader was the Czech Josef Novak flying an Aero A.34 biplane, with 17.5 pts. Behind him, there were three Italians flying Romeo Ro-5 biplanes (17.25 pts), then the rest. The best German pilot, Wolf Hirth, had 16.25 pts (12th place, Klemm L.25), but most Germans had a few points less. Some planes were handicapped, not having folding wings. Some crews completed wings' folding trial on 6 August.The last was a fuel consumption test, on 6 x 50 km closed circuit, on 5 August. It could bring up to 20 points. The best result was obtained by the German Johannes Nehring flying a Darmstadt D-18 biplane (18.5 pts), then the Swiss Hans Wirth (Klemm L.25), three German Junkers A50 and two Czech Avia BH-11s, with 15-17 pts.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of volcaniclastic sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks of Permian {{age in the}} Wallowa terrane of Oregon and Idaho has been sampled for paleomagnetic study. Thermal demagnetization revealed three components of magnetization. The A component has the lowest unblocking temperatures, has normal polarity, and fails the <b>fold</b> <b>test.</b> The B component is removed between heating steps of about 200 °C and 550 °C, is of normal polarity, and also fails the <b>fold</b> <b>test.</b> The C component, observed between heating steps of approximately 550 °C and 660 °C is always of negative inclination. The grouping of this component improves slightly upon unfolding. This component in interpreted as the characteristic remanent magnetization acquired during deposition of the Hunsaker Creek Formation. The resulting paleolatitude, calculated using inclination-only statistics, of 24 ° ± 12 ° N (n ≥ 3, k ≥ 10), or 26 ° ± 9 ° N (n ≥ 3 sites), implies a northern hemisphere position of the Wallowa terrane during the Early Permian and possible southward transport of this terrane with respect to North America.

This is the first positive <b>fold</b> <b>test</b> obtained for transitional directions from any geomagnetic field reversal. In addition, variations in lithology allowed a comparison of transitional records from different sedimentary environments. Alternating-field and thermal demagnetization reveals that most samples have either single or simple two-component magnetizations. The low-coercivity, low-blocking temperature component is most likely held by large multidomain grains of magnetite, and aligns with the present-day field when uncorrected for bedding orientation.
