Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> its handling of the emergency.

40|$|AbstractFailure in love {{is part of}} {{life that}} many people may {{experience}} it. But, why can some people easily cope with it {{and come back to}} normal life but some people cannot? The aim of this research was to investigate emotional intelligence and self-concept in people with and without <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> love. For this reason, 41 participants with <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> love (26 women and 15 men) and 43 without <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> love participants (26 women and 17 men) were selected by Non-probability sampling methods and answered Baron‘s Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and Roger‘s Self-Concept questionnaire. Using MANOVA, and in dependent T test, the data revealed that people with <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> love have lower level of emotional intelligence (p< 0 / 001) and lower level of selfconcept (p< 0 / 05) than people without <b>failure</b> <b>in</b> love and there was significant difference in self-actualization, reality testing, impulse control, problem solving, stress tolerance, happiness and flexibility,component of emotional intelligence, between two groups.

5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media.

Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his <b>failures</b> <b>in</b> Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|In all, 45 Israelis were killed, 50 were wounded, and 5 {{captured}} by Egypt. Of them, 29 killed and 34 wounded were from Zur's 54th Company. Egyptian sources reported 15 killed and 30 wounded, although {{this does not}} include the casualties suffered by the intercepted reinforcements from Majdal. Even before the final retreating troops came home, the Givati command had issued a new operation order, calling for renewed artillery and air bombardment of Isdud, and small harassment operations.
