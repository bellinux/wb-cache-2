5|$|Natural {{tantalum}} {{consists of}} two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of tantalum and <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E

2500|$|In 1987 diamond {{grains and}} silicon carbide grains [...] {{were found to}} exist abundantly in those same acid-insoluble {{residues}} and also to contain large concentrations of noble gases. Significant isotopic anomalies were in turn measured by improvements in secondary ion mass spectrometry within the structural chemical elements of these grains. Improved SIMS experiments showed that the silicon isotopes within each SiC grain did not have solar isotopic ratios but rather those expected in certain red-giant stars. The finding of stardust is therefore dated 1987. To measure the <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> ratios of the structural elements (e.g. silicon in an SiC grain) in microscopic stardust grains had required two difficult technological and scientific steps: 1) locating micron-sized stardust grains within the meteorite's overwhelming mass; 2) development of SIMS technology to a sufficiently high level to measure <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> ratios within micron-sized grains. Ernst Zinner became the undisputed leader of SIMS applications to microscopic grains, earning him historic acclaim.|$|E

50|$|Similarly for all {{practical}} purposes, 13C signal splitting due to coupling with nearby natural <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> carbons is negligible in 13C NMR spectra. However, practically all hydrogen bonded to carbon atoms is 1H in natural <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> samples, including any 13C nuclei bonded to H atoms. In a 13C spectrum with no decoupling at all, each of the 13C signals is split according to how many H atoms that C atom is next to. In order to simplify the spectrum, 13C NMR spectroscopy is most often run fully proton decoupled, meaning 1H nuclei in the sample are broadly irradiated to fully decouple them from the 13C nuclei being analyzed. This full proton decoupling eliminates all coupling with H atoms and thus splitting due to H atoms in natural <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> compounds. Since coupling between other carbons in natural <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> samples is negligible, signals in fully proton decoupled 13C spectra in hydrocarbons and most signals from other organic compounds are single peaks. This way, the number of equivalent sets of carbon atoms in a chemical structure can be counted by counting singlet peaks, which in 13C spectra {{tend to be very}} narrow (thin). Other information about the carbon atoms can usually be determined from the chemical shift, such as whether the atom is part of a carbonyl group or an aromatic ring, etc. Such full proton decoupling can also help increase the intensity of 13C signals.|$|E
