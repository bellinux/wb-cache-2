40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a hedging back-study which {{assesses the}} effectiveness of interest- rate modelling and the hedging of interest-rate derivatives. Caps that trade in the Johannesburg swap market are hedged using two short-rate models, namely the Hull and White (1990) one-factor model and the subsequent Hull and White (1994) two-factor extension. This is achieved by using the equivalent Gaussian additive-factor models (G 1 ++ and G 2 ++) outlined by Brigo and Mercurio (2007). The hedges are constructed using different combinations of theoretical zero-coupon bonds. A flexible factor hedging method is proposed by the author and the bucket hedging technique detailed by Driessen, Klaasen and Melenberg (2003) is tested. The results obtained support the claims made by Gupta and Subrahmanyam (2005), Fan, Gupta and Ritchken (2007) {{and others in the}} literature that multi-factor models outperform one-factor models in hedging interest-rate derivatives. It is also shown that the choice of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> can significantly influence hedge performance. Notably, a larger set of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> and the use of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> with the same maturity as the derivative improve hedging accuracy. However, no evidence to support the finding of Driessen et al. (2003) that a larger set of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> can remove the need for a multi-factor model is found...|$|R
50|$|One {{area where}} ACE {{methodology}} has frequently been applied is asset pricing. W. Brian Arthur, Eric Baum, William Brock, Cars Hommes, and Blake LeBaron, among others, have developed computational models {{in which many}} agents choose from a set of possible forecasting strategies in order to predict stock prices, which affects their asset demands and thus affects stock prices. These models assume that agents {{are more likely to}} choose forecasting strategies which have recently been successful. The success of any strategy will depend on market conditions and also on the set of strategies that are currently being used. These models frequently find that large booms and busts in asset prices may occur as agents switch across forecasting strategies. More recently, Brock, Hommes, and Wagener (2009) have used a model of this type to argue that the introduction of new <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments</b> may destabilize the market, and some papers have suggested that ACE might be a useful methodology for understanding the recent financial crisis.|$|E
