The hammer rail {{is held in}} {{position}} by the rod, shown under the hammer shank, which is hinged to the bracket at the lower end, and which allows it to be moved forward when the soft pedal is used. The soft pedal communicates with this rail by a rod which moves it forward and thereby shortens the stroke of the hammers and produces a softer tone.|$|E

50|$|The large complex {{includes}} a 16-story 210 ft ritual building {{connected to a}} 10-story wing for the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, now known as Shriners International, by the 7-story Auditorium Building. In between these areas are a 1,586-seat Scottish Rite Cathedral, and a 17500 sq ft drill hall used for trade shows and conventions. The drill hall {{is also home to}} Detroit Roller Derby.

60|$|They {{carried him}} within the palace and dressed him in purple and fine linen, {{and placed a}} crown of gold upon his bald head and a jeweled scepter in his {{wrinkled}} hand, and all this amused old King Cole very much. When he had been led to the great throne room and placed upon the throne of gold (where the silken <b>cushions</b> <b>felt</b> very soft and pleasant after his long ride upon the donkey's sharp back) the courtiers all knelt before him and asked what commands he wished to give, since everyone in the kingdom must now obey his slightest word.|$|R
50|$|The AERCam Sprint free-flyer is a 14 in, 35-pound (16 kg) sphere that {{contains}} two television cameras, an avionics system and 12 small nitrogen gas-powered thrusters. The sphere, {{which looks like}} an oversized soccer ball, was released by Mission Specialist Winston E. Scott during the STS-87 spacewalk and flew freely in the forward cargo bay for about 30 minutes. The free-flyer was remotely controlled by Pilot Steven W. Lindsey from the Shuttle's aft flight deck using a hand controller, two laptop computers and a window-mounted antenna. The AERCam is designed to fly very slowly {{at a rate of}} less than one-quarter of a foot per second. Remote control of the AERCam is performed through two-way UHF radio communications, with data regarding the status of the free-flyer's systems transmitted back to the operator. Television images are transmitted back to the operator via a one-way S-band communications link. During the experiment operations, live television images were also relayed via Columbia to Mission Control. Two miniature color television cameras are mounted on the free-flyer, one with a 6 millimeter lens and another with a 12 millimeter lens. The exterior of the free-flyer sphere is covered with a 6/10 in layer of Nomex <b>felt</b> to <b>cushion</b> any inadvertent contact with a spacecraft surface and prevent damage.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the most}} part, common {{soldiers}} {{seem to have}} dressed in belted, knee-length tunics for work or leisure. In the northern provinces, the traditionally short sleeved tunic might {{be replaced by a}} warmer, long-sleeved version. Soldiers on active duty wore short trousers under a military kilt, sometimes with a leather jerkin or <b>felt</b> padding to <b>cushion</b> their armour, and a triangular scarf tucked in at the neck. For added protection from wind and weather, they could wear the sagum, a heavy-duty cloak also worn by civilians. According to Roman tradition, soldiers had once worn togas to war, hitching them up with what was known as a [...] "Gabine cinch"; but by the mid-Republican era, this had been abandoned. Henceforth, citizen-soldiers wore togas only for formal occasions. Cicero's [...] "sagum-wearing" [...] soldiers versus [...] "toga-wearing" [...] civilians are rhetorical and literary trope, referring to a wished-for transition from military might to peaceful, civil authority. When on duty in the city, the Praetorian guard concealed their weapons beneath their white [...] "civilian" [...] togas.|$|R
