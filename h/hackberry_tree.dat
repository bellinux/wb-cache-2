The campus was designated as a national arboretum in 1988 by the Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, and approximately 190 species of trees and shrubs can be found on campus. One tree, the Bicentennial Oak between Rand Hall and Garland Hall, is certified to have lived during the American Revolution and is the oldest living thing on the campus. In December 2015, a <b>hackberry</b> <b>tree</b> fell, leaving 10 students injured with [...] "broken bones and stitches." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{though he}} were in a circus ring the {{speckled}} roan wheeled and danced through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the Lone Wolf Crossing was close at hand. Then, where the pear was thinner, {{he caught sight of}} the grass roof of the /jacal/ and the <b>hackberry</b> <b>tree</b> {{on the edge of the}} arroyo. A few yards farther the Kid stopped the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings. Then he dismounted, dropped the roan's reins, and proceeded on foot, stooping and silent, like an Indian. The roan, knowing his part, stood still, making no sound.|$|E

50|$|The design’s {{repetition}} of linear rows of trees aims {{to create a}} sense of harmony though repetition. Specific trees and plants were selected as allegories of the trans experience: rare, overlooked, and aesthetically unconventional. Native perennials were selected to attract butterflies: whose life-course transition symbolizes the transgender experience. Redbuds can be rather plain small, ornamental trees in summer but are highly prized for their butter-yellow fall foliage and spectacular display of magenta flowers in early spring. <b>Hackberry</b> <b>trees</b> have bark not always considered beautiful, but produce berries that support a wide array of birds and other wildlife in winter. Devil's walkingstick is a large shrub or small tree having stems spiked with large thorns but a canopy topped with beautiful white flowers in mid-spring. Hackberry and aralia are undervalued plants and rarely used in conventional domestic gardens and commercial landscaping. The original design called for nine redbud <b>trees,</b> 17 <b>hackberry</b> <b>trees,</b> and six aralias.|$|R

50|$|First, the {{midwives}} softened the earthen {{floor of}} the tipi and dug two holes. One of the holes was for heating water {{and the other for}} the afterbirth. One or two stakes were driven into the ground near the expectant mother's bedding for her to grip during the pain of labor. After the birth, the midwives hung the umbilical cord on a <b>hackberry</b> <b>tree.</b> The people believed that if the umbilical cord was not disturbed before it rotted, the baby would live a long and prosperous life.|$|E
50|$|The {{top of this}} {{hill was}} the site of a lone <b>hackberry</b> <b>tree</b> which served as a {{landmark}} to early explorers and settlers of region. The tree was unusual, both for its location since the only other scattered trees in the area grew next to water, and because hackberry trees were not native to the region. As a result, there were a variety of stories to explain the origin of the tree, including a Native American legend that a great chief had been buried there along with a medicine bag containing hackberry seeds.|$|E
5000|$|John C. Moser {{graduated}} from high school in 1947 and finally studied at the Ohio State University (OSU), where he soon regognized his interest in entomology. His undergraduate professor was Ralph Davidson, who supported and motivated Moser to perform studies on galls on leaves of a <b>hackberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Celtis occidentalis), which was growing in Moser's front yard, where he at once detected a new wasp species of the genus Torymus. This finding inspired his further research a lot. He was cited with: [...] "I had observed something that no one else in the world had ever seen" [...] (Moser 2000).|$|E

50|$|He {{relocated}} {{and founded}} the Pedernales Settlement {{on the river}} of the same name, where he became the leader.

On September 11, 1854, he hosted a meeting to plan Live Oak School and was elected trustee. Keidel founded the political and cultural club Society for Good Fellowship and Promotion of General Information.

Cultivated mushrooms have not been exposed to light, resulting in a white color, whereas wild mushrooms usually display a dark brown color. Cultivated mushrooms are grown in a carbon dioxide (CO2)-rich environment to nurture the development of long thin stems, whereas wild mushrooms produce a much shorter and thicker stem.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, leaf tatters has been {{reported}} in white oak and hackberry across several Midwestern states. Herbicide spray drift studies have shown that chloroacetamides can induce leaf tatters. The objectives of this research were to: 1) identify vulnerable bud developmental stages in hackberry and 2) determine if different commercial chloroacetamides affect severity of leaf tatters. In 2008, a preliminary spray drift experiment was conducted on mature trees from a former hackberry provenance test stand. Acetochlor (Harness), S-metolachlor (Dual II Magnum), and dimethenamid (Outlook) were applied at concentrations approximating 27 %, 54 %, 81 %, or 108 % of the recommended field rate. Three developmental stages before bud burst were present on the selected trees. Leaf tatters did not develop on the selected <b>hackberry</b> <b>trees.</b> However, symptoms were observed on neighboring, non-target <b>hackberry</b> <b>trees,</b> which had been in the leaf unfolding and expanding stages at the time of spraying. In 2009, three year old hackberry seedlings were treated with 1 %, 10 %, and 100 % of the recommended field rate of acetochlor (Harness), S-metolachlor (Dual II Magnum), and dimethenamid (Outlook). Folded buds and two unfolding leaf developmental stages were present on seedlings. Another spray study was conducted on 32 mature <b>hackberry</b> <b>trees</b> from the provenance stand. A solution of 5608 mg a. i. /L dimethenamid (Outlook) was applied to trees in the unfolding and/or expanding leaf stage. Treated trees represented four provenances. Image analysis was used to calculate seedling and mature tree leaf areas and estimate the seedling percentage of leaf tissue loss. Foliar damage was not significantly different between seedlings treated with water, 1 %, or 10 % of the field rate. Foliar damage was significantly different between seedlings treated with 1 % or 100 % of the field rate, and between seedlings treated with 10 % or 100 % of the field rate. Foliar damage in seedlings was not significantly different between the developmental stages. Additionally, symptoms of leaf tatters were observed on the treated mature hackberry. Future studies should focus on chloroacetamide concentrations above 10 % of the recommended field rate...|$|R
