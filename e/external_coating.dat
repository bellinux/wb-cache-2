40|$|Most of the {{bacteria}} found in rumen fluid samples taken from cows fed hay, or a concentrate diet, had cell walls of the gram-negative type. Most were intact, with only {{a small proportion of}} lysed cells, and many of the cells contained electron-translucent cytoplasmic deposits similar to the carbohydrate reserve material described in pure cultures of rumen organisms. All of {{the bacteria}} observed in these samples had an external “coat” layer outside the outer membrane when fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined as sectioned material. These coat layers varied from thin (ca. 8 nm) structures to very extensive fibrous systems, sometimes including concentric arrangements and radial fibers extending up to 1, 200 nm from the cell. The thin-coat layers sometimes exhibited a rough periodicity. In all, 10 different types of coat layers were distinguished on a morphological basis.

40|$|Fertile eggs of Toxocara pteropodis, {{passed in}} the faeces of {{juvenile}} flying-foxes, were ovoid to spheroid in shape with a diameter range of 80 – 110 μm. The shell was often seen to comprise 4 layers: a fine inner lipid layer, a thicker clear chitinous layer, an equally thick outer vitelline layer and a pitted outermost, proteinaceous uterine layer of variable thickness. Infertile eggs were less uniform in shape and generally did not have well-defined shell layers, the formation of which is triggered by sperm penetration of the oocyte. The eggs of this species are bulkier than those of related ascaridoids, apparently because of a thicker <b>external</b> <b>coat</b> which, while not providing mechanical strength, is thought to protect against desiccation.

50|$|The primary {{physical}} {{factor to}} be considered in submarine pipeline construction is the state of the seabed - whether it is smooth (i.e., relatively flat) or uneven (corrugated, with high points and low points). If it is uneven, the pipeline will include free spans when it connects two high points, leaving the section in between unsupported. If an unsupported section is too long, the bending stress exerted onto it (due to its weight) may be excessive. Vibration from current-induced vortexes may also become an issue. Corrective measures for unsupported pipeline spans include seabed leveling and post-installation support, such as berm or sand infilling below the pipeline. The strength of the seabed is another significant parameter. If the soil is not strong enough, the pipeline may sink into it to an extent where inspection, maintenance procedures and prospective tie-ins become difficult to carry out. At the other extreme, a rocky seabed is expensive to trench and, at high points, abrasion and damage of the pipeline's <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> may occur. Ideally, the soil should be such as to allow the pipe to settle into it to some extent, thereby providing it with some lateral stability.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chitosan}} as internal or <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> on the mesalamine (5 -ASA) release from calcium alginate microparticles (CaAl) was studied, and a delayed release of 5 -ASA system intended for colonic drug delivery was developed. The external chitosan coating {{was developed by}} immersion of wetted CaAl in chitosan solution and the internal coating by mixing 5 -ASA with chitosan solution and drying before the preparation of CaAl. Both systems were coated with Acryl-EZE® using combined fluid bed coating and immersion procedure. The results showed that in phosphate medium (pH  7. 5), chitosan as 5 -ASA coating promotes a quick erosion process accelerating drug release, but chitosan as <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> (CaAlCS) does not increase the T 50 value compared with the microparticles without chitosan (CaAl). Chitosan as internal or <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> was not effective to avoid the quick 5 -ASA release in acidic medium (pH  1. 2). The presence of β-glucosidase enzymes increases significantly the 5 -ASA release for CaAl, while no effect was observed with chitosan as internal or <b>external</b> <b>coating.</b> Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray data revealed that 5 -ASA did not form a solid solution but was dispersed in the microparticles. The Acryl-EZE® coating of microparticles was effective because all the formulations showed a low release, less than 15 %, of 5 -ASA in acid medium at pH  1. 2. Significant differences {{in the percentage of}} 5 -ASA released between formulations were observed in phosphate buffer at pH  6. 0.

40|$|International audienceThe {{microstructure}} {{evolution of}} a platinum-modified nickel-aluminide coating on single-crystal nickel-based superalloy was investigated for various thermal cycling and thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) conditions in air for a long-term exposure. An increase in roughness and in β→γ′ transformation rate depends similarly on maximum temperature, holding time at maximum temperature and applied stress. Moreover, {{the evolution of the}} interdiffusion zone (IDZ) is analyzed by making the distinction between two layers, according to the major phases observed within these layers, namely β-(Ni,Pt) Al and γ′-Ni 3 Al. This distinction highlighted that the respective thickness evolution of these two layers are sensitive to each parameter of TMF tests with similar increase in evolution rate when increasing time, temperature, as well as applied stress. The distinctive features of phase transformation are finally discussed together with localization of phase transformation and measured evolution of phase transformation within the <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> and β- and γ′-IDZ layer thicknesses under thermal and thermo-mechanical fatigue. This analysis leads to a conclusion that grain boundaries within the <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> as well as interfaces, between thermally grown oxide, <b>external</b> <b>coating,</b> and IDZ, respectively, {{play a major role in}} diffusion, phase transformation, and microstructure evolution of typical platinum-modified nickel-aluminide coating...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMultidrug {{resistance}} of murine leukaemic cell line L 1210 /VCR (obtained by adaptation of parental drug-sensitive L 1210 cells to vincristine) {{is associated with}} overexpression of mdr 1 gene product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) —the ATP-dependent drug efflux pump. 31 P-NMR spectra of L 1210 and L 1210 /VCR cells (the latter {{in the presence of}} vincristine) revealed, besides the decrease of ATP level, a considerable lower level of UDP-saccharides in L 1210 /VCR cells. Histochemical staining of negatively charged cell surface binding sites (mostly sialic acid) by ruthenium red (RR) revealed a compact layer of RR bound to the <b>external</b> <b>coat</b> of sensitive cells. In resistant cells cultivated in the absence or presence of vincristine, the RR layer is either reduced or absent. Consistently, resistant cells were found to be less sensitive to Concanavalin A (ConA). Moreover, differences in the amount and spectrum of glycoproteins interacting with ConA-Sepharose were demonstrated between sensitive and resistant cells. Finally, the content of glycogen in resistant cells is lower than in sensitive cells. All the above facts indicate that multidrug {{resistance of}} L 1210 /VCR cells mediated predominantly by drug efflux activity of Pgp is accompanied by a considerable depression of oligo- and/or polysaccharides biosynthesis...|$|R

A primer consisting of a metallic Ni-Al-Mo based powder has been applied to plates with dimensions of 5 × 200 × 300 mm and front surfaces of Ø 40 × 50 mm cylinders. Flame spraying of primer coating was made using a RotoTec 80 torch, and an <b>external</b> <b>coating</b> was made with a CastoDyn DS 8000 torch. Evaluation of the coating properties was conducted using metallographic testing, phase composition research, measurement of microhardness, substrate coating adhesion (acc. to EN 582 : 1996 standard), erosion wear resistance (acc. to ASTM G 76 - 95 standard), and abrasive wear resistance (acc. to ASTM G 65 standard) and thermal impact. The testing performed has demonstrated that flame spraying with 97 % Al 2 O 3 powder containing 3 % TiO 2 performed in a range of parameters allows for obtaining high-quality ceramic coatings with thickness up to ca. 500 µm on a steel base. Spray coating possesses a structure consisting mainly of aluminium oxide and a small amount of NiAl 10 O 16 and NiAl 32 O 49 phases.

40|$|Abstract. Hexavalent {{cationic}} dye ruthenium red (RR) binds to anionic sites of cellular components, predominantly {{to the surface}} coat rich in glycoconjugates, {{and can be used}} as a marker of negative binding sites. Due to limited penetration of RR only supercial layers of cells are stained satisfactorily. To improve RR staining of L 1210 leukemic cells isolated from culture and concentrated by centrifugation, cryosections of frozen cells were treated by RR to expose simultaneously all the cells and their components to the dye treatment. Cells were xed with 2 % glutaralde-hyde in cacodylate buer (CB), soaked in 2. 2 mol/l sucrose and frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were cut at a temperature of − 90 C, transferred to Formvar coated copper grids, postxed with 1 % OsO 4 and stained with 0. 05 % RR in CB for 60 { 120 min. After removing RR solution with lter the grids were dried and examined electron microscopically. The resulting staining was a combination of a negative contrast (the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles) and of a positive contrast (cytoplasmic matrix and the ex-tracellular coat). RR staining of negative binding sites on cryosections has proved useful for uniform exposure of all cells and cellular compartments to the dye and especially of <b>external</b> <b>coat</b> containing glycoconjugates...|$|R
