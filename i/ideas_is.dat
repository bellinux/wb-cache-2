25|$|There {{are several}} {{concepts}} {{important to the}} Chomskyan (or generativist) approach to linguistics. The most fundamental of these <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> the theory of universal grammar (UG).

25|$|The {{inability}} to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other way. They {{do not know}} how to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with Autism learn to communicate their needs and <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with Autism require intensive intervention to learn how to communicate their intent.|$|E
25|$|The medical {{practices}} of the Byzantine Empire originated from the Greek physician Hippocrates and Roman Physician Galen. Evidence {{of the use of}} ancient Greek medicinal <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> seen through Byzantine physician’s reliance on humors to diagnose illness. Byzantine physicians followed the Hippocratic Theory that the body consisted of four humors, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These humors were connected to particular seasons, hot or cold and dry or moist. In order to identifying these humors Byzantine physicians relied heavily on Galen's works.|$|E
25|$|The University of Greifswald aims {{to extend}} and {{efficiently}} use its international contacts. The primary geographic focus of international collaboration is Northern Europe and Eastern Europe, which {{is due to}} the university's research focus in this area. Partnerships with foreign universities to foster exchange of people (staff and students alike) and <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> conducted in two different ways. Firstly, through official partnership agreements with foreign universities, which involves the entire university and most or all of her disciplines. Secondly, through contacts of professors, departments, and schools, which usually involves only one or few disciplines.|$|E
60|$|As a clear <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that whereof {{the mind}} {{has such a}} full and evident perception, as it does receive from an outward object {{operating}} duly on a well-disposed organ, so a DISTINCT <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that wherein the mind perceives a difference from all other; and a CONFUSED <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> such an one as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another, from which {{it ought to be}} different.|$|R
40|$|What {{makes an}} idea {{culturally}} successful, {{such as the}} widespread notion in many societies of ancestor-spirits, a haiku, or the recipe for apple pie? To be sure, not all <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> culturally successful. Some <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> never represented in minds. Some are represented, but never communicated to others. Yet other <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> successfully communicated to enough people that they become fashionable for a short time, but quickly fade away. But {{a small number of}} <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> culturally successful: they permanently invade a group of minds. According to an epidemiological approach to explaining culture, then, “contagious ” ideas and their material effects, such as texts, tools, buildings, artwork, constitute what we call culture.

25|$|Those who {{generally}} view modernity as obsolete or an outright failure, {{a flaw in}} humanity's evolution leading to disasters like Auschwitz and Hiroshima, see postmodernity as a positive development. Other philosophers, particularly those seeing themselves as within the modern project, see the state of postmodernity as a negative consequence of holding postmodernist ideas. For example, Jürgen Habermas and others contend that postmodernity represents a resurgence of long running counter-enlightenment ideas, that the modern project is not finished and that universality cannot be so lightly dispensed with. Postmodernity, the consequence of holding postmodern <b>ideas,</b> <b>is</b> generally a negative term in this context.|$|E
25|$|An {{admirer of}} the {{freshness}} and clarity of Bertrand Russell’s History of Western Philosophy, whose foreword he composed, {{as well as}} a critic of some of its shortcomings, Mosterín has undertaken the ambitious plan of writing all by himself a universal history of thought, not only Western, but also Asian and even Archaic. His series of books on Historia del Pensamiento aims at covering all main intellectual traditions from an interdisciplinary approach dealing simultaneously with developments in philosophy, science and ideology. The analysis of the <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> critical and uncompromising, combining rigor with clarity and straightforward language. Besides, he delves into the arguments and does not hesitate to dig out their eventual flaws.|$|E
25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has {{very little to do with}} the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> known as the Socratic problem.|$|E

50|$|Modification of NGT, {{undertaken}} by Bartunek and Murnighan, helps {{to deal with}} ill-structured problems. Normal <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> generated and listed, followed by the facilitator questioning if the <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> relevant to the same problem. If not, the problem {{is said to be}} ill-structured, and the <b>ideas</b> generated <b>are</b> clustered into coherent groups. These clusters of ill-structured <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> then treated as problems in their own right, and the NGT procedure is applied to them. Regular breaks are taken by the participants to ensure that the group feels they are still working on the original problem.|$|R
25|$|Three basic {{themes emerge}} from Qutb's writings. First, {{he claimed that}} the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a {{condition}} he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslim – as he defined them – therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.|$|E
25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> {{that we try to}} compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} Perso-Arabic inflow, English {{became the}} current foreign source of new vocabulary. English had and {{continues}} to have a considerable influence over Indian languages. Loanwords include new innovations and concepts, first introduced directly through British colonialism, and then streaming in {{on the basis of}} continued English language dominance in the post-colonial period. Besides the category of new <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> the category of English words that already have Gujarati counterparts which end up replaced or existed alongside with. The major driving force behind this latter category has to be the continuing role of English in modern India as a language of education, prestige, and mobility. In this way, Indian speech can be sprinkled with English words and expressions, even switches to whole sentences. See Hinglish, Code-switching.|$|E
50|$|Self-refuting {{ideas or}} self-defeating <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> <b>ideas</b> or {{statements}} whose falsehood {{is a logical}} consequence of the act or situation of holding them to <b>be</b> true. Many <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> called self-refuting by their detractors, and such accusations are therefore almost always controversial, with defenders stating that the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> being misunderstood or that the argument is invalid. For these reasons, none of the <b>ideas</b> below <b>are</b> unambiguously or incontrovertibly self-refuting. These <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> often used as axioms, which are definitions taken to be true (tautological assumptions), and cannot be used to test themselves, for doing so would lead to only two consequences: consistency (circular reasoning) or exception (self-contradiction). It {{is important to know}} that the conclusion of an argument that is self-refuting is not necessarily false, since it could be supported by another, more valid, argument.|$|R

25|$|David Hume {{acknowledged}} {{that there are}} events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that ‘all events have a specific course or reason.’ Therefore Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally {{be divided into two}} kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”. Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”. Hume later goes onto say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume’s separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of <b>Ideas</b> <b>is</b> often referred to as “Hume’s Fork”.|$|E
