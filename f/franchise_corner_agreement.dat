The theme has been used in other movies, including Cry of the City, Kiss of Death, I Wake Up Screaming, Where the Sidewalk Ends, The Dark <b>Corner,</b> Gentleman's <b>Agreement</b> and as the overture to How to Marry a Millionaire.|$|R
25|$|During {{practice}} Prost {{revealed his}} discontent with Senna. According to Prost the pair had {{an agreement that}} if they were leading, whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other at the first <b>corner,</b> an <b>agreement</b> he previously had with former team mates Niki Lauda and Keke Rosberg. Despite Marlboro's John Hogan supporting Prost's story by stating he was present when the agreement was made, Senna continued to deny that any such agreement existed. He also contended that the corner he passed Prost at, Tosa, was actually the third turn on the Imola circuit after Tamburello and Villeneuve.|$|R

The molecular architecture may {{be thought of as}} two q-arm stars connected by a polymeric ''crossbar. '' The dynamics lead to a novel integrodifferential equation which exhibits extreme strain hardening in extension and strain softening in shear. Calculations of flow through a contraction predict that the degree of long-chain branching controls the growth of <b>corner</b> vortices, in <b>agreement</b> with experiments on commercial branched polymers...|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{is written}} to outline the {{difficulties}} in establishing mechanisms for addressing multi-national criminal activities when those efforts continue to be frustrated by rampant public corruption. This Essay argues that the problems of public corruption are purposefully not addressed in the instruments which are intended to combat criminal activity. The Essay concludes that international efforts {{will continue to be}} frustrated until nations determine that they will not permit public corruption to void their efforts to better the lives of their populations and establish within the four <b>corners</b> of their <b>agreements</b> mechanisms for identifying, investigating, and sanctioning the corruption that undermines the goals of the agreements...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the school and pioneer {{industries}} operating from Groveton were still thriving. The community was home to a post office and in 1885, local men leased land just northeast of the hamlet near the settlement of Campbell’s <b>Corners</b> with the <b>agreement</b> they would establish a cheese factory there immediately. The cheese factory became known as the Groveton Cheese Factory and remained in operation until the 1930s. In 1890, a frame church was constructed at the settlement’s main intersection. The church was built to serve the pre-existing Methodist congregation. The church operated until 1917, when it was permanently closed. The building was used a machine shed before being demolished.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} a finite plate {{containing}} collinear surface cracks is considered and solved by using the line spring model with plane elasticity and Reissner's plate theory. The main {{focus is on the}} effect of interaction between two cracks or between cracks and stress-free plate boundaries on the stress intensity factors in an effort to provide extensive numerical results which may be useful in applications. Some sample results are obtained and are compared with the existing finite element results. Then the problem is solved for a single (internal) crack, two collinear cracks, and two corner cracks for wide range of relative dimensions. Particularly in <b>corner</b> cracks, the <b>agreement</b> with the finite element solution is surprisingly very good. The results are obtained for semi-elliptic and rectangular crack profiles which may, in practice, correspond to two limiting cases of the actual profile of a subcritically growing surface crack...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{photodissociation}} and geminate recombination of {{nitric oxide}} in myoglobin, under continuous illumination, is modeled computationally. The relaxation of the photon {{energy into the}} protein matrix is also considered in a single simulation scheme that mimics a complete experimental setup. The dynamic approach to non-equilibrium molecular dynamics is used, starting from a steady state, to compute its relaxation to equilibrium. Simulations are conducted for the native form of sperm whale myoglobin and for two other mutants, V 68 W and L 29 F, illustrating a fair diversity of spatial and temporal geminate recombination processes. Energy flow to the heme and immediate protein environment provide hints to allostery. In particular, a pathway of energy flow between the heme and the FG loop is illustrated. Although the simulations were conducted for myoglobin only, the thermal fluctuations of the FG <b>corner</b> are in <b>agreement</b> with the large structural shifts of FG during the allosteric transition of tetrameric hemoglobin...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} quantum communication mediated by a passive optical refocusing system. The model captures the basic features of all those situations in which a signal is either refocused by a repeater for long-distance communication, or it is focused on a detector prior to the information decoding process. Introducing a general method for linear passive optical systems, we determine {{the conditions under which}} optical refocusing implies information transmission gain. Although the finite aperture of the repeater may cause loss of information, we show that the presence of the refocusing system can substantially enhance the rate of reliable communication with respect to the free-space propagation. We explicitly address the transferring of classical messages over the quantum channel, but the results can be easily extended to include the case of transferring quantum messages as well.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} undertaken for the creeping flow of a well-characterized polymer solution (fluid S 1) in the benchmark {{problem of the}} entry flow in a 4 : 1 axisymmetric contraction. The fluid has been modelled using an integral constitutive equation of the K-BKZ type with a spectrum of relaxation times. Numerical values for the constants appearing in the equation have been obtained from fitting shear viscosity and normal stress data as measured in shear: and elongational viscosities both steady-state and transient. Convergence of the numerical scheme was obtained for {{the whole range of}} experiments previously performed by Byars et al., J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 72 (1997) 219 - 235. The numerical solutions show that the vortex in the reservoir increases monotonically with increasing flow rate (or Weissenberg number) in agreement with the experiments. For identical flow conditions, a sudden contraction shows a higher vortex growth than a contraction with a rounded re-entrant <b>corner,</b> again in <b>agreement</b> with experiments.
