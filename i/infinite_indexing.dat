40|$|AbstractThe algebras in {{this paper}} are over the {{associative}} algebras R obtained from extended Coxeter-Dynkin quivers with no oriented cycles. The finite-dimensional indecomposable R-modules can, in principle, be described. Taking direct products and direct sums, respectively, of finite-dimensional R-modules over an <b>infinite</b> <b>indexing</b> set are two natural ways of getting infinite-dimensional R-modules. The latter are the infinite-dimensional pure-projective modules and direct summands of the former are the pure-injective modules. The focus {{in this paper}} is on these two classes of infinite-dimensional modules. Every module is a submodule of a pure-injective module and a quotient of a pure-projective module. When {{is an extension of}} a pure-injective module by a pure-injective module pure-injective? This question is answered in this paper. The answer is analogous to the answer of the corresponding question for pure-projective modules. The structures of some quotients of direct products of finite-dimensional modules are also obtained...|$|E
40|$|Let X be {{a set of}} states, and let I be an <b>infinite</b> <b>indexing</b> set. Our first main result {{states that}} any separable, permutation-invariant {{preference}} order (>) on X^I admits an additive representation. That is: there exists a linearly ordered abelian group A and a `utility function' u:X [...] >A such that, for any x,y in X^I which differ in only finitely many coordinates, we have x>y {{if and only if}} the sum of [u(x_i) -u(y_i) ] over all i in I is positive. Our second result states: If (>) also satisfies a weak continuity condition, then, for any x,y in X^I, we have x>y if and only if the `hypersum' of [u(x_i) -u(y_i) ] over all i in I is positive. The `hypersum' is an infinite summation operator defined using methods from nonstandard analysis. Like an integration operator or series summation operator, it allows us to define the sum of an infinite set of values. However, unlike these operations, the hypersum does not depend on some form of convergence (recall: A has no topology) [...] -it is always well-defined. Also, unlike an integral, the hypersum does not depend upon a sigma-algebra or measure on the indexing set I. The hypersum takes values in a linearly ordered abelian group A*, which is an ultrapower extension of A. These results are applicable to infinite-horizon intertemporal choice, choice under uncertainty, and variable-population social choice. ...|$|E

40|$|Finding {{the number}} of maximal subgroups of <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> of a finitely {{generated}} subgroup is a natural problem that has been solved for several classes of "geometric" groups (linear groups, hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups, etc). Here we provide a solution {{for a family of}} groups with a different geometric origin: groups of intermediate growth that act on rooted binary trees. In particular, we show that the non-torsion iterated monodromy groups of the tent map (a special case of some groups first introduced by Sunic as "siblings of the Grigorchuk group") have exactly countably many maximal subgroups of <b>infinite</b> <b>index.</b> This is in contrast to the torsion case (e. g.

We generalize some {{of the results of}} [LR 95] to the case of extensions with <b>infinite</b> Jones <b>index.</b> This case naturally arises in physics, the canonical examples are given by global gauge theories with respect to a compact (non-finite) group of internal symmetries. Building on the works of Izumi, Longo, Popa [ILP 98] and Fidaleo, Isola [FI 99], we consider generalized Q-systems (of intertwiners) for a semidiscrete inclusion of properly infinite von Neumann algebras, which generalize ordinary Q-systems introduced by Longo [Lon 94] to the <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> case. We characterize inclusions which admit generalized Q-systems of intertwiners and define a braided product among the latter, hence we construct examples of QFTs with defects (phase boundaries) of <b>infinite</b> <b>index,</b> extending the family of boundaries in the grasp of [BKLR 16].

40|$|We {{examine the}} notion of a-strong {{singularity}} for subfactors N of a II 1 factor M, which is a metric quantity that relates the distance of a unitary to a subalgebra with the distance between that subalgebra and its unitary conjugate. Using work of Popa, Sinclair, and Smith, we show that there exists an absolute constant 0 < c < 1 such that all singular subfactors are c-strongly singular. Under the hypothesis that N 0 hM, eNi is 2 -dimensional, we prove that finite index subfactors are 1 -strongly singular with a constant that tends to 1 as the Jones Index tends to infinity and <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> subfactors are 1 -strongly singular. We provide examples of subfactors satisfying these conditions using group theoretic constructions. Specifically, if P is a II 1 factor and G is a countable discrete group acting on P by outer automorphisms, we characterize the elements x of PoG such that x(PoH) x 0 PoH for some subgroup H of G. We establish that proper finite index singular subfactors {{do not have the}} weak asymptotic homomorphism property, in contrast to the case for masas. In the <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> setting, we discuss the role of the semigroup of one-sided normalizers with regards {{to the question of whether}} all <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> singular subfactors have the weak asymptotic homomorphism property. Finally, we provide a characterization of singularity for finite index subfactors in terms of the traces of projections in N 0 hM, eNi and use this result to show that fixed point subfactors of outer Zp for p prime are regular. The characterization extends to <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> subfactors by replacing singular with contains its one-sided normalizers...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three self-contained papers from my graduate work at UC Berkeley. The chapters increase in complexity from the annular Temperley-Lieb category to strongly Markov inclusions of finite von Neumann algebras to <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> II_ 1 -subfactors. In Chapter 2, we discuss how two copies of the cyclic category generate the annular Temperley-Lieb category. In the process, we give a presentation of the annular Temperley-Lieb category via generators and relations, {{and we see the}} cyclic category evolve from the simplicial and semi-simplicial categories. Chapter 3 is joint work with Vaughan F. R. Jones. First, we define a canonical planar *-algebra associated to a strongly Markov inclusion of finite von Neumann algebras (the notion of such an inclusion is defined within). Second, we show for an inclusion of finite dimensional C^*-algebras with the Markov trace, the canonical planar algebra is isomorphic to the graph planar algebra of the Bratteli diagram of the inclusion. We use this fact to show that a subfactor planar algebra embeds into the graph planar algebra of its principal graph. In Chapter 4, we expand upon Burns' work on rotations for <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> II_ 1 -subfactors. We start with a II_ 1 -factor bimodule, and we construct a tower of centralizer algebras and a sequence of central L^ 2 -vectors. In the finite index setting, the centralizer algebras and central L^ 2 -vectors agree, but in the <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> setting, these spaces can differ dramatically. We develop planar calculi for both sequences which are compatible. Interestingly, we obtain planar structure without Jones' basic construction or the resulting Jones projections! We also generalize Burns work on extremality and the existence of rotations to the bimodule setting, and we recover his main theorem. Along the way, we prove some results about relative tensor products of extended positive cones, and we give an example of an <b>infinite</b> <b>index</b> subfactor with finite dimensional higher relative commutants...|$|R
