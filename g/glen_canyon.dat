5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon,</b> the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon,</b> is also named for their leader.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, scutes {{which were}} found in the Kayenta Formation (<b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon</b> Group) of {{northern}} Arizona, were by Kevin Padian referred to a Scelidosaurus sp., and used to determine that the age of the strata was around 199.6-196.5 million years ago, {{at a time when it}} was still thought that Scelidosaurus harrisonii dated to the early Sinemurian. These scutes established a geographic tie-in between Arizona's <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon</b> and Europe, where fossils of Scelidosaurus had previously been discovered. Later scientists have rejected the assignment to Scelidosaurus, as the scutes are different in form. In 2014, Roman Ulansky named a new species, S. arizonenesis, based off these specimens. In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter identified it as a nomen dubium, instead once again placing the specimens as Thyreophora indet.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} {{movement in the}} American Southwest has opposed the damming and diversion of the Colorado River system because of {{detrimental effects on the}} ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon</b> Dam, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.|$|E

5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks were observed in the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon</b> Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.|$|E
5|$|Lees Ferry is {{considered}} the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and {{is used as a}} fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, {{on the west side of}} the Navajo Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee's brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the Charles H. Spencer. The area is managed by the National Park Service within the <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon</b> National Recreation Area as a historical site.|$|E
5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding <b>Glen</b> <b>Canyon</b> National Recreation Area received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26billion each year to the Southwest economy.|$|E
50|$|Many {{stretches}} of the Fraser are named in their own right, starting with the Little Canyon between Yale and Spuzzum, which is officially the lowest reach of the Fraser Canyon (although in regional terms Hope, 20 mi farther south, is considered a canyon town and to be the southern outlet of the canyon because the highway became more difficult from that point; the river is navigable to Yale). Between the Spuzzum and Boston Bar was known in the gold rush as the Big Canyon or Black Canyon; there are several named subcanyons of the Big Canyon, most famously Hells Gate Canyon (in some descriptions the Black Canyon is below Hell's Gate). Above the Big Canyon there are the Lillooet <b>Canyon,</b> Fountain <b>Canyon,</b> <b>Glen</b> Fraser <b>Canyon,</b> Moran Canyon, High Bar Canyon, French Bar Canyon and more {{all the way up}} to Soda Creek Canyon near Quesnel. Upstream from there the river flows in wider country, but in the Robson Valley between Prince George and Tête Jaune Cache, the river enters the Grand Canyon of the Fraser. The Black Canyon was the site of a shantytown of the same name, much of which was on catwalks on the ramparts of its dark-rock cliffs.|$|R

50|$|The Carneros Creek {{official}} mainstem is 7.6 mi long. It drains {{a watershed}} of 5.6 sq mi and its Tecolotito Creek tributary drains the 5.8 sq mi <b>Glen</b> Annie <b>Canyon</b> watershed. It drops rapidly from its source {{just south of}} the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains through Bartlett Canyon in the Los Padres National Forest. After crossing the Tecolote Aqueduct and being joined by Dry Creek on the right (headed downstream), Carneros Creek becomes low gradient. As it passes to the west of Lake Los Carneros Park, it crosses beneath U.S. Highway 101 where it enters the Los Carneros Wetlands and is diverted {{to the west of the}} Santa Barbara Municipal Airport. The Wetlands are located south of Highway 101 and north of Hollister Avenue and are a remnant of a large area that was once a part of the Goleta Slough.

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship.

40|$|Fluvial {{terraces}} contain {{information about}} incision, deformation, and climate change. In this study, a chronostratigraphic record of Colorado River terraces is constructed from {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) dating of Pleistocene alluvium and real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS surveys of terrace form. This record is analyzed to relate terrace formation to late Pleistocene climate fluctuations, and terrain analyses and longitudinal profile patterns reveal recent salt-related activity in the northern Paradox Basin as well as patterns in Colorado Plateau incision. A well-preserved, correlative suite of mainstem (M) fluvial deposits exists along the Colorado River upstream of Moab, Utah. Absolute dates indicate sedimentation 3 ̆e 70 ka (M 7, M 6 /M 5), 70 - 50 ka (M 4), 50 - 40 ka (M 3), and 35 - 25 ka (M 2). The M 4 and M 2 formed during the crescendo to glacial maxima, but the M 7, M 6 /M 5, and M 3 were deposited during variable climate of marine isotope stages (MIS) 5 and 3. Deposits include thin (3 ̆c 7 m) strath terraces and thick (10 - 20 m) fill terraces. Our results suggest that terrace sedimentation is linked to enhanced sediment flux during glaciations in Rocky Mountain headwaters (M 4 and M 2), but major deposits also formed during dryland tributary sediment loading with markedly different timing (M 6 /M 5 and M 3). Conversely, incision may be driven by higher deglacial flows. Clast provenance data demonstrate greater percentages of locally-sourced sediment in M 6 /M 5 and M 3 deposits. Valley-bottom geometry and neotectonics control terrace form, with strath terraces found in bedrock-restricted reaches and fill terraces in wider valleys. Previously speculated salt deformation {{in this area is}} confirmed by localized collapse preserved in M 4 stratigraphy in the Cache Valley graben and 15 m of broader subsidence upstream. Concavity and knickzone distributions in tributary profiles are discordant and represent subtle expressions of salt-tectonic activity. Finally, a surprisingly rapid incision rate of 900 m/Ma over the past 70 ka suggests that the Colorado River may be responding to flexural rebound in the central plateau, but is faster than that predicted by the debated bull 2 ̆ 7 s-eye pattern of regional incision. This locally high rate may also reflect a transient wave of incision, as suggested by increased Pleistocene rates interpreted by studies in <b>Glen</b> and Grand <b>canyons...</b>|$|R
