2500|$|A {{skeletal}} {{survey is}} useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The <b>iliac</b> <b>wings</b> are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, {{a search for a}} different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often [...] "double jointed".|$|E
50|$|The bony pelvis {{consists}} of the ilium (i.e., <b>iliac</b> <b>wings),</b> ischium, and pubis, which form an anatomic ring with the sacrum. Disruption of this ring requires significant energy. When {{it comes to the}} stability and the structure of the pelvis, or pelvic girdle, understanding its function as support for the trunk and legs helps to recognize the effect a pelvic fracture has on someone. The pubic bone, the ischium and the ilium make up the pelvic girdle, fused together as one unit. They attach to both sides of the spine and circle around to create a ring and sockets to place hip joints. Attachment to the spine is important to direct force into the trunk from the legs as movement occurs, extending to one’s back. This requires the pelvis to be strong enough to withstand pressure and energy. Various muscles play important roles in pelvic stability.Because of the forces involved, pelvic fractures frequently involve injury to organs contained within the bony pelvis. In addition, trauma to extra-pelvic organs is common. Pelvic fractures are often associated with severe hemorrhage due to the extensive blood supply to the region.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe desmoplastic fibroma {{is a rare}} locally {{invasive}} bone tumour. Surgical resection {{with minimal}} margins is recommended. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 15 year-old boy was referred with chronic left thigh pain. MRI revealed a bone lesion within the cavity of the inner table of the left <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> without invasion of the underlying bone marrow. A surgical biopsy revealed a desmoplastic bone fibroma. A partial resection of the inner table of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> sparing the outer table was performed. At the latest follow-up the initially spared <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> had needed further resection. The reason proposed for this is devascularisation by substantial periosteal stripping causing partial resorption initially, then necrosis and ultimately ulceration through the skin necessitating further surgical resection. DISCUSSIONThe technique of resection of a pelvic desmoplastic fibroma sparing the outer table of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> has not previously been reported. The objective of a limited resection was {{to minimize the risk}} of a postsurgical limp caused by weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. However we report that this technique did not work in this case. A wider resection of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> as it is recommended for a malignant tumour would have yielded a similar final outcome. CONCLUSIONA partial resection of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> seemed an appealing technique for a benign tumour of the inner table of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing.</b> However, considering the complications encountered, the authors advise a simple “en bloc” resection of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> for this type of tumour in this location...|$|R
50|$|Duverney {{fractures}} {{are isolated}} pelvic fractures involving only the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing.</b> They {{are caused by}} direct trauma to the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing,</b> and are generally stable fractures as they do not disrupt the weight bearing pelvic ring.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Iliac</b> <b>wing</b> {{fractures}} {{have received}} little {{attention in the}} literature. Commonly occurring after a direct blow, they are rotationally and vertically stable. However, one {{must be aware of}} their potential for major morbidity including soft tissue, abdominal organ, and vascular lesions. This study examines the incidence, radiographic findings, soft tissue injuries, and complications associated with isolated <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> fractures. METHODS: Retrospective review between 2003 and 2006 of a consecutive series of 450 polytraumatized patients treated in a level- 1 University trauma center. Hospital charts and radiographs were reviewed and all patients with an isolated <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> fracture were requested to return for a clinical and radiologic examination. RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients had major pelvic trauma. Only 10 sustained a fracture limited to the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing,</b> all after high-energy trauma. Nine of 10 patients sustained a total of 36 additional injuries involving head, thorax, spine, abdomen, urologic, and orthopedic systems. Only two patients underwent internal fixation of their fracture, one because of the fracture compressing the bowel and the other because of a very large rotated <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> fragment. Two patients with open fractures were treated with irrigation and debridement and no internal fixation. CONCLUSIONS: An isolated <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> fracture not compromising the stability of the pelvic ring may be interpreted as a benign injury. However, serious and potentially life-threatening associated injuries may be present requiring emergency abdominal, vascular, or neurologic surgery. A thorough search for such injuries is critical. Most <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> fractures can be managed nonoperatively...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of the fetal <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> angle measurements in the detection of trisomy 21 during the second trimester and the impact of the fetal position on this measurement. During a 43 -month period, the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> angle was prospectively measured in 695 fetuses at genetic ultrasonography performed before amniocentesis. The <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> angle measurements were performed in a true axial section of the fetal pelvis and the relative position of the fetal spine was recorded (decubitus, lateral). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR) were computed for multiple cutoff angles. The prevalence of trisomy 21 was 1. 4 %; 447 fetuses were in lateral position, 240 fetuses were in decubitus position, including, respectively, 2 and 8 fetuses with trisomy 21 (8 fetuses with other chromosomal anomalies were excluded). In euploid fetuses, the mean <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> angle was 83. 7 ° in decubitus and 68. 7 ° in lateral position; in fetuses with trisomy 21 the respective mean angles were 104. 9 ° and 102. 5 °. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve provided an absolute cutoff angle of 90 °, predicting trisomy 21 with a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 72. 4 %, an NPV of 100 %, a PPV value of 11. 1 %, and an LR of 3. 6. The measurement of <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> angles in an axial section of the fetal pelvis is dependent on spine orientation and provides an efficient cutoff angle for the exclusion of trisomy 21 in patients at risk.

30|$|Pelvic {{rotation}} or tilt {{can also}} lead to misinterpretation of films and radiographic signs, including the ISS and the COS [16, 22]. Consequently, {{one of the most important}} tools in radiographic evaluation of the adolescent hip is recognition of a proper AP pelvis film. A proper film is obtained with the patient supine with their legs internally rotated 15 ° and the X-ray tube placed 120  cm away from the film, centered on the midpoint between the pubic symphysis and a line connecting the two anterior superior iliac spines [23]. Although there are slight variations between genders, an appropriate AP pelvis film should position the tip of the coccyx approximately 1 – 3  cm from the pubic symphysis. This technique was used in our study to confirm appropriate pelvic tilt and rotation. Additionally, symmetry of the obturator for aminae, <b>iliac</b> <b>wings,</b> and radiographic teardrops are also useful markers of appropriate positioning [22]. Using these radiographic cues, one can avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation of pelvic radiographs.|$|E
50|$|Malunion and {{deformity}} of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> can occur. Injury to {{the internal}} iliac artery can occur, leading to hypovolaemic shock. Perforation of the bowel can occur, leading to sepsis. Damage to the adjacent nerves of the lumbosacral plexus has also been described.|$|R

30|$|During surgery, the {{abdominal}} muscles and the gluteus medius {{are separated from}} the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> {{to gain access to}} the sciatic notch both internally and externally. The iliac muscle is usually sacrificed to achieve a wide tumor margin, while the psoas muscle is often saved to gain better hip stability postoperatively. Insertion of the saddle prosthesis (Waldemar Link GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) is achieved after preparing the femoral stem. The appropriate saddle length is selected before applying the prosthesis. The saddle is placed in contact with the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing,</b> engraving a notch on the medial part of the wing, while external displacement of the saddle is prevented through the use of artificial ligaments or bone graft (usually the resected femoral head). At the end of the operation, good hip stability is achieved by lengthening the operated limb.|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare, but {{represent}} {{the most common}} mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. Tumor resection is the treatment of choice for localized disease. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, sunitinib) are the standard therapy for metastatic or unresectable GISTs.

We describe three cases of bone metastases in patients with advanced GISTs: two women (82 and 54 years of age), and one man (62 years of age). Bones metastases involved the spine, pelvis and ribs in one patient, multiple vertebral bodies and pelvis in one, and the spine and <b>iliac</b> <b>wings</b> in the third case.

30|$|We {{routinely}} {{apply the}} body casts under general endotracheal anesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, a bite block is placed {{to protect the}} tongue and cheeks, {{as well as the}} tube, from accidental bite as traction is applied with a halter strap. A cast t-shirt is placed on the patient and two stacked towels are placed under the t-shirt to prevent the cast from being too tight. A stockinet may be used instead of the cast t-shirt. A towel is wrapped around the patient’s occiput and covers the ears as well as the eyes. This towel helps protect the ears from the pressure of the halter strap and is also useful to protect the face from the saw dust {{at the end of the}} procedure. Then, a halter strap is placed around the occiput and under the chin. Long straps are cut from a cloth wrap and placed around the patient’s waist above the <b>iliac</b> <b>wings</b> on both sides. These straps are placed over the cast t-shirt to prevent skin irritation during removal. The patient is then transferred onto the cast frame. Different cast frames are available commercially depending on the surgeon’s preference.|$|E
40|$|Campomelic {{dysplasia}} (CD) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited, skeletal abnormality {{belonging to}} the subgroup of bent bone dysplasias. In addition to bowed lower limbs, CD typically includes the following: disproportionate short stature, flat face, micrognathia, cleft palate, bell-shaped thorax, and club feet. Up to three quarters of 46, XY individuals may be sex-reversed. Radiological signs include scapular and pubic hypoplasia, narrow <b>iliac</b> <b>wings,</b> spaced ischia, and bowed femora and tibiae. Lethal CD is usually due to heterozygous mutations in SOX 9, a major regulator of chondrocytic development. We present a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of nine Brazilian CD patients. Infants were either stillborn (n = 2) or died shortly after birth and presented similar phenotypes. Sex-reversal was observed {{in one of three}} chromosomally male patients. Sequencing of SOX 9 revealed new heterozygous mutations in seven individuals.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{supplement}} data on pelvic morphology and structural geometry. Using these data, a mathematical and biomechanical model was constructed. The research was divided into two parts. The first part comprised radiogrammetric analysis of pelvic morphology and geometry based on 60 AP x-rays of male and female pelvises. The spatial definition of the pelvis was given by three transverse and one sagittal diameter. Transverse diameters were measured at the level of <b>iliac</b> <b>wings,</b> at the narrowest supraacetabular portion and on the line passing through the center of both femoral heads. The fourth diameter was the height of the pelvis. Geometric properties and structure of pelvic bones and position of muscles in relation to bone elements of the pelvis were analyzed in the second part. Knowing geometric dimensions of the pelvis and the body weight, it is possible to calculate the magnitude of gravitational forces acting upon certain pelvic portions.

A cross sectional anatomic atlas of the lumbosacral region and ex-vivo ultrasound images were obtained in two cadavers to describe the ultrasound anatomy of the region and to identify the landmarks. Eighteen cadavers were used to establish two different variations of an ultrasound-guided technique, using spinal needles or epidural catheters. The technique was then performed in three cadavers in situations, considered similar to the daily clinical activity.

40|$|Higher demands {{by people}} on the {{performance}} of vehicles and the comfort-related physical complaints by professional drivers have led to an increasing demand for more comfortable cars. Car manufacturers use comfort as an item to distinguish themselves from their competitors. However, the development and introduction of a new, more-comfortable car seat or interior is time consuming and costly. The use of computer models of human and seat could facilitate this process. Literature showed that pressure distribution is proposed as an objective factor relating to the personal subjective feeling of comfort. For that reason, a detailed finite element model of the pelvis and the thighs has been developed in MADYMO, an explicit non-linear dynamic code with combined multibody-FE capabilities. In the model, the bony structures of the <b>iliac</b> <b>wings,</b> sacrum, coccyx and femora have been represented. The soft tissues (such as muscles and fat) have been lumped together and the skin has been modelled separately.

Tissue engineering (TE) of bone by combining bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with a porous scaffold, is considered a promising technique.

Orthotopic bone formation was compared to ectopic bone formation in comparable constructs. TE constructs were prepared from goat BMSCs and porous biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic scaffolds. These constructs and scaffolds without cells were implanted paired in critical sized <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> defects. Comparable samples were implanted intramuscularly. After 9 (n= 7) and 12 (n= 8) weeks implantation, the samples were analyzed histomorphometrically. After 9 -weeks implantation in the <b>iliac</b> <b>wing</b> defect, significantly more bone apposition was found in the TE condition. After 12 weeks, the defects were almost completely filled with bone, but no significant advantage of TE was determined anymore.
