5|$|Although {{uncommon}} in dogs, bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> {{be the cause}} of wheezing (stridor) when middle-aged dogs inhale.|$|E
5|$|An {{infection}} with Spirochetes (a bacterium) in gum <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> cause dementia {{and may be}} involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|There may be {{symptoms}} of thyroid overactivity, such as weight loss, a fast heart rate, tremor, and perspiration; but such symptoms occur in {{only half of}} all cases. The {{most common type of}} hyperthyroidism, Graves' <b>disease,</b> <b>may</b> additionally cause eye problems (Graves' ophthalmopathy) and skin changes of the legs (pretibial myxedema). Thyroid <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> also cause muscle weakness in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy, but this is constant rather than episodic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diseases</b> <b>may</b> be {{classified}} by cause, pathogenesis (mechanism {{by which the}} disease is caused), or by symptom(s). Alternatively, <b>diseases</b> <b>may</b> {{be classified}} according to the organ system involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ.|$|R

5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric {{symptoms are}} commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E

5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's <b>disease,</b> <b>may</b> {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal <b>disease,</b> <b>may</b> be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
30|$|Radiologists {{should be}} {{familiar}} with less well-known diseases affecting the small bowel other than Crohn’s disease as these <b>diseases</b> <b>may</b> be detected in patients referred for small bowel MR enterography or enteroclysis. This also includes malignant and inflammatory <b>diseases</b> that <b>may</b> mimic Crohn’s <b>disease.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Diseases</b> <b>may</b> also be {{vectored}} by invasive insects {{such as the}} Asian citrus psyllid and the {{bacterial disease}} citrus greening.|$|R

5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E

2500|$|There is also {{a higher}} risk of {{developing}} an autoimmune disease. [...] Autoimmune <b>diseases</b> <b>may</b> also go into remission after treatment of HCL.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively to {{the protein}} targets, {{lysosomal}} storage <b>diseases</b> <b>may</b> be classified by {{the type of}} protein that is deficient and is causing buildup.|$|R
5|$|Renal <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> lead to hyperparathyroidism. When {{too much}} calcium is lost, {{there is a}} {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{progress}} in preventing the <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> in part {{be due to}} stigma associated with TB. Stigma {{may be due to}} the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS. Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
50|$|Restrictive lung <b>diseases</b> <b>may</b> {{be due to}} {{specific}} causes which can be intrinsic to the parenchyma of the lung, or extrinsic to it.|$|R
50|$|The species {{used most}} {{commonly}} in modern herbalism is Lobelia inflata (Indian tobacco). Use of lobelia for cardiovascular <b>diseases</b> <b>may</b> cause adverse effects.|$|R

5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
5|$|Liver <b>disease</b> <b>may</b> {{present itself}} as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
