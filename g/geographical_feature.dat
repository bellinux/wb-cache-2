He also became the commercial representative of the Dominican government in Paris, Bern and London. At one time Betances attempted to be a venture capital partner on a failed enterprise that attempted to commercialize the use of Samaná Bay to benefit the Dominican Republic, and also to prevent foreign interests (particularly the United States) from taking over the bay, which was considered a primary strategic <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> of Hispaniola, in both commercial and military terms.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Juno Beach by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division {{was the most}} {{successful}} of the five beaches attacked on D-Day, 6June 1944. Having successfully landed in Normandy, Allied forces soon became embroiled in battles against German armour and were unable to significantly expand their beachhead; {{by the time the}} 2nd Division came ashore {{at the end of the}} first week of July, the entire front had congealed. Assigned to the II Canadian Corps, and subordinated to the British Second Army, the division assembled its brigades for combat while British and Canadian forces launched Operation Charnwood. It was a tactical success, but could not clear all Caen of its German defenders. Although originally a D-Day objective, Caen proved a difficult prize, holding out until 19July when it finally fell to British troops during Operation Goodwood. In the aftermath, General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, ordered elements of II Canadian Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, to push forward towards Verrières Ridge, the dominant <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> between Caen and Falaise. By keeping up the pressure, Montgomery hoped to divert German attention away from the American sector to the west.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{subsequently}} became {{heavily involved}} in fighting throughout the front it occupied, especially 3rd Parachute Battalion, which launched several attacks on a <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> known as 'Green Hill'; during multiple attacks, several companies from the battalion were able to gain {{the crest of the}} hill, only to be driven back by enemy counterattacks. On the night of 78 January the brigade was relieved from the frontline and transported to Algiers, with the exception of 2nd Parachute Battalion, which remained under the command of 78th Infantry Division {{because of a lack of}} troops to replace it. Plans were made to use the brigade in conjunction with US II Corps to cut Axis lines of communications around Sfax and Gabes, but these were never finalised. On 24 January it was transferred back to V Corps and came under the command of 6th Armoured Division, but did not remain there for long; two days later it came under the command of XIX French Corps, located in area around Bou Araba. There it was given command of several French units and stationed between 36th Infantry Brigade and 1st Guards Brigade. On 2 February 1 Parachute Battalion was ordered to mount an attack on the massifs of Djebel Mansour and Djebel Alliliga, supported by a company belonging to the French Foreign Legion. The battalion launched its attack during the night and by the next morning had captured both features against fierce opposition; however, heavy casualties meant that the battalion was forced to retreat from Djebel Alligila and concentrate on Djebel Mansour. There they were cut off from supplies and almost all reinforcements, and counterattacks by 6th Armoured Division failed to reach the battalion. A battalion from the Grenadier Guards was able to capture most of Djebel Alliliga on 4 February, but both battalions came under increasingly heavy attack, and by 11:00 the next day it was decided to withdraw both battalions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have also suggested indigenous American origins for these words. The Spanish named the South Carolina and Georgia coastal region as Guale, after a Native American tribe. The {{name of the}} Ogeechee River, a prominent <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> in coastal Georgia, may have been derived from a Creek Indian (Muskogee language) word.|$|E
40|$|Suruga bay is a {{structural}} bay with {{a considerable number}} of <b>geographical</b> <b>features.</b> The Suruga Trough runs from north to south,and the Fujikawa Fan Delta is {{in the northern part of}} Suruga Bay. From seismic data on the continental shelf in the northern part of Suruga Bay,we clarified the formation processes of the <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> from detailed sea-beam data and determined the displacement of the basement in the Wu?rm ice age due to the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate. As a result, unique <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> were found to exist on the continental shelf in the northern part of Suruga Bay. We distinguished some of the <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> and assumed a wavy surface and two gradual slopes. Moreover,we found that the base sank gradually from the region off Ueda to that off Fuji River from seismic data. However,large displacement of the base was confirmed to the west of Fuji River. This large displacement of base might show <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> change from Wu?rm...|$|R

25|$|The Andes Mountains are the {{dominant}} <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> of Argentine wine regions, with the snow-capped mountains often {{serving as a}} backdrop view to the vineyards. As the winter snows start to melt in the spring, an intricate irrigation system of dams, canals and channels brings vital water supplies down to the wine regions to sustain viticulture in the dry, arid climates. Most of the wine regions are located within {{the foothills of the}} Andes and recent trends have seen a push to plant vineyards on higher elevations closer to the mountains.|$|E

25|$|According to Jordanes, the Catalaunian plain rose on {{one side}} by a sharp slope to a ridge; this <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> {{dominated}} the battlefield and {{became the center of}} the battle. The Huns first seized {{the right side of the}} ridge, while the Romans seized the left, with the crest unoccupied between them. Jordanes explains that the Visigoths held the right side, the Romans the left, with Sangiban of uncertain loyalty and his Alans surrounded in the middle. The Hunnic forces attempted to take the ridge, but were outstripped by the Romans under Aetius and the Goths under Thorismund.|$|E

The large Yellow Rock escarpment that border Broke also has numerous vineyards and is the regions dominant <b>geographical</b> <b>feature.</b> The area is one of the warmest in the Lower Hunter with some continental influences due to extenuating foothills of the Brokenback range that particularly encircle the area and block many of the breezes coming off the coast.|$|E
25|$|The land {{surrounding}} Stirling {{has been}} most affected by glacial erosion and deposition. The city itself has grown up around its castle which stands atop an ancient quartz-dolerite sill, known as the Stirling Sill, a major defensive position which was at the lowest crossing point on the River Forth. Stirling stands on the Forth {{at the point where}} the river widens and becomes tidal. To the east of the city the Ochil Hills dominate the skyline with the highest peak in the range being Ben Cleuch, although Dumyat is more noticeable from Stirling. The Ochils meet the flat carse (floodplain) of the River Forth to the east of the distinctive <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> of Abbey Craig, a crag and tail hill upon which stands the 220ft (67m) high National Wallace Monument.|$|E

25|$|A' Bhuidheanach Bheag’s best <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> is {{the remote}} Cama Choire {{on the eastern}} side of the mountain. This is a steep sided valley which cuts deeply into the hill and is drained by the Allt a’ Chama Choire. The coire is well seen from the hill of An Dun above the Gaick Pass. From a {{geological}} point of view the most interesting characteristic of the mountain is Coire Mhic-sith on its south-western flank. The coire is a deeply incised, fault-guided valley which has received the attention of geologists, especially the School of Geoscience at the University of Edinburgh who have concluded that the presence of glacial silt and sand in the valley along with a glacial spillway to the adjacent valley of the Edendon Water means that the coire had a large ice dammed lake during the last Ice age. This Proglacial lake drained away when the ice melted but has left evidence similar, but on a lesser scale, to the “parallel roads” in Glen Roy.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is situated}} on {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada between the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl and in the Moctezuma-Panuco River. The Sierra Nevada is the most important <b>geographical</b> <b>feature</b> of the region and forms the eastern border of the municipality. These volcanoes are responsible for the compositions of the soils here as well as the source of most of the municipality’s fresh water. The average altitude in these mountains is 4,000 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos. Although near the active volcano, Amecameca is considered to be at a lower risk than other communities in the area because of the shape of Popocatépetl’s cone and the large ravines that are found in this area. The latter offers protection against lava flows and runoff from melting snow. However, the area remains part of the evacuation zone {{in the event of a}} major eruption. There is a lookout station on Sacromonte hill which is used by civil defense when the volcano is more active. The area has an eruption warning system of three colors—red, yellow and green—which depend on the status of Popocatepetl. Green means that the volcano is quiet, yellow that there is activity and caution is advised and red indicates a current or imminent eruption. When the status turns to yellow, tourism to the area plummets to about half normal.|$|E

40|$|Electronic maps (E-maps) provide {{people with}} {{convenience}} in real-world space. Although web map services can display maps on screens, {{a more important}} function is their ability to access <b>geographical</b> <b>features.</b> An E-map {{that is based on}} raster tiles is inferior to vector tiles in terms of interactive ability because vector maps provide a convenient and effective method to access and manipulate web map features. However, the critical issue regarding rendering tiled vector maps is that <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> that are rendered in the form of map symbols via vector tiles may cause visual discontinuities, such as graphic conflicts and losses of data around the borders of tiles, which likely represent the main obstacles to exploring vector map tiles on the web. This paper proposes a tiled vector data model for <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> in symbolized maps that considers the relationships among <b>geographical</b> <b>features,</b> symbol representations and map renderings. This model presents a method to tailor <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> in terms of map symbols and 'addition' (join) operations on the following two levels: <b>geographical</b> <b>features</b> and map features. Thus, these maps can resolve the visual discontinuity problem based on the proposed model without weakening the interactivity of vector maps. The proposed model is validated by two map data sets, and the results demonstrate that the rendered (symbolized) web maps present smooth visual continuity...|$|R
