It is not implied by Szemerédi's theorem because the primes have density 0 {{in the natural}} numbers. As part of their <b>proof,</b> <b>Green</b> and Tao introduced a [...] "relative" [...] Szemerédi theorem which applies to subsets of the integers (even those with 0 density) satisfying certain pseudorandomness conditions. A more general relative Szemerédi theorem has since been given by Conlon, Fox, and Zhao.|$|R
40|$|We prove a removal lemma for {{systems of}} linear {{equations}} over finite fields: let X 1, …, X m be subsets of the finite field F q and let A be a (k × m) matrix with coefficients in F q; if the linear system Ax = b has o(q m−k) solutions with x i ∈ X i, {{then we can}} eliminate all these solutions by deleting o(q) elements from each X i. This extends a result of Green [Geometric and Functional Analysis 15 (2) (2005), 340 – 376] for a single linear equation in abelian groups to systems of linear equations. In particular, we also obtain an analogous result for systems of equations over integers, a result conjectured by <b>Green.</b> Our <b>proof</b> uses the colored version of the hypergraph Removal Lemma...|$|R

Then, in Section 4.2, {{we will use}} eigenvalues to give a complete description for the sign of <b>Green</b> functions. The <b>proofs</b> of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 will be given. One may notice that in the deduction of the sign of Green functions, besides eigenvalues, rotation numbers, and oscillation of solutions, some important estimates on Poincaré matrixes in [10, 12] will be used. Moreover, in the deduction of AMP, a very remarkable reduction for elliptic Hill's equations by Ortega [14, 15] is effectively used to simplify the argument. Note that such a reduction is originally used to deduce the formula for the first Birkhoff twist coefficient of periodic solutions of nonlinear, scalar Newtonian equations. Finally, in Section 4.3, we will outline how the known sufficient conditions on AMP can be easily deduced from Theorem 1.1.|$|R
40|$|From June 2005 till June 2007 {{different}} {{soil preparation}} techniques like chiselling and advance sowing of medicinal plants and <b>green</b> manuring were <b>proofed</b> for {{their influence on}} reducing plant losses of strawberries caused by root diseases like Phytophthora species and Verticillium dahliae. The variants were combined with potted plants and Frigos. The experiment took place on an organic fruit farm near Stuttgart, Germany, with the strawberry variety ´Elsanta´. Focused on root diseases, habit and yield chiselling combined with Frigos and green manuring combined with potted plants showed the best results. Generally the marketable yield was often below yields from conventional cultivation.

It includes also experiments about cutting techniques at raspberries, plant protection at black- and gooseberries and weed control at blueberries and black currants.

If then the white kernel had been called Tuna's brain, we have only to {{remember}} that in Mangaia {{there are two kinds of}} cocoanut trees, and we shall then have no difficulty in understanding why these twin cocoanut trees were said to have sprung from the two halves of Tuna's brain, one being red in stem, branches, and fruit, whilst the other was of a deep <b>green.</b> In <b>proof</b> of these trees being derived from the head of Tuna, we are told that we have only to break the nut in order to see in the sprouting germ the two eyes and the mouth of Tuna, the great eel, the lover of Ina. For a full understanding of this very complicated myth more information has been supplied by Mr. Gill. Ina means moon; Ina-mae- aitu, the heroine of our story, means Ina-who-had-a-divine (aitu) lover, and she was the daughter of Kui, the blind. Tuna means eel, and in Mangaia it was unlawful for women to eat eels, so that even now, as Mr. Gill informs me, his converts turn away from this fish with the utmost disgust. From other stories about the origin of cocoanut trees, told in the same island, it would appear that the sprouts of the cocoanut were actually called eels' heads, while the skulls of warriors were called cocoanuts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} several related graph rewrite systems {{derived from}} known identities on classical structures within a †-symmetric monoidal category. First, we develop a rewrite {{system based on}} a single classical structure, {{and use it to}} develop a proof of the so-called “spider-theorem, ” where a connected graph containing a single classical structure can be uniquely determined by the number of inputs and outputs (i. e. it can be rewritten as a graph resembling an n-legged spider). These spiders are shown to be the normal forms of graphs containing a single classical structure. Next, complementary classical structures are introduced, as well as a new rewrite system on graphs of red and <b>green</b> spiders. A <b>proof</b> of convergence is given for a limited two-colour rewrite system, as well as insights into ways to approach normalisation in a more powerful rewrite system.

30|$|Green {{management}} {{has led to}} questioning the profit-oriented structure of the existing management research traditions and highlighted the cost of economic growth. With the participation of environmental risks into the research agenda, green {{management has}} brought different perspectives to management research. Today, it has attracted increasing attention among management scholars and business practitioners (Srivastava 2007). Many books have been published to criticize the anti-environmental practices of companies and suggested methods to be more environmental (Mishan 1967; Schumacher 1973; Hawken et al. 1999; Martinez-Alier 2002; Esty and Winston 2006; Werbach 2009; Hollender and Breen 2010; Cramer and Karabell 2010). In addition, {{an increasing number of}} journals, that subjected the <b>green</b> management, are <b>proof</b> of academic interest. Today, there are a total of 417 journals that are indexed in Scopus and ISI indexes that have subjected various aspects of environmental issues. Forty four of them are specialized in environmental management, economics, and policy issues. Besides academic interest, many surveys conducted to managers in different industries show that green management has gained importance over the past decades and has become an essential part of a firm’s agenda to be and stay competitive (Porter 1991; Porter and Van der Linde 1995 a, b; Delmas and Toffel 2008; Riddleberger and Hittner 2009; Haanaes et al. 2012; AlixPartners 2013).|$|R
