5|$|<b>Google</b> <b>is</b> a {{computer}} software and a web search engine {{company that has}} been acquiring, on average, more than one company per week in 2010 and 2011. The table below is an incomplete list of acquisitions, with each acquisition listed being for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified. The acquisition date listed is {{the date of the}} agreement between Google and the acquisition subject. As <b>Google</b> <b>is</b> headquartered in the United States, acquisition is listed in US dollars. If the price of an acquisition is unlisted, then it is undisclosed. If the Google service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed here. Google itself was re-organized into a subsidiary of a larger holding company known as Alphabet Inc. in 2015.|$|E

And, while the deal did not give NSA access to Google's data on users' searches or e-mail communications and accounts and <b>Google</b> <b>was</b> not sharing proprietary data with the agency, privacy and civil rights advocates were concerned.|$|R
50|$|In June 2009, <b>Google</b> <b>was</b> {{ordered by}} the Chinese {{government}} to block various overseas websites, including some with sexually explicit content. <b>Google</b> <b>was</b> criticized by the China Illegal Information Reporting Center (CIIRC) for allowing search results that included content that was sexual in nature, claiming the company was a dissemination channel for a “huge amount of porn and lewd content”.|$|R

25|$|A common {{interview}} {{question at}} <b>Google</b> <b>is</b> how to route data among data processing nodes; routes vary by time {{to transfer the}} data, but nodes also differ by their computing power and storage, compounding the problem of where to send data.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, the UK Government {{introduced}} a new law intended to penalise Google and other large multinational corporations' artificial tax avoidance. <b>Google</b> <b>is</b> accused of avoiding paying {{tens of billions of}} dollars of tax through a convoluted scheme of inter-company licensing agreements and transfers to tax havens. Schmidt was also criticised for his inaccurate use of the term 'capitalism' to describe billions of dollars being transferred into tax havens where no economic activity was actually taking place.|$|E

25|$|A JavaScript engine (also {{known as}} JavaScript {{interpreter}} or JavaScript implementation) is an interpreter that interprets JavaScript source code and executes the script accordingly. The first JavaScript engine {{was created by}} Brendan Eich at Netscape, for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. The engine, code-named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C. It has since been updated (in JavaScript 1.5) to conform to ECMAScript 3. The Rhino engine, created primarily by Norris Boyd (formerly at Netscape, now at <b>Google)</b> <b>is</b> a JavaScript implementation in Java. Rhino, like SpiderMonkey, is ECMAScript 3 compliant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Google</b> <b>is</b> {{suspected}} of collecting and aggregating data about Internet users {{through the various}} tools it provides to developers, such as Google Analytics, Google Fonts, and Google APIs. This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the IP address being used through successive sites (cross-domain web tracking). Linked to other information made available through Google APIs, which are widely used, Google {{might be able to}} provide a quite complete web user profile linked to an IP address or user. This kind of data is invaluable for marketing agencies, and for Google itself to increase the efficiency of its own marketing and advertising activities.|$|E
25|$|Markov chains {{have many}} {{applications}} as statistical models of real-world processes, such as studying cruise control systems in motor vehicles, queues or lines of customers arriving at an airport, exchange rates of currencies, storage {{systems such as}} dams, and population growths of certain animal species. The algorithm known as PageRank, which was originally proposed for the internet search engine <b>Google,</b> <b>is</b> based on a Markov process. Furthermore, Markov processes are the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Gibbs sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, are used for simulating random objects with specific probability distributions, and have found extensive application in Bayesian statistics.|$|E

25|$|The {{dominant}} desktop {{operating system}} is Microsoft Windows with a {{market share of}} around 83.3%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (11.2%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.55%). In the mobile (smartphone and tablet combined) sector, according to third quarter 2016 data, Android by <b>Google</b> <b>is</b> dominant with 87.5 percent and a growth rate 10.3 percent per year, followed by iOS by Apple with 12.1 percent and a per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent. Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications.|$|E
25|$|Despite Android's popularity, {{including}} an activation rate {{three times that}} of iOS, {{there have been reports}} that Google {{has not been able to}} leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected. The Verge suggested that <b>Google</b> <b>is</b> losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services Amazon's Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS, a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google's proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store. In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} issue {{related to}} Internet privacy internationally {{is that of}} data collection. At this point in time, the U.S. and the European Union had separate sets of privacy policies, making it increasingly difficult for companies such as Google to exist globally without violating such policies. <b>Google</b> <b>is</b> {{just one example of}} a large company whose primary goal is to make money by serving their product, web browsing, to consumers. Consumers, however, are concerned with the quality of that product and their privacy. Online data collection by search engines allows Internet businesses to track consumer’s online roadmap, everything from the sites they visit to the purchases they make. This poses problems globally to those who are web users around the world, especially in a world where there is no overarching privacy policy. The general consensus of this issue regarding international privacy violations at the time of Fleischer’s U.N. address is that, since the Internet is global, the privacy policies should also be global and unified.|$|E
