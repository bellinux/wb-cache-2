2500|$|Neon is a {{noble gas}} {{chemical}} element and an inert gas {{that is a}} minor component of the Earth's atmosphere. It was discovered in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. When Ramsay and Travers had succeeded in obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [...] "electrical gas-discharge" [...] tube that {{was similar to the}} tubes used today for neon signs. Travers later wrote, [...] "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget." [...] The procedure of examining the colors of the light emitted from gas-discharge (or [...] "Geissler" [...] tubes) was well-known at the time, since the colors of light (the [...] "spectral lines") emitted by a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> are, essentially, fingerprints that identify the gases inside.|$|E

50|$|An anode ray (also {{positive}} ray or canal ray) is a beam {{of positive}} ions that is created by certain types of <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes.</b> They were first observed in Crookes tubes during experiments by the German scientist Eugen Goldstein, in 1886.

50|$|The {{characteristic}} of a TVS requires that it respond to overvoltages faster than other common overvoltage protection components such as varistors or <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes.</b> This makes TVS devices or components useful for protection against very fast and often damaging voltage spikes. These fast overvoltage spikes are present on all distribution networks and {{can be caused by}} either internal or external events, such as lightning or motor arcing.|$|R
50|$|Some {{important}} {{examples include}} the thyratron, krytron, and ignitron tubes, which are used to switch high-voltage currents. A specialized type of gas-filled tube called a <b>Gas</b> <b>Discharge</b> <b>Tube</b> (GDT) is fabricated for use as surge protectors, to limit voltage surges in electrical and electronic circuits.|$|E

The sawtooth shaped oscillation generated has frequency ...|$|E
50|$|The {{father of}} the {{low-pressure}} <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> was German glassblower Heinrich Geissler, who beginning in 1857 constructed colorful artistic cold cathode tubes with different gases in them which glowed with many different colors, called Geissler tubes. It was found that inert gases like the noble gases neon, argon, krypton or xenon, as well as carbon dioxide worked well in tubes. This technology was commercialized by French engineer Georges Claude in 1910 and became neon lighting, used in neon signs.|$|E
50|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon gas also has uses in incandescent and fluorescent lighting, {{and other types of}} <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes.</b> Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser.|$|R
50|$|The {{electronic}} {{vacuum tubes}} invented later around 1906 superseded the Crookes tube. These operate at a still lower pressure, around 10−9 atm (10−4 Pa), at {{which there are}} so few gas molecules that they do not conduct by ionization. Instead, they use a more reliable and controllable source of electrons, a heated filament or hot cathode which releases electrons by thermionic emission. The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes</b> such as thyratrons.|$|R
50|$|While {{the current}} is carried by electrons, the {{positive}} ions {{returning to the}} cathode allow the conduction path to be largely unaffected by the space charge effects which limit the performance of vacuum tubes. Consequently, the valve can carry high currents at low arc voltages (typically 20-30 V) and so is an efficient rectifier. Hot-cathode, <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes</b> such as the thyratron may also achieve similar levels of efficiency but heated cathode filaments are delicate and have a short operating life when used at high current.|$|R
50|$|A mercury-arc valve or mercury-vapor {{rectifier}} or (UK) mercury-arc rectifier {{is a type}} {{of electrical}} rectifier used for converting high-voltage or high-current alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). It {{is a type of}} cold cathode gas-filled tube, but is unusual in that the cathode, instead of being solid, is made from a pool of liquid mercury and is therefore self-restoring. As a result, mercury-arc valves were much more rugged and long-lasting, and could carry much higher currents than most other types of <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{second result}} {{demonstrated}} how energy {{can be made}} to go through space without any connecting wires. The wireless energy transmission effect involves the creation of an electric field between two metal plates, each being connected to one terminal of an induction coil’s secondary winding. A <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> was used as a means of detecting the presence of the transmitted energy. Some demonstrations involved lighting of two partially evacuated tubes in an alternating electrostatic field while held in the hand of the experimenter.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> (GDT) is {{a sealed}} glass-enclosed device {{containing}} a special gas mixture trapped between two electrodes, which conducts electric current after becoming ionized {{by a high}} voltage spike. GDTs can conduct more current for their size than other components. Like MOVs, GDTs have a finite life expectancy, and can handle a few very large transients or {{a greater number of}} smaller transients. The typical failure mode occurs when the triggering voltage rises so high that the device becomes ineffective, although lightning surges can occasionally cause a dead short.|$|E
500|$|Krypton's white {{discharge}} {{is often}} used to good effect in colored <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes,</b> which are simply painted or stained to create the desired color (for example, [...] "neon" [...] type multi-colored advertising signs are often entirely krypton-based). Krypton produces much higher light power than neon in the red spectral line region, and for this reason, red lasers for high-power laser light-shows are often krypton lasers with mirrors that select the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission, rather than the more familiar helium-neon variety, which could not achieve the same multi-watt outputs.|$|R
5000|$|Current {{controlled}} {{negative resistance}} (CCNR, open-circuit stable, or [...] "S" [...] type): In this type, the dual of the VCNR, the voltage {{is a single}} valued function of the current, but the current is a multivalued function of the voltage. In the most common type, with one negative resistance region, the graph is a curve shaped like the letter [...] "S". Devices {{with this type of}} negative resistance include the IMPATT diode, UJT, SCRs and other thyristors, electric arc, and <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes</b> like thyratron tubes, fluorescent lamps and neon lights.|$|R

5000|$|Canal rays, {{also called}} anode rays, were {{observed}} by Eugen Goldstein, in 1886. Goldstein used a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> {{which had a}} perforated cathode. The rays are produced in the holes (canals) in the cathode and travels in a direction opposite to the [...] "cathode rays," [...] which are streams of electrons. Goldstein called these positive rays [...] "Kanalstrahlen" [...] - canal rays. In 1907 a study of how this [...] "ray" [...] was deflected in a magnetic field, revealed that the particles making up the ray were not all the same mass.|$|E
50|$|The Zener diode {{exhibits}} {{an apparently}} similar effect {{in addition to}} Zener breakdown. Both effects are actually present in any such diode, but one usually dominates the other. Avalanche diodes are optimized for avalanche effect so they exhibit small but significant voltage drop under breakdown conditions, unlike Zener diodes that always maintain a voltage higher than breakdown. This feature provides better surge protection than simple Zener diode and acts more like a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> replacement. Avalanche diodes have a small positive temperature coefficient of voltage, where diodes relying on the Zener effect have a negative temperature coefficient.|$|E

40|$|Work on the {{distribution}} of charge and of electric fields in <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tubes</b> has been carried on along various lines since about 1880, three principal methods of experiment being followed, viz: the probe method, cathode ray deflection, and the measurement of the separation of spectral lines in Stark effect photographs. The earliest measurements were made by Hittorf 1; Graham 2, Herz 3, H. A. Wilson 4, and others, all of whom used the probe method.

40|$|Cold cathodes for CO 2 lasers should {{possess a}} very low {{sputtering}} rate, have a minimum of negative ions in the sputtering products, and consume no oxygen. These conditions can be satisfied by selecting cathode materials from those elements of group I in the periodic table which form semiconducting oxide layers and then exposing these elements to a reducing gas mixture.

50|$|Low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps have a {{borosilicate}} glass <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>tube</b> (arc tube) containing solid sodium, {{a small amount}} of neon, and argon gas in a Penning mixture to start the gas discharge. The discharge tube may be linear (SLI lamp) or U-shaped.

These lamps produce a virtually monochromatic light averaging a 589.3 nm wavelength (actually two dominant spectral lines very close together at 589.0 and 589.6 nm). The colors of objects illuminated by only this narrow bandwidth are difficult to distinguish.|$|E

50|$|A more {{reliable}} and controllable method of producing cathode rays was investigated by Hittorf and Goldstein, and rediscovered by Thomas Edison in 1880. A cathode {{made of a}} wire filament heated red hot by a separate current passing through it would release electrons into the tube by a process called thermionic emission. The first true electronic vacuum tubes, invented in 1904, used this hot cathode technique, and they superseded Crookes tubes. These tubes didn't need gas in them to work, so they were evacuated to a lower pressure, around 10−9 atm (10−4 Pa).
