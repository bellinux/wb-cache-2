5|$|Following {{the loss}} of {{territory}} required <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire. This divided {{the resources of the}} country. Furthermore, dams and canals became derelict, and a devastating plague erupted in the western provinces of Iran, killing half of the population along with Kavadh II, who was succeeded by Ardashir III.|$|E
5|$|Although the Duke {{was only}} an {{observer}} at Geertruidenberg, the failed negotiations gave credence to his detractors that he was deliberately prolonging the war for his own profit. Yet it was with reluctance that he returned to campaigning in the spring, capturing Douai in June, before taking Béthune, and Saint-Venant, followed in November by Aire-sur-la-Lys. Nevertheless, support for the pro-war policy of the Whigs had, by this time, ebbed away. The Cabinet had long lacked cohesion and mutual trust (particularly following the Sacheverell affair) when in the summer the plan to break it up, prepared by Harley, was brought into action by the Queen. Sunderland was dismissed in June, followed by Godolphin (who had refused to sever his ties with Sarah) in August. Others followed. The result of the general election in October was a Tory landslide and a victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> policy. Marlborough remained {{at the head of}} the army, however. The defeated Junto, the Dutch, Eugene and the Emperor, implored him to stand by the common cause, while the new ministers, knowing they had to fight another campaign, required him to maintain the pressure on the enemy until they had made their own arrangements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{involved}} in the 1914 Second Battle of Vera Cruz, deploying their Marine contingents as part of the operation. Following the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, both ships were deployed to Europe. Florida was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> negotiations. Utah was assigned to convoy escort duty; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys as they approached the European continent.|$|E

5|$|During 1937 Britten {{composed}} a Pacifist March to words by Ronald Duncan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, {{he had become}} an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. The best known of his compositions from this period is probably Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Committee then {{prepares a}} report {{reflecting}} {{the advice of}} experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions. The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote. A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.|$|E

5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought {{its way through the}} Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern borders. On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. It appeared that the war was over, and arrangements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E
5|$|Except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Prize, the Nobel Prizes are {{presented}} in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures {{are presented}} at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo, Norway, usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events. The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies' are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall, with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall. The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946), at the auditorium of the University of Oslo (1947–1989), and at Oslo City Hall (1990–present).|$|E
5|$|Harclay's {{head was}} on display in London for five years before it was taken down. His sister {{petition}}ed the king to return the {{various parts of the}} body for a Christian burial, and in 1328 her request was granted. Further clemencies were not awarded. In the reign of Edward III, Harclay's nephew Henry petitioned to have the charge of treason annulled, but the petition was ignored. As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> treaty, the wisdom of Harclay's policy was vindicated after his death. Edward II's inability to win the war against the Scots, combined with his refusal to give up his claim on the Scottish crown, proved untenable in the end. Furthermore, it was Harclay's military skills and well-organised forces that gave what little protection the northern borders had over the previous years. Less than three months after Harclay's execution, Edward agreed on a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1918, the Armistice took effect; {{according}} to its terms, eleven battleships and five battlecruisers were to be interned in Scapa Flow {{for the duration of}} negotiations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> treaty. Posen was not among the ships interned, and she was instead decommissioned on 16 December. The ships in Scapa Flow were scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the Allies. As a result, Posen and the other battleships that remained in Germany were seized as replacements for the ships that had been lost. On 5 November, Posen was stricken from the German navy list to be handed over to Great Britain. The ship was transferred on 13 May 1920; on 1 November 1920, she was driven ashore at Hawkcraig, Fife, Scotland. The British subsequently sold Posen to ship-breakers in the Netherlands. She was broken up in Dordrecht in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A. Tripp, {{a psychologist who}} had put CBS {{in touch with his}} patient Larson, claimed that Salant felt the piece was pro-homosexuality. Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature of the subject matter. Commercial spots were filled by public service announcements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Corps and the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E
5|$|In 1071 William {{defeated}} the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed {{by his own}} men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the Treaty of Abernethy, and Malcolm probably gave up his son Duncan as a hostage <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace.</b> Perhaps another stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the Ætheling from Malcolm's court. William then {{turned his attention to}} the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by Fulk le Rechin, the Count of Anjou. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the Ætheling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister Bertha to the king of France, Philip I, who was opposed to Norman power.|$|E
