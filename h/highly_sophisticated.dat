5|$|RAF night fighter defences {{were still}} in their infancy. Most fighters lacked radar and in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, they flew outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences would be <b>highly</b> <b>sophisticated.</b> But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E

Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said that a suicide bomber had detonated himself in the mosque located at {{the opposite side of}} the complex to the seminary. Arshad also said a second suicide bomber had detonated himself in the white-domed mosque. In total, it took 36 hours to fully secure the complex and remove the booby traps.|$|E

The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administrated by the Mongols. This <b>highly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> system {{of communication and}} travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time.

5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out of the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with <b>highly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E
5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. He is also believed to have threatened to shoot down {{the plane of the}} former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas. Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be <b>highly</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere. He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Elastoplastic and {{time-dependent}} {{analysis of}} seismic structures {{has become a}} major analysis technique in popularly accepted performance-based seismic design. However the primary difficulty in using this technique is the lack of a unified criterion in the selection of various intensity indices of ground motions. Various earthquake factors influencing the elastoplastic response of seismic structures are <b>highly</b> <b>sophisticating.</b> Hence it is vitally important to choose an appropriate and comprehensive earthquake intensity index to correlate well to a structural performance. In this study, a total of 30 earthquake intensity indices published in the literature are reviewed and are evaluated through correlation analysis based on 60 ground motion records. Examined herein is the correlation between existing earthquake intensity indices and the seismic responses of elastoplastic SDOF and MDOF systems. The characteristics and applicability of such indices are also discussed in some details, based on which appropriate earthquake intensity indices are recommended. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{proposed in}} this paper in based on an integrated approach for creating a 3 D digital reconstruction of an archaeological site, using extensively the 3 D documentation of the site in its current state, followed by an iterative interaction between archaeologists and digital modelers, leading to a progressive refinement of the reconstructive hypotheses. The starting point of the method is the reality-based model, which, together with ancient drawings and documents, is used for generating the first reconstructive step. Such rough approximation of a possible architectural structure can be annotated through archaeological considerations {{that has to be}} confronted with geometrical constraints, producing a reduction of the reconstructive hypotheses to a limited set, each one to be archaeologically evaluated. This refinement loop on the reconstructive choices is iterated until the result become convincing by both points of view, integrating in the best way all the available sources. The proposed method has been verified on the ruins of five temples in the My Son site, a wide archaeological area located in central Vietnam. The integration of 3 D surveyed data and historical documentation has allowed to support a digital reconstruction of not existing architectures, developing their three-dimensional digital models step by step, from rough shapes to <b>highly</b> <b>sophisticate</b> virtual prototypes. 1.
