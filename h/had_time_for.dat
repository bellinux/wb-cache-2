5|$|NC State {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff {{and returned}} the ball to their 32-yard line. The Wolfpack offense <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> just one play—an eight-yard pass—before {{the end of the}} quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, NC State still held a 2116 lead.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats' second {{possession}} {{of the second half}} was more successful than their first. On the first play of the drive, running back Jacob Ramsey broke free of the Tech defense for a 25-yard run, the longest run of any Cincinnati player in the game. He followed that first-down run by gaining eight more yards on consecutive runs. Pike then ran three yards for a first down at the Tech 44-yard line. There, however, Cincinnati's offense sputtered and could not gain another first down. The Bearcats' punted, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Tech 14-yard line with six seconds remaining in the quarter. The Hokies <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> one play, a 21-yard run by Evans to the Tech 35-yard line. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech had a 13–7 lead over Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} was {{abandoned}} due to rain. Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch. The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman's wicket {{twice in the}} match, causing a media sensation. Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11, the Australian captain's first score on tour below 80. The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40. Australia looked set to concede a lead {{for the first time}} on tour as the hosts reached 3/129, but Johnston (5/49) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire's only innings, which ended on the third morning. With a result impossible, Australia <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> batting practice. Bradman reached 43, and when Hilton came on, the Australian captain, perhaps perturbed by earlier events, attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack. After missing the first two balls, Bradman charged the third, swung and missed, fell over and was stumped. Harvey (76*) and Hamence (49*) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52.|$|E

5|$|Wake's post-score kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. With time running down, Georgia Tech had a chance for a game-winning score if it could sustain a drive into Wake Forest {{territory}} from its own 20-yard line. The drive began with a promising 14-yard completion to Calvin Johnson, but after Reggie Ball threw three incomplete passes, Georgia Tech was forced to punt the ball back to Wake Forest. The Deacons, after getting the ball at their own 20-yard line, began a drive of their own. Riley Skinner completed his first four passes of the drive, including a long 45-yard strike to Willie Idlette for the longest play of the game. With a first down inside the Georgia Tech red zone, the Deacons seemed to be in perfect position for a potentially game-winning touchdown. But as had every other drive previous, Wake Forest's offense failed to cross the goal line. Sam Swank kicked a 22-yard field goal to give the Deacons a 96 lead, but Georgia Tech still <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> one final drive.|$|E
5|$|With {{the energy}} and impetuosity noted by Lang, Henson worked {{continually}} {{over the next seven}} years to improve the parish, restoring the fabric of the church, opening clubs for his parishioners, and holding popular open-air services in the vicarage grounds. At Barking his high-church leanings were welcomed, and he was invited to preach from time to time at St Alban's Holborn, a central London bastion of Anglo-Catholicism. He was never physically strong, and his relentless work at Barking put a strain on his physique. In 1895 he accepted an offer from Lord Salisbury of a less arduous post, the chaplaincy of St Mary's Hospital, Ilford, which he held until 1900. In 1895 and 1896, Henson was select preacher at Oxford, and from 1897 he served as chaplain to John Festing, Bishop of St Albans. He <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> writing; between 1897 and 1900 he published four books, ranging from purely theological studies to analyses of Church politics. His beliefs had changed from his early high-churchmanship to a broad-church latitudinarianism; his 1899 Cui bono? set out his concerns about the strict ritualists in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church.|$|E

25|$|When Scheiner went to Rome in 1624, friends {{asked him}} to write about his solar observations. At last he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{mathematical}} books, among them Galilei’s Il saggiatore, which contains Galileo's work on sunspots. This was similar to Scheiner's own work (unsurprisingly, since both were observing at the same time) but led to allegations from both of plagiarism by the other, and to a deep enmity between the two scientists.|$|E

Stevens's father, George, died in 1957 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, of lung cancer. Stevens and his cousin Patricia moved to Manhattan Beach, California, to live with Patricia's mother, Gladys Swindells. Stevens attended Redondo Union High School, participating in extracurricular activities including working on the school newspaper and becoming {{a member of a}} student theater group, a service society affiliated with the YMCA, and, during his senior year, the Lettermen's Society. Stevens also worked at jobs before and after school, but still <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> surfing with his friend Russell Green, son of the president of Signal Gas and Oil Company, who remained a close friend throughout Stevens's life.|$|E

25|$|From the 1902 season, Johnson began {{appearing}} in County Championship matches for Somerset. His qualification {{for the county}} would {{appear to have been}} fairly flimsy: there is a story, which is also told of a later Somerset cricketer, Tom Lowry, that the county put his birthplace down as Wellington, which was true, without bothering to volunteer that it was not, in fact, the town of that name in Somerset. Employed as a stockbroker, he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> fairly regular appearances in 1902 and 1903, fewer in 1904 and 1905, and then more again in 1906. From then until the First World War, Johnson appeared in only a handful of matches in each season, but for five seasons from 1921 to 1925 he was nearly always in the Somerset side, finally retiring after a few unsuccessful matches in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{students}} were evacuated to the countryside, {{or at least to}} towns outside of the larger and more industrialized cities, many students went to work in factories where unskilled labor was needed under the official “Labor Mobilization Policy” and “Student Mobilization Policy”. In most cases students were genuine volunteers who petitioned their teachers and school principals as a group to allow them to work in factory complexes that could accept them. Students then entered dorms near the factory complex; strict daily schedules ensured that the children woke, cleaned their quarters, ate meals, went to and from their work shifts, and <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> evening hygiene in cohorts. Parents were reluctant to protest because it was believed that the military-funded factories could provide the children with more nourishing meals and because such protests would draw the attention of the secret police and suspicions of disloyalty or subversion.|$|E
25|$|Garry Sobers, the West Indies' {{captain and}} their best cricketer, caused {{controversy}} by {{playing in a}} double-wicket competition in Rhodesia in September 1970. Although Sobers spent only 48 hours in Salisbury, he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a meal with the prime minister, Ian Smith, and described him as a great man to talk to. Sobers' statement and his participation in the tournament gave Caribbean politicians {{an opportunity to make}} clear their hatred of apartheid and racism. The Guyanese prime minister, Forbes Burnham, said Sobers was not welcome in his country until there was an apology. The Jamaican government called for his resignation as captain. The Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, forbade the Indian cricket team to tour the West Indies until the matter was sorted out. Sobers initially argued that he had done nothing wrong as he was a cricketer, not a politician, but ultimately apologised in October 1970 when the scandal threatened to break the West Indies team.|$|E

25|$|Behind the {{two leading}} runners, Ferrari's {{challenge}} for pole position faded {{during the final}} session. Alesi's car {{ground to a halt}} on his first out-lap of the session after losing hydraulic pressure, and he had to share Berger's chassis for the remainder of qualifying. This forced Berger to hurry through his planned programme, making three runs instead of four, before handing his car over to his teammate. The extensive adjustments required to tailor the car's pedal system from Berger to Alesi's preferred set-up meant that he left the pits with only twominutes and 38seconds of the session remaining. Alesi thus <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> just one flying lap, which was spoiled when Irvine crashed his Jordan at Tabac during the final minutes. As a result, Alesi failed to improve on his Thursday time and dropped to fifthplace on the grid, half a second and oneposition behind Berger. The team's problems allowed Coulthard to improve to third place with a time of 1:23.109, continuing his progress as he became more familiar with the circuit. Häkkinen was another driver to be caught out by Irvine's crash {{at the end of the}} session, restricting him to sixthplace on the grid ahead of Herbert, who was satisfied to qualify only a second behind Schumacher. Blundell rounded out the top ten in the second McLaren, despite going up the escape road after missing his braking point at Sainte Dévote. Brundle took eighth and Irvine ninth despite his crash, which meant that all six of the British drivers qualified in the top ten.|$|E

Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed {{as part of a}} five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran." [...] Wesley regards the 2003 invasion of Iraq as [...] "a huge mistake".|$|E

[...] He stated he felt he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> [...] "at least a few more books yet", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask [...] "is there anything I can do?", in this case he would only entertain such offers from [...] "very high-end experts in brain chemistry." [...] Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.|$|E

[...] Weems and his band <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> only one rehearsal before recording the song. [...] Initially, Weems {{did not like the}} song; he decided to omit the lyrics by way of having Tanner whistle instead. [...] While running through the song at rehearsal, someone thought of trying it with a speedier tempo than initially written. It was not a large seller, and the master was filed away. In 1938, Weems was now working with Decca Records and was preparing to make another record. [...] When someone had forgotten to assign a song for the [...] "B" [...] side of the record, Weems and Tanner made another recording of [...] "Heartaches"; the Decca version was not any more successful than the Victor one had been five years earlier.|$|E
500|$|At Geauga Academy, {{which he}} {{attended}} from 1848 to 1850, Garfield learned academic subjects {{he had not}} previously <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>for.</b> He shone as a student, and was especially interested in languages and elocution. [...] He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform [...] "creates some excitement. I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error." [...] Geauga was co-educational, and Garfield was attracted {{to one of his}} fellow students, Lucretia Rudolph, whom he later married. To support himself at Geauga, he worked as a carpenter's assistant and as a teacher. The need to go from town to town to find a place as a teacher disgusted Garfield, and he thereafter developed a dislike of what he called [...] "place-seeking", which became, he said, [...] "the law of my life." [...] In later years, he would astound his friends by letting positions pass that could have been his with a little politicking. Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens underwent a religious awakening, and attended many camp meetings, at one of which he was born again. The next day, March 4, 1850, he was baptized into the Disciples by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River.|$|E
