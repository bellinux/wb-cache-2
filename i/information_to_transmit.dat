50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{terminals}} available to merchants, although most have the same basic purpose and functions. They allow a merchant to insert, swipe, or manually enter the required credit/debit card <b>information,</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> this data to the merchant service provider for authorization and finally, to transfer funds to the merchant. Most newer models not only process credit and debit cards but can also handle gift cards, cheques, and so on. The majority of card terminals transmit data over a standard telephone line or a wired or wireless Internet connection. Some also {{have the ability to}} cache transactional data to be transmitted to the gateway processor when a connection becomes available; the major drawback to this is that immediate authorization is not available at the time the card was processed, which can subsequently result in failed payments. Remote wireless terminals can transmit card data using either cellular or satellite networks.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{overhead}} {{is introduced}} by each connection, as the MAC PDU will not perfectly align to the MAC SDU and padding will be added. It {{is reasonable to}} assume that this adds up, over time, to half of a slot in each direction per bidirectional connection. This is making the conservative estimation that nodes have <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> all the time.

30|$|These {{features}} {{are present in}} many modern systems like a sensor network which has multiple sensors with limited energy connected in a distributed manner to a common receiver. These sensors do not always have <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit,</b> resulting in sporadic data transmission. Another example would be several mobile devices connected to a hotspot (via wifi or even Bluetooth). Due to these features of the network, inter-transmitter communication is not possible and the transmitters are independent decision-makers. Therefore, implementing frequency or time division multiple access becomes harder, and a MAC protocol (with single carrier) is often the preferred or natural method of channel access.|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{telecommunications}} is to adapt the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> to the propagation channel. For frequency selective channels, a technique is to use multi-carrier modulation such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) in which an information block is modulated by a Fourier transform. But {{one of the main}} disadvantages of OFDM is its high PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio). In this paper we propose a method for reducing PAPR using encoding and companding techniques. Companding is used to reduce PAPR while coding is used to reduce the Bit Error Rate (BER). BCH codes and # 956;-law compander have been used for this purpose. The effects of modulation have been studied too...|$|E

In this paper, we define inter/intra-cluster competitive, cooperative, and cognitive behavior in wireless networks. We define intercluster cognitive behavior as simultaneous transmissions by two or more clusters in which some clusters know the messages to be transmitted by other clusters, and so can act as relays or use a Gel'fand-Pinsker coding-like technique to mitigate interference. We construct an achievable region for the inter-cluster behavior of two multiple access channels. In the Gaussian case, we compare our achievable region to that of competitive behavior {{as well as that}} of cooperative behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{different}} view on the broadcast channel that fits better an asynchronous setting, where each receiver can “listen ” to the broadcasted data at different time intervals. In this scenario, there is a “static ” fixed amount of data, {{that needs to be}} transmitted to all receivers. Each receiver wants to minimize the receiving time, and this way get the static data at the highest possible rate. I. CONCEPT DEFINITION In this work we define and analyze static broadcasting. In this broadcasting scenario, the sender has only a fixed common <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> to all receivers.

40|$|Effective risk {{communication}} uses audience members ’ time well by {{providing them with}} {{the information that they}} most need, in a form that they can easily comprehend. Accom-plishing this task can be hard because of problems with both the transmitter and the receiver. The former must determine what is most worth saying. The latter must integrate that message with their often fragmentary mental models of the processes creating and controlling the risks. One strategy for improving communication is to use analytic methods for se-lecting the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit,</b> based on its criticality to recipients ’ decision making. A second strategy for improving communications is adapting the message to the cognitive processes of its recipients.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we show that humans are {{sensitive}} to distributed information. The distributed information used was conveyed by pseudo-patterns. Pseudo-patterns result from injecting random noise into a connectionist network that has previously learned the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit.</b> As pseudo-pattern is a concept related to the recently proposed solution (Robins, 1995; Ans et Rousset, 1997, 2000; French, 1997) {{to the problem of}} catastrophic forgetting in distributed connectionist networks, we briefly review this research field and highlight the relevance of the use of pseudo-patterns in distributed networks. We show that the human brain is sensitive to pseudo-patterns, in the sense that distributed information generated by an external reverberant connectionist system is an efficient learning basis for humans. On this account, we think that new ways are opened in understanding the mechanism(s) of information integration, consolidation and transfer in human memory...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{protocol}} for a large-scale WPCN, named hybrid multiple access-based dual harvest-then-transmit (H-DHT). The H-DHT has a hybrid multiple access structure which employs both time {{division multiple access}} (TDMA) and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA), in order to manage different traffic patterns and requirements of nodes. We assume {{that there are two}} primary traffic patterns in the large-scale WPCN: periodic and non-periodic traffic. Note that transmission reliability is guaranteed for the periodic traffic, but not for the non-periodic traffic. The periodic traffic can be allocated in the TDMA period (TP) for the reliable information transmission, i.e., the time slots in the TP are assigned to each node for their periodic traffic. Especially, we consider that the H-AP can also perform the DL WIT in the TP when the H-AP has <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> (not supported in [11 – 15]). On the other hand, the non-periodic traffic, which is unconstrained from the transmission reliability, is allocated in the CSMA period (CP).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how {{to adapt the}} routing {{according}} to dynamic network conditions in wireless ad hoc networks. We present a method that dynamically chooses routing agent between ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol (AODV) with TCP (endto-end transport) and delay-tolerant networking (DTN) routing and bundle protocol (hop-by-hop transport). We use simulations to confirm that DTN routing and the bundle protocol leads to significantly shorter end-to-end delays and higher message delivery ratios than AODV and end-to-end TCP when the wireless node density is low. However, with high node density, DTN routing, especially epidemic routing, suffers from multiple bundle copies and simultaneous transmissions that lead into collisions and retransmissions at the wireless link (MAC) layer. Thus, we propose a simple adaptive scheme that uses only local <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> the messages from source to destination using either AODV or DTN routing, depending on current node density, message size, and path length to destination...|$|E
