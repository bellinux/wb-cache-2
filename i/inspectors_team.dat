50|$|Prior to {{the first}} IAEA {{inspection}} after the Gulf War, the only known nuclear facilities in Iraq were those at the Al Tuwaitha nuclear center, where nuclear material was being safeguarded. No other facilities were declared in the initial Iraqi statements. That the Tarmiya facility housed a substantial piece of the Iraqi nuclear program was only confirmed after the Gulf War in the early summer of 1991, when the movement there of large saucer-like objects (just prior {{to the first}} IAEA inspection of the site) led to the positive identification of the Iraqi calutron program. Much of the equipment at this site was disassembled unilaterally by Iraq, and the components hidden from IAEA <b>inspector</b> <b>teams.</b> These parts were eventually turned over to IAEA personnel and destroyed in place.|$|R
50|$|The second {{downloadable}} content pack, Private Military Company (PMC), {{adds the}} ability for the player to play as a contractor for a fictional private military company ION.

In this campaign, player assumes the role of ION operative Brian Frost who, along with his team, escorts the UN inspectors through the war-torn Takistan while avoiding any large-scale conflict with multiple warring factions. The team also uncovers a conspiracy into which ION is involved and could have worldwide consequences, if made public, so Frost has to choose between loyalty and morality.British Armed Forces and Private Military Company DLCs were bundled onto DVD and released as an expansion called Arma 2: Reinforcements on 1 April 2011.|$|R

50|$|The {{main feature}} of Tatort {{is that it}} is jointly {{produced}} by all participating regional TV stations: Each of the eleven companies involved (the nine German regional TV channels or Landesrundfunkanstalten that together form ARD, plus ORF in Austria and SRF in Switzerland), produces its own episodes, starring its own police <b>inspector</b> or <b>team</b> of <b>inspectors.</b> The episodes are then fed into a common pool and shown through all participating stations as part of their common programming. This means that if one Tatort features one <b>team</b> of <b>inspectors</b> in one specific city, the next Tatort will play in another city and feature another set of inspectors. Combine this {{with the fact that the}} episodes are, with 90 minutes of length, almost the size of a movie and with the fact that, with rarely more than 30 episodes in one year, the series is broadcast only every other week and you come up with a cultural phenomenon that is closer to a string of made-for-TV movies then your typical run-of-the-mill police series.|$|R

5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and <b>Inspector</b> Detector's <b>team</b> makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|R
5000|$|While POP was {{proving the}} basic concepts, {{construction}} of the test train continued at the Derby lab. The set was sufficiently complete by late 1971 for an official naming ceremony, where it became the APT-E (for Experimental). It made its first low-speed run from Derby to Duffield on 25 July 1972. Upon reaching Duffield, the ASLEF union immediately [...] "blacked" [...] it, forbidding their members from doing any work involving the train. Their complaint was that the APT-E had a single operator's chair, which they took as evidence that BR was moving to single operator trains. A friendly <b>inspector</b> helped the <b>team</b> move the train back to Derby at night. This resulted in a one-day national strike that cost more than the entire APT-E project.|$|R

5000|$|The story {{starts off}} with [...] "Tano Il Greco", a tired mafia boss, making {{a deal with}} Montalbano to stage his arrest in order for him to save face.

At the same time there has also been a seemingly unrelated and mysterious theft of a grocery store delivery truck; the truck is discovered the next morning, abandoned, with the stolen goods still within and intact. An old man, Misucara, who was witness to the robbery then dies in a suspect accident, but not before passing on an odd bit of information to the inspector: that the grocery store owner's car was parked nearby {{during the time of the}} robbery.

40|$|The on-site {{inspection}} provisions in many current and proposed arms control agreements require extensive preparation and {{training on the}} part of both the Inspection <b>Teams</b> (<b>inspectors)</b> and Inspected Parties (hosts). Traditional training techniques include lectures, table-top inspections, and practice inspections. The Augmented Computer Exercise for Inspection Training (ACE-IT), an interactive computer training tool, increases the utility of table-top inspections. ACE-IT is used for training both inspectors and hosts to conduct a hypothetical challenge inspection under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The training covers the entire sequence of events in the challenge inspection regime, from initial notification of an inspection through post-inspection activities. The primary emphasis of the training tool is on conducting the inspection itself, and in particular, implementing the concept of managed access. (Managed access is a technique used to assure the inspectors that the facility is in compliance with the CWC, while at the same time protecting sensitive information unrelated to the CWC.) Information for all of the activities is located in the electronic {open_quotes}Exercise Manual. {close_quotes} In addition, interactive menus are used to negotiate access to each room and to alternate information during the simulated inspection.

Current training techniques include lectures, table-top inspections, and practice inspections. The Augmented Computer Exercise for Inspection Training (ACE-IT), an interactive computer training tool, increases the utility of table-top inspections.

The time interval between notice of intent to inspect a facility and the arrival of inspectors at the facility may be as short as 72 hours. Therefore, advance training is important.

In one incident, a man wearing the insignia of an ARVN lieutenant inquired about the easiest way to get off the firebase because his men wanted to go fishing. He was told the easiest way {{in and out of the}} camp was the south end of the firebase. During the battle, some of the enemy gunfire seemed to come from the ARVN section of the camp. However, one US soldier who was wounded and remained in the ARVN sector for the duration of the fight stated later that he never saw any ARVN firing toward US positions. The ARVN battery was located in the northern sector of the FSB, which was not attacked by the sappers, and this may in part account for their inaction. The 23rd ID's <b>Inspector</b> General (IG) <b>team</b> noted that the northeastern side of the base was [...] "generally untouched, including the Battalion ammunition storage area. The actions of ARVN soldiers were no different from many US soldiers in taking cover until the attack was over."
