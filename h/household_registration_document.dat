30|$|Relaxation of {{policies}} for migrants obtaining <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> in large cities, development of larger metropolitan areas, and establishment of state-level new areas {{have led to}} a significant demand for development of coordinated, multimodal urban rail transit systems.|$|E
30|$|The New National Urbanization Plan [9] {{proposed}} that “the limitations of obtaining a <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> {{in large cities}} {{with a population of}} 1 – 3 million people should be relaxed reasonably” and that “reasonable criteria should be determined for obtaining a <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> in large cities with a population of 3 – 5 million.” This major policy is likely to boost the population of large cities, stimulate demand for public transit, and increase the urgency for developing urban rail transit, which will have a profound impact on urban construction and development of urban rail transit. As some cities, particularly Type II large cities, only have moderate passenger traffic and limited financial resources, {{it is likely that the}} strong demand for low-to-medium capacity and low-cost urban rail transit systems, such as light rail, monorail, and trams, will grow significantly.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} on China’s <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system and rural land transfer, few studies have examined the impact of the <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system on peasants’ willingness to return rural residential land. This paper aims to fill this gap and uses household survey data to measure the impacts of <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system on peasants’ willingness to return rural residential land.

30|$|There {{were several}} {{criteria}} {{used to select}} the respondents. They were required to be undergraduate students studying at Peking University or Tsinghua University {{at the time of}} the interview. Rural respondents had to have rural <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status and have lived in a village (not a small town or county). Their parents also had to have rural <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status, so they could work in or outside the village, but could not have their own shop or company. The urban respondents had to have urban <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status and to have lived in a non-rural area. Their parents had to have urban <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status and could not be peasants.|$|R
50|$|When Taiwan {{was under}} Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, the Japanese {{government}} maintained {{the same system}} of <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> (koseki) {{as they did in}} other parts of the Empire of Japan. This system of <b>household</b> <b>registration,</b> with minor changes, has been continued. Records concerning native Taiwanese are fairly complete. Records of mainlanders date back to the date they first applied for registration with the local <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> office, and are based on information provided by the applicant.|$|R
50|$|Immigration Act Article 9 {{gives the}} list of {{conditions}} under which an NWOHR may apply for a residence permit in Taiwan, including employment, study, and investment. Article 10 gives NWOHRs holding residence permits under some qualifications the right to apply for <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> after {{a certain period of}} residence. Regulations provide further details. Applications for residence permits and <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> by Hong Kong residents and Macau residents are governed by a separate set of regulations. Applications for residence permits and <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> by Mainland Area persons are controlled much more strictly, due to concerns over population growth, economic development, and social stability. An NWOHR who enters with a foreign passport or stateless travel document may not apply for residence or <b>household</b> <b>registration,</b> according to Article 12, unless that person has NWOHR status by consequence of naturalisation or of being born overseas to a national having Taiwan Area <b>household</b> <b>registration.</b> From 1991 to 2001, 141,660 residence permits were granted to NWOHRs, and 215,825 NWOHRs were given permission to establish <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> (thus ending their status as NWOHRs). Unlike the numbers of entrances for short term visits, these numbers have shown an upward trend since 1991, rising from 1,085 and 4,903 respectively in 1991 to 10,820 and 17,048 by 2010.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the {{standard}} deviation of the intercept across prefectures is significantly high (. 28), which justifies the relevance of a random coefficient model. The correlations between the random intercepts and random slopes of occupation and <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> are significantly negative. This means that prefectures with a higher intercept (higher mean scores on log income) {{tend to have a}} flatter slope of occupation and <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> on income. In other words, the effects of occupation and <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> on income are higher when the prefecture has a generally lower level of income.|$|R

The results show that the effect of <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system reform is significant at the 1 % level, which indicates that <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system reform significantly influences farmers’ willingness to transfer rural housing land in the experimental area, leading to an increase in the share of farmers willing to transfer such land by 37 %. In areas with greater efforts to reform the <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system, farmers are more willing to transfer rural housing land. Moreover, the per capita non-farm income of rural households and compensation standard have a significantly positive correlation with farmers’ willingness...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} match with {{previous}} theoretical model analysis, the growth speed of urban population density is used to test China’s urbanization process and observe the relationship between China’s urbanization and service employment, instead of taking the general international practice of urban population proportion as the testing variation, which mostly lies in the large welfare effects implied in the current <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system of China. For one thing, employees, being in the household register of big cities, can enjoy the institutional welfare, namely, education, health, and pension. Therefore, in big cities, especially in such cities with special resources, parts of urban employees are removed outside of the urban population statistical caliber because of the <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system barriers (Zhang et al. 2013). For another, due to the great demolition interest implied in the current Chinese rural land ownership’s transfer system, parts of urban employees with rural <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> {{do not want to}} give up their present registration {{to be a member of}} urban population in the course of industrialization and urbanization. What is more, some with urban <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> would use every possible relation to convert to their original rural <b>household</b> <b>registration,</b> which makes it lower for urban employees taking <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> as statistical caliber and also declines the growth of urbanization measured by the proportion of urban population (Zeng and Xiang, 2013).|$|R

30|$|A large {{proportion}} of people in Hanoi and HCMC are migrants from other areas. In this study, we define migrants as {{those who do not}} have a <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> book (called Ho Khau in Vietnamese) in Hanoi or HCMC. The <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> system has been implemented in Vietnam since 1964 to manage public security and population movement (Demombynes and Vu 2016). According to this system, a person has to register his/her residence in an local areas and is provided with a <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> book of that area (a permanent residence permission in that area). In other words, a <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> book is a statement that household members are permanent residents in one location. Having a registration book in an area, people are more easily to have access to social services such as education and health insurance in that area.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to residential areas, <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status {{can also be}} used to determine urban/rural areas. This study used residential area to distinguish rural from urban for two main reasons. First, migrants from rural to urban areas differ systematically from the left-behind, and their concepts of marriage and childbearing may change because of their urban experiences. Thus, merging them with those who remain in rural areas may not be appropriate. Second, defining urban/rural according to <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> can bring ambiguities in the operationalization because the husband and wife may each have a different <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status. For couples living in two separate places, especially people who have been divorced, we only have information from the individual answering the questionnaire, which makes it difficult to operationalize. In order to test sensitivity, we also repeated the analysis by using <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> status to distinguish rural from urban and found that the results are consistent.|$|R

Under Article 8(3) for official and diplomatic passports or 9(1)(2) for ordinary passports, persons without <b>household</b> <b>registration</b> are exempted from the requirement to present a national identification card when applying for a passport. Article 31 governs the Chinese name which may appear on an ROC passport held by an NWOHR; in contrast, other nationals' passports simply use the same name which appears on their identification card. Under 28(1)(5), the identification card number will appear on the passport only for persons having <b>household</b> <b>registration.</b> Thus NWOHRs' passports do not have an identification card number.|$|R
