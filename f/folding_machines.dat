5000|$|A {{folding machine}} is a machine used {{primarily}} for the folding of paper. Paper can be folded with either a buckle or a knife; thus, there are generally three types of folding machines: buckle folders, knife folders {{or a combination of}} these two types. Whilst buckle folding is the more popular of the two methods, knife folding is sometimes preferable. Folding machine models vary in sophistication, with [...] machines capable of processing more complex folding jobs and unusual paper forms (in terms of density and size). Organizations required to undertake mass mail-out campaigns often employ <b>folding</b> <b>machines</b> to improve efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Located {{about a mile}} west of the village, on Holmesville Hill Road, a {{congregation}} built a church in 1826. At {{that time it was}} named the [...] "Free Will Baptist Church". That church building was later abandoned as the congregation built a new facility in the village. The new Church was named the Holmesville Baptist Church. The Church used a small school house, located across the main road, for Sunday School classes. By 1968 the church had torn down the old school house and built a new facility, which stands at the present. The former building was sold to AutoMecha - a company that manufactured paper <b>folding</b> <b>machines.</b> After a few years of operation, the AutoMecha building burned to the ground and the owner, a Mr. Brown, sold the vacant property back to the Church for $1.00 with the understanding that the Church would remove the remains of the building.|$|E
50|$|Over time, the proteostasis network becomes {{burdened}} with proteins modified by {{reactive oxygen species}} and metabolites that induce oxidative damage. These byproducts can react with cellular proteins to cause misfolding and aggregation (especially in nondividing cells like neurons). This risk is particularly high for intrinsically disordered proteins. The IGFR-1 pathway {{has been shown in}} C. elegans to protect against these harmful aggregates, and some experimental work has suggested that upregulation of insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR-1) may stabilize proteostatic network and prevent detrimental effects of aging. Expression of the chaperome, the ensemble of chaperones and co-chaperones that interact in a complex network of molecular <b>folding</b> <b>machines</b> to regulate proteome function, is dramatically repressed in human aging brains and in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Functional assays in C. elegant and human cells have identified a conserved chaperome sub-network of 16 chaperone genes, corresponding to 28 human orthologs as a proteostasis safeguard in aging and age-onset neurodegenerative disease.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of our}} {{teaching}} in the Departments of Fabrication and Transport Engineering in the Dublin Institute of Technology we use industrial metal <b>folding</b> <b>machines</b> to help students to learn the sequencing of folds on manufactured sheet metal components. Many students have difficulty visualising the folding sequences required to complete practical manufacturing assignments. This paper details the digital media resource which was developed {{to provide students with}} the opportunity to offer a proposed solution to questions which relate to the folding sequence required for these components. Feedback is provided through the medium of pre recorded videos which show the component being folded using the folding sequence the student has suggested. If the folding sequence the student has suggested is correct they are guided to a video which shows the successful folding of the component. If the folding sequence the student has suggested is incorrect they are guided to video which highlights the errors and provides guidance of on the criteria for the selection of the correct bend sequence. The students can access this resource at any time to practice and perfect their ability to sequence folds correctly. A student survey was carried out and the data was analyzed.

40|$|The 2010 Gordon Conference on Single-Molecule Approaches to Biology {{focuses on}} {{cutting-edge}} research in single-molecule science. Tremendous technical developments {{have made it}} possible to detect, identify, track, and manipulate single biomolecules in an ambient environment or even in a live cell. Single-molecule approaches have changed the way many biological problems are addressed, and new knowledge derived from these approaches continues to emerge. The ability of single-molecule approaches to avoid ensemble averaging and to capture transient intermediates and heterogeneous behavior renders them particularly powerful in elucidating mechanisms of biomolecular machines: what they do, how they work individually, how they work together, and finally, how they work inside live cells. The burgeoning use of single-molecule methods to elucidate biological problems is a highly multidisciplinary pursuit, involving both force- and fluorescence-based methods, the most up-to-date advances in microscopy, innovative biological and chemical approaches, and nanotechnology tools. This conference seeks to bring together top experts in molecular and cell biology with innovators in the measurement and manipulation of single molecules, and will provide opportunities for junior scientists and graduate students to present their work in poster format and to exchange ideas with leaders in the field. A number of excellent poster presenters will be selected for short oral talks. Topics as diverse as single-molecule sequencing, DNA/RNA/protein interactions, <b>folding</b> <b>machines,</b> cellular biophysics, synthetic biology and bioengineering, force spectroscopy, new method developments, superresolution imaging in cells, and novel probes for single-molecule imaging will be on the program. Additionally, the collegial atmosphere of this Conference, with programmed discussion sessions as well as opportunities for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings in the beauty of the Il Ciocco site in Tuscany, provides an avenue for scientists from different disciplines to interact and brainstorm and promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations directed toward compelling biological problems...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{little is}} known either about the {{physical}} interactions of heat shock protein 10 (Hsp 10) with other proteins within the cell or its involvement in signal transduction pathways. Hsp 10 has been considered mainly as a partner of Hsp 60 in the Hsp 60 / 10 protein <b>folding</b> <b>machine.</b> Only recently, Hsp 10 was reported to interact with proteins involved in deoxyribonucleic acid checkpoint inactivation, termination of M-phase, messenger ribonucleic acid export, import of nuclear proteins, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and pheromone signaling pathways.
