These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the <b>flexural</b> <b>strength</b> of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study on <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> of masonry using various blocks {{in combination with}} different mortars. <b>Flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> of masonry has been determined by testing stack-bonded prisms using a modified bond wrench test set-up.

Increases in mortar strength lead to increased <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> for cement mortar, irrespective {{of the type of}} masonry unit. It has been found that combination mortars, such as soil-cement mortar and cement-lime mortar, lead to better bond strength compared to cement mortars. The moisture content of the masonry unit at the time of casting has displayed significant influence on the <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> of the masonry.

30|$|Although {{the effect}} of fatigue {{conditions}} on <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> of ceramics to basic metal and gold alloys has been verified by several studies [13, 14, 16, 17, 21 – 23], there is no investigation concerning about the combined effect of a bonding agent and the thermo-mechanical cycling on the bond strength of dental ceramics to metal alloys. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the in vitro influence of a bonding agent and thermo-mechanical cycling on the <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> between a ceramic and a gold or cobalt-chromium alloy. The study hypotheses were that alloy types produce similar <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> values, the bonding agent increases the <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> between ceramic and metal, and thermo-mechanical cycling reduces <b>flexural</b> bond <b>strength</b> values.|$|R
25|$|PMMA is an {{economical}} {{alternative to}} polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, <b>flexural</b> <b>strength,</b> transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance {{are more important}} than impact strength, chemical resistance and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.|$|E
2500|$|C'b is a {{modification}} factor {{used in the}} equation for nominal <b>flexural</b> <b>strength</b> when determining lateral-torsional buckling.

C'b is always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For cantilevers or overhangs where the free end is unbraced, Cb is equal to 1. Tables of values of C'b for simply supported beams exist.|$|E
2500|$|Strength of {{materials}} {{is defined as}} the maximum stress that can be endured before fracture occurs. Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In brittle materials like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to tensile loading, [...] unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength {{of materials}}, such as the bending flexural test, the biaxial <b>flexural</b> <b>strength</b> test and the weibull approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal sintering and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability, [...] rather than high strength.|$|E

This paper investigates the flexural performance of various SFRC mixes using RTSF and two types of Manufactured Steel Fibres (MSF). The post-cracking <b>flexural</b> <b>strengths</b> of these mixes are obtained using 3 -point notched prism tests. A simplified equation is proposed to determine the relationship between the post-cracking <b>flexural</b> tensile <b>strength</b> and required SFRC ground-supported slabs thicknesses. It is found that the required slab thicknesses largely depend on f, a single coefficient obtained from the post-cracking <b>flexural</b> <b>strengths</b> of SFRC. In all SFRC mixes, the lowest required slab thickness is obtained when using hybrid fibre reinforcement containing 10 kg/m 3 of RTSF. It is concluded that hybrid fibres using RTSF can be a competitive and environmentally-friendly alternative for industrial concrete flooring applications...|$|R

A modular die was designed and manufactured to produce rod shaped products of various diameters. The induced pressure was also recorded. Tests on tensile and <b>flexural</b> <b>strengths</b> were carried out and bulk densities were measured. The results illustrate that an increase in die pressure significantly increases the strength of the product accompanied with a decrease in porosity and an increase in bulk density.

It {{is extremely}} important that UHTCs are able to retain high bending strength and hardness at high temperatures (above 2000 °C). UHTCs generally exhibit hardness above 20 GPa due to the strong covalent bonds present in these materials. However, the different methods of processing UHTCs can lead to great variation in hardness values. UHTCs exhibit high <b>flexural</b> <b>strengths</b> of > 200 MPa at 1800 °C, and UHTCs with fine-grained particles exhibit higher <b>flexural</b> <b>strengths</b> than UHTCs with coarse grains.

This is due to material densification and a reduction in grain size upon processing.|$|R

One major factor influencing the <b>flexural</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> of denture base resins is the processing technique used.

50|$|The <b>flexural</b> <b>{{strength}}</b> {{would be}} the same as the tensile strength if the material were homogeneous. In fact, most materials have small or large defects in them which act to concentrate the stresses locally, effectively causing a localized weakness. When a material is bent only the extreme fibers are at the largest stress so, if those fibers are free from defects, the <b>flexural</b> <b>strength</b> will be controlled by the strength of those intact 'fibers'. However, if the same material was subjected to only tensile forces then all the fibers in the material are at the same stress and failure will initiate when the weakest fiber reaches its limiting tensile stress. Therefore, it is common for flexural strengths to be higher than tensile strengths for the same material. Conversely, a homogeneous material with defects only on its surfaces (e.g., due to scratches) might have a higher tensile strength than <b>flexural</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

The hydration behavior was followed by estimation of free lime (FL) and combined water content at different curing ages. The required water for standard consistency, setting times and compressive strength was also determined. The results obtained were confirmed by XRD, DTA, IR and SEM techniques. The required water for standard consistency and setting times increases with NS content due {{to the presence of}} 1 % of superplasticizer.
