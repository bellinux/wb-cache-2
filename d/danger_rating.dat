Every day during the fire season the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecasts an outlook of the Fire Danger Index (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation.

40|$|Wandering {{behaviour}} {{is regarded}} as one of the most difficult to manage for Caregivers of persons with Dementia. It also results in a lot of stress and burden for all caregivers involved, since this behaviour can result in injuries and getting lost. In this research we are proposing a tool which utilizes the currently available Smart Mobile Technologies to focus on the patients’ wandering patterns whilst identifying any possible dangers pertaining to the patient. A number of findings have been collected from this research tool, through a number of studies with both formal and informal caregivers and patients at the St. Vincent de Paul Elderly Nursing Home. These findings primarily relate to: (1) The benefits which caregivers perceive when being alerted of danger relating to their patients and (2) the need for further understanding this research area through the collected data. Caregivers are also given the opportunity to give their feedback on a patient’s exposure to danger, thus creating a cooperative environment between caregivers of the same patient. Preliminary tests have shown how this system achieves an 89 % specificity to <b>danger</b> <b>rate,</b> which defines the statistical performance of a binary classification test, together with showing how caregivers find this system as a positive way of reducing their burden when caring for wandering patients. peer-reviewe...|$|R

This technology of quality assessment of first circuit pipe welds during in-service inspection at some Russian NPP was accepted from the beginning 1997. The technology consists of three stages. At the first stage the conventional ultrasonic inspection is performed according to the up-date testing rules. At the second stage the expert testing of flaw areas detected at the first stage is performed. The result of the expert testing is the determination of real flaw parameters. For this purpose the Augur system with FT-SAFT treatment is used. At the third stage the strength specialists calculate the <b>danger</b> <b>rate</b> of detected flaws and its affect on the weld strength and residual resource. During {{the last four years}} (1997 - 2001) the 853 welds were inspected using the technology. All welds should to be repaired according to the old testing technology. 532 welds were allowed for further exploitation because they meet strength requirements. It was repaired 93 welds. All these welds after expert testing are monitored periodically. It allows to reduce ungrounded expensive weld repair significantly without decrease of operation safety. On the other hand, the reliability of most dangerous flaw detection such as cracks was increased. The accuracy of flaw height measurements for initial and repeated NDT is discussed.

After the possibility of achievement of the remedial goals of punishments was questioned and the necessity of criminal justice system's expense control was clear, the atmosphere for the appearance of the administrative approaches in criminal justice domain was prepared. In this approach, the crime is considered a common and normal behavior in the society and the criminals are categorized and managed based on the <b>danger</b> <b>rate</b> and the crime repetition possibility. Iran's criminal legislation system, in spite of the lack of the necessary infrastructures for evaluation and management of the crime danger in different rules and regulations, has approached the issue unsystematically. The dangerous state possesses two aspects: the criminal aspect which implies condition produced in the person by the coincidence of the crime factors, and the social compatibility which means one's compatibility and sociability level. But, recently, what inferred from the rules and regulations is the change of the dangerous state concept and act upon this concept in order to manage the crime commitment danger in the different levels of the criminal justice system which intends to manage and control the endangered groups and supply the public security putting aside the diagnosis and treatment of the positivist approach.

Psychopathy rating accuracy improved as rater extroversion-sociability and agreeableness increased and when neuroticism and lifestyle and antisocial characteristics decreased.
