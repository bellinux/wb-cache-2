25|$|The former East German side Berliner FC Dynamo laid {{claim to}} the three stars of a 10-time champion.

Dynamo eventually took {{matters into their own}} hands and emblazoned their jerseys with three stars. This caused some debate <b>given</b> <b>what</b> may be the tainted nature of their championships under the patronage of East Germany's secret police, the Stasi. The issue also affects other former East German and pre-Bundesliga champions. In November 2005, the DFB allowed all former champions to display a single star inscribed with the number of titles, including all German men's titles since 1903, women's titles since 1974 and East German titles.|$|E
25|$|Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón (September 7, 1839 – September 30, 1917) was {{a career}} Spanish naval officer who {{commanded}} the restored Kingdom of Spain's Pacific Squadron {{based in the}} Philippines during the Spanish–American War.

Montojo became known for his defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay (1 May 1898) by U.S. Navy Admiral George Dewey, being a decisive naval battle of the war. After the conflict, the rear admiral was held accountable for the defeat and was court-martialed, but that was later overturned, though Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.|$|E

25|$|Chamberlain was {{commissioned}} a lieutenant {{colonel in the}} 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. He became commander of the regiment in June 1863. On July 2, during the Battle of Gettysburg, Chamberlain's regiment occupied the extreme left of the Union lines at Little Round Top. Chamberlain's men withstood repeated assaults from the 15th Regiment Alabama Infantry and finally drove the Confederates away with a bayonet charge. Chamberlain was severely wounded while commanding a brigade during the Second Battle of Petersburg in June 1864, and was <b>given</b> <b>what</b> {{was intended to be}} a death bed promotion to brigadier general. In April 1865, he fought at the Battle of Five Forks and was given the honor of commanding the Union troops at the surrender ceremony for the infantry of Robert E.

25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, <b>given</b> <b>what</b> A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{theories}} of the ultimate cause of the singer's death persist to this day (including a few rather sinister ones), <b>given</b> <b>what</b> is now known about cardiovascular disease, {{it seems likely that}} by {{the time of his death}} Vysotsky had an advanced coronary condition brought about by years of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his grueling work schedule and the stress of the constant harassment by the government. Towards the end, most of Vysotsky's closest friends had become aware of the ominous signs and were convinced that his demise was only a matter of time. Clear evidence of this can be seen in a video ostensibly shot by the Japanese NHK channel only months before Vysotsky's death, where he appears visibly unwell, breathing heavily and slurring his speech. Accounts by Vysotsky's close friends and colleagues concerning his last hours were compiled in the book by V. Perevozchikov.|$|E

25|$|For the 11years before Davie, the Irish were {{coached by}} Lou Holtz. Holtz, who, it was reported, had {{returned}} {{the program to}} excellence, led the team to a national championship in 1988 and had been <b>given,</b> <b>what</b> was reported to be, a lifetime contract by Notre Dame. By his final season, 1996, Holtz had tallied 92wins to put him third on the all-time Notre Dame wins list (only behind Ara Parseghian with 95wins and Knute Rockne with 105wins). Throughout the season there was speculation that Holtz, who passed Parseghian's mark, would retire rather than break Rockne's record, and on November 19, a week before his final home game at Notre Dame, {{it was revealed that}} he turned in his letter of resignation to the Notre Dame administration. In his final game at Notre Dame Stadium, where the team shut-out Rutgers 62–0, Holtz got his 100th and final win for the Irish. The Notre Dame administration didn't look far for Holtz's replacement, as their defensive coordinator, Bob Davie, who was hired by Holtz three years previous, was named as his replacement.|$|E
500|$|Under Burton's direction, Broyles wrote another draft, but his {{script was}} {{projected}} at a $200 million budget. Fox {{wanted to cut}} it to $100 million. In August 2000, two months before principal photography, Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites. Broyles [...] "had {{a lot of respect}} with the work they [...] did. And to think that <b>given</b> <b>what</b> I'd done and <b>given</b> <b>what</b> Tim wanted, they navigated the right course." [...] One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash-landing at Yankee Stadium, witnessing apes playing baseball. Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one. The production of Planet of the Apes was a difficult experience for Burton. This was largely contributed by Fox's adamant release date (July 2001), which meant that everything from pre-production to editing and visual effects work was rushed.|$|E

Jardine was personally incapable of reacting to the crowds or responding to the controversy in a way that would have eased tensions, and so was not a good choice as captain <b>given</b> <b>what</b> the selectors already knew of him.
