The ladies were shocked, and my husband was censured for letting me 'faire l'Anglaise,' but we were young and full of spirits, and the being thus thrown on each other had {{put an end to}} his {{timidity}} towards me. He did indeed blush up to his curls, and hold himself as upright as a ramrod, when satire was directed to us as Celadon and Chloe; but he never took any other notice of it, nor altered his behaviour in consequence. Indeed, we felt like children escaping from school when we crept down the stairs in early morning, and hand-in-hand repaired to the church in time for the very earliest mass among the peasants, who left their scythes at the door, and the women with their <b>hottes,</b> or their swaddled babies at their backs. We would get a cup of milk and piece of barley-bread at some cottage, and wander among the orchards, fields, or vineyards before Mesdames had begun their toiles; and when we appeared at the dejeuner, the gentlemen would compliment me on my rouge au naturel, and the ladies would ironically envy my English appetite.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the midst}} of World War II there is a report that the {{assembly}} of Montevideo was dissolved in early 1945 but was re-established by summer 1945. Barton was joined by pioneer Flora <b>Hottes</b> in early 1946. A regional committee to coordinate efforts and build unity and familiarity in regions leading to regional national assemblies were appointed in 1946 - Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay were in one such committee's jurisdiction. Retrospectively, a stated purpose for the regional committee was to facilitate {{a shift in the}} balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. The second South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in Santiago, Chile, in January, 1948 with Uruguayan delegate Gambeta Roldan. When the regional national assembly of South America was elected the members included Rangvald Taetz of Uruguay. By 1950 there was still the one assembly in Uruguay. In 1956 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo hosted the sixth convention to elect the regional assembly of South America. The regional assembly was reorganized in 1957 to be made up of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay & Bolivia; one member was Roberto Cazcarra of Montevideo. In early 1958 the Bahá'ís of Montevideo held their first summer school and in the fall of 1959 eighteen Bahá'ís gathered for a conference to discuss the progress of the religion in Uruguay. In December 1959 the Montevideo newspaper El País covered a presentation on Israel, which mentioned the Bahá'í Faith. In spring 1960 Hand of the Cause William Sears visited the Bahá'ís in Minas. In late 1960 the secretary of the regional assembly, Chilean Salvador Tormo, {{died in a plane crash}} in Uruguay. In 1961 each country of the regional assembly elected its own National Spiritual Assembly - Uruguay's was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, `Alí-Akbar Furútan. The members of the first Uruguayan national assembly were: Leopolda Caraballo, Else Cazcarra, Roberto Cazcarra, Mary Dutra, Francisco Flores, Elena Caraballo, Mario Regina Marius, Carola Escofet, and Edward Belcher. By 1963 there were Local Spiritual Assemblies also in Maldonado, and Minas, and a smaller group in Juan Lacaze (see List of cities in Uruguay.) ...|$|E

40|$|From 1996 to 2002 {{the monthly}} {{litterfall}} in a Quercus suber forest ecosystem of Montseny (NE Spain) was recorded {{and its relationship}} to meteorological variables was statistically analysed. The average annual production (477 g m− 2 yr− 1) was similar to those found in other Mediterranean evergreen forests with relatively high rainfall. The main components were the leaves (55 % of the total biomass), followed by acorns (22 %) and twigs (16 %). Litter production was highest during May and June, when the majority of the old leaves fell. When themeteorological conditions were favourable, a second leaf fall collection was observed. Acorn production in 2001 was about nine times that of the previous years, indicating a mast year. In general, the different litterfall components were highly correlated in time except for the acorns. Interannual covariation was significant for leaves/twigs and leaves/catkins. Catkins were the most variable component with also strong seasonality, acorns were also very variable with low seasonality, while leaves were less variable and with the strongest seasonality. After accounting for seasonal covariation, there were significant effects of rainfall on twig litterfall and of temperature on leaf litterfall, the years with highest leaf litterfall being the <b>hottes...</b>|$|E

The aphid Amphorophora agathonica <b>Hottes</b> (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is an important virus vector in red (Rubus idaeus L.) and black (Rubus occidentalis L.) raspberries in North America. Raspberry resistance to A. agathonica {{in the form of a}} single dominant gene named Ag 1 has been relied upon to help control aphid-transmitted plant viruses; however, the mechanism of resistance to the insect is poorly understood. Aphid feeding was monitored using an electrical penetration graph on the resistant red raspberry `Tulameen' and compared with a susceptible control, `Vintage'. There were no differences in pathway feeding behaviors of aphids as they moved toward the phloem. Once in the phloem, however, aphids feeding on resistant plants spent significantly more time salivating than on susceptible plants, and ingested significantly less phloem sap. This suggests that a mechanism for resistance to A. agathonica is located in the phloem. Reduced ingestion of phloem may result in inefficient acquisition of viruses and is a likely explanation for the lack of aphid-transmitted viruses in plantings of resistant cultivars...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by the Entomological Society of America and can be found at: [URL] agathonica (<b>Hottes)</b> is the primary vector of aphid-transmitted viruses in red raspberry in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. To better understand the biology of the aphid, we estimated the lower developmental threshold and studied the seasonal activity of A. agathonica in commercial fields in northern Washington state. In addition, we monitored the spread of raspberry viruses (raspberry latent virus and raspberry leaf mottle virus, RLMV) to determine how rapidly fields became infected and whether there was a relationship between aphid presence and infection. The lower developmental threshold of A. agathonica was estimated to be 2. 7 °C. In the field, apterous and alate aphid populations began rapidly increasing at ≈ 800 growing degree-days and peaked at 1, 050 growing degree-days. RLMV spread rapidly, with 30 – 60 % of plants in four different commercial fields testing positive after three growing seasons. There was no discernible relationship between the presence or abundance of aphids based on 10 leaves sampled per plant location, and the odds of that plant becoming infected with RLMV...|$|E
