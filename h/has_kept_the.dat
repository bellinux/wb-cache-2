5|$|In his ghostly form, Frank {{confronts the}} Grim Reaper and discovers {{that he is}} the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a {{psychiatric}} hospital orderly who killed twelve people 30 years earlier, before being captured, convicted and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like Charles Starkweather. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia <b>has</b> <b>kept.</b> <b>The</b> pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to Hell.|$|E
