5|$|For its slender body, {{the black}} mamba is deceptively powerful; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> moving snake {{indigenous}} to Africa, {{and perhaps the}} fastest anywhere. It does however, move rather clumsily over soft sand, a surface {{to which it is}} not adapted.|$|E

This performance broke his previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200 metres title.|$|E
5|$|Spain's {{success at}} Euro 2008 saw the nation qualify as European champions for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, the curtain-raiser for the 2010 FIFA World Cup {{to be held}} in South Africa. Torres scored three goals at the tournament, a hat-trick in Spain's 5–0 win over New Zealand on 14 June. His treble, which was scored within 11 minutes from kick-off, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> hat-trick scored in the competition's history.

5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into three {{separate}} scenarios, with each one surrounding the story of the three main characters: Terra, Aqua and Ventus. While the first ten minutes of the story are the same regardless of which character is chosen, the events that follow differ in each scenario, with each character's narrative occurring parallel to the others. The gameplay of each scenario differs based on the abilities of each character such as their power, speed and magic: Terra is the most powerful in terms of physical damage, Ventus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> character and Aqua specializes in magic. Players may choose which of the three scenarios they wish to start with near the beginning of the game. The recommended scenario order of play by Nomura is Terra, followed by Ventus, and lastly Aqua, allowing the player to best understand the story. Completing all three scenarios will unlock the story's final chapter.|$|E
50|$|Muller led {{the opening}} free {{practice}} session with Huff and Alain Menu behind {{making it a}} Chevrolet 1-2-3.

5|$|Jayawardene's debut Test {{match was}} against India in August 1997, {{in which the}} Sri Lankan team made a world record 952 runs for 6 wickets. He scored his maiden Test century in his fourth match, played in June 1998 against New Zealand. The 150 he scored against Bangladesh in September 2001 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> Test century made by a Sri Lankan player. However, this innings came to an unusual end when he retired out just after {{reaching}} 150 runs. Jayawardene's best innings was made against South Africa in July 2006 when he scored 374 runs, surpassing Sanath Jayasuriya's record of 340 for the highest individual score by a Sri Lankan batsman. It is also the fourth-highest score in Test cricket, as well {{as part of the}} world's highest Test partnership—624 runs—which he established with teammate Kumar Sangakkara. Jayawardene has scored a total of 34 centuries during his career, the second highest number by a Sri Lankan player, after Kumar Sangakkara. He has scored more than 200 runs on seven of these occasions. This is the second-highest number of double centuries by a Sri Lankan player, behind Kumar Sangakkara. He is also one of only three players who have scored a triple century for Sri Lanka; the other two being Jayasuriya and Sangakkara.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August 2010, Chamakh scored {{his first}} Premier League goal with a header against Blackpool. In the same match, {{he won a}} penalty when he was fouled by Ian Evatt, which Andrey Arshavin {{subsequently}} converted in a 6–0 win for Arsenal. In his third start in four games, Chamakh scored the team's second goal against Bolton Wanderers in a 4–1 victory. On 15 September, in his first Champions League match for the club, he scored the third goal in a 6–0 win against Portuguese club Braga. Two weeks later, Chamakh scored his second Champions League goal for Arsenal against Serbian outfit Partizan. The goal was his seventh goal in eight Champions League matches. Following the international break, Chamakh continued his solid form, scoring the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Birmingham City. Three days later, he scored his eighth goal in nine Champions League matches against Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk in a 5–1 rout. On 10 November, Chamakh scored both goals in a midweek victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He scored the opening goal 37seconds into play, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> league goal scored in the club's history. The previous record was held by Thierry Henry, who scored a goal after 58seconds for Arsenal against Reading on 22 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{first player}} {{to score a}} century in the tournament was Pakistan's Moin-ul-Atiq, who made 105 against Bangladesh in the third edition (1988). In the same match, his team mate Ijaz Ahmed scored 124 not out. India's Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar were the lone centurions of the 1990 and 1995 tournaments, respectively. The 2008 edition saw 13 centuries—the highest for a tournament—while no centuries were made in 1986 and 1988. Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya holds the record for most number of centuries, with six, {{followed}} by his compatriot Kumar Sangakkara, who has made four. Virat Kohli (India) and Shoaib Malik (Pakistan) follow these two with three centuries each. Sangakkara's three centuries in the 2008 tournament is a record for a single edition. Pakistani batsman Shahid Afridi made two centuries in the 2010 edition while playing as a captain, {{the most in the}} tournament history. His second century, which came against Bangladesh when he made 124 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> in terms of balls faced in Asia cup matches. Kohli's 183 against Pakistan in 2012 is the highest individual score as of 2014. Lahiru Thirimanne's (Sri Lanka) 108 against Pakistan in the final of the 2014 edition is the most recent century.|$|E

5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E
