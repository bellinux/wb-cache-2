40|$|Both the European Union (EU) and the Member States {{individually}} use techno-economic modelling {{studies to}} analytically underpin the <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> of proposed low-carbon strategies. As these studies vary in depth, focus, {{and degree of}} embedment into policy design, we systematically look into the differences by comparing the long-term perspectives toward 2050 for five EU countries (respectively Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom). The study draws out insights on how <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> efforts are mobilised and whether the national approaches {{are consistent with the}} long-term European policy objectives for 2050. The comparative analysis consists of a qualitative comparison of (1) the governance of <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> in long-term policy planning processes, (2) the distribution of knowledge and skills for <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation,</b> and (3) the inclusion of (public) stakeholders. In a second step we conduct a quantitative comparison of national model-based <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> studies by assessing (1) their alignment to communicated long-term ambitions and (2) the relative differences. We find a high diversity in national configurations on planning towards 2050, for instance regarding the degree of institutional embedding (e. g. by the presence or lack thereof of climate regulations and monitoring and advising organisations) and the distribution and utilisation of model-based <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> efforts. Interestingly, while the national <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> studies provided insights into the required domestic action, very little attention was given to the alignment of domestic policies with European or global mitigation ambitions. This study concludes with several areas in which <b>ex-ante</b> policy <b>evaluation</b> could be strengthened...|$|R

This paper presents approaches to implementing state-of-the-art evaluations in rural electrification projects, taking into account specific challenges that researchers face in such interventions. Furthermore, it suggests a particular approach to assess impacts before an intervention is implemented by surveying the yet non-electrified target region of the project and, in addition, an already electrified region. Besides delivering robust evidence on impacts, results from such <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> provide insights for the project design, thereby reducing the gap between evaluation researchers and practitioners.

Researchers have generally relied on <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> models to fine-tune existing CCTs or to design new ones. One of the main pitfalls is 'targeted modelling', in which results of counterfactual simulations might be driven by model features rather than the policy objectives. This paper uses the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> technique of Bourguignon et al., relaxes one of its assumptions, and simulates policy changes {{at the national level}} for the Mexican CCT.

Finally, combining hazard and vulnerability levels by using a GIS-based toolbox, the EAD to an urban area is obtained. The proposed model is then tested in a residential urban area of the municipality of Olbia in Italy, which was damaged by the extraordinary flood on November 2013. The comparison, between the ex-post assessed damage and the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> based on the application of the model, enables to verify high reliability of the results obtained...|$|E

30|$|Besides, {{innovative}} and well-grounded decision-support systems (DSS) {{are necessary to}} deal with the complexity characterising UFT environment and participatory decision-making. Three elements are fundamental and strictly interlaced to make a DSS effective and efficient: data, models and simulations. Understanding, predicting and interpreting stakeholders’ behaviours to policy interventions requires data and models to produce suitable hypothetical scenarios simulations and <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> of their likely acceptability and effects. Under this respect, an innovative approach promotes the combination of disaggregate behavioural freight models (e.g. discrete choice models - DCMs), and dynamic simulations (e.g. agent-based modelling - ABM). In fact, while DCMs can adequately elicit stakeholders’ individual preferences based on sound microeconomic theory [9, 22, 23], ABMs can simulate and reproduce interaction in a participatory decision-making process where stakeholders can influence each other’s decisions [24 – 26].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology of R&D&I project <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> for the Brazilian electric power sector using a multi-criteria tool focused on risk. The R&D {{process in the}} Brazilian electric power industry is regulated by the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), and requires companies to invest part of Net Operating Income (NOI) in R&D&I. This pushed firms to structure management routines for technological innovation efforts that simultaneously mitigate market and regulatory risk. One way to achieve this issue is to perform an <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> project selection methodology {{able to deal with}} somewhat antagonistic multiple-element analysis. PiTech (Prioritization in Technology) is a very flexible and conducive tool for performing such a weighted parametric multivariate analysis. The case presented in this article was performed with PiTech working with operational, market and regulatory criteria in multiple combinations for 19 projects for a key holding group in the Brazilian power market. The tool proved to be very useful by allowing decision makers to verify the appropriateness of investment in R&D projects totaling R 61 million in 2010, minimizing regulatory risks and preserving adherence to corporate interests...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{practices}} of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the Italian health-care sector (HCS) in order to verify whether (and how), in spite of legislative requirements, public interests are also considered before choosing the PFI solution, and to understand the possible effects of the pre-evaluation method used on {{the expectations of the}} public partner regarding the future of the relationship. The research was carried out by interviewing the subjects responsible for six initiatives of project financing in the Italian health-care sector. The empirical analysis has shown that Italian health-care trusts, which are not required to apply a compulsory method for pre-evaluating PFIs from their own perspective, neither drew up any calculation for weighting their future costs and revenues related to the project, nor did they consider the social consequences for the community. However, they merely followed the legal requirements and prepared a financial plan from the private partner perspective. In this situation, the importance of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluation</b> from the public perspective for guaranteeing the beginning of a PPP in a context more suitable for developing trust between partners is even stronger. ...|$|E

30|$|Differently {{from earlier}} <b>ex-ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> of in-work {{benefits}} for Italy (Colonna and Marcassa 2011; Figari 2011), our policy simulations focus on EITC and WTC in-work benefits for Italian married couples {{with a special}} emphasis on the new benefit premium for two-earner households. Policy reforms are simulated under budget neutrality by considering the abolition of Italian family allowances (FA). We find that in-work benefits with a suitable set of incentives for secondary earners may have strong positive effects on labor supply of wives and equity. The EITC {{is more effective than}} the WTC in boosting employment of wives, while the WTC is more effective than the EITC in fighting poverty. Most labor supply responses take place in the private sector where there is a greater availability of job opportunities and lower hourly wages with respect to the public sector.

For the estimation I apply a microsimulation model which is based on the tax-benefit model STSM and on structural microeconometric models of transitions into and out of self-employment. These structural models include an estimated parameter of risk aversion. The simulation results indicate that flatter tax systems do not encourage, but rather discourage people from choosing self-employment.
