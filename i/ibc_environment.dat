40|$|AbstractWireless {{sensor network}} (WSN) plays an {{important}} role in military sensing and tracking, target tracking, and environment monitoring. To query of the network to get useful information from anywhere and anytime, we need to integrate the WSN into the Internet as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this case, it is an important task to design an access control scheme that can authorize, authenticate and revoke a user to access the WSN. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous signcryption scheme to control the access behavior of the users. We give the formal security proof of our scheme in the random oracle model. An important characteristic of our scheme is to allow a user in a certificateless cryptography (CLC) environment to send a message to a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography (<b>IBC)</b> <b>environment.</b> We give an access control scheme for the WSN in the context of the IoT using the proposed signcryption scheme. As compared with existing two access control schemes using signcryption, the computational cost of sensors in our scheme is reduced by about 22 % and 53 %, respectively and the energy consumption of sensors in our scheme is reduced by about 33 % and 54 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the specification of communication services, with special emphasis {{being placed on}} the use of the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to {{describe the}} behaviours involved. We show how, starting from Message Sequence Charts, this temporal logic may be used to describe The Joint Viewing and Tele Operating Service (JVTOS) and its associated functions; and so lead on to the specification of QoS parameters. We discuss the approach that was taken to determine the exact nature of the Quality of Service parameters, and how the method may be used to extend the specification, and probe further aspects of the services and protocols involved.

40|$|We present {{constraints}} on the progenitor metallicities of core-collapse supernovae. To date, nearly all metallicity constraints have been inferred from indirect methods such as metallicity gradients in host galaxies, luminosities of host galaxies, or derived global galaxy metallicities. Here, progenitor metallicities are derived from optical spectra taken at the sites of nearby supernovae, from the ratio of strong emission lines found in their host HII regions. We present results from the spectra of 74 host HII regions and discuss the implications that these have {{on the nature of}} core-collapse supernova progenitors. Overall, while we find that the mean metallicity of type <b>Ibc</b> <b>environments</b> is higher than that of type II events, this difference is smaller than observed in previous studies. There is only a 0. 06 dex difference in the mean metallicity values, at a statistical significance of ~ 1. 5 sigma, while using a KS-test we find that the two metallicity distributions are marginally consistent with being drawn from the same parent population (probability > 10 %). This argues that progenitor metallicity is not a dominant parameter in deciding supernovae type, with progenitor mass and/or binarity playing a much more significant role.

40|$|We {{present the}} largest spectroscopic {{study of the}} host <b>environments</b> of Type <b>Ibc</b> supernovae (SN Ibc) {{discovered}} exclusively by untargeted SN searches. Past studies of SN <b>Ibc</b> host <b>environments</b> have been biased towards high-mass, high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN searches. Our new observations {{more than double the}} total number of spectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for untargeted SN <b>Ibc</b> host <b>environments,</b> and extend to a median redshift about twice as large as previous statistical studies (z = 0. 04). For the 12 SNe Ib and 21 SNe Ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of log(O/H) + 12 = 8. 48 and 8. 61, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy in the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant. This median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass loss via metal-line driven winds (< 30 %), suggesting this does not play the dominant role in distinguishing SN Ib and Ic progenitors. However, the median metallicity of the 7 broad-lined SN Ic (SN Ic-BL) in our sample is significantly lower, log(O/H) + 12 = 8. 34. The age of the young stellar population of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SN Ib and Ic, but our age sample is small. A synthesis of SN <b>Ibc</b> host <b>environment</b> spectroscopy to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic metallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for SN Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches introduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity distribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic effects that play smaller roles. We discuss the path forward for making progress on SN Ibc progenitor studies in the LSST era. Comment: 27 pages, 12 Figures, V 2 as accepted by ApJ, more information at [URL]...|$|R

There is only a 0. 06 dex difference in the mean metallicity values, at a statistical significance of ∼ 1. 5 σ, while using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test we find that the two metallicity distributions are marginally consistent with being drawn from the same parent population (probability > 10 per cent). This argues that progenitor metallicity is not a dominant parameter in deciding supernovae type, with progenitor mass and/or binarity playing a much more significant role. The mean derived oxygen metallicities [12 +log(O/H) ] for the different supernova types, on the Pettini & Pagel scale, are 8. 580 (standard error on the mean of 0. 027) for the 46 Type II supernovae (dominated by Type II plateau), 8. 616 (0. 040) for 10 Type Ib and 8. 626 (0. 039) for 14 Type Ic. Overall, the Type Ibc supernovae have a mean metallicity of 8. 635 (0. 026, 27 supernovae). Hence, we find a slight suggestion of a metallicity sequence, in terms of increasing progenitor metallicity going from Type II through Ib and finally Ic supernovae arising from the highest metallicity progenitors. Finally we discuss these results in the context of all current literature progenitor metallicity measurements, and discuss biases and selection effects that may affect the current sample compared to overall supernova and galaxy samples...|$|R
40|$|In the murine {{model of}} urinary tract infections (UTI), {{cystitis}} by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) occurs through {{an intimate relationship}} with the bladder superficial umbrella cell entailing cycles of adherence, invasion, intracellular bacterial community (IBC) formation, and dispersal (fluxing) from the intracellular <b>environment.</b> <b>IBC</b> dispersal is a key step that results in the spread of bacteria over the epithelial surface to initiate additional rounds of IBC formation. We investigated the role of flagella in mediating adherence and motility during UTI, hypothesizing that the dispersion of the IBC would be incomplete {{in the absence of}} motility, thus interrupting the IBC pathway and attenuating the infection. Using gfp reporter fusions, the expression of the flagellar class I flhDC and class III fliC genes was monitored to track key points of regulation throughout the pathogenic cascade. In vitro, growth under conditions promoting motility resulted in the robust expression of both fusions. In contrast, only the class I fusion produced significant expression throughout early stages of IBC development including the dispersion stage. Thus, unlike in vitro modeling of motility, the regulatory cascade appeared incomplete in vivo. Throughout IBC formation, nonmotile �fliC mutants achieved the same number of IBCs as the wild-type (wt) strain, demonstrating that flagella are neither essential nor required for first- or second-generation IBC formation. However, in competition experiments between wt and �fliC strains, the wt was shown to have a fitness advantage in persisting throughout the urinary tract fo...|$|R
