500|$|Miranda Seymour in The New York Times {{remarks on}} the [...] "breathless passion" [...] of the narrator's voice as being {{absolutely}} convincing, citing as an example Nancy's statement to her sister {{at the start of}} the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler:... It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... I never saw a girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E
2500|$|Although The Starry Night {{was painted}} {{during the day}} in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be {{inaccurate}} to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view {{has been identified as}} the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. [...] "Through the iron-barred window," [...] he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, [...] "I can see an enclosed square of wheat [...] [...] [...] above which, in the morning, <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> sun rise in all its glory." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Madden, {{coach of}} the 1972 Raiders, {{has said that he}} will never get over the play, and has {{indicated}} that he was bothered more by the delay between {{the end of the play}} and the final signal of touchdown than by which player the ball truly hit. After the game, he indicated that from his view the football had indeed touched Tatum. Although a few days later Madden indicated that the Raiders game films showed that the ball hit Fuqua's shoulder pads, Jack Tatum conceded that [...] "even after we viewed the game films with stop action, nobody could tell who the ball hit on that moment of impact." [...] Years later Madden wrote, [...] "No matter how many times <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> films of the 'immaculate reception' play, I never know for sure what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first U.S. {{review of}} the film was {{published}} on May 23 in industry trade magazine Variety. Todd McCarthy called Pulp Fiction a [...] "spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture... a startling, massive success." [...] From Cannes forward, Tarantino {{was on the road}} continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebastián. Tarantino later said, [...] "One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> film with an audience, it does break [...] alpha state. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie." [...] In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. The New York Times published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a [...] "triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color... {{has come up with a}} work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers." ...|$|E
