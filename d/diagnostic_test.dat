We used PubMed, Psychinfo, Cochrane Central, Ongoing Trials Database and Scopus. RESULTS: We found 5 randomized controlled trials that included 1544 patients. The trials used different <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> (ECG, radiography of lumbar spine, MR brain scan, laboratory tests, MR of lumbar spine) for different complaints (e. g. chest pain, low back pain and headache). Four out of 5 RCTs did not find a significant reassuring value of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> One study reported a reassuring effect at 3 months which had disappeared after one year. CONCLUSION: Despite the sparse and heterogeneous studies, the results point {{in the direction of}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> making hardly any contribution to the level of reassurance.

5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.|$|E

As a result the regular improvements in diagnostic technology that are observed can justify a lower investment on prevention at any given unitary price for this activity.

5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive <b>diagnostic</b> <b>test</b> than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is still}} an {{important}} heath issue in developing countries. According to low sensitivity of sputum smear and prolonged declaration of culture results, we reviewed rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> for tuberculosis in this article. Materials and Method: Electronic databases (PubMed and Embase) were searched from 1990 to 2010 for rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> Key words like tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rapid tests were used. In this review article we discussed about the accuracy of rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Results: Serologic and enzyme tests such as adenosine deaminase and cytokines revealed different results. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATS) provided higher accuracy for sputum positive pulmonary TB. The specificity of NAATS was high in pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis. Automated liquid culture (radiometric and non-radiometric) had higher speed and accuracy in comparison to conventional solid media culture. Conclusion: Despite many efforts for rapid detection of TB, sputum microscopic smears and cultures remain the principal <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> for TB patients.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} predictors of inappropriate use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> and management of bronchiolitis in a population of hospitalized infants. Methods. In an analytical cross-sectional study, we determined independent predictors of the inappropriate use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> and management of bronchiolitis in a population of hospitalized infants. We defined a composite outcome score as the main outcome variable. Results. Of the 303 included patients, 216 (71. 3 %) experienced an inappropriate use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> and treatment of bronchiolitis. After controlling for potential confounders, it was found that atopic dermatitis (OR 5. 30; CI 95 % 1. 14 – 24. 79; p= 0. 034), length of hospital stay (OR 1. 48; CI 95 % 1. 08 – 2. 03; p= 0. 015), and the number of siblings (OR 1. 92; CI 95 % 1. 13 – 3. 26; p= 0. 015) were independent predictors of an inappropriate use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> and treatment of the disease. Conclusions. Inappropriate use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> and treatment of bronchiolitis was a highly prevalent outcome in our population of study.

40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{diagnosis}} {{is a fundamental}} aspect of appropriate healthcare. However, clinicians need guidance when implementing <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> {{given the number of}} tests available and resource constraints in healthcare. Practitioners of health often feel compelled to implement recommendations in guidelines, including recommendations about the use of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> However, the understanding about <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> by guideline panels and the methodology for developing recommendations is far from completely explored. Therefore, we evaluated the factors that guideline developers and users need to consider for the development of implementable recommendations about <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> Methods Using a critical analysis of the process, we present the results of a case study using the Grading of Recommendations Applicability, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop a clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis of Cow Milk Allergy with the World Allergy Organization. Results To ensure that guideline panels can develop informed recommendations about <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests,</b> it appears that more emphasis needs to be placed on group processes, including question formulation, defining patient-important outcomes for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests,</b> and summarizing evidence. Explicit consideration of concepts of diagnosis from evidence-based medicine, such as pre-test probability and treatment threshold, is required to facilitate the work of a guideline panel and to formulate implementable recommendations. Discussion This case study provides useful guidance for guideline developers and clinicians about what they ought to demand from clinical practice guidelines to facilitate implementation and strengthen confidence in recommendations about <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> Applying a structured framework like the GRADE approach with its requirement for transparency in the description of the evidence and factors that influence recommendations facilitates laying out the process and decision factors that are required for the development, interpretation, and implementation of recommendations about <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tests.</b> </p...|$|R
