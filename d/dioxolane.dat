Previously a series of 3 -alkoxy- 1, 2 -dioxolanes, which are chemically stable cyclic peroxides, demonstrated significant in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. We aimed to evaluate the potential of these compounds against Schistosoma mansoni and elucidate the roles of iron and peroxidic groups in activity. Methods Drugs were tested against juvenile and adult stages of S. mansoni in vitro and in vivo. Selected structures were assessed in vitro against schistosomes {{in the presence of}} additional iron sources. In addition, drugs were tested in vitro and in vivo against Echinostoma caproni, a non-blood-feeding intestinal fluke. Finally, the activity of non-peroxidic analogues was evaluated. Results Three <b>dioxolanes</b> displayed IC 50 s ≤ 20. 1 μM against adult schistosomes and values as low as 4. 2 μM against newly transformed schistosomula. Nonetheless, only moderate, non-significant worm burden reductions were observed after treatment of mice harbouring adult infections. Drugs lacked activity against juvenile schistosomes in vivo. Two selected <b>dioxolanes</b> showed in vitro activity against E. caproni down to concentrations of 5 mg/L, but none of the compounds revealed in vivo activity. All tested non-peroxidic analogues lacked activity in vitro against both parasites. Conclusions Selected <b>dioxolanes</b> presented interesting in vitro activity, but low in vivo activities have to be overcome to identify a lead candidate.

40|$|The {{aging and}} {{consequent}} changes in flavor molecules of a top-fermented beer were studied. Different aging conditions were imposed on freshly bottled beer. After 6 months of aging, the concentration changes were recorded for acetate esters, ethyl esters, carbonyls, Maillard compounds, <b>dioxolanes,</b> and furanic ethers. For some flavor compounds, the changes with time of storage were monitored at different temperatures, either with CO 2 or with {{air in the}} headspace of the bottles. For some molecules a relationship was determined between concentration changes and sensory evaluation results. A decrease in volatile esters was responsible for a reduced fruity flavor during aging. On the contrary, various carbonyl compounds, some ethyl esters, Maillard compounds, <b>dioxolanes,</b> and furanic ethers showed a marked increase, due to oxidative and nonoxidative reactions. A very high increase was found for furfural, 2 -furanmethanol, and especially the furanic ether, 2 -furfuryl ethyl ether (FEE). For FEE a flavor threshold in beer of 6 mug/L was determined.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the oxidation of aromatic compounds and benzylidene acetals with dimethyldioxinne. Dimethyldioxirane, either by Insitu preparation or in the isolated form, has shown remarkable reactivity. This oxidant is effective in oxygen transfer, readily prepared from commercial materials and reacts under mild conditions. Quinones are natural materials with biological activity and some are key intermediates in the synthesis of medicines. A well-known method for the preparation of quinones, is the oxidation of phenols and aromatic ethers. The oxidation of simple phenol and anisole derivatives by dimethyldioxirane yielded complex mixtures. More hindered aromatic compounds were investigated, since the oxidation of these compounds proceeded in a more controlled manner. In this study the phenols were found to be more reactive than the corresponding aromatic ethers. para-Quinones were formed preferentially, whereas ortho-quinones were observed in one or two cases. Products formed in these oxidations depend on the substitution pattern of the substrate. The oxidation of phenols and aromatic compounds formed complex mixtures and does not have many synthetic applications. Mechanisms are proposed for the formation of the different products. Benzylidene acetals are important protecting groups in the chemistry of carbohydrates. Cleavage of these benzylidene acetals gave either the free diol or benzyl ether or benzoyl ester, depending on the reagent used. The reaction of dimethyldioxirane with benzylidene acetals gave the benzoylesters. With dioxanes, e. g. 4, 6 -O-benzylidene sugar derivatives, there are no difference in stereoelectronic effects in the cleavage of C- 4 and C- 6. The major product has a 6 -benzoate group, probably due to the greater stability of the primary benzoate. In <b>dioxolanes</b> both reactivity and regioselectivity of the reactions are influenced by stereoeleetronic effects. It has been found that the cleavage of <b>dioxolanes</b> took place preferably in a conformation where the oxygen is antiperiplanar towards the leaving group.
