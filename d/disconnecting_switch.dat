On the other hand, open-circuit fault usually results in sustained period of abnormal states and can significantly degrade the converter performance.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a {{bachelor}} degree thesis in the Industrial Design Engineering program at Lulea University of Technology. The thesis work has been implemented at Creator Teknisk Utveckling AB in Vikmanshyttan. The work has been a product development project about a smart temperature sensor that monitors the temperature of sensitive parts in high voltage substations. The purpose of the project has been to secure that the sensor will withstand environmental stresses and find a final design that makes the product more cost efficient to manufacture. The Swedish electricity grid can be divided into three different types of grids; Local grid, Regional grid and the National grid. These grids provides the customer with electricity from where it´s produced. Where these grids connect with each other, there are substations which can send the electricity with contained voltage or it can be transformed into a lower voltage. When service needs to be performed on the substations, for example maintenance work, the power must be cut off. That is done by a circuit breaker and a <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch.</b> The breaker turns the power off and then the disconnector opens up to secure the safety of the service staff. These disconnecting switches are critical components, since attrition injuries can affect the components breakdown due to overheating. If Creator’s smart temperature sensor is used, the temperature can be monitored continuously and prevent costly power failures. The goal for this project was to make a prototype of the product with a design that protects the electronic parts from environmental stress without deteriorate the performance. The goal also included to get information of manufacturing costs for proper manufacturing methods to make 10 000 units. The project has followed a stage-gate model divided into four phases: project planning, context study, creative phase and detail development/concept. The project began with a structured project plan and an estimated time-schedule. Then the product was studied, as well as the high voltage environment where the product will be used. During the creative part of the project a workshop was held that, among other creative methods, generated a lot of different ideas. The result of these ideas generated three concepts that went through a concept selection. Trough that selection, one concept was chosen and further developed into two new concepts. Manufactures was contacted to get approximate manufacturing costs. The two concept was named Nigrum and Argentum. In the final selection, Nigrum was chosen as the final concept. Manufactures was contacted again to get more precise prices and manufacturing methods. The final concept Nigrum has a selling design that is adapted for manufacturing. The report also includes a theoretical framework of topics that have been important for the project. Validerat; 20160704 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|The {{employment}} {{of renewable energy}} sources is driving an increase {{of the amount of}} embedded generation that is connected to the medium and low voltage distribution networks. This penetration brings new challenges to improve the grid operation, but also concerns because these parts of the grid were not designed to host generation. These energy sources are usually interfaced by power electronic converters, e. g. inverters, which are flexible in terms of control capability. For instance, they can control output currents or voltages, both in phase and amplitude. So, a proper design of the regulators of inverters can improve distribution efficiency and reliability of the grid. Distributed generation can also increase power quality and provide voltage regulation in the distribution grid. For instance, parts of the electric network can be operated intentionally as autonomous networks, when the connection to the mains is lost. In this way, the reliability of the grid can increase and uninterruptible power supply capabilities can be achieved. However, in autonomous or islanded operation the voltage must be managed by the inverters to correctly feed all the loads, since the main control is missing, and the load power has also to be shared among the distributed energy resources. On the other side, the penetration of distributed generation can also be dangerous in some particular cases, if it is not properly managed. For instance, islanded operation can appear also unintentionally and without being expected, because of the local generation. In this case, islanded operation is a problem for the electric grid because it may damage the electric equipment or create safety hazard for the line workers. The probability of unintentional islanded operation has increased due to the newly introduced standards for generators, which in particular impose wider frequency and voltage ranges and active and reactive power support capabilities using of P/f and Q/V droop characteristics. Anti-islanding protections that each inverter is equipped with, may fail to detect the grid transition and so uncontrolled islanded operation may appear. In this scenario, some contributions of this Thesis are related to the islanded operation of parts of the electric grid. First, the unintentional islanding risk is studied considering the newly introduced standards for distributed energy resources and in particular for photovoltaic sources. A potential increase of such phenomenon will be shown and suggestions will be provided in order to reduce this risk. Then, another part of the Thesis addresses the intentional islanded operation. A local controller for inverter of distributed energy resources is presented to manage a part of the grid during grid-connected and autonomous operating modes and also during the transition: during grid-connected operation, the controller tracks active and reactive power references and, during islanded mode, it exploits the droop control properties to share the load among the distributed energy resources. The peculiarity of this regulator {{is that it does not}} need to identify the particular operation mode and so a smooth transition from grid-connected to islanded mode can be achieved with no communication within the power grid or among the <b>disconnecting</b> <b>switch</b> and distributed energy resources. Another important issue in these complex scenarios is the system stability: the interactions of more and more power electronics-interfaced power systems can indeed worsen the power quality and the stability of distribution networks. These phenomena can be addressed by analyzing the source and load impedances at the section of interaction between two subsystems. Well-established approaches exist for DC and three-phase AC networks to analyze the source-load system. Some papers focused also on single-phase AC systems, whose study is generally more difficult due to their time-varying characteristics. Another contribution of this Thesis is an extension of a method to study the stability of single-phase AC power systems, together with its experimental validation. This approach bases on the dynamic phasor method to determine the 2 -dimensional source and load impedances and it addresses the stability with the Generalized Nyquist stability Criterion, previously used to study balanced three-phase AC system stability. Distribution grid stability can be studied also focusing on the high level interactions of its multitude of devices, such as generators and loads, and this can be done considering approximated and general models that can account different types of device. The last contribution of this work is the system stability and dynamic studies of large distribution grids, with large penetration of distributed generation. Simplified models for the single units are linked together in large small-signal models, with a scalable and automatable approach for the dynamic analysis, that can address the study of a grid with a generic number of node, with no more effort by the user. In particular, this activity was done during a visiting research period done by the Author at the Institute Automation of Complex Power Systems of RWTH Aachen University (Germany). The results of this Thesis are given in terms of analytic and simulation studies, together with experimental validations. Also hardware-in-the-loop and real-time simulation approaches have been used for implementation and validation purposes...|$|E
