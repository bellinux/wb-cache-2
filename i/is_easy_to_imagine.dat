25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> a {{biological}} system where some components are complex multi-state molecules, whereas others have few possible states (or even just one) and exist in large numbers. A hybrid {{approach has been}} proposed to model such systems: Within the Hybrid Particle/Population (HPP) framework, the user can specify a rule-based model, but can designate some species {{to be treated as}} populations (rather than particles) in the subsequent simulation. This method combines the computational advantages of particle-based modeling for multi-state systems with relatively low molecule numbers and of population-based modeling for systems with high molecule numbers and a small number of possible states. Specification of HPP models is supported by BioNetGen, and simulations can be performed with NFSim.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} {{animal and plant}} species were not constant, but changed over time, was {{suggested}} {{as far back as}} the 18th century. Darwin's On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, gave it a firm scientific basis. A weakness of Darwin's work, however, was the lack of palaeontological evidence, as pointed out by Darwin himself. While it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> natural selection producing the variation seen within genera and families, the transmutation between the higher categories was harder to imagine. The dramatic find of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx in 1861, only two years after the publication of Darwin's work, offered for the first time a link between the class of the highly derived birds, and that of the more primitive reptiles. In a letter to Darwin, the palaeontologist Hugh Falconer wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, a Pittsburgh couple, Aaron and Christine Boring, sued Google for [...] "invasion of privacy".

[...] "While it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, {{it is hard to believe}} that any other than the most exquisitely sensitive would suffer shame or humiliation," [...] Judge Hay ruled; the Boring family was paid one dollar by Google for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Crandon's {{husband was}} known for {{displaying}} nude photographs of her in her mediumship sessions. Mina Crandon {{was described as a}} very beautiful lady whom men found [...] "too attractive for her own good." [...] It was suggested that the psychical investigator J. Malcolm Bird actively conspired with the Crandons in stage-managing the séances in an attempt to have a sexual relationship with Mina. Reports, however, suggest that Mina found Bird repulsive. Instead she had amorous feelings for the psychical researcher Hereward Carrington, with whom she had an affair. Carrington also borrowed money he was unable to repay from Crandon. Critics have written that it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> these factors could have biased his judgement regarding her mediumship.|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{hypothesis}} ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume {{would have been}} called [...] "fleur-de-lis." [...] This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.|$|E

Since then the decision was reversed in part and on December 1, 2010 Magistrate Judge Bissoon ruled that Google is an intentional trespasser and the company was ordered to pay one US dollar to the plaintiffs.|$|E
2500|$|Metz {{warns that}} the {{paradigm}} may have changed. [...] "Insurgency matters today because it {{is linked to the}} phenomenon of transnational terrorism. Insurgents have long used terrorism in the operational sense, deterring those who supported the government and creating an environment of violence and insecurity to erode public trust in the regime. But now terrorism plays a strategic role as well. Insurgents can use terrorism as a form of long-range power projection against outsiders who support the government they are fighting. This could deter or even end outside assistance. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine,</b> for instance, that the already fragile backing for American involvement in Iraq would erode even further if the Iraqi insurgents launched attacks in the United States. Even more important, an insurgent movement able to seize control of a state could support transnational terrorists. The idea is that insurgents have demonstrated an affinity for violence and extremism which would flavor their policies if they came to power." ...|$|E
