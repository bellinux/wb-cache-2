A European standard (EN 673) uses 20 °C difference between the inside and outside temperature which results in an optimal simulated <b>gap</b> <b>width</b> of about 17 mm for a standard double glazed window. A US standard (NFRC) uses a 39 °C difference which yields a smaller optimal <b>gap</b> <b>width</b> of about 13 mm. Using the European standard a window with an ideal gap of 17 mm has a simulated U-Value of about 2.8 W/m²/K, a window with a much smaller gap of 6 mm has a U-value of about 3.3 W/m²/K, while a single glazed window has a U-value of about 5.5 W/m²/K.

The entire screen is then placed in an organic gas and pulses of electricity are sent through the pads. Carbon in the gas is pulled onto {{the edges of the}} slit in the PdO squares, forming thin films that extend vertically off the tops of the gaps and grow toward each other at a slight angle.

However, the {{study has been}} limited to the subnanometer gap regime. Here, we newly extend quantum plasmonics to <b>gap</b> <b>widths</b> well over 1 nm {{by taking advantage of}} the low-frequency terahertz regime. Enhanced electric fields of up to 5 V/nm induce tunneling of electrons in different arrays of ring-shaped nanoslot antennas of <b>gap</b> <b>widths</b> from 1. 5 to 10 nm, which lead to a significant nonlinear transmission decrease.

A narrower head gap is optimal for playback than for recording, so the head <b>gap</b> <b>width</b> of any combined record/playback head must necessarily be a compromise. Separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording, permitting immediate verification of the recording quality. (Such machines can be identified {{by the presence of}} a [...] "monitor" [...] switch with positions for [...] "tape" [...] and [...] "source", or similar.) Three-head systems were common on reel-to-reel decks, but were more difficult to implement for cassettes, which do not provide separate openings for record and play heads.

50|$|Some drill presses {{and milling}} {{machines}} contain a pulley-based CVT where the output shaft has {{a pair of}} manually adjustable conical pulley halves through which a wide drive belt from the motor loops. The pulley on the motor, however, is usually fixed in diameter, or may {{have a series of}} given-diameter steps to allow a selection of speed ranges. A handwheel on the drill press, marked with a scale corresponding to the desired machine speed, is mounted to a reduction gearing system for the operator to precisely control the width of the gap between the pulley halves. This <b>gap</b> <b>width</b> thus adjusts the gearing ratio between the motor's fixed pulley and the output shaft's variable pulley, changing speed of the chuck. A tensioner pulley is implemented in the belt transmission to take up or release the slack in the belt as the speed is altered. In most cases, the speed must be changed with the motor running.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{argument}} {{has been raised}} about the possible interference the vomer flap surgery has with midface growth in children. In 1975, defective mid-facial growth found in some patients caused the vomer flap procedure to begin to decline drastically in surgical use (Friede and Johanson, 1977). A debate still exists among researchers and surgeons {{in regards to the}} relationship between vomer flap surgery and defective midface growth. Some contemporary surgeons continue to use the vomer flap technique in the nasal lining of patients with cleft palate. A study that compared the effects of vomerine flap closure of the hard palate at the time of lip repair with non-closure of the hard palate in subjects with a unilateral cleft lip and palate found that the decrease of alveolar arch <b>gap</b> <b>width</b> at palate repair (6 months) in the vomerine flap group was significantly more than the decrease observed in the non-vomerine flap group, and there was no significant decrease in the anterior and posterior arch width or anteroposterior length of the hard palate in the vomerine flap group compared with the non-vomerine flap group (Maggiulli et al, 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{bypass flow}} in a {{prismatic}} high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) is the flow that occurs between adjacent graphite blocks. Gaps exist between blocks due to variances in their manufacture and installation {{and because of}} the expansion and shrinkage of the blocks from heating and irradiation. Although the temperature of fuel compacts and graphite is sensitive to the presence of bypass flow, there is great uncertainty in the level and effects of the bypass flow. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) program at the Idaho National Laboratory has undertaken to produce experimental data of isothermal bypass flow between three adjacent graphite blocks. These data are intended to provide validation for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses of the bypass flow. Such validation data sets are called Standard Problems in the nuclear safety analysis field. Details of the experimental apparatus as well as several pre-test calculations of the bypass flow are provided. Pre-test calculations are useful in examining the nature of the flow and {{to see if there are}} any problems associated with the flow and its measurement.

40|$|One {{point of}} {{critique}} on playgrounds is their omnipresent standardization the distances between, for example, jumping stones or the ropes in a climbing net {{tend to be}} equal. Although current psychological literature suggests that nonstandardized playgrounds are beneficial for the children's motor development, standardized playgrounds may have a greater appeal to children because of their symmetry. The present study examined whether children opt for standardization if they construct their own playground. A group of children, who varied in their stepping and jumping capabilities, were provided with six identical jumping stones. Each child was asked to create her own jumping stone playground and play in it. The {{vast majority of the}} children created a configuration with varying <b>gap</b> <b>widths.</b> Moreover, the maximum and mean <b>gap</b> <b>widths</b> in the playgrounds were scaled to the (perceived) action capabilities of the children.

50|$|Because {{the working}} of a choke {{connection}} {{depends on the}} wavelength, its impedance can be zero at at most one frequency within the operating band of the waveguide. However, by making the gap extremely narrow, and the choke ditch relatively wide, the input impedance can be kept small over a broad frequency band. For gap and ditch widths in a fixed proportion, the connection input impedance is approximately proportional to either width (doubling both widths is like having two connections in series). Increasing just the ditch width, increases its input impedance proportionately, and to a some extent decreases the transformed impedance, though the effect is limited when the gap-length is not exactly one quarter wavelength. The MIL-spec choke flanges have a <b>gap</b> <b>width</b> of between 2% and 3% of the waveguide height (the smaller inner dimension of the guide), which for WR28 waveguide (WG22) amounts to a gap of just 3 thousandths of an inch. The choke ditch in these flanges is some 8 times wider (around 20% of the waveguide height), although the proportions vary considerably, as the width-to-height ratio of the standard mid-size guides deviates from 2:1. MIL-Spec choke flanges are intended for use over the full recommended operational frequency band of the waveguide(that is roughly from 1.3 to 1.9 time the guide cutoff).|$|E

Within the Poisson Boltzmann Nernst Planck description of the electrostatic interaction and transport of electrical charges, the presence of Stern layers can enrich the set of possible solutions.

The initial stage of the work covered the determination of pulse parameters for controlled metal transfer with a variety of wires and shielding gases. Basic bead-on-plate fusion characteristics were investigated 1 n all welding positions and quantified in terms of the major welding variables of current and travel speed. Welding position was shown to have no effect on fusion behaviour. Successful full penetration closed butt root welds were produced in all welding positions. Heat input was shown to be the factor controlling bead dimensions. Close control over welding parameters are needed to maintain consistent bead sizes. Complete joint simulations were also made. The vertical-up technique was shown to give superior fusion characteristics with the process producing excellent quality results in all positions.
