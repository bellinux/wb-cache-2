40|$|Abstract- High {{swelling}} bentonites {{cannot be}} analyzed for <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> with {{exactly the same}} technique as most soils. To resolve varied techniques {{used in the past}} and to establish areliable pro-cedure, the effects of sample size, the number of saturations, washes and extractions, and the volume of extracting solutions were determined on three high-swelling bentonites. Small samples must be used to insure complete xtraction of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations,</b> and the 0. 5 g weight was the best size of those tested. Most <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> were removed in three extractions with 25 or 33 ml volumes of ammonium acetate. More extractions could result in excessive solubiliza-tion of minerals. Centrifugal force must be sufficient to prevent loss of sample during decantation. This varied from 4500 to 7500 g for 10 - 20 rain, depending on particle size and sample dispersion. The proposed CEC method requires little time, but still compared closely with Frink's more extensive method and showed no significant difference between treatment means. The procedure was used to analyze high-swelling bentonites from fourteen locations in six Western States. Chemical properties changed within each deposit and with geographical location, but in general the bentonites contained high amounts of exchangeable Na, moderate amounts of exchangeable Ca and Mg, and low amounts of exchangeable K.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} prevalence of salinity world-wide, {{the measurement of}} <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in saline soils remains problematic. Two soil types (Mollisol and Vertisol) were equilibrated {{with a range of}} sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) solutions at various ionic strengths. The concentrations of exchangeable cations were then determined using several different types of methods, and the measured <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations compared to reference values. At low ionic strength (low salinity), the concentration of exchangeable cations can be accurately estimated from the total soil extractable cations. In saline soils, however, the presence of soluble salts in the soil solution precludes the use of this method. Leaching of the soil with a pre-wash solution (such as alcohol) was found to effectively remove the soluble salts from the soil, thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). However, the dilution associated with this pre-washing increased the exchangeable Ca concentrations while simultaneously decreasing exchangeable Na. In contrast, when calculated as the difference between the total extractable cations and the soil solution cations, good correlations were found between the calculated <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations and the reference values for both Na (Mollisol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertisol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Mollisol: y= 0. 901 x and Vertisol: y= 1. 05 x). Therefore, for soils with a soil solution ionic strength greater than 50 mM (electrical conductivity of 4 dS/m) (in which <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations are overestimated by the assumption they can be estimated as the total extractable cations), concentrations can be calculated as the difference between total extractable cations and soluble cations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] An {{environmental}} infrared microbalance (EIRM) cell {{was used}} to study H 20 sorption on two montmorillonite samples {{as a function of}} water content and type of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation.</b> The vibrational spectra showed that H 20 sorbed to the clay at low-water content was strongly influenced by the ex-changeable " cation and by the close proximity to the clay surface. At water contents < 6 H 20 molecules per <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation,</b> the H-O-H bending mode of H 20 (v 2 mode) shifts to a lower frequency and is characterized by an increase in molar absorptivity. In contrast, the positions of the asymmetric and sym-metric OH-stretching modes of sorbed water (vl and v 3 modes) shift to higher energies. These observations indicate that H 20 molecules orbed to the clay surface at low-water content are less hydrogen bonded than in bulk H 20. In addition, the vibrational-stretching and bending bands of the structural OH groups of the 2 : 1 layer are also strongly influenced by H 20 content and type of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation.</b> By using the EIRM cell, the molar absorptivities of the structural OH-bending vibrations were measured as a function of H 20 content. The position and molar absorptivity of the structural OH-bending bands at 920, 883, and 840 cm l are strongly influenced by H 20 content and type of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation.</b> The molar absorptivity of the 920 -cm ~ band, which is assigned to the A 1 A 1 OH group, decreased strongly at low-H 20 content. This reduction in intensity is assigned to a dehydration-induced change in orientation of the structural OH groups resulting from the penetration of H 20 molecules into siloxane ditrigonal cavities that are not associated with a net negative charge from isomorphous substitutions...|$|E
40|$|ISTO = present addressInternational audienceCation {{availability}} in peat {{may limit}} CH 4 production and microbial activity and thereby impact on rates {{of organic matter}} accumulation and the chemical character of the peat. We quantify total, soluble, and <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations, Exchange Site Saturation Levels (ESSLs) and organic fractions in bog-peat profiles and compare these with fen peat. Total and soluble cation concentrations are not correlated and these and <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations are lower in bog than fen peat. In all sites these vary with depth and the distribution patterns of individual cations are unique. This is explained by variation in ESSL, which is negatively correlated with Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). Total cation concentrations in bog peat are higher in {{the top and bottom}} fractions than in the middle. Soluble concentrations in surface bog peat are low, because cations are trapped due to low ESSL. This does not occur in fen peat, with lower CEC and higher ESSL.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to study the effect of wet/dry season and the depth on several {{parameters}} of the forest soil. This work has shown that the concentration of Al 3 + increases and that the concentration of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) and pHs (distilled water and CaCl 2) decreases with the increase in depth and that these results are correlated. The concentrations of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> (Al 3 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) and organic matter (OM) are affected by dry/wet season.

When the water amount is high enough to get a basal distance higher than 1. 3 nm, then a total energy transfer from the montmorillonite sheets to the interlayer space occurs, and the H 2 production measured is very similar to the one obtained in bulk water. For a basal distance smaller than 1. 3 nm, the H 2 production increases with the relative humidity and thus with the water amount. Lastly, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements evidence the formation of a new defect induced by ionizing radiation. It consists of a hydrogen radical (H 2 precursor) trapped in the structure. This implies that structural hydroxyl bonds can be broken under irradiation, potentially accounting for the observed H 2 production...|$|E
