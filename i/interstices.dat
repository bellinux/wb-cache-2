5|$|Using an even simpler {{approximation}} of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres, {{the arrangement of}} anions in these systems are often related to close-packed arrangements of spheres, with the cations occupying tetrahedral or octahedral <b>interstices.</b> Depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound, and the coordination (principally determined by the radius ratio) of cations and anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed, and theoretically rationalized by Pauling's rules.|$|E
5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the <b>interstices</b> between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the <b>interstices</b> between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
40|$|The paper presets flow {{characteristics}} of a hydraulic unit {{made up of a}} cylinder and a plunger, which is typical for most of precision pairs, as a function of contamination content in the working fluid. The consideration cover typical cases, including flow of contaminated fluid via an <b>interstice</b> (positive allowance), when the manifold plunger (spool) is in its initial position and the flow rate Qz of the working fluid at the manifold inlet is higher than the flow rate Q via the <b>interstice,</b> the manifold plunger (spool) is in its initial position and the flow rate Qz of the working fluid at the manifold inlet is lower than the flow rate Q via the <b>interstice</b> and when the manifold plunger moves against the manifold cylinder (body). Mathematical relationships, determined for all the above cases, define the following characteristics: volume of contaminants captured upstream the <b>interstice,</b> volume of contaminants captured in the <b>interstice,</b> volume of contaminants that flow out downstream the <b>interstice,</b> flow rate of the working flow downstream the <b>interstice</b> as a function of time, average velocity for the working fluid that flows out of the <b>interstice</b> as well as time interval that is necessary to fill in the <b>interstice.</b> Distribution of contaminants along the <b>interstice</b> length is described as well. The determined relationships served as a basis to find out interconnections between volumes of fluid that flows via an <b>interstice</b> and duration of the flow process...|$|R

25|$|Anhydrous chromium(III) {{chloride}} adopts the YCl3 structure, with Cr3+ occupying {{two thirds}} of the octahedral <b>interstices</b> in alternating layers of a pseudo-cubic close packed lattice of Cl− ions. The absence of cations in alternate layers leads to weak bonding between adjacent layers. For this reason, crystals of CrCl3 cleave easily along the planes between layers, which results in the flaky (micaceous) appearance of samples of chromium(III) chloride.|$|E

In terms of its crystallography, corundum adopts a trigonal Bravais lattice with a space group of R-3c (number 167 in the International Tables).

25|$|For all {{the rough}} {{dynamism}} of the painting's surface, {{there is no}} compromise in the illusion of atmospheric quality, as some passages are painted to appear in sharper focus, while others are less so; often {{this is the result}} of the variation between areas of densely impasted paint and those composed of blurred brushstrokes The relief of the paint creates reflections of light that simulate the tactile nature of flesh. Strokes of thick paint, warm in tone, pool up to represent areas of reflected light on the forehead, nose, and cheek. Adjacent to these passages, at the temple, around the furrows of the right eye and the wing of the nostril, are <b>interstices</b> of green-gray underpainting. The right eyeball is painted with a series of transparent glazes, atop which is placed a drop of white lead pigment for the highlight. This eye is surrounded by a complex variety of brushwork: the brow is formed by an uneven series of strokes; a single stroke designates the fold above the upper lid; the skin above the cheek is molded with a rounded brush; the wrinkles at the corner of the eye are denoted by a stroke of wet paint dragged over a dry underpainting. A blunt object, likely a brush handle, was used to accent a wrinkle beneath the eye, and to score into the wet paint of the hair, creating sharp curls against which the broader passages of hair recede.|$|E
25|$|While some {{commentators}} {{have seen the}} party lose focus {{with the rise of}} SAP neoliberal study groups, the Swedish Social Democratic Party has for many years appealed to Swedes as innovative, capable, and worthy of running the state. The Social Democrats {{became one of the most}} successful political parties in the world, with some structural advantages in addition to their auspicious birth within vibrant folkrörelser. At the close of the nineteenth century, liberals and socialists had to band together to augment establishment democracy, which was at that point embarrassingly behind in Sweden; they could point to formal democratic advances elsewhere to motivate political action. In addition to being small, Sweden was a semi-peripheral country at the beginning of the twentieth century, considered unimportant to competing global political factions; so it was permitted more independence, while soon the existence of communist and capitalist superpowers allowed social democracy to flourish in the geo-political <b>interstices.</b> The SAP has the resource of sharing ideas and experiences, and working with its sister parties throughout the Nordic countries. Sweden could also borrow and innovate upon ideas from English-language economists, which was an advantage for the Social Democrats in the Great Depression; but more advantageous for the bourgeois parties in the 1980s and afterward. While the SAP has not been innocent of repressing communists, the party has overall benefitted, in government coalition and in avoiding severe stagnation and drift, by engaging in relatively constructive relationships with the more radical Left Party and the Green Party. The early SAP had internal resources as well, in creative politicians with brilliant tactical minds, and similarly creative labor economists at their disposal.|$|E

500|$|Cyclopean is {{the term}} {{normally}} applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, unworked boulders more than [...] thick and weighing several metric tonnes. They were roughly fitted together {{without the use of}} mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller hunks of limestone fill the <b>interstices.</b> Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance. At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective parapet on the outer edge and with hoop-like crenellations. The term Cyclopean was derived by the latter Greeks of the Classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclopes, could have constructed such megalithic structures. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways. Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block—an opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone.|$|E
