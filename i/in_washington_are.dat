25|$|The District {{is divided}} into four {{quadrants}} of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location, and house numbers are assigned based on the approximate number of blocks away from the Capitol. In most of the city, the streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW) and north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW). Two avenues, Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, line {{each side of the}} Mall. Many of the diagonal streets and avenues <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> named after states. Some of these streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House with the U.S. Capitol and Massachusetts Avenue, a section of which is informally known as Embassy Row given the number of foreign embassies located along the street.|$|E

500|$|The volcano {{is located}} in Washington, {{and is one of}} the five major stratovolcanoes there. Situated in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, the volcano was created by {{subduction}} of the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Convergence between the two continues at a rate of [...] per year. This range has been volcanically active for about 36 million years, and the rocks that make up its volcanoes are between 55 and 42million years old. Eruptions within the range are irregular and do not occur all at once. In an attempt to organize the volcanoes by age, scientists typically divide them into the High Cascades, younger volcanoes, and the Western Cascades, consisting of the older volcanoes. However, the vents <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> all of different ages so none of its volcanoes are included in either of the sections.|$|E
500|$|The Cascade Volcanoes <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> {{restricted}} to four belts; Goat Rocks forms one {{segment of the}} north–south trending Mount Adams belt that also incorporates Tumac Mountain, Adams, and the King Mountain Fissure Zone. Of the four Cascade arcs, this belt contains the second most volcanoes, and its volcanoes are predominantly made of calc-alkalic to tholeiitic to basaltic andesite lava. Goats Rocks and its immediate vicinity are underlain by pre-Tertiary greywacke and argillite, and these deposits are cut by several prominent northward-trending faults. Overlaying these deposits are Cenozoic volcanic rocks, including the thick, Eocene-aged Ohanapecosh Formation, comprised by chemically altered basalt and andesite lava flows and bedded andesite and dacite volcaniclastic rock. In turn, the Stevens Ridge Formation overlies the Ohanapecosh layer, featuring quartz-bearing silicic tuff, rhyolite, and other volcaniclastic rocks. Under both layers is the Russell Ranch Formation, [...] to [...] in thickness, which contains deposits of lapilli and tuff hinting at a caldera, although geologists have failed to identify clear evidence {{for the formation of}} a caldera in this zone.|$|E

On December 20, 2006, more than four months after initially charging Haq with aggravated murder, Maleng announced that Haq would not face execution, but, if convicted, would be {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Washington Wines and Wineries: The Essential Guide, Paul Gregutt, a wine writer for The Seattle Times and Wine Enthusiast, {{found that there}} is a common {{perception}} that Washington does not excel with any particular flagship variety or blend, as is common in most of the world's notable wine regions such as Napa Valley with Cabernet Sauvignon, the Mosel with Riesling, Australia with Shiraz, Chablis with Chardonnay and Pomerol with Merlot-based blends. There is also a perception that Washington wines are more expensive than other New World wine regions {{despite the fact that the}} state's two largest producers (Chateau Ste Michelle & Columbia Crest) focus primarily on value wine production. This may be partly due, as Gregutt noted, to the fact that many consumers think that Chateau Ste Michelle and Columbia Crest are California wine producers. [...] While some wineries <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> large corporate run businesses, many Washington wineries are small family run businesses, with production often less than 25,000 gallons per year. [...] Smaller wineries typically sell much or even a majority of their production direct to consumers through tasting rooms.|$|E
