5|$|The European Southern Observatory (ESO) <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> the {{presence}} of a planet, Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, through the use of direct imagery, orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star. This planet is currently the closest extrasolar planet to its star ever photographed: the observed separation is roughly the same as the distance between Saturn and the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of whether Deckard {{is intended to be}} a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release. Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human, while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity. Ridley Scott <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> that in his vision, Deckard is a replicant.|$|E
5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports.

The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that}} the razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl II is the twelve-year-old prodigy, who has {{dedicated}} {{his life to}} criminal activities. He leads the Fowl criminal empire, which has been established by his family for generations. After significant research, Artemis believes that he <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> the existence of fairies. He tracks down an alcoholic sprite posing as a healer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her The Book of the People—the Fairy holy book that is written in Gnommish.|$|E
5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E

5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 4: The Room {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan on June 17, 2004. The game was shipped for its subsequent North American and European releases on September 7, with pre-ordering customers receiving the soundtrack for free {{with the game}} in the former market. The game, alongside its two PS2 predecessors, was rereleased in 2006 as part of The Silent Hill Collection European boxset, as a tie-in with the release of the Silent Hill film, and again in 2009. Microsoft <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> that their Xbox 360 console is backward compatible with the game's Xbox port.|$|E

5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Stoa was {{destroyed}} by the Roman army during the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Its site on the Temple Mount esplanade is currently inaccessible to archaeologists. However, artifacts from the Stoa have been recovered both from excavations {{at the foot of}} the platform and in secondary use in later constructions. This evidence <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> details given in the accounts of the historian Josephus, and has also allowed comparison of the Royal Stoa's decoration with that used in other, contemporaneous monumental buildings.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many archaeological finds, {{the human}} {{remains at the}} site were able to be dated with environmental, geological, and archaeological methods. Human remains at the site are the oldest {{that have been found}} in Washington, and at the time were the oldest set of remains found in North America. Later {{radiocarbon}} work <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> the original dating of this site, indicating that these human remains, albeit very fragmentary, are still some of the oldest ever excavated in the New World. This finding was useful in confirming the early chronology of the region and confirming the antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> that they are separate species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season, Gilchrist made a {{comeback}} for his final IPL stint. He stated the reason {{as being the}} Kings XI management's decision to renew his contract for another season. An interesting change in the team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach. This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise, the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory. Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play-offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist's leadership. They were knocked out very late in the tournament. In his final game at IPL, Gilchrist decided to bowl the last over of the match against the Mumbai Indians, where he got the wicket of Harbhajan Singh of his first ball, securing KXIP's victory in the match. In a recent press conference, Gilchrist <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> {{that this will be}} his final IPL season and that he was looking forward to a fresh start in the inaugural Caribbean Premier League in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the species}} of Marginatae {{associated}} with willow, five (I.salicis-herbaceae, I.substellata, I.praetervisa, I.salicis and I.mixtilis) {{can be readily}} distinguished from I.saliceticola as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: I.mixtilis and I.praetervisa favour willow only in montane habitats, while I.salicis-herbaceae and I.substellata grow exclusively in montane habitats. I.salicis is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from dunes. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of I.dunensis are distinctly larger and of a different shape to those of I.saliceticola, and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, {{and has not been}} recorded in Finland. I.obtusiuscula also has larger spores of a different shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. Phylogenetic analysis of the respective internal transcribed spacer sequences <b>has</b> <b>confirmed</b> that I.obtusiuscula and I.saliceticola are separate species.|$|E
