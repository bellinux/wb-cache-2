40|$|With the {{development}} of urban areas and the constant need to change or improve the existing structures, a need for creative and less destructive soil reinforcement processes has occurred. Jet-grouting is one possible ground improvement technique. The behavior of the soil improved by jet-grouting is still not well understood. In this thesis, the mechanical behavior of the <b>injected</b> <b>soil</b> is modeled {{in order to determine}} the different parameters needed for the engineering design of a soil reinforcement based on jet-grouting. At first several models are presented {{in order to determine the}} extent of the injected zone within the soil mass, based on engineering parameters (cement poroelastic properties, injection rate). A model based on an energetic balance is proposed to compute the lower bound of the injection radius. The second part of the thesis focuses on the characterization of the uniaxial compressive strength of the soilcrete created in the injected area determined in the first part. Three different methods have been adapted to the problem. A hollow sphere model has been calibrated against published data. After calibration, both Eshelby's and averaging methods proved to provide results close to the reference data. The last part of this report presents numerical studies of the pile and of a group of piles. The study of the group of piles focuses on the effect of arching between soilcrete columns to reduce the vertical settlements due to urban tunneling at the surface. It appears that the values obtained for settlements in the presence of jet-grouted columns are much less important than in usual tunneling problems (with no reinforcement) ...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{differential}} settlement of buildings {{is produced by}} both natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances of the foundation soil, such as, for example, differential consolidation, circulation of water due to rupture of water pipes, seepage, suction, vibrations induced by vehicle traffic, excavations, construction defects and an incorrect design/execution of the work. Techniques of soil consolidation and stabilization by means of expanding resin injections are being advantageously employed to mitigate or even solve this issue. The resin used is a two-component polyurethane compound that, once its chemical reaction is completed, reaches an inert and lightweight solid state {{so that it is}} environment-safe and perfectly compatible with the <b>injected</b> <b>soil.</b> The resin is injected directly into the critical volumes by means of small diameter pipes. After the injection, the resin expands rapidly in the soil through an irreversible exothermic chemical reaction, so that it actively counteracts the settlement and its causes. Indeed, the observed effects are threefold: i) filling voids; ii) compacting soil; iii) reducing/removing interstitial water. Among the possible procedures to monitor soil consolidation and stabilization by injections of expanding resins, a procedure is hereafter described which involves the use of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The rationale for the use of this non-invasive imaging technique is that electrical resistivity is a physical property sensitive to grain size, porosity and water content of sediments and to voids. Therefore, it can both acquire information about the subsurface structure, also from volumes of difficult access (e. g.,, below the foundations and the floor of the building), which is necessary for the consolidation project, and it can monitor the injection work in progress, in addition to traditional geotechnical testing. Specifically, the process is divided into several steps. A 3 D-ERT is acquired first, covering both the volumes affected by the settlement and nearby stable volumes of soil underlying the footprint of the building, to accurately map the different resistivity that characterizes the anomalous volumes. The 3 D resistivity model is integrated, wherever necessary, by geotechnical investigations, mainly penetration tests and sample identification, so as to optimally design the injection points, in terms of position, depth and number. During injections, the 3 D-ERT and some geotechnical tests are repeated to check progressively the effects obtained by the treatment, so as to allow, if necessary, to modify the injection scheme until reaching the predetermined target, i. e., obtaining the greatest uniformity of chemical and physical characteristics between the stabilized volumes and the nearby stable ones, which are used as a reference. In some sites, where the settlement was stabilized by the above procedure, it was also possible to repeat a 3 D-ERT after several years: results confirmed that the situation of the subsurface just after the injections had remained almost unaltered and the effectiveness of the procedure over time was demonstrated. The above approach is described hereafter and is accompanied by the description of the results from a specifically planned test site and from two work sites, selected as examples...|$|E

Chelating agents such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) have been used in different situations in phytoremediation to enhance the extraction of heavy metals by plants from soil. The objectives of the study were (1) to assess the availability of heavy metals in <b>soil</b> <b>injected</b> with biosolids and in composted biosolids with or without EDTA amendment, (2) to determine the efficacy of EDTA on uptake of heavy metals by sunflower plants from soil with biosolids and composted biosolids, and (3) to investigate whether EDTA applied in the previous season can reduce growth of the next crop. A laboratory and two greenhouse experiments were conducted at Kansas State University. In the laboratory, five EDTA doses were applied into the flasks with 5  g of either <b>soil</b> <b>injected</b> with biosolids (<b>soil)</b> or composted biosolids (compost). The soil and EDTA solution in flasks were shaken by electronic shaker for 4  h. The solution was decanted 2  h after shaking and then tested for the concentration of heavy metals by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-ES). In the greenhouse, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) plants were grown in soil with biosolids and in the composted biosolids. At the flowering stage, EDTA salt at 0, 1. 0, and 2. 0  g/kg soil or compost was applied. Plant organs were separated and dried at the end of the trial. The concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were analyzed using ICP-ES. After harvesting the first greenhouse experiment and extraction of the roots, the pots were refilled with the same soil or compost and five sunflower seeds were sown to establish a second greenhouse experiment. The emergence of seedlings and plant growth was determined.

Parametric experimental studies using various feed materials representative of the components of various DOE waste streams have validated design models which establish the reactor operating range as a function of feed material, mass flow rate, and particle size.

At present, this waste is used to generate methane-rich biogas in oxygen-depleted environments (Ashekuzzaman and Poulsen 2011). This clean-burning biogas is produced by methanogenic bacteria from lignocellulosic substrates in manure to generate electricity and heat energy (Maranon et al. 2011).

Historical hydronuclear tests use high explosives and a small amount of plutonium. The explosion scatters plutonium within a contained subsurface environment. There is currently a need to characterize these test areas to determine the spatial extent of plutonium in the subsurface and whether geohydrologic processes are transporting the plutonium away from the event site. Three technologies were identified to assist in the characterization of the sites. These technologies are the Pipe Explorer{trademark}, cone penetrometer, and drilling. If the characterization results indicate that remediation is needed, three remediation technologies were identified that should be appropriate, namely: capping or sealing the surface, in situ grouting, and in situ vitrification. Capping the surface would prevent vertical infiltration of water into the soil column, but would not restrict lateral movement of vadose zone water. Both the in situ grouting and vitrification techniques would attempt to immobilize the radioactive contaminants to restrict or prevent leaching of the radioactive contaminants into the groundwater.

The potential and magnetic fields are measured using appropriate sensors placed on or above the soil surface. 2) Using the measured values as boundary conditions, a fast optimization algorithm, and an accurate matrix inversion routine, the subsurface conductivity is estimated. Two field tests are conducted using magnetic sensor in either contact or non-contact technique. Both tests successfully located the buffed plastic and metal objects within a radius of 1. 2 ft...|$|R
5000|$|The eastern-most {{substantial}} hemlock {{forest in}} Maryland, {{home to the}} smokey shrew, is a 60 acre old-growth hemlock forest that is located on both The Hemlocks area of the reservation and Conowingo Dam property. The invasive species hemlock woolly adelgid threatened the forest. In 2006 area volunteers worked with state officials to study and reduce the destruction caused by the hemlock woolly adelgid. Since 2007 area youth volunteers continue to record data, and mark trees. Trained adult volunteers <b>inject</b> imidacloprid into <b>soil.</b> Trees too close to streams and wetlands to receive soil injections instead receive trunk imidacloprid injections from Maryland department of agriculture staff. As a biocontrol remedy the Forest Service released over 2,300 Laricobius beetles into the forest. This process is repeated annually on 20 acre of forest {{to ensure that the}} entire forest is treated every three years. In 2013 the Forest Service reported that the [...] "Laricobius beetles are spreading, the hemlock woolly adelgid is less prevalent, and the condition of the hemlock forest has noticeably improved." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pneumatic {{fracturing}} is {{a method}} that has become very popular {{in the last ten}} years used to remediate contaminated sites. The method consists of injecting gas into a contaminated subsurface at a pressure higher than that of the gases that are present. By doing this fractures [...] "spider-web" [...] throughout the subsurface so that pumps may be placed in the ground to suck out the contaminated water through these cracks. Substrates may also be <b>injected</b> into the <b>soil</b> through the cracks to further the remediation of the soil and ground water. The clean-up technique was developed and patented through the research of various professors at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in 1996 with hopes of cleaning up various United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites which are some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the country. The patent is held by John R. Schuring, PhD and PE, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. This method has been adopted by environmental contractors all over the country since it has been patented.|$|R
