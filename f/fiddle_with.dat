25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was {{the first}} album on which the Banshees really {{exploited}} the possibilities of the studio. They allowed themselves to be inspired by sounds. Engineer Mike Hedges, who was interested in vocals, put different effects on Siouxsie's voice and multi-layered it. Hedges also encouraged them to <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> effects; if the band came up with something off-the-wall, he'd want to top it.|$|E
500|$|After the decision, Willie went on {{to reveal}} where the other prizes—the ₱2,000,000 cash prize, the ₱1,000,000 cash prize, the ₱500,000 cash prize, and the house and lot—were hidden. [...] He said that the symbol for the ₱2,000,000 cash prize—the numeral [...] "2"—was {{in the window of}} the violet wheel. [...] He was handed the violet wheel, and he reached behind the wheel, {{supposedly}} to pull the dark film in order to reveal the numeral [...] "2." [...] However, when he pulled the film, the numeral [...] "0" [...] appeared instead. [...] He appeared to <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> the back of the wheel and then he pulled out two films: one dark film (supposedly the [...] "cover" [...] film) and another film with the numeral [...] "2" [...] printed on it. [...] As he held those two films in his hand, the numeral [...] "0" [...] was still visible in the window of the violet wheel.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} with Pro Tools and tracking vocals, which Swift sang {{live with the}} band. The band consisted of acoustic guitars, bass guitars, and drums. All other instruments were overdubbed by Chapman. He said, [...] "I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track, and I stacked several background vocals — me singing, 'Ah's'." [...] Audio engineering was executed by Chad Carlson in Blackbird Studios' Studio D, with the usage of the API Legacy Plus equipments: Avantone CV-12, Neve 1073, and Tube-Tech CL-1B. Audio mixing done by Justin Niebank and was set in Studio F, with the usage of the console Solid State Logic 9080 K series and Genelec 1032 console. In between, overdubs were executed in Studio E by Chapman. [...] "Love Story", {{along with the rest}} of the album, was mastered by Hank Williams at MasterMix Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. The song was mixed for mainstream airplay by Chapman. He pulled Niebank's stems into his Mac OS laptop and used Apple Logic to create the pop version. Chapman made mix tweaks and created new elements with his laptop. In order to do so, he muted the country instruments and replaced them with new elements characteristic to pop music, replacing banjo and <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> electric guitar. The pop version's opening beat is a Logic loop in the Ultrabeat beat generator. All the new electric guitars were done with the Amplitube Stomp I/O.|$|E

2500|$|In the March 2010 {{print edition}} of British enthusiast {{magazine}} EVO (p.120), editor Richard Meaden {{was the first}} to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. He said the car had [...] "serious, instantaneous muscle". [...] "With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien. Away from traffic lights you'd murder anything, be it a 911 Turbo, GT-R or 599, simply because while they have to mess about with balancing revs and clutch, or <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> launch controls and invalid warranties, {{all you have to do}} is floor the throttle and wave goodbye".|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Owens met Don Rich in Steve's Gay 90's {{restaurant}} in South Tacoma, Washington. Owens had observed one of Rich's shows, and immediately went {{to speak with}} him. Rich started to play <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> Owens at local venues. They were featured on the weekly BAR-K Jamboree on KTNT-TV 11. Owens' career took off in 1959, when his song [...] "Second Fiddle" [...] hit No. 24 on the Billboard country chart. Soon after, [...] "Under Your Spell Again" [...] made it to No. 4 on the charts and Capitol Records wanted Owens to return to Bakersfield, California.|$|E

2500|$|Dance {{among the}} Bara is {{influenced}} by the movement of the zebu they have traditionally herded for centuries. The karitaky dance in particular is a movement inspired by a zebu kicking. The most popular contemporary dance, called kilalaky, is performed in a line and originated among Bara cattle rustlers. The specific style of musical accompaniment, also known as kilalaky, is performed on djembe, kabosy, electric guitar, bass guitar, drum kit and [...] keyboard. Bagzana and Tsiliva are considered among the most popular performers of kilalaky. The most typical musical instrument among the Bara is the lokanga, a <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> three strings made of goat gut or vegetable fiber.|$|E
2500|$|The visual {{style of}} Wong's films {{is key to}} his work, often {{described}} as beautiful and unique. The colours are bold and saturated, the camerawork swooning, resulting in what Brunette calls his [...] "signature visual pyrotechnics". One of his trademarks {{is the use of}} step-printing, which alters film rates to [...] " [...] hard blocks of primary colour into iridescent streaks of light." [...] Other features of the Wong aesthetic include slow motion, off-centre framing, the obscuring of faces, rack focus, filming in the dark or rain, and elliptical editing. Stephen Schneider writes of Wong's fondness for [...] "playing with film stock, exposure, and speed the way others might <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> a script." ...|$|E
2500|$|The score {{features}} the London Philharmonic Orchestra, London Voices, London Oratory School Schola and featured vocal soloists. The score {{is the most}} expansive of the three: scoring effectivelly the entire movie length, not including additional music written for the trailer and various alternate versions released to the public. It also uses the biggest forces in the series: sections of the score call for two sets of timpani, eight trumpets (and possibly a similar increase {{in the size of}} the horn, trombone and tuba section, as well), 85 singers in the mixed choir with additional players for all-male and all-female sections, over fifty in the boy choir and many instrumentalist [...] "bands" [...] playing celtic and eastern instruments such as tin whistle or pan flute, on stage or off of it. One piece of music required an instrument invented and crafted especially for the film: a <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> four pairs of strings instead of single strings.|$|E

2500|$|The term STV in Australia {{refers to}} the Senate electoral system, a variant of Hare-Clark {{characterized}} by the [...] "above the line" [...] group voting ticket, a party list option. [...] It {{is used in the}} Australian upper house, the Senate, and some state upper houses. [...] Due to the number of preferences that are compulsory if a vote for candidates (below-the-line) is to be valid for the Senate a minimum of 90% of candidates must be scored, in 2013 in New South Wales that meant writing 99 preferences on the ballot 95% and more of voters use the above-the-line option, making the system, in all but name, a party list system. [...] Parties determine the order in which candidates are elected and also control transfers to other lists and this has led to anomalies: preference deals between parties, and [...] "micro parties" [...] which rely entirely on these deals. [...] Additionally, independent candidates are unelectable unless they form, or join, a group above-the-line. [...] Concerning the development of STV in Australia researchers have observed: [...] "... we see real evidence {{of the extent to which}} Australian politicians, particularly at national levels, are prone to <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> the electoral system".|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Poplington came two {{or three}} days ago, and he is {{stopping}} at our hotel. We three have hired a carriage together {{two or three}} times and have taken drives into, the country. Once we went to an inn, the Cat and Fiddle, about five miles away, on a high bit of ground called Axe Edge. It {{is said to be the}} highest tavern in England, and it's lucky that it is, for that's the only recommendation it's got.

Looking at their footmarks on the ground they seem to throw an almost straight track, neither splayed nor in-toed, and to set their feet down with a gentle forward pressure, rather like the Australian's stealthy footfall. Talking among themselves, or waiting for friends, they did not drum with their fingers, <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> their feet, or feel the hair on their faces. These things seem trivial enough, but when breeds are in the making everything is worth while.
