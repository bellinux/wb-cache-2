40|$|Restrictions {{on exports}} of staples or cash crops are {{frequently}} imposed {{in developing countries}} to promote food security or industrial development goals. By diverting production to the local market, these policies aim to reduce prices and increase the supply of food or intermediate inputs {{to the benefit of}} consumers or downstream industrial users. Although export restrictions reduce aggregate welfare, they are attractive to policymakers: Governments gain support when they are seen to keep consumer prices low; likewise, politicians are swayed by industrial lobbyists who promise increased value-addition in exchange for access to cheaper inputs. This study weighs in on the debate around the desirability of export restrictions by simulating the economy-wide effects of Malawi’s longstanding maize export ban as well as a pro-posed oilseed <b>export</b> <b>levy</b> intended to raise value-addition in processing sectors. Our results show that, while export restrictions may have the desired outcome in the short run, producers respond to weakening market prospects in the longer run by restricting supply, often {{to the extent that the}} policies become self-defeating. Specifically, maize export bans only benefit the urban non-poor, while poor farm households experience income losses and reduced maize consumption in the long run. The oilseed <b>export</b> <b>levy</b> is equally ineffective: Even when export tax revenues are used to subsidize processors, gains in industrial value-addition are outweighed by declining agricultural value-addition as production in the fledgling oilseed sector is effectively decimated. The policy is further associated with welfare losses among rural households, while urban non-poor households benefit marginally.

40|$|Sharp {{fluctuations}} in the export prices of a major staple commodity can have jarring effects on economic activity. To reduce these undesirable effects {{and at the same}} time, increase the government's share in the proceeds of the booming sector, developing countries can funnel the revenue from higher export earnings into a special compensation fund. The fund works by setting up a variable <b>export</b> <b>levy</b> somewhere between the actual export price and an agreed-upon base, and the government appropriates the windfall revenues. In a downturn, the fund pays producers the base price. This paper accordingly examines the case for establishing compensation arrangements and the forms they may take.

Yields are among the lowest in the world but, despite the low world price for coffee, there is a market for ‘Mzuzu’ coffee because of its high quality. Following on from earlier work to identify the pest constraints, this project promoted control measures within an ICM framework. On-farm demonstrations were used to promote an ICM system based on growing a derivative of the improved variety Catimor 129 (known as Nyika), which is resistant to the two major diseases. On-farm trials to evaluate insecticides led to the approval of fipronil for use on coffee. This project has contributed to the rehabilitation of smallholder coffee in Malawi at a time when the estate sector is abandoning coffee in favour of other crops. The smallholder sector is expanding rapidly with the assistance of the EU, and the SCFT expects the crop to be sufficient to sustain this trade organisation from <b>export</b> <b>levies</b> by 2007.

In the mid- 1990 s {{the government of}} Ghana began instituting a number of regulations and initiatives to achieve this goal. This study examines the three primary actions taken since that time and examines their influence on increasing value-added exports.

Export records from the Timber Industry Development Division of the Forestry Commission were used to develop time series of volumes of 10 major value-added products exported from Ghana for the period 1992 to 2001 in order to estimate the effect of these government interventions. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling was used to model these effects. Results indicate that the air-dried lumber <b>export</b> <b>levy</b> and the decrease in annual allowable cut had the most impact on increasing value-added wood product exports.

40|$|Trade in {{agriculture}} {{is important to}} the world’s poor— Agriculture is the largest employer in lowincome countries, accounting for about 60 percent of the labor force and producing about 25 percent of GDP. Even in middle-income countries, where agriculture’s share of GDP is only about 15 percent, the sector still accounts for more than 25 percent of employment. When coupled with agro-related industries and foodrelated services, its share, even among middleincome countries, is typically 25 to 40 percent of GDP. About 73 percent of the poor in developing countries live in rural areas. Rural development, therefore, is central to alleviating poverty. Government policy has heavily distorted agricultural performance in both developing and developed countries. Until the 1990 s, industrial countries generally protected agriculture, whereas developing countries generally taxed it (Schiff and Valdes 1992). Industrial countries supported their agricultural sectors through subsidies to producers, high tariffs, and other nontariff measures such as import restrictions and quotas. —but agricultural policies have often worked {{to the detriment of the}} poor Most of the developing countries generated the bulk of their agricultural GDP in lowerefficiency production for the domestic market, supplying the world market with tropical commodities that could not easily be produced in the industrial countries.

The agreement specifies {{an increase in}} the <b>export</b> <b>levy</b> on Norwegian salmon entering the EU from 0. 75 % to 3. 00 % ad valorem. The proceeds of the levy are to be used by the Norwegian Seafood Export Council in cooperation with the Scottish Salmon Board and the Irish Salmon Growers Association for generic advertising of atlantic salmon in the European markets, the so called Pan-European Salmon Marketing Campaign. Over the Agreement’s five-year life, an estimated $ 30 million is expected to be invested in salmon promotion in Europe.

Bibliography: leaves [142]- 146. ix, 146 leaves illThe {{present study}} is an econometric {{investigation}} into Nepal's foreign sector. Its foreign trade presents Nepal with a unique problem. While {{the small size of}} the country impels Nepal to resort to international trade, its landlocked topography severely limits its option to trade with countries other than India. Trade with India thus presents itself to Nepal as a combined situation of monopoly and monopsony. In the present study, we have (a) constructed a structural model of the Nepalese foreign sector and estimated its parameters by using multivariate regression techniques, (b) projected Nepal's imports and exports for five years and examined the required exchange rate depreciation to rectify the projected trade deficits, (c) studied the effects on Indo-Nepal trade in the event of removal of trade treaties between the two nations, and finally, (d) suggested alternative trade policies. Lack of adequate data and the primitive state of the available data on Nepal have been the main reasons for the estimation of the functions in the model in highly aggregate form. Export demand and export supply functions have been disaggregated on the basis of end-use of the commodities. No disaggregation has been achieved in the import function. Single equation least-squares regression techniques have been used in the estimation of the model with annual data for 1960 / 61 to 1969 / 70. The usual objections to this method become less significant in this case {{because of the fact that}} a large number of the independent variables in the model are exogenous. The model consists of five structural equations and four identities. When data permit the construction of a model for the entire economy, the foreign trade model can be linked to a model of the domestic sector to take into account the inter-relationships and feedback between the two sectors. Contrary to what has been found in other studies on foreign trade, the relative price variable in our model has been consistently significant in import demand and export demand functions. Elasticity of Nepal's import demand has been found to be greater than unity with respect to income as well as to its import price. This suggests that decision makers can make use of expenditure-reducing and also expenditure-switching measures in formulating trade policies aimed to remedy the trade deficits. Nepal's export demand has been found to be relatively elastic with respect to the ratio of India's national income to its agricultural income; but with respect to its export price, the elasticity was below unity. The income elasticity of Nepal's export demand indicates susceptibility of its export earnings to India's agricultural condition. The low price elasticity of export demand gives scope for the Nepalese Government to impose <b>export</b> <b>levies</b> without their possible adverse effects on its export earnings. Nepal's elasticity of export supply with respect to Nepal's income was found to be substantially below unity while its elasticity with respect to its price was found to be greater than unity. Elasticities approach has been used in computing the required exchange rate depreciation to rectify the projected trade deficits of Nepal. The required rates ranged from 18 % to about 28 %. It has been found that in the event of mutual tariff imposition in each other's trade, in a static sense, Nepal's trade diversion losses in its trade with India are likely to be greater than the trade creations emanating from its free trade with India. Finally, we have examined the model in its performance in explaining the observed pattern and the accuracy of the structural estimates.

40|$|The log {{export policy}} {{suggestion}} by Dumont and Wright (2006) is critically assessed {{in an effort}} to determine if it is based on economic efficiency. The optimal log export policy for British Columbia is derived using two different models. The first model assumes that B.

In both cases it is shown that an optimal log export tax when a fixed lumber export tax exists can be characterized as a problem of second best. In that scenario the optimal log export policy is a positive export tax in both models. In the second model a positive export tax is also optimal when there is no lumber export tax, but it is smaller than when the lumber <b>export</b> tax is <b>levied.</b> In comparison to the log export tax recommended by Dumont and Wright (2006), the optimal tax for a small economy is always lower, while it is lower only in certain circumstances for an economy with market power.

40|$|Nontariff {{barriers}} {{have become}} one of the key issues in agricultural trade policy and trade negotiations.

Agricultural trade negotiations have become increasingly complex. As the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) partici-pants prepared for the so-called Tokyo Round of negotiations after the U. S.

The complexity of this "new situa-tion " is due in large part to nontariff trade barriers originating from technology and the administrative bureaucracies, which have made commercial problems of the mid-twentieth century unique. Nontariff barrier problems, along with ag-ricultural policy issues, were pushed into the background during the Kennedy Round negotiations of 1962 - 67. There was an initial underestimation of the nature and level of the ultimate significance of such barriers to the countries involved.

30|$|The modern service {{industry}} {{is an important}} component of the national economy, and accelerating the development of the modern {{service industry}} is an important way to expand domestic demand and transform the pattern of economic development. In general, the development of China's modern service industry is still at a low level, and current taxation system and policies are not conducive to its development. The pilot work of changing sales tax to a value-added tax (VAT) is of great importance to eliminating double taxation in the area of the modern service industry, reducing its tax burden, pushing manufacturing enterprises to voluntarily divest producer services, and increasing the supply of producer services. It is imperative to carry out the reform of changing sales tax to a VAT, but since the current VAT was designed based on the features of manufacturing, simple reproduction of it for the service industry on which sales tax is currently levied is obviously too simple, for there are fundamental differences between the process of production and the operation of the service industry and that of manufacturing. In manufacturing, production mainly relies on physical materials including raw materials, fuels, power, semi-manufactures, and so on, and in the current VAT system, after the deductions are made, the object of taxation is basically the added value of products. However, in the service industry, a great deal of production and operation does not rely primarily on the consumption of materials, but on that of non-material human capital and intangible assets including ‘taste,’ ‘originality,’ and so on (Gao 2012). If labor costs in the service industry cannot be deducted, it is possible that the burden of some modern service industries would be heavier than that before the reform, which obviously runs counter to the intent of the reform. For the purpose of encouraging the development of the modern service industry, it has been suggested that intangible assets, human capital, and so on be included in the scope of VAT deduction as early as possible. In addition, there is no explicit instruction in the reform plan of ‘changing sales tax to VAT’ for tax exemption of service <b>exports.</b> Taxes are <b>levied</b> on service products exported from China and compared with the service industry in countries where a VAT is levied on the service industry, the service industry in China is in a disadvantageous position in the international market. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of China's service industry in the international market, especially in the producer services trade, specific measures and rules for the implementation of exempting, deducting and reimbursing taxes levied on the service industry must be worked out as soon as possible.|$|R
