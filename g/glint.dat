5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a <b>glint</b> of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
25|$|At {{the scale}} of the {{wavelength}} of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The <b>glint</b> of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.|$|E

40|$|Rhinolophidae or Horseshoe bats emit {{long and}} {{narrowband}} calls. Fluttering insect prey generates echoes in which amplitude and frequency shifts are present, i. e. <b>glints.</b> These <b>glints</b> are reliable cues {{about the presence}} of prey and also encode certain properties of the prey. In this paper, we propose that these <b>glints,</b> i. e. the dominant <b>glints,</b> are also reliable signals upon which to base prey localization. In contrast to the spectral cues used by many other bats, the localization cues in Rhinolophidae are most likely provided by self-induced amplitude modulations generated by pinnae movement. Amplitude variations in the echo not introduced by the moving pinnae can be considered as noise interfering with the localization process. The amplitude of the dominant <b>glints</b> is very stable. Therefore, these parts of the echoes contain very little noise. However, using only the dominant <b>glints</b> potentially comes at a cost. Depending on the flutter rate of the insect, a limited number of dominant <b>glints</b> will be present in each echo giving the bat a limited number of sample points on which to base localization. We evaluate the feasibility of a strategy under which Rhinolophidae use only dominant <b>glints.</b> We use a computational model of the echolocation task faced by Rhinolophidae. Our model includes the spatial filtering of the echoes by the morphology of the sonar apparatus of Rhinolophus rouxii as well as the amplitude modulations introduced by pinnae movements. Using this model, we evaluate whether the dominant <b>glints</b> provide Rhinolophidae with enough information to perform localization. Our simulations show that Rhinolophidae can use dominant <b>glints</b> in the echoes a...|$|R

25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause a <b>glint</b> of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Little Round Top was undefended by Union troops. Maj. Gen. George Meade, {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac, had ordered Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps to defend {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge, which would have just included Little Round Top. But Sickles, defying Meade's orders, moved his corps a few hundred yards west to the Emmitsburg Road and the Peach Orchard, causing a large salient in the line, which was also too long to defend properly. His left flank was anchored in Devil's Den. When Meade discovered this situation, he dispatched his chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, to attempt to deal with the situation south of Sickles's position. Climbing Little Round Top, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw the <b>glint</b> of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers, including Washington Roebling, to find help from any available units in the vicinity.|$|E
500|$|The cover {{has three}} [...] "Zoso-like" [...] icons for each band member: a jacket, {{a pair of}} pants and an {{airplane}}. Delonge and Hoppus' symbols became the pants and jacket, respectively, leaving Barker the airplane despite begging his bandmates not to assign him the symbol, citing his fear of flying, but he took it anyway. Ironically in 2008 Travis was in a plane crash fortunately surviving the wreck. Journalist Joe Shooman called the title [...] "a <b>glint</b> of sharp intelligence behind the boys' humour as it draws oblique attention to the fact that, latterly, Blink-182 had often been encouraged to get naked in order to promote themselves. It's a very self-aware album title in that context and a portent, perhaps, of what was to come".|$|E

500|$|Few optical {{effects were}} used in Conan the Barbarian. Milius professed ambivalence to fantasy elements, preferring a story that showcases accomplishments {{realized}} through one's own efforts without reliance on the supernatural. He {{also said that he}} followed the advice of Cobb and other production members on the matters of special effects. [...] Peter Kuran's Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE) effects company was engaged in October 1981 to handle postproduction optical effects for Conan. VCE had previously worked on films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Dragonslayer. Among their tasks for Conan were adding <b>glint</b> and sparkle to the Eye of the Serpent and Valeria's Valkyrie armor. [...] Not all of VCE's work made it to the final print; the flames of Valeria's funeral pyre were originally enhanced by the company, but were later restored to the original version.|$|E

In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: [...] "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read {{about it all the}} time." [...] He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked <b>glint</b> in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running.

Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: [...] "There were three elements that Mike [...] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of <b>glint</b> in his eyes reflected in the rearview mirror, the speedometer pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home". However, when the cover was presented to SST, [...] "someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{features}} a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that [...] "to start the film with the candles being lit... {{would be a}} rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins." [...] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to {{a world in which}} smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent [...] "just a <b>glint</b> of color, and a glimmer of hope." [...] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end. She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.|$|E

[...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that makes all the right moves, but lacks any serious bite."

[...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic."

Measurements on core in the Stillwater Mine core room showed that false positive sulfide classifications occurred at {{breaks in the}} core and there were also problems with camera saturation due to <b>glints</b> from crystal facets within the core. To reduce false positives due to noisy data, a wavelet transform smoothing program was explored. Results indicate classifications improve only marginally with smoothed data for spectral angle mapping techniques. A new lighting technique was developed to decrease saturation due to <b>glints</b> from facets within the core samples. This appears to have decreased the <b>glints</b> {{and it has the}} added benefit of greatly decreasing false positives near the breaks in the core...|$|R

2500|$|An antireflective or anti-reflection (AR) coating {{is a type}} {{of optical}} coating applied to the surface of lenses and other optical {{elements}} to reduce reflection. In typical imaging systems, this improves the efficiency since less light is lost. In complex systems such as a telescope, the reduction in reflections also improves the contrast of the image by elimination of stray light. This is especially important in planetary astronomy. In other applications, the primary benefit is the elimination of the reflection itself, such as a coating on eyeglass lenses that makes the eyes of the wearer more visible to others, or a coating to reduce the <b>glint</b> from a covert viewer's binoculars or telescopic sight.|$|E
