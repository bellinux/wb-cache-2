5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time he was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} SaGa 1 was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{and that of}} SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito, while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka. Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, the emphasis was on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance or sound. The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the twelfth}} century, {{education}} within the Byzantine Greek population was {{more advanced than}} in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout {{the latter half of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a special place, not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), only a small part, about 10%, of the population was Christian.|$|E
