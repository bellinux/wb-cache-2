25|$|Granting the {{government}} additional power {{to reduce the}} compensation of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals,</b> as it does with Medicare and Medicaid. This would likely occur with a single-payer solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{health care}} system {{immediately}} became overloaded. In the severely affected areas, nearly 70 percent were under-qualified doctors.

50|$|In a {{comparison}} of funding arrangements, institutions an-d level of resources, prevention of long waiting lists has been attributed by Siciliani and Hurst to {{a high number of}} <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospital</b> beds, combined with fee-for-service funding of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> private <b>hospitals.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{no doctor}} or nurse working in Arrentières. The nearest <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospital</b> {{are located in}} Bar-sur-Aube.|$|R
25|$|Progressive medical {{reforms were}} {{initiated}} by English women in India {{under the leadership}} of the Marchioness of Dufferin and Lady Curzon by supplying women <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> for women. There is a Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore, shown to the right.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, in {{parallel}} to the single-payer healthcare system there are private insurers, which provide coverage for some private <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Employers will sometimes offer private health insurance as a benefit, with 14.8% of the Spanish population being covered under private health insurance in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Our <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{are failing}} {{to provide us with}} care we need while {{delivering}} a staggering amount that we don't need. Current estimates suggest that as much as 20 to 30 percent of what we spend, or about $500 billion, goes toward useless, potentially harmful care.|$|E

25|$|There are {{basically}} {{two types of}} health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{a change}} of {{government}} at the December 1975 election, the Fraser Coalition government established the Medibank Review Committee in January 1976. The Committee findings were not made public but the new program was announced in a Ministerial Statement to Parliament on 20 May 1976. 'Medibank Mark II' was launched on 1 October 1976 and included a 2.5% levy on taxable incomes, with the option of taking out private health insurance instead of paying the levy. Other changes included reducing rebates to <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} the synopsis {{for the six}} films in Six Stories from the Outskirts of Bucharest, Cristi Puiu showed them to Răzvan Rădulescu, a writer and screenwriter who collaborated with Puiu on writing Stuff and Dough (2001) and Lucian Pintilie's Niki and Flo (2003). They started researching The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu by going to various <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals,</b> then completed the screenplay. Puiu and Rădulescu entered the screenplay in the 2004 Script Contest organised by the CNC. However, the CNC refused financing for The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu. Puiu appealed directly to Răzvan Theodorescu, the Minister of Culture, who approved it immediately, overruling the CNC decision.|$|E

25|$|The Alberta District Nursing Service {{administered}} {{health care}} in the predominantly rural and impoverished areas of Alberta {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Founded in 1919 to meet maternal and emergency medical needs by the United Farm Women of Alberta (UFWA), the Nursing Service treated prairie settlers living in primitive areas lacking <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed minor surgery, conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-World War II discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services. The passage of provincial health and universal hospital insurance in 1957 precipitated the eventual phasing out of the obsolete District Nursing Service in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
25|$|CPOE {{systems can}} take years to install and configure. Despite ample {{evidence}} of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards. According {{to a study by}} RAND Health, the US healthcare system could save more than 81 billion dollars annually, reduce adverse medical events and improve the quality of care if it were to widely adopt CPOE and other health information technology. As more hospitals become aware of the financial benefits of CPOE, and more physicians with a familiarity with computers enter practice, increased use of CPOE is predicted. Several high-profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred, so a major effort must be focused on change management, including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.|$|E

25|$|That Dragon, Cancer {{bore out}} from {{experiences}} that Ryan and Amy Green had after their third child Joel {{was diagnosed with}} an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor at twelve months of age, around November 2010. The doctors had only given the child about four months to live, but despite developing seven additional tumors, Joel continued to live for four more years. Joel's condition left him mentally underdeveloped, being unable to speak even by age 2, and he required additional parental care and supervision, alongside numerous visits to <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> for palliative care and chemotherapy treatment. In early 2014, Joel's condition worsened, and the Greens temporarily moved from Colorado to San Francisco {{to take part in}} an experimental drug trial. The new drug failed to relieve any of the new symptoms. Ryan and Amy, following the advice of the hospice, decided to take him off his feeding tube, and he died on March 13, 2014 at the age of five.|$|E

500|$|Feldman {{noted that}} the advent of online support groups, {{combined}} with access to vast stores of medical information, enabled [...] individuals seeking to gain sympathy by relating a series of harrowing medical or psychological problems that defy comprehension to misuse the groups. Communication forums specializing in medical or psychological recovery were established to give lay users support in navigating often confusing and frustrating medical processes and bureaucracy. Communities often formed on those forums, {{with the goal of}} sharing information to help other members. Medical websites also became common, giving lay users access to literature {{in a way that was}} accessible to those without specific medical training. As Internet communication grew in popularity, users began to forgo the <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> often consulted for medical advice. Frequenting virtual communities that have experience with a medical problem, Feldman notes, is easier than going through the physical pain or illness that would be necessary before visiting a doctor to get the attention sought. By pretending to be gravely ill, Internet users can gain sympathy from a group whose sole reason for existence is support. [...] Health care professionals, with their limited time, greater medical knowledge, and tendency to be more skeptical in their diagnoses, may be less likely to provide that support.|$|E
30|$|Interviewers {{approached}} patients {{individually and}} gradually acquired {{information for the}} survey, including questions about “sensitive data” that a more general/social survey could hardly obtain.

2500|$|McCaughey {{said the}} National Coordinator would monitor patients' {{electronic}} medical records {{to ensure that}} <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> treated patients {{in a way that}} [...] "the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective" [...] and that <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>hospitals</b> deviating from the government's [...] "electronically delivered protocols" [...] would be penalized. She said that the Federal Coordinating Council would be composed of appointed bureaucrats charged with a costcutting agenda that would slow the development of new medical products and drugs and ration healthcare for senior citizens. She opined that the bureaucrats would use a comparative effectiveness formula, which, in the United Kingdom, had resulted in a requirement that senior citizens go blind in one eye before the government would pay for a treatment to save the sight in the other eye.|$|E
