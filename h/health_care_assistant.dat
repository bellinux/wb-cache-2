40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how newly {{qualified}} nurses delegate to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> when delivering bedside care. Aim: To explore newly qualified nurses' experiences of delegating to, and supervising, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants.</b> Design: Ethnographic case studies. Settings: In-patient wards in three English National Health Service (NHS) acute hospitals. Participants: 33 newly qualified nurses were observed, 10 <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> and 12 ward managers. Methods: Participant observation and in-depth interviews. Findings: We suggest that newly qualified nurses learn to delegate to, and supervise, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> through re-working (`recontextualising') knowledge; and that this process occurs within a transitional (`liminal') space. Conclusions: Conceptualising learning in this way allows {{an understanding of the}} shift from student to newly qualified nurse and the associated interaction of people, space and experience. Using ethnographic case studies allows the experiences of those undergoing these transitions to be vocalised by the key people involved...|$|R

40|$|There {{is little}} {{experience}} {{of the use of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in the community to support breastfeeding in the UK. The aim of this project was to evaluate the implementation of a small-scale pilot project using <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in the community to support disadvantaged women breastfeeding. The evaluation was funded as part of the Department of Health's Infant Feeding Initiative. A longitudinal observational and quasi-experimental design was used.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether case management provided by <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in small primary care practices {{is more effective}} than usual care in improving depression symptoms and process of care for patients with major depression. DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled trial. A central automated system generated the randomization scheme, which was stratified by urban and rural practices; allocation sequence was concealed until groups were assigned. SETTING: 74 small primary care practices in Germany from April 2005 to September 2007. PATIENTS: 626 patients age 18 to 80 years with major depression. INTERVENTION: Structured telephone interview to monitor depression symptoms and support for adherence to medication, with feedback to the family physician. MEASUREMENTS: Depression symptoms at 12 months, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9); secondary outcomes were patient assessment of chronic illness care, adherence to medication, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients were randomly assigned to case management and 316 to usual care. At 12 months, 249 intervention recipients and 278 control patients were assessed; 555 patients were included in a modified intention-to-treat-analysis (267 intervention recipients vs. 288 control patients). Compared with control patients, intervention recipients had lower mean PHQ- 9 values in depression symptoms (- 1. 41 [95 % CI, - 2. 49 to - 0. 33]; P = 0. 014), more favorable assessments of care (3. 41 vs. 3. 11; P = 0. 011), and increased treatment adherence (2. 70 vs. 2. 53; P = 0. 042). Quality-of-life scores did not differ between groups. LIMITATION: Patients, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants,</b> family physicians, and researchers were not blinded to group assignment, and 12 -month follow-up of patients was incomplete.

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} extent of {{adherence}} to hand hygiene {{as a means for}} infection control by in-patients’ caregivers, and to identify factors in relation to caregivers’ adherence of hand hygiene practice guidelines. Background: Low compliance rate of hand hygiene among inpatients’ caregivers may lead to cross infection in hospitals and may be associated with detectable changes in the incidence of healthcare-associated infections. While hand hygiene education regarding infection control is given to each <b>health</b> <b>care</b> worker working in hospital settings, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> and patients’ family members who often provide care to in-hospital patients have not received or undergone compulsory hand hygiene training. Little is known about the inpatients’ caregivers’ attitude towards hand hygiene and their hand hygiene practices in mainland China. Such information is particular important since non-hospital <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> (HCAs) and patient’s family members (PFMs) are common caregivers for in-patients in mainland China. Such information can guide policymakers to formulate specific health polices to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted from February 2015 to March 2015 in a tertiary public hospital in Guangzhou, southern China. Survey data were collected using the pretested questionnaire developed by Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan on 232 <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> and patient’s family members selected in the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery and Department of Geriatrics in this hospital. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the frequency, mean, standard deviation and other statistics. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} hand hygiene knowledge and hand hygiene practice when caring in-patients, adjusted for the effect of demographic variables. The level of statistically significant was set at 0. 05. Results: Nearly half of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> and patient’s family members had good knowledge of hand hygiene (mean scores= 69. 11 + 8. 25). Over 90 % participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene and current health education tools regarding hand hygiene. Only 41. 4 % of participants had good hand hygiene practice (mean scores= 24. 47 + 4. 36). Results of multivariate linear regression analysis showed that female gender (β= 1. 511, P= 0. 034) and knowledge level towards hand hygiene (β= 0. 07, P = 0. 001) had positive correlation with hand hygiene practice. Obstacles to hand hygiene mainly included misperception of gloves use, lack of time, and poor hand hygiene knowledge. Increasing hand washing facilities was considered as the most effective intervention to improve their adherence. Conclusion: Although the majority of patient’s caregivers had a positive attitude towards hand hygiene, lack of knowledge regarding ‘Five Moments for Hand Hygiene’ and low hand hygiene adherence still persisted among <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> and patient’s family members. Future study should explore strategies to improve HCAs and PFMs knowledge and practice about hand hygiene. Health education and surveillance regarding hand hygiene should be conducted among patient’s caregivers. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
5000|$|The 1980s saw further {{changes in}} the NHS' workforce. The Thatcher Government {{encouraged}} (and eventually forced) health authorities to put most ancillary services out for competitive tender, effectively outsourcing the jobs of those workers. This led to a substantial reduction in numbers, with 1/3 of ancillary posts disappearing between 1980 and 1987. Those that remained were largely employed by private agencies and no longer subject to national agreements or trade union collective bargaining. For nurses, the introduction of Project 2000 meant that their profession now centred around degree courses run by universities rather than nurse training courses run by teaching hospitals. This effectively removed student nurses from hospital workforces and helped raise {{the status of the}} profession. Much of the physical labour done by student nurses was now passed to a new category of health worker, the <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Assistant,</b> a role than mirrors that of [...] "auxiliary nurses" [...] in the early NHS. The status of General Practitioners as outside contractors was largely confirmed by the market-based reforms introduced by the Thatcher, Major and Blair governments. The working lives of Hospital Doctors changed from the 1970s onwards, as career paths and work patterns became increasingly formalised. Set rules on hours were introduced in the 1970s and refined in the 1980s and 1990s to dramatically reduce the number of hours junior doctors were expected to contribute.|$|E

40|$|Background: Expected {{growth in}} the demand for health {{services}} has generated interest in the more effective deployment of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants.</b> Programs encouraging German general practitioners (GPs) to share responsibility for care with specially qualified <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> in the family practice (VERAHs) have existed for several years.

Methods: As part of an evaluation study on the deployment of VERAHs in GP-centered <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> we used a questionnaire to ask about task delegation within the practice team. From a list of tasks that VERAHs are specifically trained to carry out, GPs were asked to indicate which they actually delegate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{short report}} {{describes}} the development from page to {{stage of a}} work of theatre based on an ethnographic study. The originating research focused on the work of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> (nurse's aides) whose direct impact on {{the quality of life of}} highly dependent people is often overlooked. The research followed hospital personnel on wards specialising in the 'challenging behaviour' associated with dementia in central England. Conventional research outputs failed to engage the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>assistants</b> themselves, so we turned to theatre to remedy this. The development of the field notes into theatre was characterised by the artistic freedom given to the playwright, in contrast to more data-led approaches to theatre making. The account of the process of creating the play, Inside Out of Mind, is followed a description of how the work was received by specialist and general audiences totalling 2000 +. The discussion seeks to locate the whole enterprise in relation to the field of research-based theatre and explores how the production and its associated learning events relate to definitions of research-based theatre in the light of recent attempts to encapsulate this broad and diverse methodology...|$|R
