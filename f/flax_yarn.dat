The recommended level of residual pectin, lignin and hemicellulose (wt. %) is: after enzymatic treatment P 1 = 1, 0 ± 0, 1; L 1 = 3, 9 ± 0, 3; Hc 1 = 11, 0 ± 1, 0; after peroxide bleaching P 2 = 0, 4 ± 0, 05; L 2 = 2, 3 ± 0, 3; Hc 2 = 7, 5 ± 0, 5.

Buckling and post-buckling are two loading conditions that can occur in large wind turbine blades due to gravitational, aerodynamic and centrifugal forces. In the work reported here, experimental studies of buckling and post-buckling failure in multi-delaminated composite beams were carried out.

These properties were used in numerical models of the microbond test, and good agreement with experiments was obtained for both systems. When the interface and fibre properties were used in numerical models of single <b>flax</b> <b>yarns</b> impregnated with polypropylene or epoxy resin, the stiffness behaviour showed good agreement with experiments for flax/polypropylene and flax/epoxy systems.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{reinforcement}} for unidirectional natural fiber composites has been developed, where a paper layer is assembled {{with a layer of}} unidirectional <b>flax</b> <b>yarns.</b> The paper layer chemically and mechanically bonds to the loose yarns to maintain their alignment and enables better manipulability of the reinforcement during stacking in the mold. Unfortunately, the paper layer adversely affects the permeability of the whole reinforcement to liquid resin and thus limits the impregnation quality of the final part. In this paper, a technique is adopted to increase the impregnation performance by modifying the architecture of the fibrous network in the paper layer. In particular, a method has been developed to replace a proportion of the Kraft fibers by short flax fibers in the paper layer, in an attempt to open the structure and increase the paper permeability. Permeability measurements show a major improvement in global reinforcement permeability. Basic mechanical properties of resulting composites were also analysed. Results show a slight decrease in modulus and strength when the paper layer is present. This is compensated by an important reduction in variability.

The wetting capability of the composites was tested firstly. The wetting rate illustrated that {{the weight of the}} composites were fast increased when immersed in the water. And the impact property of the composites after saturated in the water for different duration time was tested. The impact property of the four-layer plain fabrics composites was decreased after immersing in water for one-, two-and three-month.

40|$|Natural {{cellulosic}} fibres such as flax fibres present interesting {{mechanical properties}} {{as well as}} biodegradability, and by-products, such as short flax fibres, {{could be used to}} produce geotextiles to stabilise soils. Today, geotextiles are often made of coir fibres, which have a high lignin percentage leading to their slow degradation in soil. Fibres with a high cellulosic content, such as those of flax, exhibit lower resistance to soil degradation. This study investigates solutions to improve this parameter with a view to increasing their service life and therefore their credibility compared to coir fibres for geotextile applications. For this purpose, a cellulose coating of yarns made of short flax fibres was performed and its stability under a water flow was assessed. The ability to form a cellulose sheath was estimated by chromaticity measurements of flax fibres after applying a dye specific to lignin. Infrared spectrometry analysis to monitor the level of protection against degradation by cellulolytic enzymes was also carried out. It appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate. Then, the possibility of conferring antibacterial properties on the cellulose coating by chelating phytoalexin molecules such as gramine on it was assayed and proven to be effective against soil cellulolytic bacteria such as Cellvibrio fulvus and Cellvibrio vulgaris.

40|$|With {{the use of}} Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) for {{composite}} {{manufacturing in}} the transportation industry, the complexity of part shapes and quality requirements have increased tremendously. There is thus a strong need to accurately control and understand liquid flow through porous preforms in order to minimise void formation in composite parts. Capillary issues and wetting affinity between fibers and resin {{have to be considered}} to understand and simulate properly the resin flow during processing. Flax fibers are usually considered adequate bio-reinforcements for composites, thanks to their good mechanical properties and low density. Nevertheless their hydrophilic character makes them sensitive to moisture sorption and incompatible with hydrophobic resins. In this work, a thermal treatment aiming to modify the surface chemistry of flax fibers has been applied {{in order to make the}} fiber surface more hydrophobic and decrease the sensitivity to water sorption. Measurements on elementary fibers have been performed to quantify the effect of the thermal treatment on surface energy. On the other hand, the thermal treatment could also result in a decrease of the mechanical properties of flax fibers. The decrease of mechanical properties of yarns does not necessarily imply a decrease in the composite mechanical properties if the interfacial properties are enhanced. In order to evaluate effect of treatment on porosity formation and the Inter-Laminar Shear Strength (ILSS) of composites, panels reinforced by both untreated and treated flax fibers were manufactured by Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM), with strictly controlled and identical process parameters.

Single tests for the reinforcement of test beams from light-weight concrete and plaster were performed with the producted knittted grids.

Body Temperature SMAs (BT SMA) that regain their (straight) form when they are subject to human body temperature were used for this purpose. Clothing and bed sheeting are potential applications of these hybrid structures, which become wrinkle-free when they are exposed to the heat of the body, a hair dryer or that generated by an electrical current.

40|$|The article {{reports on}} the {{successful}} processing of flax-reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) profiles by thermoplastic pultrusion into sandwich' structures consisting of commingled yarns as outer layers and layers of nonwoven material in the core section. The results showed that a good quality matrix impregnation was obtained. The profiles produced from only commingled yarns had higher impact strengths due to yarns {{in the middle of}} the profiles; the matrix of which did not melt during pultrusion. The flexural properties of the composites improved with increasing nonwoven layers. Good PLA impregnation improved the flexural properties. The tensile strength of the sandwich' structures was much lower than that of commingled yarn-based composites, this being attributed to the poor distribution of flax fibres and poor interfacial adhesion leading to poor stress transfer from matrix to fibres. Crystallinity decreased as the number of nonwoven layers increased presumably due to blockage of nucleating sites essential for crystal growth. The storage modulus of composites reinforced with commingled yarns was greater than that of the composites reinforced with sandwich' material, confirming effective transfer of stress from matrix to the commingled <b>flax</b> <b>yarns</b> and indicating that increasing nonwoven layers decreased adhesion between reinforcement and the matrix. The effects of a wide range of pultrusion process parameters on the mechanical properties of resulting profiles were investigated. Higher die temperatures (290 degrees C) and lower pulling speeds (0. 5 mmin(- 1)) improved the mechanical properties due to better melting and lower viscosity of the matrix, enabling increased penetration within the reinforcement. Flexural and tensile properties of microwave-heated samples were very low due to fibre degradation. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that fibre impregnation was good in sandwich' systems, but fibre distribution remained a challenge...|$|R

The results obtained have been compared with the results of flame retardant metaaramide yarns Nomex (DuPont, USA) and with results obtained earlier by co-author of present investigations [1, 2]. The investigation shows that even when the concentration is 4 times lower than basic, it provides similar flammability properties to the analogous properties of Nomex yarns. The differences between properties of various kinds of cellulose yarns were investigated as well. The best results of flammability properties have been obtained for cotton yarns and the lowest - for <b>flax</b> <b>yarns.</b> The reason for these differences can be explained by composition of various kinds of cellulose fibres. The influence of concentration of flame retardant reagent on the strength of yarns was investigated too. The research shows, that oncentration has a negative influence on the strength of yarns – when concentration increases the strength decreases. The results of investigation show that concentration of flame retardant reagent can be used in much lower levels than is recommended by the producer. Also the lower level of concentration supports the higher strength of yarns. The lower concentration can be recommended for textile goods which are not necessary to wash...|$|R

Their hut was quite hidden by trees, and none saw their beauty but the sun by day, and the moon by night, and {{the eyes of the}} stars. The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night, spinning gold <b>flax</b> into <b>yarn,</b> and when one distaff was empty another was given them, so they had no rest. The thread had to be fine and even, and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice or thrice every summer went a journey. Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence, and always returned in the night, so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her, neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came, nor what it was to be used for.|$|R
