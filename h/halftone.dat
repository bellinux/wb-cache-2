40|$|<b>Halftoning</b> {{breaks the}} {{continuous}} tone image into a pattern of black dots and makes an illusion of a continuous image to the observer. <b>Halftoned</b> image is a binary version of the continuous toned image. <b>Halftoning</b> techniques have been widely accepted for the printing of newspapers, magazines as well as fax machines and printers. ^ Inverse <b>halftoning</b> is the reconstruction of continuous toned image from its <b>halftoned</b> version. The need for inverse <b>halftoning</b> arises from the need to manipulate the images, rotation or zooming etc In this thesis we deal with inverse <b>halftoning</b> of images <b>halftoned</b> by error diffusion algorithms. ^ Analysing the spectrum the low frequencies of the <b>halftoned</b> and original image are similar, but the <b>halftoned</b> image contains quantization noise in the higher frequencies. So {{the first step in}} our inverse <b>halftoning</b> method is the removal of high frequency quantization noise by Gaussian lowpass filtering. The second stage of our inverse <b>halftoning</b> algorithm is the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm which alternatively projects the image onto the two convex sets, repeats and converges in the intersection of the two convex sets.

40|$|Abstract—Video <b>halftoning</b> {{is a key}} {{technology}} for use in elec-tronic paper (e-paper) or smart paper, which is an emerging display device that has received considerable attention recently. In this paper, a temporal frequency of flickering-distortion optimized video <b>halftoning</b> method is proposed. We first uncover three visual defects that conventional neighboring frame referencing-based video <b>halftoning</b> methods, due to their sequential changes of ref-erence frames, will encounter. To deal with the problem, we then propose a reference frame update per GOP-based error diffusion video <b>halftoning</b> method based on a flickering sensitivity-based human visual model. To efficiently compromise between average temporal frequency of flickering (ATFoF) and visual quality, temporal frequency of flickering-distortion (TFoFD) {{is presented as a}} metric for video <b>halftoning</b> performance evaluation. Based on the proposed probability model of video <b>halftoning,</b> the TFoFD curve can be accurately estimated to optimize the tradeoff between quality and ATFoF before the video is <b>halftoned.</b> Our temporal frequency of flickering-distortion optimization strategy can also be applied to other video <b>halftoning</b> schemes for performance improvement. Experimental results and comparisons with known methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our video <b>halftoning</b> method.

40|$|<b>Halftoning</b> is the {{rendition}} of continuous-tone pictures on displays, paper or other media that {{are capable of}} producing only two levels. In digital <b>halftoning,</b> we perform the gray scale to bilevel conversion digitally using software or hardware. In the last 3 decades, several algorithms have evolved for <b>halftoning.</b> Examples of algorithms include ordered dither, error diffusion, blue noise masks, green noise <b>halftoning,</b> direct binary search (DBS), and dot diffusion. In this paper we first review some of the algorithms which have a direct bearing on our paper and then describe some of the more recent advances in the field. The dot diffusion method for digital <b>halftoning</b> has the advantage of pixel-level parallelism unlike the error diffusion method, which is a popular <b>halftoning</b> method. However, the image quality offered by error diffusion is still regarded as superior to most of the other known methods. We first review error diffusion and dot diffusion, and describe a recent method to improve the image quality of the dot diffusion algorithm which takes advantage of the Human Visual System (HVS) function. Then, we discuss the inverse <b>halftoning</b> problem. Inverse <b>halftoning</b> is the reconstruction of a continuous tone image from its <b>halftoned</b> version. We give a brief review of the methods used in inverse <b>halftoning,</b> and discuss the advantadges of a recent inverse <b>halftoning</b> algorithm: Look Up Table (LUT) Method for inverse <b>halftoning.</b> The method is extremely fast (no filtering is required) and the image quality achieved is comparable to the best method...|$|R
40|$|A least-squares model-based {{approach}} to digital <b>halftoning</b> is proposed. It exploits both a printer model {{and a model}} of visual perception. It produces a <b>halftoned</b> image that minimizes the squared error between {{the response of the}} visual model to the original image and the response of the printer and visual models to the <b>halftoned</b> image. For onedimensional <b>halftoning,</b> where each column is processed independently, it is shown that least-squares <b>halftoning</b> can be optimally performed with the Viterbi algorithm. Applying this {{approach to}} simple visual and printer models yields better <b>halftones</b> than conventional one-dimensional methods. Though one-dimensional <b>halftoning</b> is seldom used in practice, the results of this method are of interest because their appearance is due only to the models and the fundamental nature of <b>halftoning.</b> Thus they can serve as a guide to the design of two-dimensional approaches for which only approximate least-squares solutions are possible. 1 Portions of this wor [...] ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 97 - 101 <b>Halftoning</b> {{refers to}} the problem of rendering continuous-tone (contone) images on display and printing devices which are capable of reproducing {{only a limited number of}} colors. A new adaptive <b>halftoning</b> method using the adaptive QR- RLS algorithm is developed for error diffusion which is one of the <b>halftoning</b> techniques. Also, a diagonal scanning strategy to exploit the human visual system properties in processing the image is proposed. Simulation results on color images demonstrate the superior quality of the new method compared to the existing methods. Another problem studied in this thesis is inverse <b>halftoning</b> which is the problem of recovering a contone image from a given <b>halftoned</b> image. A novel inverse <b>halftoning</b> method is developed for restoring a contone image from the <b>halftoned</b> image. A set theoretic formulation is used where sets are defined using the prior information about the problem. A new space domain projection is introduced assuming the <b>halftoning</b> is performed,with error diffusion, and the error diffusion filter kernel is known.

40|$|Video <b>halftoning</b> is a {{technology}} used to render a video onto a display device {{that can only}} display limited number of levels. Conventional video <b>halftoning</b> algorithms produce blue noise video <b>halftones</b> which are prone to flickering. Dedicated deflickering processes are hence required to reduce flickering. These processes share a common approach in which pixels are artificially made stable subject to some quality constraints. Due to the difficulty to control the extent of stability, artifacts caused by overstability such as dirty window effect, subtle motion and residual shadow are easily found in video <b>halftones.</b> In this paper, we suggest producing green noise video <b>halftones</b> instead of blue noise video <b>halftones.</b> By doing so, we can effectively reduce flickering and eliminate artifacts caused by overstability from the root simultaneously.

40|$|<b>Halftoning</b> of a colour {{image is}} {{normally}} performed by <b>halftoning</b> the colour separations independently. Each <b>halftoned</b> image then builds the corresponding colour {{separation of the}} final <b>halftoned</b> colour image. In conventional <b>halftoning</b> methods different screen angles for different separations {{are being used to}} reduce the correlation between the separations to reduce artefacts in the form of moiré patterns for example.

With a detailed control of the dot placement it is possible to increase the colour gamut and reduce the colour noise of the image. The present paper discusses the problem and presents a <b>halftoning</b> method that <b>halftones</b> the colour separations dependently, that is, it can control the dot placement not only in each separation by itself, but also in each separation in relation to the others. Predicting and modelling the dot gain accurately is another problem of image reproduction in general since the effect of dot gain has to be considered {{in one way or another}} when the <b>halftoned</b> image is to be printed on a substrate.
