40|$|Background: These {{two studies}} {{examined}} whether facial expressions in student identification photographs were connected with <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visitation. Method: In Study 1, participants (N = 267) completed a short online survey that detailed {{the number of}} times they had visited a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the last year. In Study 2, participants (N = 435) answered this same question, but <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits were divided into four categories: illness, injury, mood-related, and preventive. In both studies, the photographs on participants’ student identification cards were coded as no smile, non-Duchenne smile, or Duchenne smile. Results: Logistic regressions revealed that in Study 1, participants with non-Duchenne or Duchenne smiles {{were more likely to have}} visited a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the past year than participants with no smile in their photograph. However, Study 2 revealed that this finding was driven by preventive <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits: participants with non-Duchenne or Duchenne smiles in their photographs were more likely to have visited a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> in the past year for preventive purposes than participants with no smile in their photograph. No facial expression differences were found for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits for illness, injury, or mood-related concerns. Conclusions: Smiling in photographs is connected to preventive <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>center</b> visits, a positive health behavior. Future research should continue to investigate whether smiles in photographs are connected with other important health outcome...|$|R
