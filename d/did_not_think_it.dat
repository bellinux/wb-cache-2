5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has. In their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, {{they said that the}} gameplay still holds up. They found the demon fusion system to be excellent and fun, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> felt outdated. Kurt Kalata and Cristopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 {{appreciated the}} game's lowered difficulty compared to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt {{that it would be}} harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|The humor {{magazine}} National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss {{after they}} graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu {{was born}} in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would become a full-time career. He said {{it was a way to}} make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E

5|$|After {{examining}} the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the {{species in the}} genus Oryzomys in 1948. He remarked {{that it was an}} especially distinctive member of that genus, and hence classified it in its own subgenus Micronectomys. J. Hernández-Camacho described a second species of Micronectomys, Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi, from Colombia in 1957. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated O.dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name Micronectomys was a nomen nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Micronectomys remains a nomen nudum. Hershkovitz also noted that while O.dimidiatus resembles a juvenile Nectomys in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). He accepted O.borreroi as an Oryzomys, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> closely related to O.dimidiatus. Six years later, Alfred Gardner and James Patton instead suggested that O.borreroi was a Zygodontomys, and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that it is the same as Zygodontomys brunneus.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
5|$|Haakon's councillors {{had sought}} to {{reconcile}} Haakon and Skule by proposing marriage between Haakon and Skule's daughter Margrete in 1219. Haakon accepted the proposal (although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would change much politically), but the marriage between Haakon and Margrete {{did not take place}} before 1225, partly due to the conflict with Ribbung. The relationship between Haakon and Skule nevertheless deteriorated further during the 1230s, and attempts of settlements at meetings in 1233 and 1236 only distanced them more from each other. Periodically, the two nonetheless reconciled and spent a great amount of time together, only to have their friendship destroyed, according to the saga by intrigues derived from rumours and slander by men who played the two against each other. Skule was the first person ever in Norway to be titled Duke (hertug) in 1237, but instead of control over a region gained the rights to the incomes from a third of the syssels scattered across the whole of Norway. This was part of an attempt by Haakon to limit Skule's power. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. Although he had some support in Trøndelag, Opplandene and in eastern Viken, he could not stand up to Haakon's forces. The rebellion ended when Skule was killed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed king of Norway. This revolt is generally taken to mark the final end of Norway's civil war era.|$|E

25|$|He {{also played}} soccer for Natal, but {{gave it up}} in 1954, partly to avoid {{injuries}} that might jeopardise his cricket career, and partly because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> fair to ask his employers to give him leave to play two sports.|$|E
25|$|The House of Breath was {{received}} with critical success and puzzlement. Critics appreciated Goyen’s lyric and evocative prose {{but at the}} same time <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> always worked in the author’s favor. Goyen’s family and the people in Trinity, Texas were troubled by what appeared to be the book’s disturbing autobiographical look at a “fictional” family in a “fictional” East Texas town.|$|E
25|$|Cross {{initially}} rebuffed {{efforts by}} the justices {{to ask about the}} issue still being argued by Soler, that the other statutory claims were non-arbitrable as well.

On April 25, 2006, Williams was suspended for the entire 2006 season. It has been suggested that the substance may have been an herb related to his interest in holistic medicine.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the tenth}} issue of his {{periodical}} The Moment could be published, Kierkegaard {{collapsed on the}} street. He stayed {{in the hospital for}} over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He said to Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> so.|$|E

25|$|To Photios, we are indebted {{for almost}} all we possess of Ctesias, Memnon of Heraclea, Conon, the lost books of Diodorus Siculus, and the lost {{writings}} of Arrian. Theology and ecclesiastical history are also very fully represented, but poetry and ancient philosophy are almost entirely ignored. It seems that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessary {{to deal with those}} authors with whom every well-educated man would naturally be familiar. The literary criticisms, generally distinguished by keen and independent judgment, and the excerpts vary considerably in length. The numerous biographical notes are probably taken from the work of Hesychius of Miletus.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 1865, Lee held {{a council}} of war at which Lee decided that Major General Cadmus M. Wilcox's {{division}} must recapture a crucial elevated {{portion of their}} old picket line called McIlwaine's Hill. Also on that date, Lee wrote to Davis that he feared {{it would be impossible}} to prevent Sherman joining forces with Grant and that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> prudent to maintain the Confederate army's current positions as Sherman came near to them. After the Fort Stedman defeat, Lee realized that he could not detach only a portion of his army to send to Johnston in North Carolina and still maintain the Richmond and Petersburg defenses.|$|E
25|$|In 1828 Maria and Emily {{joined a}} {{boarding}} school in Paris, which later influenced scenes in Maria's second novel Love’s Sacrifice in 1868. A year later they {{were removed from the}} school due to Emily's poor health and after their father was appointed captain of the port of Gibraltar in 1831 he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to appoint another governess. Though their formal education was at an end, Maria and Emliy continued to improve themselves by travelling extensively and became expert linguists through their visits to France, Spain and Italy, reading books from their father's extensive library, and became acquainted with many intellectuals of the age through their father's contacts.|$|E
