500|$|The book is 15,000 words {{long and}} was first {{published}} in January 2011 as an electronic book only, priced at USD$4. The Economist noted that the [...] "publishing model <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> in its own right". A hardback version, which Cowen dubbed [...] "the retrogression", was published in June 2011. Yglesias described the publication as an innovation in [...] "current affairs publishing" [...] and [...] "much shorter and cheaper than a conventional book in a way that actually leaves you wanting to read more once you finish it. My guess is that this is the future of books." [...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|E
500|$|Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 {{that using}} Twitter for [...] "literate communication" [...] is [...] "about {{as likely as}} firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad". In September 2008, the {{journalist}} Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into [...] "a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> {{and ought to be}} shared with the world". One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful." ...|$|E

500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which <b>is</b> <b>fascinating,</b> because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{film editor}} Susan Korda's 2005 lecture, [...] "We'll Fix It in the Edit!?", at the Berlinale Talent Campus, she broadly {{explained}} {{the contribution of}} editing to the film: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> in Jaws is that the shark has a personality, the shark has an intelligence, indeed sometimes I think the shark {{has a sense of}} humor, morbid as it might be. And that was all achieved in the first two acts of the film before you see the shark. So the cutting was very essential for that." [...] David Bordwell has used the second shark attack scene in Jaws as (literally) a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in the late 1960s. The innovation, which Fields herself named the [...] "wipe by cut", can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a telephoto lens. The cut to a different framing of the character occurs during the interruption by a figure who passes between the camera and the character. The cut thus masks itself, and avoids drawing the viewer's attention away from the narrative of the scene.|$|E
500|$|NBC were {{positive}} about the project, {{but there was still}} some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen that aired on ABC was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became [...] "too gay". Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through <b>is</b> <b>fascinating,</b> but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's like that When Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex always gets in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E

[...] Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that it was [...] "somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring." [...] Variety's 'Robe' believed the film was a [...] "ig, beautiful, but plodding sci-fi epic... A major achievement in cinematography and special effects, 2001 lacks dramatic appeal to a large degree and only conveys suspense after the halfway mark." [...] Andrew Sarris called it [...] "one of the grimmest films I have ever seen in my life...2001 is a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points." [...] (Sarris reversed his opinion upon a second viewing of the film, and declared, [...] "2001 is indeed a major work by a major artist.") John Simon felt it was [...] "a regrettable failure, although not a total one. This film <b>is</b> <b>fascinating</b> when it concentrates on apes or machines... and dreadful when it deals with the in-betweens: humans...2001, for all its lively visual and mechanical spectacle, is a kind of space-Spartacus and, more pretentious still, a shaggy God story." [...] Eminent historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. deemed the film [...] "morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long... a film out of control". The BBC said that its slow pacing often alienates modern audiences more than it did upon its initial release.|$|E
