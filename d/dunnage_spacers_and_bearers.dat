40|$|The {{influence}} of polydopamine- and polydopamine-. graft-poly(ethylene glycol) -coated feed <b>spacers</b> <b>and</b> membranes, copper-coated feed <b>spacers,</b> <b>and</b> commercially-available biostatic feed spacers on biofouling {{has been studied}} in membrane fouling simulators. Feed <b>spacers</b> <b>and</b> membranes applied in practical membrane filtration systems were used; biofouling development was monitored by feed channel pressure drop increase and biomass accumulation. Polydopamine and polydopamine-. g-PEG are hydrophilic surface modification agents expected to resist protein and bacterial adhesion, while copper feed <b>spacer</b> coatings <b>and</b> biocides infused in feed spacers are expected to restrict biological growth. Our studies showed that polydopamine and polydopamine-. g-PEG coatings on feed <b>spacers</b> <b>and</b> membranes, copper coatings on feed <b>spacers,</b> <b>and</b> a commercial biostatic feed spacer {{did not have a}} significant impact on feed channel pressure drop increase and biofilm accumulation as measured by ATP and TOC content. The studied <b>spacer</b> <b>and</b> membrane modifications were not effective for biofouling control; it is doubtful that feed <b>spacer</b> <b>and</b> membrane modification, in general, may be effective for biofouling control regardless of the type of applied coating. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Reinforcement spacers (i. e. bar supports, chairs) {{are crucial}} {{elements}} of reinforced concrete, but {{their influence on}} the microstructure and long-term durability is not clear. This study investigates the effect caused by plastic <b>and</b> cementitious <b>spacers,</b> <b>and</b> steel wire chairs combined with different aggregate sizes, curing and conditioning regimes on the transport properties, microstructure and chloride-induced corrosion of concrete structures. Concrete cylindrical samples were prepared with 25 and 50 mm high plastic, steel <b>and</b> cementitious <b>spacers.</b> Samples were then cured, conditioned and tested for oxygen diffusivity, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity and chloride diffusivity. Selected samples were pressure impregnated with fluorescent epoxy to study the extent and spatial distribution of epoxy intrusion. The interfacial zone between the <b>spacer</b> <b>and</b> concrete was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscope in the backscattered electron (BSE) mode. The ingress of chloride, particularly near the interface between <b>spacers</b> <b>and</b> concrete matrix was studied using micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF). The effect of plastic <b>and</b> cementitious <b>spacers</b> on chloride- induced corrosion via capillary rise and cyclic wetting/drying was investigated using small reinforced concrete beams. The feasibility of improving the bond between <b>spacer</b> <b>and</b> concrete by increasing surface roughness of plastic spacers was also investigated. Results show that concrete samples containing plastic spacers consistently gave the least resistance to transport and the highest epoxy penetration followed by samples with cementitious <b>spacers,</b> <b>and</b> then steel <b>spacers.</b> The control samples (samples without spacers) had the highest resistance to transport in all cases. The epoxy penetration occurred mainly through the spacer-concrete interface. The microstructure of the spacer-concrete interface showed significantly lower cement content and higher porosity compared to 'bulk paste' farther away form the interface. Higher penetration of chloride ions was detected along spacer-concrete interface compared to the control sample or the bulk paste farther away. It is evident that spacers initiate early corrosion and this may reduce the service-life of reinforced concrete structures. The implications of these findings on durability of concrete structures are discussed. Several recommendations to improve the bond at the interface between <b>spacer</b> <b>and</b> concrete are presented. Open Acces...|$|R
