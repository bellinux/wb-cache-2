25|$|The very {{existence}} of the outer world seemed a base mockery, a cruel sham of some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a speechless beauty. I hated flowers, for I had seen the enameled meads of Paradise; I cursed the rocks because they were mute stone, the sky because <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> with no music; and the earth and sky seemed to throw back my curse....|$|E
25|$|Only once {{since then}} has it been rung. During World War II, <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> in the New Year for 1943. This was {{broadcast}} to the Netherlands via shortwave radio. That country was occupied by Nazi Germany at the time, {{and most of its}} church bells had been confiscated and melted down for matériel. Those that had not were not permitted to be rung, and the broadcast was thus intended to boost morale among the Dutch population.|$|E
25|$|Words {{were not}} scored by length. Instead, the {{position}} of the word's first letter was added to the number of the line it was on to determine a team's score. For instance, a word that started in the first position of the first line (line one, position one) would be worth two points, whereas a word on the same line but with the first letter in the eighth position (line one, position eight) would be worth nine points. Halfway through the round, a bell would ring and the teammates would switch seats. This occurred after six questions had been asked; after another six were asked, the bell rang again and the team that was in the lead when <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> the second time won the Elimination Round.|$|E
50|$|Fiore and DeBlanc wait in {{the motel}} room. The phone contraption begins to ring. They stare {{motionless}} at the phone as <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> and rings.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is shown}} {{as having an}} ability to tell who is calling on the {{telephone}} and for what reason when <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> (sometimes even before <b>it</b> <b>rings),</b> as when he told his mom to say hi to an aunt who hadn't phoned for weeks, {{only to have the}} phone ring and Connie tell him to [...] "stop that!".|$|R
5000|$|Yet {{the clock}} seems to eerily know {{the good and}} bad events in the {{grandfather}}'s life [...] - [...] <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> 24 chimes when the grandfather brings his bride into his house, and near his death <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> an eerie alarm, which the family recognizes to mean that the grandfather is near death and gathers by his bed. After the grandfather dies, the clock suddenly stops, and never works again.|$|R
2500|$|In 1879, {{the first}} {{official}} bell for Old Main was installed. That bell still exists today, but {{is no longer in}} regular use. The last two times it was used was when <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> 10 times in 1985 to mark the $10 million received through donations for the restoration process and in July 1989 to mark the beginning of renovation. [...] Electronic bells were installed during 1949, and dedicated to those students lost in any war. [...] These bells wore out and were replaced with a computerized bell device. [...] It plays the Westminster Chimes every hour from 8 am- 8 pm, a musical selection after noon and the alma mater after five o'clock.|$|E
2500|$|And he said, [...] "Mum, I'm in... big trouble... You {{know this}} Nouvelle Solidarité?"... He said, [...] "I can't do this... I want out." [...] And {{at that point}} the phone was cut. And then <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> back again almost immediately. And the first thing that he said that time was, [...] "Mum, I'm frightened." [...] I {{realised}} he was in such danger that I said to him, [...] "I love you." [...] And then he said, [...] "I want to see you now."... I said, [...] "well, where are you, Jerry?" [...] He said, [...] "Wiesbaden." [...] And I said, [...] "How do you spell it?" [...] And he said, [...] "W I E S." [...] And then the phone was cut.|$|E
60|$|His {{voice had}} lost its deprecating mildness. <b>It</b> <b>rang</b> strong and clear.|$|E
6000|$|By {{a violent}} and unsuspected effort {{the old man}} jerked himself up and reached the bell. Mr. Ventnor heard <b>it</b> <b>ring,</b> and said sharply: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s the {{telephone}} downstairs!” cried Phil. “My, but <b>it’s</b> <b>ringing</b> {{to beat the}} band!” he added, as the bell continued to sound its call.|$|R
60|$|And {{the boom}} is a death-knell. As <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> softly {{out on the}} {{pleasant}} spring air, another stout slug has made the Great Change.|$|R
60|$|Sir Crispin laughed. He {{judged the}} tone {{rather than the}} words, and <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> hollow.|$|E
60|$|But {{this time}} <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> {{out like the}} sound of a {{gigantic}} trumpet, and the handjars flashed.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>rang</b> in Felix Thurstan's ears {{like the}} sound of a bell. He gazed about him in dismay, {{wondering}} what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh dear! [It rings again. She looks scared. <b>It</b> <b>rings</b> again. She {{approaches}} <b>it</b> timidly. <b>It</b> <b>rings</b> again. She retreats hastily. <b>It</b> <b>rings</b> repeatedly. She runs to it {{in desperation}} and puts the receiver to her ear.] Who is there? What do I do? I am not used to the telephone: I don't know how--What! Oh, I can hear you speaking quite distinctly. [She sits down, delighted, and settles herself for a conversation.] How wonderful! What! A lady? Oh! a person. Oh, yes: I know. Yes, please, send her up. Have my servants finished their lunch yet? Oh no: please don't disturb them: I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. Thank you. What? Oh yes, it's quite easy. I had no idea--am I to hang it up just as it was? Thank you. [She hangs it up.] ...|$|R
50|$|The White Tower {{was named}} after its {{building}} material, which is white stone. The Augustine Bell weighs 10 tonnes. On special occasions <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> even nowadays.|$|R
5000|$|Jane Vandenburgh in The New York Times {{likens the}} novel to Franz Kafka's A Hunger Artist ... "wild, extreme and {{slightly}} unbelievable, yet <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> absolutely true" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you are not}} glad to see Myeerah?" [...] she said, in English. Her {{voice was}} music. <b>It</b> <b>rang</b> low, sweet, clear-toned as a bell.|$|E
60|$|He laughed {{outright}} this time. It was {{a delightful}} laugh. <b>It</b> <b>rang</b> through the quiet Park, awaking echoes; and caught by it, I laughed with him.|$|E
60|$|I {{forced a}} laugh. <b>It</b> <b>rang</b> hollow against the barrier that {{separated}} us. In my heart I {{knew that this}} barrier {{was not to be}} laughed away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye {{might have}} moved slow-measure to my tune, Not stood stockstill. I {{made it in}} the woods, And found <b>it</b> <b>ring</b> as true as tested gold." ...|$|R
5000|$|Callers to {{the show}} would be told (on air) to call the number and [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>rings,</b> let <b>it</b> <b>ring.</b> We'll answer when it's your turn." [...] Some of King's regular callers used the pseudonyms [...] "The Numbers Guy", [...] "The (Syracuse) Chair", [...] "The Portland Laugher," [...] "The Scandal Scooper," [...] "The Miami Derelict," [...] "The Todd Cruz Caller," [...] "The Water Is Warm Caller", and [...] "Mr. Radio". [...] "Mr. Radio" [...] made over 200 calls to King during Open Phone America.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ye {{might have}} moved slow-measure to my tune, [...] Not stood stockstill. I {{made it in}} the woods, [...] And heard <b>it</b> <b>ring</b> as true as tested gold.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Drassilis {{blocked the}} motion. I {{imagine that the}} sharp note in her voice was lost on Tanky, but <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> out like a clarion to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "One—two—three"—had {{it really}} sounded three! Then <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> on a lower bell—"One—two—three." [...] A passing bell for a man! I {{looked at my}} mother—she turned away from me.|$|E
60|$|Therewith he rode {{to where}} the shield of Sir Tristram hung, and he struck upon the shield so violent a blow that <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> very loud and clear.|$|E
6000|$|When the steeple tolleth the noon, [...] It soundeth not so soon, [...] Yet <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> a far earlier hour, [...] And {{the sun has}} {{not reached}} its tower.|$|R
6000|$|... "They both sat down, but Tom wasn’t {{quick enough}} to please Bill, {{and he got}} a wipe o’ the side o’ the ’ead that made <b>it</b> <b>ring</b> for an hour afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, {{reviewer}} John Coulbourn {{believed that}} [...] "not much of <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> true, {{either to the}} heart or to {{the period of the}} piece", considering that Anne's musings were too generic to convince.|$|R
60|$|He {{took that}} monstrous resolve {{at the very}} {{beginning}} of the new year, and in the months that followed France rang with preparations. <b>It</b> <b>rang,</b> too, with other things which should have given him pause. <b>It</b> <b>rang</b> with the voice of preachers giving expression to the popular vied; that Cleves was not worth fighting for, that the war was unrighteous--a war undertaken by Catholic France to defend Protestant interests against the very champions of Catholicism in Europe. And soon it began to ring, tool with prophecies of the King's approaching end.|$|E
60|$|All {{men were}} silent, {{as the old}} Viking's voice, cracked and feeble when he began, {{gathered}} strength from rage, till <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> through the still night-air like a trumpet-blast.|$|E
60|$|Then Sir Gareth {{drew his}} sword and he went forward and smote the shield such a blow that <b>it</b> <b>rang</b> like thunder beneath the stroke that he gave it.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclobutane has {{the carbon}} atoms in a {{puckered}} square with approximately 90-degree bond angles; [...] "puckering" [...] reduces the eclipsing interactions between hydrogen atoms. <b>Its</b> <b>ring</b> strain is therefore slightly less, at around 110 kJ/mol.|$|R
60|$|So saying, Essper, in a {{careless}} manner, tossed a broad {{piece in the}} air, and made <b>it</b> <b>ring</b> on a fellow coin, as he caught it {{in the palm of}} his hand when it descended.|$|R
5000|$|Hark! 'tis {{the voice}} of our Alma Mater dear [...] "Animo et Fide," [...] <b>it</b> <b>rings</b> within our ear Bravely and loyally each task must be done Urged on by love and with hatred for none ...|$|R
