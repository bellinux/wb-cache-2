40|$|The {{last two}} decades have not been kind to {{professional}} engineers in the public service. Numbers have been slashed, their status has declined and <b>engineering</b> <b>advice</b> does not carry the weight it once did. While {{it has been said}} that non-engineers do not appreciate the benefits of <b>engineering</b> <b>advice,</b> part of the reason for this is that engineers themselves and the engineering profession have taken a low-key approach to promoting the benefits of <b>engineering</b> <b>advice.</b> If engineers want to have a positive future in the public sector, this attitude needs to change. Engineers and the engineering profession need to be proactive in promoting the benefits of sound <b>engineering</b> <b>advice,</b> professional judgment and the skills of engineers. This paper suggests a number of ways of accomplishing these goals. Public Service Reform, Engineers, Managerialism, Skills,...|$|R
