60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> with {{a twinkle}} of rather grim amusement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{which she}} took passively, {{and he moved}} away.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{arms and}} she came {{to him with a}} little sigh of satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms to her. His {{eyes were}} bright with {{the joy of}} conquest.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> cutlass for inspection. It {{had been}} seriously bent {{in the recent}} encounter.|$|R
60|$|Burton {{rose to his}} feet. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> for the manuscript.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> for the book, {{and found}} another passage for her.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and noticed}} with swift {{comprehension}} her first instinctive withdrawal.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hands with}} a low cry of triumph and she came to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands, and Justin {{took them}} affectionately and pressed {{them in his}} own.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> nervous, sinewy {{hand and}} took the rabbit by the ears, from Gudrun.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{and gave}} mine an earnest clasp. Then he went away.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Carnally, {{and they}} gripped in silence. Words were unnecessary.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> but {{she seemed}} {{in no hurry to}} let him go.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> dagger {{and looked}} at it. The blade was beautifully damaskeened, the hilt bejewelled.|$|R
60|$|Tony saw {{the slight}} {{trembling}} of her lips, and laughed somewhat inanely as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms. With a swift little {{backward}} movement she flitted away {{and leaned against}} the table.|$|R
60|$|They {{reached the}} gate of the villa. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to say good-by.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> gayly, but Collinson {{retained}} the slipper while he gravely examined it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> but {{she threw}} her arms round his neck, and kissed him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hands and}} tried {{once more to}} draw her to him. But she stepped {{backwards}} laughing.|$|R
60|$|The dancer shrugged <b>his</b> shoulders. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{glass to}} be replenished. The double {{password}} had reassured him.|$|R
60|$|A waiter whom I knew came up {{to greet}} us. I asked him about Louis. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> On {{the palm}} were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> She hesitated, then gripped it heartily, {{and smiled}} through her tears.|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} now by her side, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Mr. Sabin.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand; I {{gave him}} mine: {{he took it}} first in one, them in both his own.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{other hand}} and half rose, but her lips {{suddenly}} ceased to quiver and she waved him back.|$|R
60|$|He {{searched the}} inmost depths {{of my soul}} with his {{wonderful}} eyes. Then, after a pause, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> baby palm.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Cyril, {{to signify}} {{that he would}} fain be alone.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> with irresistible cordiality. Romayne took it gratefully--still bent, however, {{on making}} atonement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arm to me, and bade me try his muscle. I was startled. The hard flesh almost {{filled his}} sleeve.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms, {{then drew}} back. His face had grown {{suddenly}} tense, {{and there were}} lines of pain about his mouth.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands. With another effort, {{she lifted}} her arms from the desk, and turned {{to him on the}} high office-stool.|$|R
