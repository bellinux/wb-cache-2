5|$|Bran {{has been}} in a coma {{for more than a month}} since being thrown <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> by Jaime Lannister. After {{slapping}} his nephew Prince Joffrey for refusing to give his condolences to the Starks, Tyrion Lannister informs his siblings that despite Bran's fall, the boy will survive, much to the dismay of the incestuous Lannister twins.|$|E
5|$|From when it opened, {{the tower}} was {{referred}} to as both the Bond Tower and the R Tower, owing to the presence of both logos on the building's exterior. The Bond Corporation logos were later removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> {{and by the end of}} 1994, the signage on the building was updated to match the new name and logo of its owner and head tenant, Bankwest.|$|E
5|$|On 3 October, with Edward IV in exile, Henry VI was {{released}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> {{and returned to}} the throne by Warwick. Almost immediately, Montagu was granted the wardship of the executed Earl of Worcester's heir and estates, {{as well as of the}} young Lord Clifford. He was reappointed to the Wardenship of the East March, with its salary, on 22 October 1470.|$|E

5|$|The light {{aircraft}} was a 1976-built 6-seat Piper PA-32R-300 Cherokee Lance piloted by Steven Altman with 2 passengers. Altman was given clearance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> at Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey at 11:48a.m. to take off. It departed at 11:49a.m., and {{was headed for}} Ocean City, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The north nave window has {{fragments}} of fourteenth-century glass, and the nave {{has a good}} selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board. A lead plaque on the nave wall, removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> roof in 1859, has {{a picture of a}} ship from Nelson's time scratched on it. The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book, Church Mills, was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower,</b> called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.|$|E
25|$|The first cables {{were hung}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> in 2004—as a time-saving measure, {{this was done}} before <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were wholly completed. Sections of the deck were built outward <b>from</b> each of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> as more cables were hung.|$|R

5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in abeyance. As the Anglo–Spanish War was ongoing, Portuguese {{shipping}} was a fair target for the Royal Navy. Sir Walter Raleigh, having only just been released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London, received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies. He outfitted a sixteen ship naval squadron of which two, the Garland and Foresight belonged to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what {{was becoming a}} popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself on the losing side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E

5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once Monmouth's {{force had}} entered {{and started to}} fortify Bridgwater, he sent some of his cavalry to collect six cannon from Minehead. He planned to stay in Bridgwater until they {{returned}} and then break out and head for Bristol. Feversham and his army of 500 horse and 1,500 militiamen camped {{on the edge of}} Sedgemoor at the village of Westonzoyland. Monmouth could view them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> of Church of St Mary and may have inspected them more closely from the Church of St Mary in Chedzoy, before deciding to attack them.|$|E

5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E
5|$|Out of desperation, Douchebag is told {{to invite}} the girls to play. They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an {{abortion}} clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends is spreading gossip. Flanked by the girls, kindergarten pirates, and Star Trek role-players, the humans and elves attack Clyde's dark tower. Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted a nuclear device in Mr. Slave's anus to blow up South Park, forcing Douchebag to shrink and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb. After exiting Mr. Slave, Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie Chef; Chef is defeated. Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since the Blackheath {{negotiations}} had failed, {{the decision}} was taken that the King himself should meet the rebels, at Greenwich, {{on the south side}} of the Thames. Guarded by four barges of soldiers, Richard sailed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> on the morning of 13 June, where he was met on the other side by the rebel crowds. The negotiations failed, as Richard was unwilling to come ashore and the rebels refused to enter discussions until he did. Richard returned across the river to the Tower.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch fleet raided up the Thames in June 1667, {{but did not}} {{approach}} Gravesend Blockhouse due to {{the threat posed by}} its guns. The fort, under the command of Sir John Griffith, was in reality not well prepared for war. £400 was spent on upgrading the blockhouse, artillery was sent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London to reinforce the local guns and four infantry companies were detached to guard the site. The risk of attack ended with the signing of the Peace of Breda that July, and the blockhouse did not see action. Shortly after the Dutch raids, Sir John was removed from his post for apparently demanding payments from ships passing by the blockhouse, a complaint which was repeated in later years under subsequent captains.|$|E
5|$|After Washington's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, {{and the city}} {{prepared}} for what {{was seen as an}} inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to the town of Bethlehem. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, now Allentown, where it waited out the British occupation of Philadelphia under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.|$|E
5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E
