40|$|The {{navigation}} {{of imagery}} from polar orbiting weather satellites includes the correction for geometric distortions due to earth shape/earth rotation, satellite orbit variations, and satellite attitude {{along with the}} resampling of the satellite image to a selected geographic map projection.

This paper reviews general methods for performing this <b>image</b> <b>navigation,</b> ranging from a method that assumes no orbital information and, thus, relies on nominal orbital parameter values and image corrections computed by matching ground control points (GCPs), to a method that uses high-quality satellite ephemeris data to make the correction with {{a limited number of}} GCPs.

30|$|The {{preoperative}} {{evaluation of}} donors for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) aims {{to select a}} suitable donor with optimal graft quality and to ensure donor safety. Owing to extensive research on and rapid technical development of computed tomography (CT) scanners and three-dimensional (3 D) workstations [1], the evaluation of hepatic vascular anatomy in living liver donors is increasingly being performed by 3 D CT angiography. However, details of hepatic artery anatomy obtained by the 3 D CT angiography are not always superior to those obtained by angiography [2]. On the other hand, 3 D <b>image</b> <b>navigation</b> software systems enable not only the calculation of total liver volume and the volume of each vessel’s (both the portal and hepatic venous branches) territory but also the visualization of the anatomy of the donor’s hepatic vessels [3], which facilitates preoperative surgical planning.

40|$|Path tracing {{has been}} {{successfully}} utilized in modern animated films to produce photorealistic images. However, with path tracing being a Monte Carlo method, {{a large amount of}} light paths must be sampled to reduce image noise to acceptable levels. Although a wide variety of acceleration and importance sampling techniques have been developed to reduce the cost of individual samples and reduce the number of required samples, path tracing remains a very computationally expensive approach. Monte Carlo error estimation and reconstruction approaches the problem from a signal processing perspective by reducing the sampling budget and instead applying image denoising filters to lower noise levels. Although these image denoising filters can be successfully applied to post-process images into near ground truth results, estimating the right parameters to use remains an open problem. We propose that limitations of automatic parameter estimation can be overcome by taking advantage of the ground truth image in the mind of artists. To that end we introduce a workflow and associated user interface to let artists locally tune and apply filters to noisy Monte Carlo images. The interface lets users explore the high dimensional parameter spaces of filters through an <b>image</b> <b>navigation</b> paradigm, which means that users pick the right filter and settings by choosing the end result they want. We organize a case study to evaluate the efficacy of interactive filter tuning and to compare the efficiency of slider-based parameter choice with the <b>image</b> <b>navigation</b> paradigm. With the results from the case study we show that our workflow allows even novice users with no prior image processing experience to quickly select appropriate filters. Users are able to produce higher quality results using our local parameter painting approach compared to global optimization in the same time span. Users also prefer the <b>image</b> <b>navigation</b> interface for filter choice and tuning to sliders, but we are only able to quantify the benefits on images that require filters with a high dimensional parameter space.

40|$|The {{problem of}} precise and {{automatic}} AVHRR <b>image</b> <b>navigation</b> is tractable in theory, but {{has proved to}} be somewhat difficult in practice. The authors' work has been motivated by the need for a fully automatic and operational navigation system capable of geo-referencing NOAA-AVHRR images with high accuracy and without operator supervision. The proposed method is based on the simultaneous use of an orbital model and a contour matching approach. This last process, relying on an affine transformation model, is used to correct the errors caused by inaccuracies in orbit modeling, nonzero value for the spacecraft's roll, pitch and yaw, errors due to inaccuracies in the satellite positioning and failures in the satellite internal clock. The automatic global contour matching process is summarized as follows: i) Estimation of the gradient energy map (edges) in the sensed image and detection of the cloudless (reliable) areas in this map. ii) Initialization of the affine model parameters by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the reference and sensed images objects. iii) Simultaneous optimization of all reference image contours on the sensed image by energy minimization in the domain of the global transformation parameters. The process is iterated in a hierarchical way, reducing the parameter searching space at each iteration.
