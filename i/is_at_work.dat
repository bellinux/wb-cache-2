5|$|Derek Charles (Idris Elba) {{works for}} a finance company and is married to Sharon (Beyoncé). While Derek <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> he greets {{temporary}} worker Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), who, believing Derek was flirting with her, attempts to seduce him throughout the film. Derek repeatedly rejects her, but Lisa continues to pursue him, making sexual advances on him at the Christmas party {{and at one point}} she follows him to his car in the parking garage and attempts to seduce him with revealing lingerie and fishnet stockings but Derek refuses again and forces her out of his car. Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide by drug overdose, and calls for medical help.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E

There is also a suggestion of a communal {{narrative voice}}, as Ngugi draws on the mythic past of Kenya to place the novel in a wider context than simply the colonial. This communal voice <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> through the various Gikuyu songs with which Ngugi intersperses the novel; {{there is a great}} reliance placed on such songs, which help tell, through the oral tradition of linking of proverbs and fables, the history of Ilmorog and Kenya before colonial intervention.|$|E
25|$|Detector dogs begin {{training}} {{between the}} ages of 11 and 16 months and work for an average of 8 to 10 years. Several different breeds are used, but the CBSA primarily uses Labrador Retrievers for firearm, drug and currency detection, and the Beagle for plant, food and animal detection. Dogs that are used to detect firearms, drugs and currency live with their handler. However, dogs trained to detect agricultural products live in a commercial kennel as living around large amounts of food full-time can cause the dog to become desensitized to some scents. While the dog <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> it is transported in air-conditioned vehicles that act as a mobile kennel.|$|E

Claire as {{expected}} is angry at this as she expects the family not {{to help with the}} dog and she will do all the work. While taking the trash out Claire overhears Frank crying in his RV. Claire tells Phil, but Phil does not believe this. Claire finally convinces Phil to ask his father what is wrong, though when he gets ready to ask, Phil instead avoids it with another question. Claire continues to be bothered by the dog, though it becomes clear she begins bonding with it. Finally, Phil asks Frank what is wrong and Frank tells Phil he fell in love, making Phil think his parents are divorcing. Then he says {{he fell in love with}} a he...Scout. Phil tells him he can take Scout home and Claire, who ends up being the most upset that Scout is leaving, gives Scout her bra. Frank then leaves with Luke (Nolan Gould) chasing the RV like a dog.|$|E

25|$|Gutworms {{and similar}} parasites {{are present in}} {{untreated}} drinking water in developing countries, and {{were present in the}} water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies. Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g., hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite. This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that co-evolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only {{in the presence of the}} parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive. In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants. However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms. Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies. It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy.|$|E

Elsewhere, Oswald <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> at an automobile repair shop when his boss's wife, Sharon Kiveat, walks in. He then tries talking to her, but she nervously rebuffs him; it is revealed that he had hit on her the day before, and she turned him down. His boss returns and tells Oswald that Mulder and Scully want to talk with him. When the agents visit Oswald to question him, he claims to have not witnessed anything. However, Mulder's cell phone mysteriously overheats in Oswald's presence, to which Oswald acts unsurprised.|$|E
500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family. Additionally, when Clair <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> Cliff willingly assumes traditionally female household responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Both Clair's professional and personal lives operate alongside each other rather smoothly with little conflict. However, despite being a full-time lawyer, she is seldom shown {{at work in the}} courtroom; audiences see the character at home more often than anywhere else. According to Women Watching Television: Gender, Class, and Generation in the American Television Experience author Andrea L. Press, Clair's role demonstrates [...] "the hegemonic view that families need not change to accommodate working wives and mothers", believing that the show mostly depicts Clair at home to avoid exploring the everyday conflicts working women endure in their daily lives. One of the series' more political moments, Clair refuses to be exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer. When Clair learns that her all-white male co-panelists only want to hear opinions {{from the perspective of a}} black woman, Clair delivers a speech that reads, [...] "I am also a human being, who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable about history ... But when you look at me, this is all you see in me, a black woman?" ...|$|E
