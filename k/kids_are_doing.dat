The referendum was called [...] "not definitive", however, {{because of a}} snow storm that began on voting day and lasted until polls were closed, {{and because of the}} slight margin (one half of one percent). Wildes addressed the referendum results, saying [...] "The way I interpret it is that there are residents who came forward wanting to increase their taxes {{for the good of the}} community. But we have to look beyond taxes. Investing in a school system is like investing in a portfolio. You hope it will result in increased property values that will make Englewood a more attractive place. If our <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> better, it will cost us less in other areas of government. But more than anything this is a moral issue.

We want to obtain a better understanding of what their actual needs are so that we can advocate for, and put in place, services that meet those needs...|$|E
