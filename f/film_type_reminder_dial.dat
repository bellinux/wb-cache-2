50|$|The basic C3 model {{underwent}} {{only minor}} revisions from its introduction {{until it was}} discontinued in 1966. For instance, the number of shutter speeds was lowered from ten to seven to five, an accessory shoe was added, and the exposure <b>reminder</b> <b>dial</b> {{on the back of}} the camera was removed. There was a variant featuring color-coded exposure controls known as the Colormatic. A second-generation C3 with an improved lens and more comfortable controls, the Standard C3, came out in 1958, though it was otherwise nearly identical to its predecessor.|$|R

40|$|Prevention {{of damage}} to the teat and {{mastitis}} requires determination of the teat load caused by a collapsing liner. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a pressure-indicating film designed to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and artificial teats. The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional milking cluster equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and <b>film</b> <b>type,</b> 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to detect differences between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable <b>film</b> <b>type.</b> Both <b>film</b> <b>types</b> measured the pressure applied to both artificial teats by the teat cup liner. Thus, the pressure-indicating films can be used to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and an artificial teat. Based on the results of the present investigation, a pressure-indicating film with the measurement ranges of both <b>film</b> <b>types</b> combined would be an optimal tool to measure the overall pressure between an artificial teat and a collapsing liner...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{different}} <b>types</b> of persuasive <b>reminder</b> {{should be}} sent to patients with different personalities. We describe a study where we presented participants with a personality measure, then describe a scenario with a fictional patient, who has not performed a skin check for recurrent melanoma. We asked patients to imagine they are in that situation and rate validated reminders based on Cialdini's 6 principles of persuasion for their suitability. Participants then chose their favourite reminder, and an alternative reminder to send if that one failed. We found that persuasive reminders that use `Authority' and 'Liking' are the most popular overall. We also found that personality had an effect when deciding on the <b>type</b> of persuasive <b>reminder</b> to use. In particular, we have found that those with high emotional stability are more responsive to any kind of persuasion, those with low agreeableness rated all <b>types</b> of <b>reminder</b> higher than those with high, and that conscientiousness matters when selecting an alternative reminder...|$|R

40|$|Solid-phase {{crystallisation}} (SPC) of Si {{films on}} glass prepared by three deposition methods, plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} (PECVD), electron-beam evaporation, and a combination of both, are compared for different annealing temperatures. Three independent techniques, optical transmission microscopy, UV reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, are used to characterise the crystallisation kinetics and film properties. The activation energy for the incubation {{is estimated to be}} 2. 7 &# 8211; 3. 0 eV. The scanning electron microscopy images of polycrystalline Si films after Secco etching show a gradually decreasing average grain size in each <b>film</b> <b>type</b> for higher SPC temperatures.

Solar cells fabricated from these polycrystalline Si films were characterised by Suns-Voc and spectral response measurements.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a game theoretic model of two directors {{on a single}} market.
