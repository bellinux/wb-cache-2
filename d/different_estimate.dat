6000|$|Some years afterwards, {{getting to}} know our friend Swinburne, I found with much {{satisfaction}} that he also was an ardent (not of course a blind) admirer of Whitman. Satisfaction, and a degree almost of surprise; for his intense sense of poetic refinement of form in his own works and his exacting acuteness as a critic might have seemed likely to carry him away from Whitman in sympathy at least, if not in actual latitude of perception. Those who find the American poet [...] "utterly formless," [...] "intolerably rough and floundering," [...] "destitute of the A B C of art," [...] and the like, might not unprofitably ponder this very <b>different</b> <b>estimate</b> of him {{by the author of}} Atalanta in Calydon.|$|E

The {{theory of}} the {{syllogism}} laid down in the preceding pages, has obtained, among other important adhesions, three of peculiar value: those of Sir John Herschel,(59) Dr. Whewell,(60) and Mr. Bailey;(61) Sir John Herschel considering the doctrine, though not strictly “a discovery,” having been anticipated by Berkeley,(62) to be “one of the greatest steps which have yet {{been made in the}} philosophy of Logic.” “When we consider” (to quote the further words of the same authority) “the inveteracy of the habits and prejudices which it has cast to the winds,” there is no cause for misgiving in the fact that other thinkers, no less entitled to consideration, have formed a very <b>different</b> <b>estimate</b> of it. Their principal objection can not be better or more succinctly stated than by borrowing a sentence from Archbishop Whately.(63) “In every case where an inference is drawn from Induction (unless that name is to be given to a mere random guess without any grounds at all) we must form a judgment that the instance or instances adduced are sufficient to authorize the conclusion; that it is allowable to take these instances as a sample warranting an inference respecting the whole class;” and the expression of this judgment in words (it has been said by several of my critics) is the major premise.|$|E

6000|$|The {{letters to}} Cromwell were {{published}} in Curll's [...] "Miscellanea," [...] of which the title-page says [...] "Printed in the year 1727;" [...] but the dedication to the letters themselves is dated June, 1726, {{and it was in}} 1726 that they appeared. The incidental and scanty notices of them at the time are sufficient to indicate the impression they produced. Thompson, writing in October to Aaron Hill, says that [...] "though careless and uncorrected, they are full of wit and gaiety." [...] There may have been many who thought that they did as much credit to the heart as {{to the head of the}} poet. [...] "I have read the collection of letters you mention," [...] Fenton wrote to Broome in September, 1726, [...] "and was delighted with nothing more than that air of sincerity, those professions of esteem and respect, and that deference paid to his friend's judgment in poetry which I have sometimes seen expressed to others, and I doubt not with the same cordial affection. If they are read in that light, they will be very entertaining and useful in the present age; but in the next, Cicero, Pliny, and Voiture may regain their reputation." [...] The comments on Pope's sincerity were plainly ironical. Fenton considered him to be extremely hypocritical, and some person concerned in the publication of 1726 must have formed the same opinion of his character, if the ludicrous tail-piece is intended to be typical of the letters. A little man whose diminutive stature did not permit him to clasp the taller figure in his arms while they stood upon a level, is represented as having jumped off the ground and seized his companion round the waist, who, with his hands thrown into the air at the painful vehemence of the embrace, is struggling to get loose. Undiscerning persons, who judged the poet by his words, would form a <b>different</b> <b>estimate,</b> and would perceive only proofs of his excellence where Fenton saw examples of his habitual insincerity. [...] "His correspondence," [...] says Johnson, of the later collection of 1735, [...] "filled the nation with praises of his candour, tenderness, and benevolence, the purity of his purposes, and the fidelity of his friendship."[16] ...|$|E
