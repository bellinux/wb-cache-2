40|$|The {{approaching}} ways {{in religious}} phenomenon quantitative studies are, {{most of the}} times, based only {{on the evolution of}} adherent flows and population structure from a religious point of view. In this pape, an <b>integrated</b> <b>statistical</b> indicators <b>system</b> will be designed. The main purpose of the system is to enhance the quality and coherence of the religious phenomenon. The most important indicators from the integrated system are: context indicators (political, economical, socio-cultural, demographical), basic indicators, level and structure indicators, participation indicators, resource indicators (spiritual, human and pecuniary), quality, efficiency and outcomes (religious freedom, social connections, international relationships). Designing a complete, coherent system of indicators is necessary for a correct approach in studying the religious phenomenon. Statistical indicators can supply quantitative data for the operational description of the religious phenomenon. The indicators&rsquo; system makes possible not only a descriptive analysis but also some advanced statistical techniques (e. g. regression and correlation method) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first of a set of {{background}} papers and research papers on information systems for regional planning. Information systems contain structured data on real-world phenomena, their properties, and their mutual links. Frequently, however, information systems are oriented to the national level or to specific factors. The geographical dimension of information systems as a decision aid in regional development planning has too often been neglected. Therefore, much more attention should be paid to the design and development of information systems reflecting socio-economic processes so as to arrive at a better representation of regional systems and a better adaptation to the needs of regional planners. The major aim of the current study is to provide in a systematic way a set of guidelines and considerations {{to be taken into account}} in the design and use of information systems for regional planning. In addition to the conceptual framework, regional accounting, <b>integrated</b> <b>statistical</b> information <b>systems,</b> regional modeling, and qualitative information may also be addressed in this study. The present paper outlines some important aspects and attributes of information systems for multiregional planning.

40|$|Statistical {{innovation}} produces {{new opportunities}} for advancement of knowledge and policy improvement. Twenty five years ago, a nineteenth century map and chart was cited as “the best statistical graphic ever drawn ” because it inspired the visual display of a relatively large amount of data in limited space. It tells a story. Today, modern information technology has ushered in a dynamic, online mapping and reporting tool called OnTheMap that can analyze and present an unprecedented amount of detailed data in a short span of time and space. The resulting maps and reports can tell many stories. OnTheMap {{is a product of}} a visionary idea at the U. S. Census Bureau and its partner states that a new, cost-effective, 21 st-century <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> can be built by integrating existing administrative records with census and survey data. Properly <b>integrated,</b> this <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> can be better than its individual parts. In turn, ensuring public availability of detailed statistics derived from this system has stimulated the development of state-of-the-art methods to protect confidentiality. In this regard, OnTheMap symbolizes continuing American ingenuity to innovate with new statistical data, methods, and dissemination tools. This work is unofficial and thus has not undergone the review accorded to official Census Bureau publications. All results have been reviewed to ensure that no confidential information is disclosed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics is to enable developing countries to build a sound and comprehensive agricultural <b>statistical</b> <b>system,</b> that is sustainable, well integrated in the overall national <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> and {{that is capable of}} responding to the information needs of the 21 st century. One of the three pillars of the Global Strategy is the integration of agriculture into the national <b>statistical</b> <b>system</b> which is obtained through three methodological tools: (i) an integrated survey framework, that defines the mix and frequency of data collection initiatives needed to meet the predefined data requirements; (ii) an <b>integrated</b> <b>statistical</b> data base, that provides data management system for different data sources (censuses, surveys, administrative data), using common definitions and classifications and ensuring that only one number is agreed as official statistics; (iii) a master sampling frame, that is the basis for selecting the sample of all agriculture-related surveys across the national <b>statistical</b> <b>system,</b> thus allowing coordinated data collections. Little guidance is currently available on buiding a Master Sample Frame for agricultural surveys in different country contexts. The FAO and UNFPA Guidelines for Linking Population and Housing Censuses with Agricultura Censuses aim to fill this gap. This paper draws on the Guidelines and country reports to examine how the agricultural data collected through the Population Census can contribute to building a Master Sample Frame for agriculture censuses and surveys, with illustrations from the recent experience of Mozambique...|$|R

This requires testing geometric relations such as identity, incidence, parallelity or orthogonality. Due to uncertainty of the elements, checking these relation requires thresholds which in general are difficult to set.
