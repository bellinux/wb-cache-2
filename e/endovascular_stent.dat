50|$|Between {{the end of}} the '80s and the {{beginning}} of the '90s, INR was suddenly revolutioned after the work of two italian physicians: Cesare Gianturco and Guido Guglielmi. The first combined a ∂eep knowledge of diagnostic radiology with a great ability to solve technical and manual problems. He invented Gianturco's coils, which he used to make the first attempts to embolize arteries and aneurysms. Gianturco also patented the first <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> approved by the American FDA; a device with a great legacy. In the second half of the 1980s, Hilal was the first in Columbia University to use coils to treat brain aneurysms; but this technique was inaccurate and dangerous because the coils were released with little control with great risk of occluding the vessel from which the aneurysm originated. The coil embolization was revolutionized by the work of Guido Guglielmi in UCLA, who realized that electricity could function as a controlled release mechanism for coils; in 1991 he published two works dealing with the embolization of brain aneurysms by means of detachable platinum coils (Guglielmi's coils). The treatment of aneurysms was thus made more accessible and safe.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This report {{describes}} {{our experience}} with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms and other arterial lesions. Methods: Between September 1990 and April 1994, 57 patients {{were treated with}} <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> grafts (50 with abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms; five with traumatic arteriovenous fistulas; one with an infected femoral false aneurysm; and one with a false aneurysm of the proximal right common carotid artery). The devices consist of either a Dacron or an autogenous vein graft sutured to a balloon-expandable stent. The stented grafts are placed through remote arteriotomies, advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to their predetermined sites, and secured into position. Results: Forty of the 50 <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> graft procedures used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms or iliac aneurysms were considered successful, even though some secondary treatment was required in six patients (two open operations; four secondary endovascular procedures). The 10 failures include four early procedural deaths, one late procedural death, and five leaks. All five arteriovenous fistulas and the two false aneurysms were successfully treated with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> grafts. Conclusions: Although our experience with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stented</b> grafts has been promising, remaining problems require resolution, and further follow-up is needed. However, the potential advantages of these endovascular grafts warrant their continued evaluation. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 549 - 57. ...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} was to compare early results of <b>endovascular</b> <b>stenting</b> for traumatic aortic rupture with conventional open repair. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of consecutive cases of traumatic aortic rupture in a single institution from July 2000 to July 2006. ResultsFifteen cases were identified. The mean injury severity score was 43 ± 10. Fourteen patients had the procedure within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Seven patients underwent <b>endovascular</b> <b>stenting</b> and 8 underwent open repair. For <b>endovascular</b> <b>stenting,</b> there were no failed procedures, no periprocedural complications, and no periprocedural deaths. In 6 patients, {{there was no evidence}} of endoleak, stent migration, or late pseudoaneurysm formation. One patient required a second stent 2 years later to treat a stenosis in the original stent. For open repair, cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 7 of the 8 patients. Lower limb paraplegia developed postoperatively in 1 patient and another patient died of head injuries. There was a significant reduction in the mean duration of the procedure (2. 2 ± 0. 90 vs 5 ± 3. 2 hours; P = 0. 04), the mean intraoperative blood loss (311 ± 20 vs 953 ± 20 mL; P =. 02), the mean number of units of blood and blood products used (0. 43 ± 1. 1 vs 3 ± 3 units; P =. 026), and the mean dose of heparin required (5000 ± 1700 vs 24, 000 ± 7500 IU; P =. 001) in the <b>endovascular</b> <b>stenting</b> group. There was no difference in duration of ventilation, intensive treatment unit, or hospital stay. ConclusionsEndovascular stenting is technically feasible and applicable to a range of cardiac patients. It takes less time than open repair, requires less heparin and blood products, and therefore simplifies management of other injuries.

However, long-term studies on whether <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> graft place-ment is the optimal initial treatment for elective cases of type BAD remain inconclusive. 1 Eggebrecht and colleagues 2 and Resch and associates, 3 respectively, reported multicenter ret-rospective studies of <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> graft placement in patients with type B AD.

40|$|Background: Coarctation of the aorta (COA) is {{a defect}} that {{accounts}} for 5 - 8 % of all congenital heart diseases. Balloon angioplasty {{as a treatment for}} COA is increasingly performed, with <b>endovascular</b> <b>stents</b> having been proposed as a means of improving the efficacy and safety of the procedure. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the systolic blood pressure gradient at rest and during maximal exercise at follow-up in patients post <b>endovascular</b> <b>stenting</b> of COA. Methods: Thirteen patients (4 native and 9 re-coarctation cases of COA after surgery or balloon angioplasty) with a mean age of 11. 1 ± 4. 7 years underwent <b>endovascular</b> <b>stenting</b> between November 2007 and December 2009 via standard techniques for native COA as an alternative to surgical repair. Doppler echocardiography was performed pre and post stenting. Resting and exercise assessment of blood pressure was performed at follow-up. Results: Post stent implantation, no angiographic major complications were evident. Systolic blood pressure gradient decreased from 42 ± 8. 8 mm Hg before stent placement to 7 ± 10 mm Hg at follow-up (p value < 0. 001). Peak Doppler pressure gradient decreased from 30 ± 14 mm Hg to 14 ± 10 mm Hg at follow-up (p value < 0. 007). One case of exercise-induced hypertension was seen in patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Symptomatic {{cerebral}} hyperperfusion has an {{incidence of}} 5 % after <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> placement. We hypothesized that increases in {{cerebral blood flow}} (CBF) after <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> placement are positively correlated with the severity of stenosis. METHODS:We studied patients with carotid (n 20) or vertebrobasilar (n 3) stenosis who were undergoing <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> placement. Hemispheric CBF was measured by using intra-arterial xenon- 133 technique (initial slope). RESULTS: CBF increased from 29 10 to 35 12 mL/ 100 g/min (P. 0003) at 39 12 minutes (range 13 – 60 minutes) after <b>endovascular</b> <b>stent</b> placement.

Physiologic parameters remained constant between measurements: PaCO 2 was 43 6 mm Hg and arterial pressure was 89 16 mmHg. The degree of vascular stenosis (70 % 13 %, range, 40 – 99 %) was not correlated with change in CBF (r 2 0. 007, P. 70) or baseline CBF (r 2 0. 005, P. 31).
