25|$|Lufthansa was a {{state-owned}} enterprise (and flag carrier) until 1994. Deutsche Lufthansa AG shares have been publicly traded on all German stock exchanges since 1966. In addition to <b>floor</b> <b>trading,</b> {{it is also}} traded electronically using the Xetra system. It is a DAX index share and is listed in the German Stock Exchange’s Prime Standard. In its annual report for 2016, Lufthansa reported that German investors held 68.6 per cent of the shares (previous year: 74.9 per cent). The second largest group, with 13.4 per cent, were shareholders from the USA. Investors from Luxembourg accounted for 4.2 per cent, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland, with 2.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. This ensures continued {{compliance with the provisions}} of the German Aviation Compliance Documentation Act (LuftNaSiG). 54.5 per cent (previous year: 53.9 per cent) of the shares were held by institutional investors and 45.5 per cent (previous year: 46.1 per cent) by private individuals.|$|E
500|$|After {{fifteen years}} of working for other companies, Fossett founded his own firms, Marathon Securities and Lakota Trading, from which he made {{millions}} renting exchange memberships. He founded Lakota Trading for that purpose in 1980. In the early 1980s, he founded Marathon Securities and extended that successful formula to memberships on the New York stock exchanges. He earned millions renting <b>floor</b> <b>trading</b> privileges (exchange memberships) to hopeful new floor traders, who would also pay clearing fees to Fossett's clearing firms {{in proportion to the}} trading activity of those renting the memberships. In 1997, the trading volume of its rented memberships was larger than any other clearing firm on the Chicago exchange. Lakota Trading replicated that same business plan on many exchanges in the United States and also in London. Fossett would later use those revenues to finance his adventures. Fossett said, [...] "As a floor trader, I was very aggressive and worked hard. Those same traits help me in adventure sports." ...|$|E

2500|$|Until 2005, {{the right}} to {{directly}} trade shares on the exchange was conferred upon owners of the 1366 [...] "seats." [...] The term {{comes from the fact}} that up until the 1870s NYSE members sat in chairs to trade. In 1868, the number of seats was fixed at 533, and this number was increased several times over the years. In 1953, the number of seats was set at 1,366. These seats were a sought-after commodity as they conferred the ability to directly trade stock on the NYSE, and seat holders were commonly referred to as members of the NYSE. The Barnes family is the only known lineage to have five generations of NYSE members: Winthrop H. Barnes (admitted 1894), Richard W.P. Barnes (admitted 1926), Richard S. Barnes (admitted 1951), Robert H. Barnes (admitted 1972), Derek J. Barnes (admitted 2003). Seat prices varied widely over the years, generally falling during recessions and rising during economic expansions. The most expensive inflation-adjusted seat was sold in 1929 for $625,000, which, today, would be over six million dollars. In recent times, seats have sold for as high as $4million in the late 1990s and as low as $1million in 2001. In 2005, seat prices shot up to $3.25million as the exchange entered into an agreement to merge with Archipelago and became a for-profit, publicly traded company. Seat owners received $500,000 in cash per seat and 77,000 shares of the newly formed corporation. The NYSE now sells one-year licenses to trade directly on the exchange. Licenses for <b>floor</b> <b>trading</b> are available for $40,000 and a license for bond trading is available for as little as $1,000 as of 2010. Neither are resell-able, but may be transferable during a change of ownership of a corporation holding a trading license.|$|E

40|$|By {{comparing}} execution {{costs of}} trades handled by Amex <b>floor</b> brokers with <b>trades</b> entered through its automated post execution reporting (PER) system, {{this article provides}} evidence that floor brokers have value. Because they can opportunistically seize liquidity, using a floor broker is equivalent to placing a "smart" limit order. Overall, <b>floor</b> <b>trades</b> have a lower realized half-spread than PER trades (- 3. 06 bps vs. 4. 43 bps). This finding holds for other measures of execution costs and is consistent across all order-size categories.

50|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>trading</b> is {{the meeting}} of traders or {{stockbrokers}} at a specific venue {{referred to as a}} trading floor or pit to buy and sell financial instruments using open outcry method to communicate with each other.

50|$|In about 1427 Robert Toppes, a Norwich merchant, re-developed {{the site}} as a {{commercial}} complex. He built his first <b>floor</b> <b>trading</b> hall on top of part of the 14th century domestic hall house {{and on top of}} the existing boundary wall and brick arch. He retained the 14th century entrance to the hall house for his customers. From the entrance passage his customers went up a new staircase to the first <b>floor</b> <b>trading</b> hall. This was a timber construction of seven bays with a crown post roof, decorated with carvings in the spandrels of 14 dragons. The hall was constructed with English oak, using some 1,000 trees. Clearly Toppes wanted to impress his customers. At the rear of the building he created a yard space with access to the river for his imports and exports, a warehouse area under the hall and a new stairway down to the extended undercroft from the yard. Part of the hall house was retained as a ground floor reception area.|$|E
50|$|Floor Broker/Trader: an {{individual}} who trades commodity contracts {{on the floor of}} a commodities exchange. When executing trades on behalf of a client in exchange for a commission he is acting in the role of a broker.

40|$|Informed traders need {{liquidity}} {{in order}} to profit from their private information. Markets provide liquidity and are compensated by the information released through trading. Fast markets provide access to a limit order book. Slow markets provide execution in an auction-based <b>trading</b> <b>floor.</b> Hybrid markets combine both execution venues. It is shown here that the overall efficiency of a hybrid market is determined by its fast component. The introduction of a <b>trading</b> <b>floor</b> does not generate more informed trading, only takes trading away from the fast market. <b>Trading</b> <b>floors</b> are thus inherently competitive to the fast market. We provide conditions that determine the competitiveness of a <b>trading</b> <b>floor</b> {{with respect to a}} fast market. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

50|$|As of 2007 few exchanges {{still had}} <b>floor</b> <b>trading</b> using open outcry. The {{supporters}} of electronic trading {{claim that they}} are faster, cheaper, more efficient for users, and less prone to manipulation by market makers and broker/dealers. However, many traders advocate for the open outcry system {{on the basis that}} the physical contact allows traders to speculate as to a buyer/seller's motives or intentions and adjust their positions accordingly. As of 2010 most stocks and futures contracts were no longer traded using open outcry due to the lower cost of the aforementioned technological advances.|$|E
50|$|As of 2007 few exchanges {{still have}} <b>floor</b> <b>trading.</b> One {{example is the}} New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) which still executes a small {{percentage}} of its trades on the floor. That means that the traders actually form a group around the post {{on the floor of the}} market for the specialist, someone that works for one of the NYSE member firms and handles the stock. As in an auction, there are shouts from those that want to sell and those that want to buy. The specialist facilitates in the match and centralizing the trades.|$|E
50|$|The {{change in}} United States' {{teaching}} and becoming more technology based, {{is due to}} the changing environment on Wall Street and other financial markets. Dominant floor stocks, such as the NYSE are facing increased competition from automated trading systems, such as the NASDAQ.

Therefore, while traditional <b>floor</b> <b>trading</b> was still essential, students need to have a greater understanding in more recent times on automated trading systems and other technological advances in economics.|$|E
