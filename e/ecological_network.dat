5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal <b>ecological</b> <b>network.</b> Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to {{synthesize}} simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E

As a result of this conference the European Union for Dune conservation & Coastal management (EUDC) was launched and formally founded in Leiden, the Netherlands, on 6 January 1989, as an association under the Dutch law. Its first undertaking consisted in producing an inventory of coastal dunes throughout Europe. Under the leadership of its Director General Albert Salman, the association evolved towards a broader coastal scope and then changed the name to European Union for Coastal Conservation (EUCC) in 1991 at {{the occasion}} of the 3rd International Conference in Galway (Ireland). Since then, the abbreviation has been kept. Milestones of the first period are the organisation of the 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference in Scheveningen 1991, and a contribution to the preparation of the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS), adopted in 1995 by the Environment for Europe Ministers Conference. Later on, under the auspices of UNEP and the Council of Europe, EUCC led the elaboration of the European Coastal & Marine <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> (ECMEN) [...] and the European Code of Conduct for Coastal Zones.

The views in this report {{are those of the}} authors and do not necessarily represent those of Natural England. Background The Natural Environment White Paper – ‘The Natural Choice: securing the value of nature’ provides the policy context for protecting and improving England’s natural resources, wildlife and landscapes; and reconnecting people and nature. Specific recommendations include: • Establishing greater ecological connectivity, through large-scale <b>ecological</b> <b>networks.</b> • Connecting people with their landscapes. • Greater public engagement in landscape planning. The planning, design and establishment of <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> is primarily underpinned by natural science research and associated evidence and data. This is critical to understanding the appropriate scenarios and patterns for ecological connectivity, conserving habitats and planning for the movement of species. However, the landscape and human/cultural dimension of <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> is often less considered as an underpinning part of the context and evidence and, as a consequence, not always fully integrated into their planning, design and implementation. In late 2012, Natural England commissioned the study known as ‘EcoLaP’– Econets, Landscape and People to: • Help understand how to capture the public’s perceptions of landscape change, aesthetic and cultural value. • Demonstrate the practical ways and benefits of using this, often more qualitative, information to complement natural science data and mapping information when planning and designing <b>ecological</b> <b>networks.</b> This report is part of the wider EcoLaP research and evidence and will be used to inform Natural England and others when planning and establishing <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> across England’s landscape...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{constraints}} on the topology of complex networks {{are just beginning to}} be appreciated, both theoretically and in concrete examples like the Internet and global air transportation <b>network.</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>networks,</b> composed of habitat patches connected by species dispersal, are intrinsically spatial and show promise as a tool for conservation planning; but while habitat-loss effects on <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> have been simulated, such effects have not been directly measured in <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> varying over time. In this study, I used satellite remote sensing to study <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> composed of wetland habitat in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America. I find power-law scaling of important topological properties as a function of dispersal ability and as wetland density varies with climate. Prairie wetland networks are &#x 27;meso-worlds&#x 27; with mean topological distance increasing faster with network size than small-world networks, but slower than regular lattices. While similar dynamics have been shown in random spatial networks, these results emphasize the importance of processes determining locations of nodes in a spatial network, with possible implications in other areas like wireless communication networks or disease transmission networks. Wetland networks establish a climate envelope for landscape connectivity in the PPR, and I show that wetland-dependent species face a &#x 27;crisis of connectivity&#x 27; with climate change. The global biodiversity crisis requires that conservation planners act quickly over large areas using limited resources; a network-based approach to coarse-filter conservation planning in dynamic landscapes should be broadly applicable to this problem...|$|R
