5|$|Smerch (Waterspout) {{was ordered}} on 25 June 1863 and {{construction}} began on 13 August at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 1 December. She was launched on 23 June 1864 and completed in 1865 {{at the cost of}} 554,100 rubles. The ship spent her career with the Baltic Fleet. Smerch struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast on 4 August in shallow water and sank. Using pontoons, she was refloated on 1 September and repaired. Little is known of her service other than she was extensively refitted in 1882 and 1889 which included replacement of much of the plating of her <b>hull</b> <b>bottom.</b> The ship was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and subsequently became a training ship.|$|E
5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using armoured plates {{riveted to}} a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E

50|$|For {{water systems}} at {{relatively}} low temperatures, the applied biocides may {{be classified as}} follows: inorganic chlorine and bromide compounds, chlorine and bromide cleavers, ozone and oxygen cleavers, unoxidizable biocides. One {{of the most important}} unoxidizable biocides is a mixture of chloromethyl-isothiazolinone and methyl-isothiazolinone. Also applied are dibrom nitrilopropionamide and quaternary ammonium compounds. For underwater ship <b>hulls</b> <b>bottom</b> paints are applied.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:High-speed heavy loaded monohull ships {{can benefit}} from {{application}} of drag-reducing air cavities under stepped <b>hull</b> <b>bottoms.</b> The subject {{of this paper is}} the steady hydrodynamic modeling of semi-planing air-cavity hulls. The current method is based on a linearized potential-flow theory for surface flows. The mathematical model description and parametric calculation results for a selected configuration with pressurized and open air cavities are presented...|$|R
2500|$|The hull was flat-sided and deep. Its {{underside}} had two steps; {{in front}} of the first the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> was a hollow V in section and behind it a flat V. There was a little water rudder behind the rear step. Pilot and mechanic sat side-by-side in an open cockpit, with gunner's positions ahead of them and at the trailing edge. [...] Alternatively, the Robbe could be configured to carry four passengers, one in a forward cabin, two in a central one and one more im a rear cabin, or to carry goods or post. The hull was divided into seven watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy. An unusual feature of each gunner's cockpit was a duralumin, telescopic mast. If, in an emergency the Robbe alighted without power, these could each be extended and a simple, triangular sail raised to reach safety. [...] At the rear the tail was conventional, with a blunted rectangular fin and small unbalanced rudder. The high aspect ratio horizontal tail, again rectangular apart from blunted tips, was mounted well up the fin and strut-braced to the upper fuselage. Like the rudder, the elevators were unbalanced.|$|E
2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|E

2500|$|The <b>hull's</b> <b>bottom</b> is {{transversely}} {{flat and}} usually bowed fore-and-aft. (This curvature {{is known as}} [...] "rocker".) The stern is frequently a raked narrow transom that tapers sharply toward the bottom forming a nearly double-ended boat. The traditional bottom is made from planks laid fore and aft and not transverse, although some hulls have {{a second set of}} planks laid over the first in a pattern that is crosswise to the main hull for additional wear and strength.|$|R
50|$|Split barges {{serve the}} same purpose, {{but instead of}} a door in the <b>hull's</b> <b>bottom,</b> the <b>hull</b> of the whole barge splits {{longitudinally}} between the end bulkheads. The vessel consists of two major parts (port and starboard halves), both are mostly symmetrical in design. Both parts of the vessel are hinged at the deck and operated by hydraulic cylinders. When the vessel splits the load is dumped rapidly, which means the barge {{has to be very}} stable in order not to capsize or otherwise get damaged.|$|R

50|$|The boat's hull is {{made from}} {{lightweight}} fiberglass. The mast, rudder, bowsprit, and keel fin are made from carbon fiber for light weight. The hull is generally flat on the bottom, making it plane easily. The 630 pound (286 kg) keel bulb can retract up to the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> {{to make it easier}} to put on a trailer.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{there are}} still {{considerable}} remains of the Clan Ranald left on the site. Almost the entire hull has collapsed, except for a portion that is held up by the port side boiler. The double <b>hulled</b> <b>bottom</b> of the bow is standing vertical and the bow section has collapsed forwards and downwards into two parts. There are still enormous boilers that remain on site, approximately 2-3 {{times the size of}} a diver and provide a spectacular site for anybody who visits the site and the port main boiler has rolled out and is free of the hull remains. Underneath the collapsed hull, the engine still remains relatively intact.|$|R

50|$|The {{total load}} on a {{particular}} section of a ship's hull is {{the sum total of}} all primary, secondary, and tertiary loads imposed on it from all factors.The typical test case for quick calculations is the middle of a <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> plate section between stiffeners, close to or at the midsection of the ship, somewhere midways between the keel and the side of the ship.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} front drive sprockets, rear idlers and eight double-interleaved rubber-rimmed steel road wheels {{on each side}} — in the so-called Schachtellaufwerk design, suspended on a dual torsion bar suspension. The dual torsion bar system, designed by Professor Ernst Lehr, allowed for a wide travel stroke and rapid oscillations with high reliability, thus allowing for relatively high speed travel over undulating terrain. The extra space required for the bars running across {{the length of the}} bottom of the hull, below the turret basket, increased the overall height of the tank and also prevented the provision for an escape hatch in the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom.</b> When damaged by mines, the torsion bars often required a welding torch for removal.|$|E
50|$|The turret was offset to {{the right}} to {{maximize}} the room in the passenger compartment. Six infantry soldiers for dismounted fighting were held in the passenger compartment. Vision for the troops was provided through three periscopes placed between the rear ramp and the cargo hatch just behind the turret, as well as two periscopes {{on each side of the}} hull above the side firing ports. The passenger compartment also held up to five TOW or Dragon missile reloads. The side and rear hull armor consisted of two 0.25 in steel plates one inch apart and 3.5 in away from the aluminum armor. The hull top, bottom, and front consisted of 5083 aluminum armor, and 0.357 in steel armor was added to the front third of the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> to increase mine protection.|$|E

25|$|The Sealand was a {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with a flying boat hull and both underwing floats and a standard tail-wheel undercarriage; the two main wheels retracted into recesses in the hull below the wings, while the tailwheel retracted behind the <b>hull's</b> planing <b>bottom.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Sloughing bottom paints", or [...] "ablative" [...] paints, are {{an older}} type of paint {{designed}} to create a hull coating which ablates (wears off) slowly, exposing a fresh layer of biocides. Scrubbing a <b>hull</b> with sloughing <b>bottom</b> paint while {{it is in the}} water releases its biocides into the environment. One way to minimize the environmental impact from <b>hulls</b> with sloughing <b>bottom</b> paint is to have them hauled out and cleaned at boatyards with a [...] "closed loop" [...] system.|$|R

50|$|The {{transmission}} housing was rounded, made of three cast sections bolted together or cast as one piece. It ranged from 50.8-108 mm (2 to 4.25 in) thick The {{upper and lower}} hull sides were 38 mm thick, and vertical, while the upper hull rear was also 38 mm thick, vertical or sloped at 10 degrees from the vertical. The lower hull rear, which protected the engine, was 38 mm thick, sloped at 0 to 22 degrees from the vertical depending upon the variant. The hull roof was 25.4 mm. The hull floor ranged from 25.4 mm thick under the driver and assistant driver's positions to 12.7 mm thick at the rear. The M4 had a hatch on the <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> to dispose of spent shell casings and to provide an emergency escape route. In the Pacific, Marines often used this Sherman feature in reverse to recover wounded infantry under fire.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} breakthroughs, {{in the development of the}} waterjet, was to change the design so it expelled the jetstream above the water line, contrary to many people's intuition. Hamilton discovered early on that this greatly improved performance, compared to expelling below the waterline, while also providing a [...] "clean" [...] <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> (i.e. nothing protruding below the hull line) to allow the boat to skim through very shallow water. It makes no difference to the amount of thrust generated whether the outlet is above or below the waterline, but having it above the waterline reduces hull resistance and draught. Hamilton's first waterjet design had the outlet below the hull and actually in front of the inlet. This probably meant that disturbed water was entering the jet unit and reducing its performance, and the main reason why the change to above the waterline made such a difference.|$|E

5000|$|The {{boat was}} built by the Dravo Contracting Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1932. She was Hull #1139 and weighed 947 tons. [...] The Sainte Genevieve had a steel hull and a {{superstructure}} of wood with steel for strengthening. Between 1963 and 1973, 97% of her <b>hull</b> <b>bottom</b> and 71% of her sides were replated. [...] Her paint scheme of gray and ivory with trim colors of dark red, black and gray {{was consistent with the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers application and hues. [...] She was used by the St. Louis District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the main channel of the Mississippi River to keep it open to barge traffic. [...] She was the last sternwheel vessel and the last steam powered dredge operated by the Corps when she retired in 1984. [...] She was given to the city of Davenport for use as a tourist attraction. Plans were to turn her into a dockside restaurant, a floating museum, or a bed and breakfast. Those plans were never realized, and she left Davenport in October 1990 for a new home on the Missouri River in St. Charles, Missouri. She did not make it there. The Sainte Genevieve sank in 1992 near Cairo, Illinois. She was raised, and sank again in Cape Girardeau, Missouri in 1994. She was reportedly scrapped.|$|E
