His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who care about this stuff. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?'

He confesses {{that he has been}} {{suffering}} from want of sleep at night. I tell him that his nerves are out of order, and that he ought to take medicine. He tells me that taking medicine and groping in the dark mean one and the same thing. This before all the company at the dinner-table. I say to him, you are groping after sleep, and nothing but medicine can help you to find it. He says to me, I have heard of the blind leading the blind, and now I know what it means. Witty--but I can give him a night's rest in spite of his teeth. He really wants sleep; and Lady Verinder's medicine chest is at my disposal. Give him five-and-twenty minims of laudanum to-night, without his knowing it; and then call to-morrow morning. 'Well, Mr. Blake, will you try a little medicine to-day? You will never sleep without it.'--'There you are out, Mr. Candy: I have had an excellent night's rest without it.' Then, come down on him with the truth!

5000|$|Sztokman's linking of Orthodox {{practice}} to radical Islam {{on the issue}} of women's body cover is met with criticism by some Orthodox Jews who claim that these cultures are different. As one commenter wrote: [...] "Sztokman likens Orthodox Judaism to the Taliban, an ethos in which women are kept illiterate and routinely endure physical beatings.What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observation that such an incendiary comparison is over the top and borders on hate speech?"Sztokman argues that much of the rabbinic writing on the subject of women's bodies is based on misogynistic ideas about women's proper role in society. In one story about a rabbi allegedly recommending to a girl that she cut her legs rather than submit to her parents' requests that she wear pants, Sztokman writes, [...] "Orthodox Judaism has issues with the female body, to put it mildly. In a culture defined by the degree to which women are kept silent and invisible, pressured to have as many babies and possible while maintaining the home and covering as much flesh as possible," [...] {{it is not surprising that}} some rabbis make extreme recommendations regarding women's bodies.|$|E

This {{is a problem that}} Jim Lewis and Ruth Heaton, instructors at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, gave on Day 1 of their geometry class for future elementary teachers in the Fall of 2002. Twenty-four of the thirty-two future elementary teachers believed the child’s theory was correct and indicated they would congratulate the child. Eight of the thirty-two questioned the child’s theory and only six out of those eight explained that the theory was definitely not true. Area and perimeter are concepts that seem to cause difficulty for students. They sometimes understand the concepts separately, but the difficulty arises when the concepts are put together. This is understandable since adults in a geometry class for futur...|$|E

In a bedchamber the Bank, portrayed as an obese woman, lies in bed vomiting coins "Deposites [sic]" into a basin "Manhattan Bank. " Nearby are two other basins (filled) marked "Mechanics Bank" and "Bank of America," and two broken medicine vials labeled "Veto" and "Order for the Removal of the Deposites.

Clay: "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> application of my Patent American System?" Calhoun: "Doctor your American System won't do here. Desperate cases require desperate remedies, a few of the leaden pills of Nullification and some blood taken will suffice. " Calhoun's reputation in the North was sorely affected by his leadership role in the southern Nullification effort of 1832.
