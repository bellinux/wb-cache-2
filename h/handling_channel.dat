50|$|OFDM {{is based}} on the idea of {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (FDM), but the multiplexed streams are all parts of a single original stream. The bit stream is split into several parallel data streams, each transferred over its own sub-carrier using some conventional digital modulation scheme. The modulated sub-carriers are summed to form an OFDM signal. This dividing and recombining help with <b>handling</b> <b>channel</b> impairments. OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multiplex technique since it transfers one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of so-called OFDM symbols. OFDM can be extended to multi-user channel access method in the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) and multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) schemes, allowing several users to share the same physical medium by giving different sub-carriers or spreading codes to different users.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a token based {{algorithm}} to access the shared medium in an optical ring network. The algorithm is based on reservation scheme. However, unlike other reservation schemes, which operate on three stages viz. reserve, transmit and release, the proposed scheme operates in two stages and does not explicitly release the resources. The proposed algorithm selects the earliest available datachannel for reservation hence we call it Earliest Available Channel (EAC) algorithm. The EAC algorithm operates in a distributed manner. Each node in the network maintains three modules: send, receive and token processing modules. The algorithm has the capability of <b>handling</b> <b>channel</b> collision and destination conflicts. We study the performance of the algorithm by simulation for bursty traffic modeled by M/Pareto distribution. ...|$|E

In particular, analytical results on D 2 D performance for offloading and relay are very promising, but no experimental evidence validates these results to date. This paper {{is the first to}} provide an experimental analysis of outband D 2 D relay schemes. Moreover, we design DORE, a complete framework for <b>handling</b> <b>channel</b> opportunities offered by outband D 2 D relay nodes. DORE consists of resource allocation optimization tools and protocols suitable to integrate QoS-aware opportunistic D 2 D communications within the architecture of 3 GPP Proximity-based Services. We implement DORE using an SDR framework to profile cellular network dynamics in the presence of opportunistic outband D 2 D communication schemes. Our experiments reveal that outband D 2 D communications are suitable for relaying in a large variety of delay-sensitive cellular applications, and that DORE enables notable gains even with a few active D 2 D relay nodes.

40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} study was {{the determination of the}} hand assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy operative approach. Material – Method: For this {{experimental study}} we used 12 pigs with a mean body weight of 35 Kg, operated under general anaesthesia. In the first 6 pigs we tested operative techniques suggested in recent studies, as well as some variants of them, when the presented technique was not satisfactory. A new technique of hand assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy was then developed and applied to the remaining 6 animals. A small, 6 mm midline incision over the umbilicus was made and the hand access device for the surgeon’s non dominant hand was put in place. A 5 / 10 mm camera trocar was placed about 10 cm subumbillicaly and 6 - 8 cm {{to the left of the}} midline. On the left and right midclavical line, 5 cm below the costal bow, two additional trocars were placed; a 5 / 12 mm <b>handling</b> <b>channel</b> trocar on the left and a 5 mm trocar to handle the right leading rib (thread) of the esophagus. Finally, on the posterior axillary line bilaterally and just below the costal bow, another pair of trocars was placed; a 10 mm trocar on the right for the entry of the liver retractor and a 5 mm trocar to handle left leading rib (thread) of the cross-sected esophagus. The gastrosplenic ligament and the short gastric arteries were firstly divided, followed by division of the duodenum. The vagus nerves were then recognized and divided. At this point the esophagus was divided and two threads were put in place. After careful division of the right and left gastric artery, the stomach was extracted through the hyperumbillical incision. An esophagojejunal Roux en Y anastomosis was then made using a circular and a linear stapler. The Roux en Y praparation was made extraabdominally through the hyperumbilicus incision. Results: No leak was identified and no bleeding occurred. The suggested technique is quite similar to the open technique, thus contributing not only to a quicker learning curve but also to an oncologic excision of the stomach. The method also proved to be safe, regaiding bleeding and anastomosis leak. The described surgical steps were followed fluently and without problems in all experiments, making the proposed technique easy to perform and repeatable. Conclusions: The described method of the hand assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy is safe, sufficient, easy and repeatable. We think that, initially, the method can be used in benign disease cases and, as experience is gained, it can be used in malignant stomach tumors as well. However, in due time, we believe that the method will be applied in all cases that require total excision of the stomach. ...|$|E

The error performance is further improved by bit interleaving and channel coding, where the encoders/channel {{is viewed as a}} serially concatenated system: a convolutional code (CC) constitutes the outer code, whereas a differential encoder and the fading channel (having truncated mem-ory) form a joint inner code. In order to obtain a feasible detector structure, it is desirable to perform iterative de-coding, which implies the need for an APP (a posteriori probability) algorithm that can operate over fading chan-nels. For this purpose, the well-known BCJR algorithm (due to Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, Raviv [1]) is generalized to <b>handle</b> <b>channels</b> having memory.

40|$|Channel {{assignments}} in a wireless cellular network is a discrete-time event process involving the correct mapping of the channels to the caller-receiver pairs.

The dynamic technique refers to the constantly changing shape of the single-row network over time as a result of its transformation from its base graph. The base graph is formed from the caller-receiver pairs in the cellular network whose shape is determined from factors such as their cellular location and duration of calls. This graph is transformed into a single-row network where the pins in the network become the channels. The transformation process is conducted dynamically over time to produce a dynamic single-row network as part of the circuitry in the multi-switching center. ...|$|R

Therefore, when using IEEE 802. 11 devices in mobile environments, {{it is critical}} to have an effective rate adaptation scheme that can deal with these issues.

RAM uses a receiver-based approach to <b>handle</b> <b>channel</b> asymmetry and a conservative SNR prediction algorithm to deal with high channel fluctuation. More importantly, RAM allows the receiver to convey the feedback information to the transmitter in a creative manner via ACK transmission rate variation, which does not require changes to the device firmware and hence is implementable at the device driver level. In addition, RAM adopts an effective scheme to guarantee that RAM-based and legacy IEEE 802. 11 devices can interoperate with each other.
