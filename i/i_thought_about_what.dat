The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann's 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court, when he was held within a similar cage.

40|$|It is {{said that}} Sabbath keeping is not just taking a day off; rather, it is {{ordering}} your life around a pattern of working and resting. The day is to be set apart and devoted to rest, play, and delighting oneself in God. 1 As <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> and prayed <b>about</b> <b>what</b> discipline to choose to practice for my engaged learning project, my immediate thoughts went toward solitude and fasting. These are two disciplines of which I feel that I don"t have a clear understanding and could benefit from them.

I try to honor you by keeping that day sacred and holy. ” The more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, the more I realized that Sunday {{was one of my}} busiest days. I preach multiple times, interact with those who attend, and often have spontaneous counseling moments that usually leave me exhausted. I realized that my energy is at an all-time low.

40|$|People {{who spend}} time {{together}} begin {{to experience the}} world in similar ways, coming in fact to share the world. Just a few days ago, my wife and I walked through downtown Victoria {{to pick up a}} stereo amplifier from the repair shop when I noticed her head move slightly left to right. I turned my head in the direction of her gaze, and, before we began talking, I knew she was alerting me to the aboriginal people sitting against the wall asking for dimes, with faces ravaged by alcohol abuse. In fact, she was alerting me to the plight of the First Nations people in our country, their fight for self-government, and their battle against the alcohol. Seconds later, we talked about just that. That is, without having talked, a simple movement of her eyes while gazing in a particular direction had communicated to me what she was presently attuned to. As <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened while walking on, I remembered many such incidences that had occurred between my younger brother and I during a period when we had {{spent a lot of time}} together.

Coming to experience the world in similar ways, or rather, coming to experience a similar world is not unique to members of the same family. A decade of research showed that people who coteach come to perceive their settings in similar ways, and they tend to act like one another.

Its autobiographical {{content is}} based on my own journal writing, sketches, and paintings produced throughout my graduate as well as undergraduate degree in Art Education at Concordia University. Between 1992 and 1999, I attended numerous studio classes in which critiques were held regularly. I became increasingly interested {{in the notion of}} critiques as they were held in university studio classes. Once someone asked me whether I felt the manner in which we had critiques was in any way helpful to me. My answer was an evasive 'not really, but I found it interesting to hear different responses to my work. ' Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I had said. Was it true that the feedback of others did not affect my work at all? Of course not. I began with the question: how did what others say about my work affect me or my painting process? I examined my journal notes and the notes I took during critiques in order to answer my question. In doing so, I came to the realization that I had addressed the notion of critiques quite a bit in my journals. In this study, I gathered a number of paintings and journal entries as well as notes taken during the critiques of those particular paintings in order to examine how words have affected my work. This thesis is a personal reflection about how language, either through critiques or through writing, impacts my work I revisited the art/writing journals I have kept {{for the past eight years}} in order to see what, if anything, I have stated about my own art making process.

500|$|In September 1936, Mickal played {{quarterback for}} the Centennial College All-Stars, a team {{composed}} of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive {{into the end zone}} from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. [...] "A lot of things flashed through my mind," [...] explained Mickal. [...] "There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> Nagurski's size. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the Nagurski legend. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> going to med school. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> possible brain damage." [...] He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.|$|R
