60|$|Once more {{brother and}} sister {{exchanged}} quick glances. Once more the men of Theos, as with one throat, shouted for Nicholas of Reist. Marie looked curiously towards the Prince. He was handsomer than Brand, broader and of finer presence. Yet <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>with</b> something which was akin to hate. In her heart she believed that her brother was making a great mistake. It was a Reist this people wanted, not one of his corrupt race.|$|E
60|$|She laughed gayly, {{leaning back}} against the dark green {{upholstery}} and showing her flawless teeth; <b>her</b> long, <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> their seductive gleam flashed into his. A lighter spirit possessed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she replied, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> critically, [...] "that cow's horn isn't on straight--the red cow's left horn. And it's {{the same}} size, {{all the way}} up." ...|$|R
60|$|Gerald's <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>with</b> a queer {{dangerous}} {{smile as}} he watched the other man.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Eastman looked {{blankly at}} her son. He had never defied or disobeyed {{her in his}} life before. She had {{supposed}} her word would be law. Rebellion was something she had not dreamed of. Her lips tightened ominously and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ingua, walking {{beside her}} up the bank, paused with a startled {{expression}} and grew red. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrowed</b> and shrewd, fixed themselves suspiciously on Josie's face. But the other returned the look with a bland smile that surely ought to disarm one more sophisticated than this simple child.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly she started, and {{her fingers}} closed more convulsively than before on the curtain behind her. Imperceptible {{as the sound}} of a swallow on the wing, there came a long-drawn sigh to her ear. Her brow contracted, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> in a great effort to peer past the light into the darkness.|$|R
60|$|She did not reply. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>narrowed</b> a little, as the Colonel's were {{sometimes}} prone to do, {{and her lips}} were pressed firmly together.|$|R
60|$|Violet sat {{perfectly}} {{still in her}} chair. For several seconds she did not utter a syllable. Her lips were a little parted. The color seemed suddenly drawn from her face, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed.</b> One realized then the pernicious effect of cosmetics. Her blackened eyebrows were painfully apparent. The little patch of rouge was easily discernible against the pallor of her powdered skin. She was suddenly ugly. Saton, looking at her, was amazed that he could ever have brought himself to touch her lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{seemed to}} <b>narrow</b> a little, and the smile upon her lips was forced.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{looked at}} <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes.</b> He hated <b>her</b> voice. She let <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> rest on his for a moment. Then {{she put her}} {{cigarette}} to her lips. Robert was watching them both.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oblige me {{by telling}} me your {{reason for not}} wearing the {{diamonds}} when I desire it," [...] said Grandcourt. His eyes were still fixed upon her, and she felt <b>her</b> own <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> under them as if to shut out an entering pain.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> had {{a mischievous}} gleam. “Do you find such sayings in your books?” she asked.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> {{magnificent}} black <b>eyes,</b> <b>narrowed,</b> long in shape, {{swept over}} {{me with an}} indefinable expression, then in a harsh, contemptuous voice she let fall in French a sort of explanation: ...|$|R
60|$|The chin {{was small}} and round, the mouth {{extraordinarily}} red, the neck slender and long. But she was not pretty: so said all the women. Her skin was rather coarse in texture and darkish in colour, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>narrow</b> and slightly turned upwards at the corners; no! she was distinctly not pretty.|$|R
6000|$|Her ladyship's brows went up; <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> again, and a frown came between them. [...] "You are mighty mysterious," [...] said she, {{looking from}} one to the other of the men, and bethinking her that it was not the first time she had found them so; bethinking her, too--jumping, woman-like, to rash conclusions--that in this mystery that linked them might lie the true secret of her husband's aversion to his son and of his oath a month ago to see that same son hang if Mr. Caryll succumbed to the wound he had taken. With some women, to suspect a thing is to believe that thing. Her ladyship was of these. She set too high value upon her acumen, upon the keenness of her instincts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{people would}} be ashamed to fill up a place {{belonging}} by rights to others," [...] said Mrs. Waule, turning <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> in the same direction.|$|R
5000|$|When her {{daughter}} Susana was born, due to <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes,</b> Aráoz would tell his friend Crespo, [...] "Felipe, a daughter has been born to me who is like Balbín." ...|$|R
60|$|Dominey {{looked at}} her calmly. Some sort of evil seemed to have lit in her face. Her lips had shrunk apart, showing her yellow teeth. The fire in <b>her</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> was the fire of hatred.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap you have," [...] {{she whispered}} in return, and then, marvelling at her boldness, blushed. He glanced sharply at <b>her</b> from <b>narrowing</b> <b>eyes.</b> It {{was not the}} answer he had looked to hear.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was during}} {{the thick of the}} {{reception}} that one of Miss Von Taer's intimates, a graceful blond girl, suddenly seized her arm and whispered: [...] "Oh, Diana! Guess who's here--guess, my dear!" [...] Diana knew. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> always <b>narrowed</b> until the lashes shielded their sharp watchfulness, seldom missed observing anything of importance. She pressed her friend's hand and turned again to the line of guests, while Louise, who had overheard the excited whisper, wondered casually what it might mean.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} a surgical technique used in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissure undergoing femtosecond laser flap creation without suction during laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Methods: All data of 2 patient groups were collected through chart review. Group 1 consisted of 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissure {{in which the}} suction ring was manually fixated and femtosecond laser was applied accordingly. Thirty comparison cases were randomly drawn from among eyes that underwent a standard LASIK procedure matched for age and preoperative refraction (group 2). Only 1 eye of each patient was selected to compare the refractive and visual outcomes between groups. Results: In all group 1 eyes, the flaps were created successfully with manual fixation of the suction ring without suction. No eyes lost 2 or more lines of vision. No {{significant difference was found}} in the safety and refractive outcomes between groups. Conclusion: Manual fixation of the suction ring in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissure without suction was feasible for flap creation during LASIK...|$|R
60|$|Presently Helen {{returned}} {{to shut the}} door behind her; and her walk toward Lane had a suggestion of the oriental dancer. For Lane her face was a study. This seemed a woman beyond his comprehension. She was the Helen Wrapp he had known and loved, plus an age of change, a measureless experience. With that swaying, sinuous, pantherish grace, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> green <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> and gleaming, half mocking, half serious, she glided up to him, close, closer until she pressed against him, and her face was uplifted under his. Then she waited with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> gazing into his. Slumberous green depths, slowly lighting, they seemed to Lane. Her presence thus, her brazen challenge, affected him powerfully, but he had no thrill.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} matter," [...] {{interrupted}} the daughter, lightly, as <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> to a hair's breadth. [...] "Any who dares reproach Diana Von Taer will afford her interesting occupation. And to offset that remote contingency we shall permanently enslave the powerful John Merrick. I understand he is hard as nails in financial matters; but {{to us the}} man has disclosed his one weakness--ambition to promote his three nieces. Since we have discovered this vulnerable point, let us take advantage of it. I am satisfied the loan of three hundred thousand was but a lure--and how cleverly the man gauged us!" ...|$|R
60|$|We stood {{very close}} together, <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> were as enigmatic as ever, but that face, which, like some ideal {{conception}} of art, {{was incapable of}} anything like untruth and grimace, expressed by some mysterious means such a depth of infinite patience that I felt profoundly ashamed of myself.|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} the mechanical effects of pilocarpine on the trabecular-iris angle opening in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles, compared <b>with</b> {{its effects on}} healthy control subjects with wide angles.  METHODS—A narrow angle was defined as 25 ° or less of trabecular-iris angle on ultrasound biomicroscopic examination. The change in anterior chamber depth (ACD), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle opening distance (AOD, distance between trabecular meshwork and iris) measured at 250  µm and 500  µm from the scleral spur (AOD 250 and AOD 500), and iris thickness was determined in 30  eyes of 30  patients (13  men and 17  women, between 63  and 82  years (mean 70. 4  years)) <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles and in 30  sex and age matched control subjects with wide angles before and 1  hour after the instillation of 2 % pilocarpine hydrochloride by ultrasound biomicroscopy.  RESULTS—In all <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles, pilocarpine increased the TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; these changes increased significantly and linearly as the corresponding pretreatment values decreased (r =  0. 807, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 787, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 852, p =  0. 0001). Of 30  eyes with wide angles, 23  eyes whose ACD was 2670  µm and more showed {{a decrease in the}} TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; the changes in TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500 also significantly correlated with the corresponding pretreatment values (r =  0. 913, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 882, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 895, p =  0. 0001). Pilocarpine induced a smaller decrease in ACD in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles than in those with wide angles (p =  0. 0001). There was a linear correlation between the increase in ACD change and the decrease in pretreatment ACD in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles and those with wide angles (r =  0. 781, p =  0. 0003; r =  0. 798, p =  0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The finding that pilocarpine increases angular width in patients <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles indicates that this agent is useful for treating patients <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles and angle closure glaucoma. The prediction of the pilocarpine induced change in the angle may assist ophthalmologists in treating such patients. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right! All right then! It is all right--forgotten--" [...] Madame sounded quite {{frank and}} restored. But the sullen watchfulness in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the <b>narrowed</b> look in Ciccio's, as {{he glanced at}} her, showed another state behind the obviousness of the words. [...] "And Miss Houghton is one of us! Yes? She has united us once more, and so she {{has become one of}} us." [...] Madame smiled strangely from her blank, round white face.|$|R
5000|$|The {{woman in}} Fukaku Shinobu Koi ( [...] , [...] "deeply hidden love") has {{blackened}} her teeth with ohaguro, which normally signifies a married woman, but she lacks the shaved eyebrows {{that would also}} signify her being married; she is perhaps yet young and recently married. Her ornate kanzashi hairpin has a flower design on it. She looks down and holds a kiseru tobacco pipe in her right hand. She stares off, <b>her</b> shoulders raised, <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed,</b> and tiny lips pursed, as if in deep, emotional mid-sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: The Lady Vivien cometh {{forth to}} Sir Percival] Now {{as he drew}} nigh to the castle the gate thereof was opened, and there came forth thence an {{extraordinarily}} beautiful lady surrounded by a court of esquires and pages all very beautiful of countenance. And this lady and all of her court were clad in red so that they shone like to several flames of fire. And the lady's hair was as red as gold, and she wore gold ornaments about her neck so that she glistered exceedingly and was very wonderful to behold. And her eyebrows were very black and fine and were joined in the middle like two fine lines drawn together with a pencil, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>narrow</b> and black, shining {{like those of a}} snake.|$|R
60|$|Walking {{backwards}} as nimbly as a cat, {{his head}} drooped, {{his hands in}} front of him, Li Wen left his master's presence. A moment later he reappeared, ushering in La Belle Nita. Prince Shan waved him away. The girl came slowly forward, pale and trembling, smouldering fires in <b>her</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes.</b> Not a muscle of Prince Shan's face moved. He watched her approach in silence. She sank on to the floor by the side of his chair.|$|R
40|$|Phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber-lens {{implantation}} in {{eyes with}} acute angle-closure glaucoma compared to cataract extraction in their partner eyes. Methods: Twelve patients were included, one with bilateral angle-closure-glaucoma and eleven with unilateral glaucoma. Thirteen eyes with an elevated intraocular pressure {{due to an}} angle-closure were treated by phacoemulsification and IOL implantation and compared to 11 partner <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angle (three previously treated by iridectomy) without intraocular pressure elevation. The average follow-up period was 15. 7 ± 2. 1 months. Results: The average intraocular pressure in eyes with angle-closure glaucoma was 54. 1 ± 14. 7 mmHg and in the partner eyes 22. 4 ± 8. 6 mmHg preoperatively. Follow-up pressure was 19. 3 ± 2. 0 mmHg in eyes with angle-closure glaucoma and 18. 8 ± 1. 8 mmHg in the partner eyes. Conclusion: Primary cataract extraction including posterior-chamber-lens implantation into eyes with angle-closure-glaucoma reduced intraocular pressure to normal levels, increased visual acuity, and decreased the number of antiglaucomatous drugs. Eyes with angle-closure-glaucoma do not respond differently to phacoemulsification and lens implantation compared to <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angle without pressure elevation during and after phacoemulsification...|$|R
50|$|Dürer {{presents}} {{himself in}} similar poses and expressions in both his 1498 Christ as Man of Sorrows and 1503 charcoal drawing Head of the Dead Christ. Both {{are believed to}} be self-portraits, although they are not named as such. However, artist historians believe that since they bear remarkable similarities to his known self-portraits - including prominent <b>eyes,</b> a <b>narrow</b> mouth <b>with</b> a full upper lip, and the shape of both the nose and indent between lip and nose - that Dürer intended to represent himself in these works.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{challenge}} in her glance, but the man, not knowing {{what was expected of}} him, made no answer. At first he had been almost repelled by the girl, but he was becoming mildly interested in her. She could, he thought, be daring to the verge of coarseness, and he did not admire her pessimism, which was probably a pose; but there was a vein of elfish mischief in her that appealed to him. Sitting among the heather, small, lithe, and felinely graceful, watching him with a provocative smile in <b>her</b> rather <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes,</b> she compelled his attention.|$|R
6000|$|She was sitting, {{her hands}} clasped in her lap, two red spots high in <b>her</b> cheeks, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> shining strangely, the faint smile still on her lips. And Winton, staring <b>with</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes,</b> thought: 'Love! Beyond measure--beyond death--it nearly kills. But one wouldn't have been without it. Why?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} {{to give her a}} sense of proportion. I suppose she figured England to herself as {{about the size of the}} Pearl of the Ocean; in which case it would certainly have been reeking with gore and a mere wreck of burgled houses from end to end. One could not make her understand that these horrors on which she fed her imagination were lost in the mass of orderly life like a few drops of blood in the ocean. She directed upon me for a moment the uncomprehending glance of <b>her</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> and then would turn her scornful powdered face away without a word. She would not even take the trouble to shrug her shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Herr Klesmer, who {{had been}} good-natured enough to seat himself at the piano, struck a thunderous chord--but in the same instant, and before Hermione had put forth her foot, the movable panel, which was on a line with the piano, flew open on the right {{opposite}} the stage and disclosed {{the picture of the}} dead face and the fleeing figure, brought out in pale definiteness by the position of the wax-lights. Everyone was startled, but all eyes in the act of turning toward the open panel were recalled by a piercing cry from Gwendolen, who stood without change of attitude, but with a change of expression that was terrifying in its terror. She looked like a statue into which a soul of Fear had entered: her pallid lips were parted; <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> usually <b>narrowed</b> under their long lashes, were dilated and fixed. Her mother, less surprised than alarmed, rushed toward her, and Rex, too, could not help going to her side. But the touch of her mother's arm had the effect of an electric charge; Gwendolen fell on her knees and put her hands before her face. She was still trembling, but mute, and it seemed that she had self-consciousness enough to aim at controlling her signs of terror, for she presently allowed herself to be raised from her kneeling posture and led away, while the company were relieving their minds by explanation.|$|R
