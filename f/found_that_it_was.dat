5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, the court <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional, and it never became law.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> barely a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{due to a}} lack of user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E

5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked {{to the development of}} duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, James Patton, Maria da Silva, and Jay Malcolm {{reported}} on mammals {{collected at the}} Rio Juruá in western Brazil. In this report, they provided further information on the Oryzomys species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, including sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three O.emmonsae studied was 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement {{can be difficult to}} determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{best to keep}} skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground {{for any length of}} time meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey's {{research}} in the immediate post-war years looked at measuring fundamental properties of atoms and molecules by use of molecular beams. On moving to Harvard, his objective was to carry out accurate molecular beam magnetic resonance experiments, based on the techniques developed by Rabi. However, {{the accuracy of the}} measurements depended on the uniformity of the magnetic field, and Ramsey <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> difficult to create sufficiently uniform magnetic fields. He developed the separated oscillatory field method in 1949 as a means of achieving the accuracy he wanted.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a member}} of the genus Ciconia, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by {{straight}} bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the white stork (C. ciconia). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> basal (an early offshoot) in the genus Ciconia. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.|$|E

5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, {{a depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false potto and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet contain more than one species.|$|E

5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{costs and}} {{concerns}} over the ships' design led to the cancellation of the DDL project. The Department of Defence observed that the DDL's costs were escalating and it was unable to finalise the design. The Navy also reviewed the project and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unduly expensive, and a Joint Parliamentary committee concluded that a unique Australian design entailed significant technological risks. As a result, the Navy recommended to the Government that the DDL project be cancelled, and this took place in August 1973. The cost of the project to the Navy had been A$1.7 million, most of which was spent on design investigations and management consultancies. The opposition Liberal Party opposed the decision to cancel the DDL project.|$|E
5|$|Ji and Ji (1996) {{identified}} many {{features that}} set Sinosauropteryx {{apart from other}} birds and dinosaurs. They <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a small primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was robust, the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is extremely well developed and acute; that there are over 50 extremely elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is extremely short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and extremely inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the hind limb was long and robust, the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively robust with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament {{the top of the}} skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.|$|E

5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were {{the development of}} the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at those places to investigate, they <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early on, a city that Cubby Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the earliest fragmentary remains that will {{come to be known as}} Deinosuchus, it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a relative of crocodiles, going as far as placing it in the same family (crocodylidae) in 1954, this assignment was mostly supported by dental features but was overturned in 1999 when the finding of new specimens from Texas and Georgia helped place Deinosuchus in a phylogenetic analysis, finding it in a basal position within the clade Alligatoroidea along with Leidyosuchus. This classification was bolstered in 2005 by {{the discovery}} of a well-preserved Deinosuchus brain case from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, Deinosuchus however, was not a direct ancestor of modern alligators.|$|E
