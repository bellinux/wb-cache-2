The primary cause was the fracture from metal fatigue of a wheel tyre; the train failed to negotiate {{two sets of}} points and struck the pier of an overbridge. It was the most serious railway accident in Germany, and also the most serious on any high speed (over 200 kph mph) line.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to study the behaviour of stiffened aluminium plates subjected to large mass (55 kg) projectiles in the low velocity regime. The stiffened aluminium plates were fabricated from aluminium alloy AA 6082 temper T 6 extrusions MIG-welded together to form flat stiffened plates. The study was made on the variation of failure mode and the energy-absorbing capacity with various combinations of projectile nose shape (blunt and hemispherical) and load application point (between two stiffeners, on a stiffener and next to a stiffener). The estimated <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> velocity (giving cracks in the target) was significant less for the hemispherical ended nose than the blunt ended nose. The impact between the stiffeners gave lowest <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> velocity followed by impact next to the stiffener and impact on a stiffener in that order. The estimated ballistic limit velocity was almost equal for impact between two stiffeners using both nose shapes and for impact next to a stiffener with the blunt ended projectile. The hemispherical ended projectile impacting next to a stiffener lead to significant higher ballistic limit. The observed differences in the ballistic limit velocity and <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> velocity were mainly attributed to the change in failure mode (and energy absorption). The blunt projectile caused failure by plugging, while petaling fracture modes were observed for impact with a hemispherical ended projectile. In addition to impact tests, static punch tests were carries out to study any possible relationships between the dynamic and quasi-static capacity before fracture occurs. In the studied velocity range and for the blunt ended projectile, it seems that the static tests may give a conservative estimate of the <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> impact energy. For the hemispherical ended projectile this method may lead to non-conservative results. A metallurgical examination of cross sections of the target at the impact point was carried out to reveal details of internal changes of configuration such as deformations and changes of microstructure, and the generation of fractures. The fracture was initiated on the rear side impacting next to a stiffener or between the stiffeners (on the weld) with both nose shapes. Ductile fracture was observed in all test specimens except for fracture in the welds. No evidence of temperature effects and no pronounced shear localisation through the thickness of the plate where seen. Numerical simulation of perforation of a stiffened plate impacted with a hemispherical ended projectile between two stiffeners (on the weld) has been performed using the non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA. Inverse modelling of tensile test specimens was performed to identify the material parameters. The weld and heat affected were modelled with reduced strength compared to the parent material. The main objective with these numerical simulations was to study whether the Lemaitre damage material model could predict the response of the impacted plate when taking failure into account. The numerical simulation described the maximum force quite well. Furthermore, the model predicts the instability phenomenon and fracture process as observed in the experiments reasonably well. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
50|$|Crack-seal veins {{are thought}} to form quite quickly during {{deformation}} by precipitation of minerals within <b>incipient</b> <b>fractures.</b> This happens swiftly by geologic standards, because pressures and deformation mean that large open spaces cannot be maintained; generally the space is {{in the order of}} millimeters or micrometers.

40|$|International audienceThe brittle {{structures}} of a Hercynian granite (La Borne, French Massif Central) observed at several scales, from regional to microscopic, are presented and interpreted on mechanical terms. Emphasis {{is placed on}} strike slip faults, joints, and cracks related to <b>incipient</b> shear <b>fracturing</b> during horizontal compression. Three compressive tectonic phases have been identified according to their brittle structures and characterised by the burial depth {{at the time of}} their generation. The two first phases (H 1, H 2) are Hercynian and occurred while the granite was deeply buried (∼ 5 to 3 km depth) whereas the last phase (P) is Pyrenean and occurred at very low depth. The geometric organizations of cracks, joints and faults are clearly similar at various scales from about 10 μm to several m. These field observations are strong arguments for the occurrence of shear structures at microscopic to macroscopic scales during tectonic events. Following this inference, it is proposed that, at least in the case of Hercynian phases, cracks, joints and macroscopic strike slip faults have been generated by the same mechanical process under high overburden weight. Therefore, <b>incipient</b> <b>fractures</b> seem to be generated as shearing structures and to evolve by coalescence with neighbouring ones with the same direction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the tensile strength of incipient discontinuities in rock and presents preliminary results from a series of laboratory studies. In most rock masses rock discontinuities, as veins or <b>incipient</b> <b>fractures,</b> often retain some tensile strength that may approach that of the parent rock. This fact is of high importance to rock mass strength but is generally ignored, neglected or underestimated. Samples of incipient rock discontinuities including joints, bedding and mineral veins have been tested in direct tension. It has been confirmed that incipient, visible and discrete discontinuities, that might be recorded as ‘joints’ in a rock mass characterisation programme can indeed have high tensile strength, approaching that of parent rock. Others are of course far weaker. The factors contributing to tensile strength have been examined. It is concluded that the degree of incipiency of rock discontinuities needs to be differentiated in the process of rock mass classification and engineering design and this can best be done with reference to the tensile strength relative to that of the parent rock...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis impact against {{offshore}} pipelines was studied. <b>Incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> in the pipes after impact was of special interest. The present work was {{a continuation of}} previous theses on the subject, and {{part of an ongoing}} research program between SIMLab (NTNU) and Statoil ASA. Component tests and numerical simulations using ABAQUS/Explicit and LS-DYNA were carried out to investigate the problem. Two pipes were impacted at different velocities in the pendulum accelerator at the Department of Structural Engineering, NTNU. The most exposed regions were investigated metallurgically to examine the material behavior at large deformations due to the impact. Pre-compressed notched tension tests at large compressive plastic strains (up to 40 %) were conducted. A material model with combined kinematic and isotropic work-hardening was calibrated based on the material tests. Inverse modeling was carried out with the optimization tool LS-OPT. In addition, the material model consisted of an uncoupled fracture criterion. The combined material model was used in the numerical simulations. The material tests revealed a distinct Bauschinger effect, transient and permanent softening, as well as a work-hardening stagnation during reversed loading. Simulations of the material tests in ABAQUS/Explicit corresponded well with the experiments. However, simulations of the pipe in ABAQUS/Explicit revealed little improvement regarding the global response compared to previous theses. Further, the volume element model in LS-DYNA revealed hydrostatic tension in the critical element during rebound, where <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> was assumed to appear. This was supported by metallurgical investigations revealing a crack through 75 % of the thickness after impact at the highest velocity. It is clear that this decreases the strength of the pipes. Hence, cracks will propagate through the thickness earlier than expected during stretching in the simulations. This indicates that the single-parameter assumption regarding the fracture criterion used in this thesis ceases to be valid for the component test. To recreate the fracture in the impacted pipes an additional formulation must be included. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the fracture behavior of fiber reinforced composites is discussed. It is suggested that experimental and analytical investigations should compliment each other. Further, {{it is suggested that}} in order to understand and mathematically model composite fracture it is necessary to explore, understand and characterize the stress-strain behavior of each type of laminate tested from initial loading to <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture.</b> That is, it is not only necessary to perform fracture studies but it is necessary to perform stress-strain characterization and failure studies as well. For this reason a literature survey is presented in which these three elements are discussed. An experimental program to determine tensile properties of unnotched and notched unidirectional and multi-directional laminates composed of Hercules AS Fiber and 3501 Resin is described. Experimental unnotched moduli and strengths are presented, discussed and compared to lamination theory predictions. It is shown that rate effects are small and that lamination theory gives good results for moduli but not for strengths...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{recent studies}} {{concerning}} {{the evolution of}} the pre-failure damage in several common lithologies, subjected to differential compression, by using detailed acoustic emission (AE) data. The experimental results exhibit a damaging process characterized by three typical phases of microcracking activity: the primary, secondary, and nucleation phases, respectively. The primary phase reflects the initial opening or rupture of pre-existing microcracks, and it is characterized by an increase, with increasing stress, both in the event rate and b value. The secondary phase involves sub-critical growth of the microcrack population in the test sample, revealed by an increase in event rate and a decrease of the b value with increasing stress. The nucleation phase corresponds to the initiation and accelerated growth of the ultimate fracture along one or more <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> plane. During the nucleation phase, the b value decreases rapidly to the global minimum value around 0. 5. The temporal variation of b value in every phase correlated clearly with the major grain size of the test sample, indicating that a comparatively larger grain size results into a lower...|$|E
40|$|Panarea is {{a largely}} {{submarine}} to partly subaerial Quaternary lava dome complex-stratovolcano with a long- lived, active, shallow hydrothermal system, {{located in the}} Aeolian Islands volcanic arc of southern Italy. The emergent top of the volcano forms a small archipelago, made up of calc-alkaline basaltic andesite to rhyolite lava domes (ca. 150 – 20 ka). We document the facies outcropping on Lisca Bianca islet, Panarea archipelago, based on grain size, clast fabric, and degree of hydrothermal alteration, identifying coherent facies, boulder breccia facies, cobble breccia facies, pebble breccia facies, and pervasively altered andesite facies (alunite-mar- casite-sulfur). The breccias all have ubiquitous jigsaw-fit clast textures, and are variably hydrothermally altered. The breccias are interpreted as hydrothermal breccias and are distinguished from primary volcanic facies based on their distinguishing characteristics. The breccias formed through a cyclical process, involving the following: stage 1 : progressive build-up of fluid pressure toward {{the level of the}} tensile strength of the host andesite; stage 2 : <b>incipient</b> <b>fracturing</b> of the andesite when fluid pressure approaches and then exceeds the tensile strength of the andesite under critical fracturing conditions; stage 3 : pervasive fracturing of the host andesite, leading to an increase in permeability as a network of fractures develops; stage 4 : declining pressure, with fluid flow rates that lead to infilling and sealing of fractures by natroalunite, thereby reducing permeability, leading to pro- gressive build-up of fluid pressure again, and {{the beginning of a new}} cycle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{investigation}} of ductile fracture plays {{a significant role}} in achieving the required deformation without the failure of the specimen. The formability of the material can be enhanced by employing proper lubricant at the die/billet interfaces in the upsetting process. When two different lubricants are applied at the die/billet interface and deformed, the billet geometry gets truncated. After observing the experimental results at the <b>incipient</b> of <b>fracture,</b> finite element simulations were conducted to the same strain level. Four workability criterions were considered to investigate the formability of the truncated billets. The strain at which the fracture initiates can be determined and the value thus obtained using these workability criterions is termed as critical damage. With the aid of finite element analysis, the zone of fracture inside the billet was observed and the accurate workability criterion was suggested...|$|R
40|$|The Agost Basin is {{characterized}} by a Miocene–Quaternary shallow marine and continental infilling controlled by the evolution of several curvilinear faults involving salt tectonics derived from Triassic rocks. From the Serravallian on, the area experienced a horizontal maximum compression with a rotation of the maximum stress axis from E–W to N–S. The resulting deformation gave rise to a strike-slip fault whose evolution {{is characterized}} progressively by three stages: (1) stepover/releasing bend with a dextral motion of blocks; (2) very close to pure horizontal compression; and (3) restraining bend with a sinistral movement of blocks. In particular, after an <b>incipient</b> <b>fracturing</b> stage, faults generated a pull-apart basin with terraced sidewall fault and graben subzones developed {{in the context of a}} dextral stepover during the lower part of late Miocene p. p. The occurrence of Triassic shales and evaporites played a fundamental role in the tectonic evolution of the study area. The salty material flowed along faults during this stage generating salt walls in root zones and salt push-up structures at the surface. During the purely compressive stage (middle part of late Miocene p. p.) the salt walls were squeezed to form extrusive mushroom-like structures. The large amount of clayish and salty material that surfaced was rapidly eroded and deposited into the basin, generating prograding fan clinoforms. The occurrence of shales and evaporites (both in the margins of the basin and in the proper infilling) favored folding of basin deposits, faulting, and the formation of rising blocks. Later, in the last stage (upper part of late Miocene p. p.), the area was affected by sinistral restraining conditions and faults must have bent to their current shape. The progressive folding of the basin and deformation of margins changed the supply points and finally caused the end of deposition and the beginning of the current erosive systems. On the basis of the interdisciplinary results, the Agost Basin can be considered a key case of the interference between salt tectonics and the evolution of strike-slip fault zones. The reconstructed model has been compared with several scaled sandbox analogical models and with some natural pull-apart basins.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{laboratory}} experiments designed {{to investigate the}} influence of pore pressure oscillations on the effective permeability of fractured rock. Berea sandstone samples were fractured in situ under triaxial stresses of tens of megapascals, and deionized water was forced through the <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> under conditions of steady and oscillating pore pressure. We find that short‐term pore pressure oscillations induce long‐term transient increases in effective permeability of the fractured samples. The magnitude of the effective permeability enhancements scales with the amplitude of pore pressure oscillations, and changes persist well after the stress perturbation. The maximum value of effective permeability enhancement is 5 × 10 - 16 m 2 with a background permeability of 1 × 10 − 15 m 2; that is, the maximum enhanced permeability is 1. 5 × 10 − 15 m 2. We evaluate poroelastic effects and show that hydraulic storage release does not explain our observations. Effective permeability recovery following dynamic oscillations occurs as the inverse square root of time. The recovery indicates that a reversible mechanism, such as clogging/unclogging of fractures, {{as opposed to an}} irreversible one, like microfracturing, is responsible for the transient effective permeability increase. Our work suggests the feasibility of dynamically controlling the effective permeability of fractured systems. The result has consequences for models of earthquake triggering and permeability enhancement in fault zones due to dynamic shaking from near and distant earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Under {{dynamic loading}} conditions, the rapid {{nature of the}} {{fracture}} process may simultaneously activate {{a considerable number of}} nucleation sites for void formation at the region of the tensile stress field. The growth and coalescence of these voids forms the deformation plane and eventually the fracture surface. Attempts to quantify damage evolution during fracture using microstructural observations, specifically for spallation, were pioneered by Seaman and his coworkers. They performed incipient spallation experiments in which they imposed a peak stress below the spall strength of the material, thereby developing an incipient spallation zone rather than complete separation. When this experimental methodology is applied, recovery techniques are utilized to recover the deformed samples without introducing any additional damage. Seaman and his coworkers, and later Lacomme, et al., developed damage quantification techniques based on area measurements of <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture.</b> However, measuring the area of a fracture opening with a certain degree of precision from a two dimensional image can be extremely inaccurate due to the irregular shape of the image. In recent years several techniques have been developed, or improved, that may allow a better and more accurate quantification of image features observed in metallographic analyses in incipient damage of fracture surfaces. Many of these measured quantities are essential towards developing a solid, robust understanding necessary for a good constitutive model...|$|E
40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation has {{overlaid}} 446 bridge decks {{with low}} slump dense concrete from 1964 through October 1978. The overall performance of these decks has been satisfactory. Nineteen bridges that were resurfaced with either low slump dense concrete (LSDC) or latex-modified concrete were analyzed for chloride content, electrical corrosion potential, delaminations or debonding, and deck surface condition. The resurfacing ages of these bridges range from 5 to 13 years. None of the bridges showed {{any evidence of}} surface distress and the chloride penetration into the resurfacing concrete is relatively low. There are delaminations in the original decks below the resurfacing on the majority of bridges examined. The delaminations are concluded {{to be caused by}} either (A) reinforcing steel corrosion, (B) not removing all delaminated concrete prior to placing the resurfacing concrete, or (C) creating an <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> in the top surf ace of the original deck through the use of scarification equipment. The active corrosion of the reinforcing steel is predominately in the gutter line on the majority of bridges evaluated. Recommendations for future deck repairs include removal of concrete to the top layer of reinforcing steel in areas where an electrical corrosion potential of - 0. 35 V or more is detected, providing more positive methods of locating delaminated concrete, and treating the curb and gutter line to reduce the potential damage from salt water...|$|E
40|$|Selected results (both new and old) {{from our}} {{research}} involving severe wear via thermal mounding in dry sliders (carbon graphite on copper) is presented. Highlighted {{will be the}} comparison of theory (simulations {{of the evolution of}} thermal, stress and fracture fields within a thermal amount mound that predict contact area size, wear particle size and shape, and estimate wear rate) with experiment (wear tests that plot wear rate (micrograms per second) vs. rotor speed and recently developed photoelastic techniques that have visualized the sliding interface and permitted direct measurement of contact areas and thermal mound lifetimes). Comparison of theory with experiment was based on Bryant’s particle ejection theory established for wear associated with thermal mounding on carbon graphite sliders. Contact between a slider and rotor initiates a thermal mound cycle in which extreme temperatures evolving inside the slider concentrates the contact into a thermal mound; during simulations, stresses intensify until material strengths are exceeded and stress failure creates a microcrack. Simulations thereafter follow propagation of this <b>incipient</b> crack; <b>fracture</b> mechanics crack propagation studies provide data that predict wear particle size and shape.

40|$|On Stjernöy, Seiland and the {{neighbouring}} peninsulas of Öksfjord and Bergsfjord ultramafic bodies of peridotite and pyroxenite with associated layered gabbro sequences occur within {{a complex of}} highly metamorphic gabbro gneisses, rocks akin to pyroxene-granulites and mafic charnockites. As is shown on the basement map in insert of backflap the layered gabbro is generally concordant with the foliation of the surrounding gneisses but locally shows transgressive features. Within this mafic province occurrences of hornblendite, carbonatite, and nephelinesyenite are also found, the latter affiliation of rocks probably being the result of metasomatic processes. The petrography and general mineralogy of the ultramafic, gabbroic, and metamorphic types of rocks are described in detail. In the layered gabbro sequences on Stjernöy there exists no gravitational crystallization differentiation such as is found in other stratiform gabbro-peridotite complexes; the variation {{in the composition of}} the characteristic minerals is too small, and irregular at that. The textural relations point to <b>incipient</b> <b>fracturing</b> along grain-boundaries and, especially, to deuteric processes which can be inferred from the abundance of spinel-pyroxene symplectites. The characteristic rims of symplectite around olivine are clearly demonstrated in the photographs 2 and 3 on plate C. In texture and structure the gabbro gneisses and intercalated syenitic and meta-sedimentary rocks on Stjernöy exhibit considerable clastic and plastic deformation. Their mineral association points to an intense regional metamorphism near or within the granulite facies; by means of the ACF diagrams, fig. 9 a and 9 b, it is shown that the plotted mineral parageneses may be stable in the hornblendegranulite and the pyroxene-granulite subfacies. The investigation of co-existing clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine in the layered gabbro-peridotite sequence on Stjernöy indicates that high pressures and temperatures prevailed {{at the time of their}} formation. In tie-line trends of co-existing pyroxenes the layered gabbros from Stjernöy are remarkably similar, not to the normal type of stratiform gabbro-peridotite complexes, but to peridotite nodules in certain basaltic lavas. (compare fig. 5 a and 6 a). As is shown in fig. 6 b the tie-lines joining co-existing orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene from gabbro gneisses exhibit similar trends; these data most probably point to an extreme metamorphism of anhydrous rocks at great depth within the earth’s crust. The chemical analyses of samples of the ultramafic sequence, as plotted in the QLM diagram of fig. 8 a, exhibit a linear trend of differentiation; this suggests a simple process of fractional melting or crystallization. The projection points of the gabbro gneiss occupy a central position in this differentiation trend on Stjernöy; thus the gabbro gneiss provides a suitable material for such a process. High lime content is another chemical characteristic of gabbro and related ultramafic rocks on Stjernöy (fig. 8 b); hence the major femic mineral is a calcium-rich clinopyroxene, whereas magnesium-rich orthopyroxene predominates in the stratiform type of layered complex. Clearly, then, the layered gabbro and related ultramafite within the mafic province of western Finnmark differs considerably in major features from the wellknown layered gabbro-peridotite occurrences such as Bushveld, Stillwater or Skaergaard. Finally the results of the mineralogical and chemical investigations are discussed from the petrogenetic point of view. A hypothesis is offered for the emplacement of layered gabbro and ultramafite on Stjernöy involving differential anatexis with local palingenesis in a deepseated zone of the Caledonian orogen...|$|R
40|$|The {{weakening}} mechanisms {{involved in}} the collapse of complex impact craters are controversial. The Araguainha impact crater, in Brazil, exposes a complex structure of 40 km in diameter, and is an excellent object to address this issue. Its core is dominated by granite. In addition to microstructural observations, magnetic studies reveal its internal fabric acquired during the collapse phase. All granite samples exhibit impact-related planar deformation features (PDFs) and planar fractures (PFs), which were overprinted by cataclasis. Cataclastic deformation has evolved from <b>incipient</b> brittle <b>fracturing</b> to the development of discrete shear bands {{in the center of the}} structure. Fracture planes are systematically decorated by tiny grains (< 10 mu m) of magnetite and hematite, and the orientation of magnetic lineation and magnetic foliation obtained by the anisotropies of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anhysteretic remanence (AAR) are perfectly coaxial in all studied sites. Therefore, we could track the orientation of deformation features which are decorated by iron oxides using the AMS and AAR. The magnetic fabrics show a regular pattern at the borders of the central peak, with orientations consistent with the fabric of sediments at the crater's inner collar and complex in the center of the structure. Both the cataclastic flow revealed from microstructural observations and the structural pattern of the magnetic anisotropy match the predictions from numerical models of complex impact structures. The widespread occurrence of cataclasis in the central peak, and its orientations revealed by magnetic studies indicate that acoustic fluidization likely operates at all scales, including the mineral scales. The cataclastic flow made possible by acoustic fluidization results in an apparent plastic deformation at the macroscopic scale in the core. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Variations in fault structure, for example, surface {{roughness}} and deformation zone width, influence {{the location and}} dynamics of large earthquakes {{as well as the}} distribution of small seismic events. In nature, changes in fault roughness and seismicity characteristics can rarely be studied simultaneously, so that little is known about their interaction and evolution. Here, we investigate the connection between fault structure and near-fault distributions of seismic events over series of stick-slip cycles in the laboratory. We conducted a set of experiments on rough faults that developed from <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces. We monitored stress and seismic activity which occurred in the form of acoustic emissions (AEs). We determined AE density distributions as a function of fault normal distance based on high-accuracy hypocentre locations during subsequent interslip periods. The characteristics of these distributions were closely connected to different structural units of the faults, that is, the fault core, off-fault and background damage zone. The core deformation zone was characterized by consistently high seismic activity, whereas the off-fault damage zone displayed a power-law decay of seismic activity with increasing distance from the fault core. The exponents of the power-law-distributed off-fault activity increased with successive stick-slip events so that later interslip periods showed a more rapid spatial decay of seismic activity from the fault. The increase in exponents was strongest during the first one to three interslip periods and reached approximately constant values thereafter. The relatively rapid spatial decay of AE events during later interslip periods is likely an expression of decreasing fault zone complexity and roughness. Our results indicate a close relationship between fault structure, stress and seismic off-fault activity. A more extensive mapping of seismic off-fault activity-decay has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of fault zone properties including variations in fault roughness and stress...|$|E
40|$|Deformation {{structures}} {{below the}} basal plane of gravitational slides can provide useful {{information about the}} state of stress undergone by rocks prior to the sliding process and about the triggering forces acting at each particular sliding event. In the present work we conducted a structural analysis of the rocks {{below the surface of the}} gravitational slide of Tazo (La Gomera, Canary Islands) and determined the epigenetic processes involved in the filling of the amphitheatre. We also inferred the possible triggering phenomena related to the Tazo landslide. The rocks located below the surface of the gravitational slide of Tazo -i. e., the basaltic lava flows, sills and dikes of the Lower Old Edifice and the submarine volcanic rocks, gabbros, pyroxenites and dikes of the Basal Complex of La Gomera- are strongly deformed close to this sliding surface. The lava flows and dikes of the Lower Old Edifice are folded, with fault breccias and gouges, and locally foliated, defining the sliding surface. The dikes of the Basal Complex are also folded, and the gabbros and pyroxenites are affected by a large number of small faults. In the Basal Complex, the sliding surface is defined by a foliated granular gouge. In the damage zone, the Basal Complex rocks show an <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> cleavage. The sliding amphitheatre has been filled by the debris avalanche or cohesive debris flow generated within the slide, as well as by later debris flows, hyperconcentrated flows, sheet flows, and by interspersed lava flows from the Upper Old Edifice. We suggest here that the collapse of the north-western flank of the Lower Old Edifice at Tazo could in part have been triggered by continuous magma injection, associated with the emplacement of dikes in a rift zone with an ENE-WSW direction, enhanced by the mechanical weakness of the Basal Complex unit, which was affected by hydrothermal metamorphism under greenschist facies conditions and by the displacement along the Montana de Alcala and Guillama normal faults, which are deeply entrenched in the altered rocks of the Basal Comple...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the 2004 - 05 eruption at Etna (Italy) is investigated by means of field surveys, to define the current structural state of the volcano. In 2004 - 05, a fracture swarm, associated with 3 effusive vents, propagated downslope from the SE summit crater towards SE. Such a scenario is commonly observed at Etna, as a pressure increase within the central conduits induces the lateral propagation {{of most of the}} dikes downslope. Nevertheless, some unusual features of this eruption (slower propagation of fractures, lack of explosive activity and seismicity, oblique shear along the fractures) suggest a more complex triggering mechanism. A detailed review of the recent activity at Etna enables us to better define this possible mechanism. In fact the NW-SE trending fractures formed in 2004 - 05 constitute the south-eastern continuation of a N-S trending fracture system which started to develop in early 1998, to the east of the summit craters. The overall 1998 - 2005 deformation pattern forms therefore an arcuate feature, whose geometry and kinematics are consistent with the head of a shallow flank deformation on the E summit of Etna. Similar deformation patterns have also been observed in analogue models of deforming volcanic cones. In this frame, the 2004 - 05 eruption was possibly induced by a dike resulting from the intersection of this <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> system with the SE Crater. A significant acceleration of this flank deformation may be induced by any magmatic involvement. The central conduit of the volcano is presently open, constantly buffering any increase in magmatic pressure and any hazardous consequence can be expected to be limited. A more hazardous scenario may be considered with a partial or total closing of the central conduit. In this case, magmatic overpressure within the central conduit may enhance the collapse of the upper eastern flank, triggering an explosive eruption associated with a landslide reaching the eastern lower slope of the volcano...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{engineering}} materials, such as concrete, composites (nano-composites), and functionally graded materials, contain {{large amount}} of internal interfaces which are either coherent (interfaces separating different components of the material) or incoherent (faces of micro-cracks or micro-voids). This type of material characteristic is also very common in biomaterials, such as bones, tissues etc. These interfaces usually serve as the sites of catastrophic failure in applications. To fully understand the failure modes of these materials and so as to provide useful information to the material manufacturers, carefully designed experiments are needed.

40|$|Magnesium alloys {{are prime}} {{potential}} candidates for lightweight structural applications {{because of their}} superior specific stiffness and strength. However, their effective insertion in transportation vehicles hinges on improving their ductility and developing cost-effective forming technologies. Here, the processes of damage initiation and accumulation to fracture are investigated at ambient temperature, experimentally and theoretically, in two Mg alloys, AZ 31 and WE 43. Material AZ 31 exhibits strong basal texture whereas WE 43 has a weak non-basal texture with quasiisotropic properties. The microstructural characterization is carried out on the initial materials aiming at determining the texture, the grain size/shape distribution {{as well as the}} chemical composition, volume fraction, shape and spatial arrangement of second-phase particles. The macroscopic plastic flow anisotropy is characterized using round tensile bars and compression pins along three principal and three off-axes orientations. Semi-continuous measurement of diameter contraction in two orthogonal directions enabled the monitoring of relative volume change and strain-ratio evolution. The data is used to model the plastic anisotropy of the materials using models from the literature. A significant increase in volume is measured during plastic deformation. Macroscopic fracture loci, along two principal and one off-axis directions, are obtained for each material using round notched bars of varying notch acuity so as to study the effect of stress triaxiality and directionality on flow and fracture. It was found that notched AZ 31 bars exhibit higher failure strain than uniaxial specimens. Second phase particles and deformation twins are identified as critical sites for damage initiation. Experiments also indicate that WE 43 and AZ 31 display significantly different sensitivities to stress triaxiality. Substantial drop in the failure strains of WE 43 with increasing triaxiality is attributed to intergranular fracture. Image analysis is performed on specimens deformed to <b>incipient</b> and complete <b>fracture</b> to infer the distribution properties of voids and particles. A micromechanics-based continuum damage model is used to rationalize the main experimental trends and explore conflicting hypotheses. The model has two components: (i) a shape-dependent void growth; and (ii) a shape-dependent void/crack coalescence part. The results provide the groundwork for understanding the effects of microstructural and loading variables on damage and fracture in magnesium alloys...|$|R
40|$|Voids are {{observed}} to be generated under sufficient loading in many materials, ranging from polymers and metals to biological tissues. The {{presence of these}} voids can have drastic implications at the macroscopic level including strong material softening and more <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture.</b> Developing tools to appropriately account for these effects is therefore very desirable. This thesis is concerned with both, the appearance of voids (nucleation process) and the modeling and simulation of materials {{in the presence of}} voids. A particular nucleation mechanism based on vacancy aggregation in high purity metallic single crystals is analyzed. A multiscale model is developed in order to obtain an approximate value of the time required for vacancies to form sufficiently large clusters for further growth by plastic deformation. It is based on quantum mechanical results, kinetic Monte Carlo methods and continuum mechanics estimates calibrated with quasi-continuum results. The ultimate goal of these simulations is to determine the feasibility of this nucleation mechanism under shock loading conditions, where the temperature and tensions are high and vacancy diffusion is promoted. On the other hand, the effective behavior of materials with pre-existent voids is analyzed within the general framework of continuum mechanics and is therefore applicable to any material. The overall properties of the heterogeneous material are obtained through a two-level characterization: a representative volume element consisting of a hollow sphere is used to describe the "microscopic" fields, and an equivalent homogeneous material is used for the "macroscopic" behavior. A variational formulation of this two-scale model is presented. It provides a consistent definition of the macro-variables under general loading conditions, extending the well-known static averaging results so as to include microdynamic effects under finite deformations. This variational framework also provides a suitable starting point for time discretization and consistent definitions within discrete time. The spatial boundary value problem resulting from this multiscale model is solved with a particular spherical shell element specially developed for this problem. The approximation space is based on spherical harmonics, which respects the symmetries of the porous material and allows the representation of the fields on the sphere with very few degrees of freedom. Numerical tools, such as the exact representation of the boundary conditions and an exact quadrature rule, are also provided. The resulting numerical model is verified extensively, demonstrating good convergence results, and its applicability is shown through several material point calculations and a full two-scale finite element implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of precursory bulge along an <b>incipient</b> <b>fracture</b> zone in a uniaxially compressed Westerly granite sample {{has been investigated}} by two optical methods. The first method is the method of slit diffraction. The cross section of a cylindrical rock sample is monitored by bringing two straightedges next to the rock sample to form two slits (each slit being formed between one straightedge and {{one side of the}} rock sample) and by illuminating alternately the two slits with a collimated laser beam. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is recorded on film in the direction perpendicular to the straightedge and can be interpreted as the absolute value squared of the one-dimensional spatial Fourier transform of the slit under certain conditions, thereby providing a simple method of magnification of the rock surface geometry. The conditions under which the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern can be interpreted as the absolute value squared of a one-dimensional Fourier transform are related to the radius of the rock sample, width of the slit, position of the recording film plane, and nature of deformation of the rock surface and are presented in this paper. The films are digitized by a microdensitometer. The data are analyzed by digital filtering and interpolation techniques to give a strain resolution of 10 ^(− 5). During a test with the slit diffraction method, strain inhomogeneities in terms of local bulges indicative of incipient failure zones were found to develop at ∼ 92 % of the uniaxial compressive strength, and their propagation is traced at 2. 66 -s intervals until failure. Local strains in the incipient failure zones are of the order of 10 ^(− 2) before failure takes place. Because of the large amplitude of the strain inhomogeneity prior to failure recorded by the slit diffraction method, we then tried the faster method of recording without magnification by a motion picture camera. In the second test a precursory bulge {{in the middle of the}} sample first appeared at ∼ 3. 75 s prior to failure at a load of > 99. 7 % of the uniaxial compressive strength. The bulge developed rapidly in successive frames until eventually a failure plane passed through this sharp bulge. The results from both tests demonstrate the formation of a concentrated weak zone as a result of the interaction and coalescence among the microcracks in the final stage of the test, which then develop into fracture zones. The bulging is the result of accentuated deformation in the weak zone because of its reduced deformation moduli. It is considered that the local bulge and orientation of the fracture zones in the first test were controlled by the stress concentration at the sample-load block interface, whereas those in the second test were controlled mainly by the inhomogeneity in the material properties within the sample. The precursor times of both tests do not fit into the empirical relationship between precursor time and fault dimension as derived from earthquakes and mine rock bursts. The precursor times of these tests are too long by 3 orders of magnitude in comparison with those given by the empirical relationship...|$|E
