Purpose – This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the motives, structure and performance attributes of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperations</b> between logistics service providers (LSPs). Based on an analytical classification model, distinctive types of logistics cooperation that characterize the logistics landscape are identified. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical data were collected on <b>horizontal</b> LSP <b>cooperations</b> from managers of German LSPs. Different uni- and multi-variate statistical methods including ANOVA and cluster analysis were applied to the dataset of 226 cooperations {{for a total of}} 6, 081 involved parties. Findings – <b>Horizontal</b> <b>cooperations</b> with other LSPs are an organizational form used by 57 percent of LSPs. Cooperation decisions are substantially driven by external market objectives. Six distinctive types of cooperation are identified. They reveal the dominance of multi-lateral and international networks that are mainly based on contractual agreements. There is a clear preference for partners with similar market competencies and for strong functional integration. Despite its inherent complexity, performance of these cooperations is high – its less than 19 percent failure rate makes these cooperations substantially more stable than cooperations within manufacturing industries. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited to an exploratory, descriptive approach in providing a sound understanding of the cooperation landscape. Practical implications – The findings contribute transparency to <b>horizontal</b> LSP <b>cooperations</b> and a common understanding of their idiosyncrasies. The conclusions help logistics managers to position themselves better within the cooperation landscape. Further, the analyses offer managers a conceptual classification of <b>horizontal</b> LSP <b>cooperations</b> and some guidance on how to structure their individual LSP cooperations more successfully. Originality/value – This paper is the first empirical study that defines the types of cooperation that comprise the logistics cooperation landscape. The analysis integrates a holistic perspective of their contractual, organizational, functional, geographical, service and resource scope and matches them with underlying motives and performance attributes...|$|R
40|$|Group {{purchasing}} cooperation can {{be beneficial}} for all parties involved. The gains are, however, not always fairly distributed amongst the participants. This puts a strain on the relationships within some forms of cooperation. Schotanus and Telgen (2005) have developed a classification model, the highway matrix, which makes a distinction between five forms of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperations.</b> This matrix distinguishes two factors to classify these cooperations, namely: the intensiveness for the members and number of different activities for the initiative. This matrix has been taken, {{because it is the}} most extensive classification tool that covers all possible forms of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperations.</b> This paper extends the highway matrix to incorporate the relationships between the parties involved, by adding a ‘symbiosis dimension’. This new classification tool, the extended highway matrix, assists purchasing cooperations, in the way how they should manage their relationship. More specifically, it provides information about the necessity for an allocation mechanism for gain distribution. It does not, however, provide information about the real distribution of gains. For more information about gain distribution the reader is referred to literature of Heijboer (2003) or Schotanus et al. (2006). This paper shows a re-analysis of 51 previously published case studies of group purchasing, which provides initial support for the new symbiosis dimension in the ‘extended highway matrix’. Based on the analyzed cases it can be concluded that some forms of group purchasing have no need for a special allocation mechanism for gain distribution, whereas others do in order to run the group successfully...|$|R

Purpose – <b>Horizontal</b> <b>cooperations</b> of logistics service providers (LSPs) have becomeimportant for LSPs within the last decades. Owing to the high complexity of these cooperations as observed by Schmoltzi and Wallenburg, the potential for conflict is inherent. This research, therefore, aims to investigate how nature (dysfunctional vs functional) and extent of conflict impact the outcome of these cooperations. Further, the roles of formal and relational governance mechanisms in influencing conflict are analyzed. Design/methodology/approach – The research is empirical in nature and employs a theory-driven, confirmatory approach. It utilizes large-scale survey data of German LSPs, which are analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. Findings – The research shows that governance mechanisms impact the extent and functionality of conflict: relational governance lowers the extent of conflict and leads to higher functionality of conflicts, while formal governance increases the extent of conflict. Moreover, it is shown that conflicts decrease the overall cooperation performance, whereas – when functional in nature – they {{have a positive impact}} on the innovativeness of cooperations. Research limitations/implications – The impact of governance on conflicts and of conflicts on outcome may differ depending on the cultural and country-specific setting. Practical implications – The results allow mangers of LSP cooperations to adapt their set of applied governance mechanisms and conflict resolution approaches with regard to the improvement of cooperation performance and cooperation innovation.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present a formal model of firm {{innovation}} that simultaneously analyzes innovation factors characteristic to the Schumpeterian strand of industrial organization literature and the know-how strand. Corporate R&D intensity serves here as an input measure of firm innovation. R&D intensity can be defined as a ratio of firm’s R&D spending to the firm’s sales (total revenues). On the basis of formal analysis it is found that R&D intensity is fully determined by three complementary factors, i. e. a firm’s technological competence (supply-side factor), consumer preference for quality and price of a product (demand-side factor), as well as a moderator factor associated with the knowledge spillovers, which occur between competing firms in the industry. Since the above factors are expressed in terms of elasticities, the presented model is called an elasticity-based model of firm innovation. Further, within the model framework, it is shown how <b>horizontal</b> R&D <b>cooperation</b> alleviates the free-rider problem that can discourage a firm’s innovation activities. It is next postulated that <b>horizontal</b> R&D <b>cooperation</b> can be effectively treated as a complementary tool (to such traditional solutions as patent protection and public research subsidies) for solving the problem of negative externalities in an industry with pervasive knowledge spillovers...|$|R

40|$|While {{significant}} {{attention is}} given to the concept of absorptive capacity as a source of competitive advantage in firms, a major drawback exists in the way it is unidimensionally defined in micro-level analysis. The paper addresses this limitation and reconceptualizes absorptive capacity as a strategic human resource construct in firms, which in turn, provide important conditions for R&D cooperation and innovation. I begin by providing a "beyond-R&D" definition of absorptive capacity constituting employment practices and incentive-based compensation programs. Next, I exploit the relationship between these practices and heterogeneity in firms 4 R&D cooperation and partner selection strategies distinguishing between different types of external collaboration partners- horizontal, institutional and consulting- based. Further, I examine the impact of such cooperative R&D on incremental product, process and radical innovation. Employing the IAB Establishment Panel Survey on about 1200 German innovation-based establishments during 2007 - 2011, findings demonstrate that adoption of employment practices positively affects R&D cooperation irrespective of the type of collaboration partner, while compensation programs positively affect only <b>horizontal</b> R&D <b>cooperation.</b> Significant differences in the patterns of research collaboration are found between manufacturing and service sector firms, with respect to importance of human resource management, educational structure of the workforce and internal R&D.

Purpose – The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide insights into the role of governance mechanisms in fostering innovativeness in <b>horizontal</b> service <b>cooperations.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 225 <b>horizontal</b> service <b>cooperations</b> in the logistics industry via an online survey. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the empirical data. Findings – The choice of governance measures helps to improve the innovativeness of service cooperations. The use of formalization and balanced mutual influence, combined with cultural similarity provides the basis for the development of new or enhanced services within the cooperation. In contexts that build on equity-based contracts, innovativeness is driven by the degree of mutual influence among partners. Research limitations/implications – Empirical data were collected in a single industry (logistics) and in a single country (Germany). A confirmation of the results in different service settings is therefore encouraged.

The potential and realized benefits of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> in disaster relief logistics, as well as related impediments are investigated. Design/methodology/approach – Case study research into three cooperative humanitarian organization initiatives. Findings – To a large extent, the same potential synergies exist in the humanitarian as in the private sector, but not all of the potential benefits have yet been realized. Humanitarian organizations focus less on cost aspects than on lead-time and quality improvements. It is apparent that smaller organizations can benefit most from a cooperative approach. Four main impediments to a cooperative approach are identified. These concern: the perception of logistics as one of the organization’s own core competences, cultural differences and mutual mistrust, a lack of transparency regarding the potential and existing benefits and inadequate relief capacities.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} competition and R&D cooperation with universities and competitors. Our simple model predicts that more competitors reduce the incentives for <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> as it diminishes the gains from “collusion”. Assuming {{that the value of}} synergies and spillovers created by cooperation depends on competition intensity reveals two distinct and opposing incentives for cooperation. While synergies foster R&D cooperation, spillovers may hinder cooperation. We mainly hypothesize that university cooperation corresponds to product innovation and hence quality competition, while <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> lead to process innovations and therefore relates to price competition. We test these hypotheses based on Swiss firm-level panel data controlling for simultaneity of cooperation decisions and endogeneity of competition. Our empirical analysis supports the relevance of distinguishing between competition dimensions and cooperation partners, respectively. We find that price competition matters for both university and <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> and it takes the form of an inverted U-shape. On the contrary, quality competition only matters for university cooperation and the relationship shows a U-form. Moreover we see that the number of principal competitors is significantly related only to cooperation between competitors and the relationship shows an inverted U-form. Hence, markets with a medium number of competitors are more receptive for <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In sum these findings advance our understanding of the relationship between innovation and competition policy. innovation cooperation, university cooperation, <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation,</b> number of competitors, price competition, quality competition, synergy, knowledge spillover, collusion...|$|E

40|$|The present {{crisis of}} the tourism {{industry}} (in terms of declining destinations) can be considered as a logical consequence of its created core destination strategies which have been established in the period of mass tourism (1960 - 1990), and which lacked both a conceptual and a customer focus. Big socio-demographic shifts, health awareness and changes in consumer behaviour and values have become important determinants and critical factors of success for what might be termed “new tourism”. The transformed tourist demand calls for new innovative products (Poon & Weiermair) such as e. g. “Alpine Wellness”, which is defined as the balance between the three spheres of Body, Spirit and Mind, which the alpine tourism industry is practising as a problem solution. New tourism clusters in the field of sports and health will in consequence constitute the only way to package and offer a complete and holistic range of wellness services.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the adaptive management of regional socio-ecological systems (SESs). <b>Horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> refers to the collaborative, non-hierarchical interactions of actors across sectors, modes of governance and spatial scales. It can allow diverse actors {{to deal with the}} complexity and uncertainties that characterize SESs and to co-produce public benefits. The research question is, When does <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> contribute to adaptive management in complex governance arrangements? The Berg River catchment in South Africa serves as a case study to analyze such complex systems. The empirical focus is on the operational level which is responsible for maintaining key functions of the water resources in the SES. A formal social network analysis is employed to describe and analyze the management of the Berg River catchment. The analysis focuses on (i) cohesion and (ii) heterogeneity, which are two network characteristics that affect learning and collective action in actor networks. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> is further investigated by examining selected collective action initiatives with the help of Ostrom’s eight design principles (1990). Constraints affecting collective action and the capacity to self-organize are identified, and the robustness of the governance arrangements arising from <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> is evaluated. The study finds that the behavior of actors towards each other and the SES is influenced by incentives provided by informal network structures, market mechanisms and bureaucratic hierarchies. Hence, modes of governance intersect at the operational level and consequently influence the nature of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation.</b> While the quality of the management of the SES is largely determined by the patterns of interactions among the actors that manage the SES, these interactions are influenced by other institutional and organizational structures in which they are embedded. Unexpectedly, market mode incentives stimulate collective action in the Berg catchment and accentuate the need for addressing degrading water quality. Informal relations and emerging inter-organizational platforms matter for learning and for providing opportunities for collective action. Yet, the incentives (or lack thereof) created through hierarchical steering of the South African water governance system by the national government department are often counterproductive. That is, so far the self-organizing efforts at sub-catchment level could not be transformed into functioning governance arrangements because of constraints imposed by the hierarchical mode. The study confirms that self-organization and collective action that arise from <b>horizontal</b> <b>cooperation</b> are important for the adaptive management of regional SESs...|$|E

Second, PM needs to be changed over time as the internal context of cooperation changes (e.g., member companies entering or leaving the alliance), but also the external context of cooperation changes. Third, PM has a coordinating function across different functional units and helps to deal with complex and multiple institutional performance logics [53], which are likely to exist, by reducing the tension within and across the performance logics [53].
