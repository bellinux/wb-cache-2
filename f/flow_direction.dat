5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the <b>flow</b> <b>direction.</b> The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{groundwater}} <b>flow</b> {{rates and}} <b>directions</b> in low permeable layered aquifers underlying industrial sites {{can be a}} difficult problem due to limited access, multiple flow zones, and multiple potentiometric surfaces. Within the upper-most aquifer, thin permeable zones of limited aerial extent may exhibit different <b>flow</b> <b>directions.</b> A large number of specifically screened observation wells completed in each permeable zone {{may be necessary to}} yield sufficient data to construct reliable potentiometric maps for assessing contamination migration patterns. The colloidal borescope, developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, offers the potential for measuring groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> and rates at specified locations within the aquifer with a limited number of observation wells. By observing the movement of naturally occurring particles in the well screen, it is possible to measure groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> and velocities at selected depths within the aquifer. The colloidal borescope was used at a large industrial site in Western Kentucky to characterize flow patterns in a clayey-silt aquifer containing numerous sand lenses. Results of the colloidal borescope measurements were compared with existing contaminant plumes and surface hydrologic features to assess the reliability of the measurements. Test results indicate that similar <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> were observed in the same sand lenses and <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> were consistent with expected <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> in areas where surface hydrologic features or industrial features such as wate...|$|R

25|$|The tides' {{influence}} on current flow {{is much more}} difficult to analyse, and data {{is much more difficult}} to collect. A tidal height is a simple number which applies to a wide region simultaneously. A flow has both a magnitude and a direction, both of which can vary substantially with depth and over short distances due to local bathymetry. Also, although a water channel's center is the most useful measuring site, mariners object when current-measuring equipment obstructs waterways. A flow proceeding up a curved channel is the same flow, even though its direction varies continuously along the channel. Surprisingly, flood and ebb flows are often not in opposite directions. <b>Flow</b> <b>direction</b> is determined by the upstream channel's shape, not the downstream channel's shape. Likewise, eddies may form in only one <b>flow</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{shock waves}} in a flow field, {{which are still}} attached to the body, the shock wave which is deviating at some arbitrary angle from the <b>flow</b> <b>direction</b> is termed oblique shock. These shocks require a component vector analysis of the flow; doing so allows {{for the treatment of}} the flow in an orthogonal direction to the oblique shock as a normal shock.|$|E
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the <b>flow</b> <b>direction</b> and {{magnitude}} trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along {{the ebb and}} flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{streamline}} which {{separates the}} final <b>flow</b> <b>direction</b> {{and the wall}} {{is known as a}} slipstream (shown as the dashed line in the figure). Across this line there is a jump in the temperature, density and tangential component of the velocity (normal component being zero). Beyond the slipstream the flow is stagnant (which automatically satisfies the velocity boundary condition at the wall). In case of real flow, a shear layer is observed instead of a slipstream, because of the additional no-slip boundary condition.|$|E
40|$|WinBasin is a GIS-based {{watershed}} analysis {{system that}} can automatically calculate depressionless <b>flow</b> <b>directions,</b> delineate watersheds/sub-watersheds, extract realistic drainage networks, and calculate geomorphological indices and hydrological responses from digital elevation models. Several improved algorithms coupled with GIS techniques were proposed for automated watershed analysis. First, different from depression fill-up treatment methods, the depression watershed method coupled with the improved fuzzy c-mean algorithm allows the depression outlet location and <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> to be determined. Second, by using the GIS-based point-and-click interface coupled with outlet-tracing and headwater-tracing algorithms, watersheds with user-specified outlets and realistic drainage networks can be easily extracted based on the derived <b>flow</b> <b>directions.</b> The analysed results can be exported to vector format for linkage with other GIS software. Third, the geomorphological indices and hydrological responses (width function and geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph) in a watershed can also be instantly derived based on the proposed algorithms and the GIS technique...|$|R
40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of water’s journey from the hillslope to the stream, water level time series from 26 groundwater wells in a hillslope–riparian study area in the Panola Mountain Research Watershed, Georgia, USA, were examined with respect to the occurrence of perched groundwater and groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>directions.</b> A connected groundwater table was taken as an indication of a hydrologic connection between the hillslope and the stream. <b>Flow</b> <b>directions</b> were determined based on observed water levels at different combinations of three neighbouring wells. The analyses indicated that the hillslope was disconnected from the stream most of the time but that almost the entire hillslope became connected to the stream during large rainfall events. This coincided with more sustained streamflow during these events. There were clear differences in the timing of the groundwater response between the upper hillslope, lower hillslope and riparian zone, with water levels near the stream and on the upper hillslope rising earlier than on the midslope. The <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> were generally downslope and were most variable around a bedrock depression on the midslope. On the hillslope, the direction of the water table followed the local bedrock topography when the water level was low at the start and end of an event and the overall surface topography when water levels were high. In the riparian zone, <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> either did not change significantly during events or turned from a more downstream (i. e. downvalley) direction to a more downslope (i. e. towards the stream) direction. These results highlight the competing influence of surface and bedrock topography on hillslope <b>flow</b> <b>directions</b> and improve our understanding of hillslope–riparian-stream connectivity...|$|R

25|$|Surface mining may impair {{groundwater}} {{in numerous}} ways: by drainage of usable water from shallow aquifers; lowering of water levels in adjacent areas {{and changes in}} <b>flow</b> <b>direction</b> within aquifers; contamination of usable aquifers below mining operations due to infiltration (percolation) of poor-quality mine water; and increased infiltration of precipitation on spoil piles. Where coal or carbonaceous shale is present, increased infiltration may result in: increased runoff of poor-quality water and erosion from spoil piles, recharge of poor-quality water to shallow groundwater aquifers and poor-quality water flow to nearby streams.|$|E

In addition to providing information about the orientation of past fluid flow in the host rock, elongate concretions can provide insight into local permeability trends (i.e., permeability correlation structure; Mozley and Davis, 1996), variation in groundwater velocity (Davis, 1999), and the types of geological features that influence flow.|$|E
25|$|Supersonic {{pressure}} recovery is {{addressed by the}} number of shock waves that are generated by the intake, the greater the number the higher the {{pressure recovery}}. Supersonic flow is compressed or slowed by changes in direction. The Concorde intake front ramps changed the <b>flow</b> <b>direction</b> causing oblique external shocks and isentropic compression in the supersonic flow. The TSR-2 had used a half-cone translating centre-body to change the direction. Subsonic pressure recovery is addressed by removal of the boundary layer (at the ramp bleed slot) and suitable shaping of the subsonic diffuser leading to the engine. The high pressure recovery for the Concorde intake at cruise gave an intake pressure ratio of 7.3:1.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of VIM, Voyager 1 was at a {{distance}} of 40 AU from the Earth while Voyager 2 was at 31 AU. VIM is broken down into three distinct phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft {{as a result of this}} interstellar wind/solar wind interaction was the termination shock where the solar wind slows from supersonic to subsonic speed and large changes in plasma <b>flow</b> <b>direction</b> and magnetic field orientation occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrays of}} {{airfoils}} {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid.

Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E

25|$|Swales can be {{incorporated}} in urban designs along streets or parklands {{and add to the}} aesthetic character of an area. Typical swales are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% in order to maintain flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or swale surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along swales or dense vegetation can help to distribute ﬂows evenly across swales and slow velocities. Milder-sloped swales may have issues with water-logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the swale is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design ﬂows and be of sufficient density to provide good ﬁltration).
