5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E
25|$|Although the numbat finds termite mounds {{primarily}} using scent, it has {{the highest}} visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has {{a high proportion of}} cone cells in the retina. These are both likely adaptations for its diurnal habits, and vision <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the primary sense used to detect potential predators. Numbats regularly enter a state of torpor, which may last up to fifteen hours a day during the winter months.|$|E

In an interview with Pitchfork Media, McCartney clarified, [...] "I must say, someone told me , and I think it's a complete mystery, because it's so complete.

500|$|Dynamic Motion (1916) for solo piano, written when Cowell was nineteen, {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "probably the first piece anywhere using secundal chords independently for musical extension and variation." [...] Though that is not quite accurate, it <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first piece to employ chromatic clusters in such a manner. A solo piano piece Cowell wrote the following year, The Tides of Manaunaun (1917), would prove to be his most popular work and the composition most responsible for establishing the tone cluster as a significant element in Western classical music. (Cowell's early piano works are often erroneously dated; in the two cases above, as 1914 and 1912, respectively.) Assumed by some to involve an essentially random—or, more kindly, aleatoric—pianistic approach, Cowell would explain that precision is required in the writing and performance of tone clusters no less than with any other musical feature: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the nailed horseshoe enabled longer, faster journeys on horseback, particularly in the wetter lands in northern Europe, and were useful for campaigns on varied terrains. [...] By providing protection and support, nailed horse shoes also improved the efficiency of draught horse teams. [...] Though the Romans had developed an iron [...] "hipposandal" [...] that resembled a hoof boot, there is much debate over the actual origins of the nailed horseshoe, though it <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of European origin. There is little evidence of nailed-on shoes prior to AD 500 or 600, though there is speculation that the Celtic Gauls {{were the first to}} nail on metal horseshoes. The earliest clear written record of iron horseshoes is a reference to [...] "crescent figured irons and their nails" [...] in a list of cavalry equipment from AD 910. Additional archaeological evidence suggests they were used in Siberia during the 9th and 10th centuries, and had spread to Byzantium soon afterward; by the 11th century, horseshoes were commonly used in Europe. By the time the Crusades began in 1096, horseshoes were widespread and frequently mentioned in various written sources.|$|E

500|$|In {{the script}} for the pilot, [...] "Mr. Monk and the Candidate", Monk is {{described}} as being [...] "a modern day Sherlock Holmes", only [...] "nuts". In the introductory scene of the episode, he is examining the scene of Nicole Vasques' murder, and picks up several important clues, but frequently interrupts himself to wonder aloud whether he left his stove on {{when he left the}} house that morning. In the season 6 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Daredevil", Monk mentions that he has 312 phobias. The strongest of these phobias are: germs, dentists, sharp or pointed objects, milk, vomiting, death and dead things, snakes, crowds, heights, fear, mushrooms, and small spaces, as Monk also mentions in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Very Very Old Man". In addition, new phobias develop at seemingly random intervals, such as a temporary fear of blankets {{at the end of the}} season 5 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink". Though it is impossible to determine his strongest phobia, there <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some form of hierarchy between them: in the series finale [...] "Mr. Monk and the End", it is made clear that his fear of vomiting is greater than his fear of death. He has also stated, [...] "Snakes trump heights!".|$|E

2500|$|Glassheart {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It received {{praise for the}} decisions to experiment with dubstep, bubblegum pop and electronic music {{on some of the}} tracks and criticism towards the ballads, with critics divided over the number on one album and their quality versus the more up-tempo songs. Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the Financial Times said that the delays in releasing Glassheart worked in Lewis' favour, by forcing her to [...] "confront her lack of [...] direction." [...] Hunter-Tilney praised both the Mariah Carey-styled vocals and use of [...] "echoing snare drums" [...] in many of the songs. He concluded by saying that Glassheart [...] "strays out of her comfort zone," [...] perhaps due to fellow British singer-songwriter Adele's [...] "preponderance over break-up" [...] songs. The Daily Mirrors Dean Piper also noted similarities to Adele, commenting that although both Lewis and Adele had worked with Smith, Lewis' album would [...] "not translate to a universal audience" [...] like Adele's 21 had. However Piper did call the comparison unfair because Glassheart [...] "reminds you what an extraordinary talent Leona is," [...] he also said [...] "there's no doubting the music is good and Glassheart <b>does</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> her most personal album to date." [...] Amongst the songs Piper picked out were [...] "Un Love Me", [...] "Favourite Scar" [...] and [...] "Fingerprint". Another positive review came from Digital Spy's Lewis Corner who said that Lewis surprised on [...] "the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that standout". Commending her falsetto, Corner awarded Lewis five out of five stars and ended by saying [...] "Like many artists before her, Leona has channelled the darker side of love's grasp into her work – and the result is nothing short of spectacular." ...|$|E
