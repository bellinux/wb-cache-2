5|$|There are 28 {{species and}} {{subspecies}} of threatened <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> in Michigan. Of these, 9 are species of special concern, 6 {{are listed as}} threatened and 13 are endangered. Six are also federally listed as endangered.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E

5|$|The list of {{threatened}} fauna of Michigan includes almost 400 endangered, threatened and special concern {{species that are}} located in Michigan {{as a part of}} the fauna of the United States. Endangered and threatened species in Michigan are protected through the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan, part of the 1994 Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. The list was last updated in 2009 to its sixth iteration. At this time, 69 new species were added, including many species of <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> and snails, and 13 species were removed. The state also recognizes species of special concern, which are not protected under the Act. These species have low or declining numbers in the state or a need for additional information on their populations in Michigan. If the species' numbers decline, they are moved to threatened or endangered status and afforded protection under the Act; if they increase, they are removed from the list without further action.|$|E
25|$|A {{population}} of American eels was released into Little Buffalo Creek in 2013.

40|$|A common bivalve: <b>Freshwater</b> <b>mussel,</b> Aspatharia sinuate was {{evaluated}} as a dietary protein supplement {{in the production}} diet for Heterobranchus longifilis fingerlings with mean body weight 8. 34 plus or minus 10 g reared in aquaria tanks. Four diets containing fishmeal protein {{at a rate of}} 25 %, 50 % and 75 % along with the <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> flesh were formulated. The diet without the <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> served as the control. The fish fingerlings were fed at 5 % body weight per day for 56 days. It was revealed {{at the end of the}} experiment that <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> was most suitable as a protein supplement when incorporated at 25 % replacement. The body weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ration values of 6. 83 g, 1. 06 % day and 0. 62 respectively were highest in diet with 25 % replacement closely followed by diet with 50 % replacement. Beyond 75 % inclusion level there was no significant growth (P> 0. 05). However, complete replacement of fishmeal by <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> decreases growth rates and should not be used in Heterobranchus longifilis diet...|$|R

25|$|Both {{marine and}} <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> are gonochoristic, with {{separate}} {{male and female}} individuals. In marine mussels, fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, {{it is capable of}} moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, areas home to {{the most}} diverse {{freshwater}} mussel fauna in the world, there are 297 known freshwater mussel taxa. Of the 297 known species, 213 (71.7%) taxa are listed as endangered, threatened, of special concern. The main factors contributing to the decline of <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> include destruction from dams, increased siltation, channel modification, {{and the introduction of}} invasive species like the Zebra mussel.|$|E
25|$|Both {{marine and}} <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels</b> are filter feeders; they feed on {{plankton}} and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its incurrent siphon. The water is then {{brought into the}} branchial chamber {{by the actions of}} the cilia located on the gills for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.|$|E

25|$|Like most bivalves, mussels {{have a large}} organ {{called a}} foot. In <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussels,</b> the foot is large, muscular, and {{generally}} hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling {{the rest of the}} animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.|$|E
