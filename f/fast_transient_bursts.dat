40|$|The MC 33761 is an Low DropOut (LDO) {{regulator}} featuring excellent noise performances. Thanks to its innovative design, {{the circuit}} reaches an impressive 40 �VRMS noise level without an external bypass capacitor. Housed {{in a small}} SOT− 23 5 leads−like package, it represents the ideal designer’s choice when space and noise are at premium. The absence of external bandgap capacitor accelerates the response time to a wake−up signal and keeps it within 40 �s (in repetitive mode), making the MC 33761 as a natural candidate for portable applications. The MC 33761 also hosts a novel architecture which prevents excessive undershoots {{in the presence of}} <b>fast</b> <b>transient</b> <b>bursts,</b> as in any bursting systems. Finally, with a static line regulation better than − 75 dB, it naturally shields the downstream electronics against choppy lines...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{results from the}} V-FASTR experiment, a {{commensal}} search for <b>fast</b> <b>transient</b> radio <b>bursts</b> using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). V-FASTR is unique in that the widely spaced VLBA antennas provide a discriminant against non-astronomical signals and a mechanism for the localization and identification of events that is not possible with single dishes or short baseline interferometers. Thus far V-FASTR has accumulated over 1300 hours of observation time with the VLBA, between 90 cm and 3 mm wavelength (327 MHz - 86 GHz), providing the first limits on <b>fast</b> <b>transient</b> event rates at high radio frequencies (> 1. 4 GHz). V-FASTR has blindly detected bright individual pulses from seven known pulsars but has not detected any single-pulse events that would indicate high redshift impulsive bursts of radio emission. At 1. 4 GHz, V-FASTR puts limits on <b>fast</b> <b>transient</b> event rates comparable with the PALFA survey at the Arecibo telescope, but generally at lower sensitivities, and comparable to the "fly's eye" survey at the Allen Telescope Array, but with less sky coverage.

The APM control can always maintain the system phase margin at an adequate value under dif-ferent load conditions. That is, the compensation pole-zero pair {{is adapted to}} load current to extend the system bandwidth and get an adequate phase margin.
