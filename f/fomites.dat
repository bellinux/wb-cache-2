5|$|UCSF {{professor}} Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) violates {{orders from}} Cheever (relayed through Hextall) to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough {{to work on}} a vaccine. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by <b>fomites,</b> with a basic reproduction number of four when the virus mutates, with projections of one in twelve of the population being infected, and a 25-30% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (<b>fomites)</b> such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} fraying social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fiancé {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (<b>fomites)</b> to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or <b>fomites</b> (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can {{be picked up by}} people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|Cryptosporidiosis, {{also known}} as crypto, is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Cryptosporidium, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunocompromised individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that {{it can also be}} transmitted via <b>fomites</b> in respiratory secretions.|$|E
25|$|FVR is {{transmitted}} through direct contact only. It replicates in the nasal and nasopharyngeal tissues and the tonsils. Viremia (the {{presence of the}} virus in the blood) is rare. The virus is shed in saliva and eye and nasal secretions, and can also be spread by <b>fomites.</b> FVR has a two- to five-day incubation period. The virus is shed for one to three weeks postinfection. Latently infected cats (carriers) will shed FHV-1 intermittently for life, with the virus persisting within the trigeminal ganglion. Stress and use of corticosteroids precipitate shedding. Most disinfectants, antiseptics and detergents are effective against the virus.|$|E
25|$|In May 1900, Major Reed {{returned}} to Cuba {{when he was}} appointed head of the Army board charged by Surgeon General George Miller Sternberg to examine tropical diseases, including yellow fever. Sternberg {{was one of the}} founders of bacteriology during this time of great advances in medicine due to widespread acceptance of Louis Pasteur's germ theory of disease, as well as the methods of studying bacteria developed by Robert Koch. During Reed's tenure with the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba, the board both confirmed the transmission by mosquitoes and disproved the common belief that yellow fever could be transmitted by clothing and bedding soiled by the body fluids and excrement of yellow fever sufferers– articles known as <b>fomites.</b> The board conducted many of its dramatic series of experiments at Camp Lazear, named in November 1900 for Reed's assistant and friend Jesse William Lazear, who had died two months earlier of yellow fever while on this assignment.|$|E
500|$|Contagion is a 2011 U.S. medical thriller-disaster film {{directed}} by Steven Soderbergh. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, and Jennifer Ehle. The plot of Contagion documents {{the spread of}} a virus transmitted by <b>fomites,</b> attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a pandemic, and finally {{the introduction of a}} vaccine to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the multi-narrative [...] "hyperlink cinema" [...] style, popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.|$|E
500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and <b>fomites,</b> as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.|$|E
2500|$|FCV {{replicates}} in {{the oral}} and respiratory tissues, and is secreted in saliva, feces, urine, and respiratory secretions. It can be transmitted through the air, orally, and on <b>fomites.</b> [...] Infected cats usually shed the virus for two weeks. [...] Following this period, infected cats never shed the virus again or become latently infected and shed the virus continuously or intermittently. [...] Co-infection with either feline herpesvirus or feline immunodeficiency virus causes a more severe disease.|$|E
2500|$|An {{infectious}} disease agent {{can be transmitted}} in two ways: as [...] disease agent transmission from one individual to another in the same generation (peers in the same age group). [...] by either direct contact (licking, touching, biting), or indirect contact air – cough or sneeze (vectors or <b>fomites</b> that allow the transmission of the agent causing the disease without physical contact). by Katharine M. Kurkjian & Susan E. Little of The University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, date? ...|$|E
2500|$|The FMD virus can be {{transmitted}} {{in a number of}} ways, including close-contact animal-to-animal spread, long-distance aerosol spread and <b>fomites,</b> or inanimate objects, typically fodder and motor vehicles. [...] The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus, as well. [...] Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls. [...] Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Even after a {{successful}} recovery from an Ebola infection, semen may contain the virus {{for at least}} two months. Breast milk may contain the virus for two weeks after recovery, and transmission of the disease to a consumer of the breast milk may be possible. By October 2014 it was suspected that handling a piece of contaminated paper may be enough to contract the disease. Contamination on paper makes it harder to keep records in Ebola clinics, as data about patients written on paper that gets written down in a [...] "hot" [...] zone is hard to pass to a [...] "safe" [...] zone, because if there is any contamination it may bring Ebola into that area. (see also <b>Fomites)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Dogs become {{infected}} through oral contact with CPV2 in feces, infected soil, or <b>fomites</b> that carry the virus. Following ingestion, the virus replicates in the lymphoid {{tissue in the}} throat, and then spreads to the bloodstream. From there, the virus attacks rapidly dividing cells, notably those in the lymph nodes, intestinal crypts, and the bone marrow. There is depletion of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and necrosis and destruction of the intestinal crypts. Anaerobic bacteria that normally reside in the intestines can then cross into the bloodstream, {{a process known as}} translocation, with [...] bacteremia leading to sepsis. The most common bacteria involved in severe cases are Clostridium, Campylobacter and Salmonella species. This can lead to a syndrome known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS leads to a range of complications such as hypercoagulability of the blood, endotoxaemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial myocarditis has also been reported secondarily to sepsis. Dogs with CPV are at risk of intussusception, a condition where part of the intestine prolapses into another part. Three to four days following infection, the virus is shed in the feces for up to three weeks, and the dog may remain an asymptomatic carrier and shed the virus periodically. The virus is usually more deadly if the host is concurrently infested with worms or other intestinal parasites.|$|E
5000|$|English {{usage of}} fomes, {{pronounced}} , is documented since 1658. The English word fomite, {{which has been}} in use since 1859, is a back-formation from the plural <b>fomites</b> (originally borrowed from the Latin plural <b>fōmĭtēs</b> [...] of fōmĕs [...] ). The English-language pronunciation of <b>fomites</b> is , while the singular, fomite, is pronounced [...]|$|E
50|$|HCoV-229E transmits via droplet-respiration and <b>fomites.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Fomites</b> play a {{conspicuous}} role in Steven Soderbergh's 2011 film Contagion about a pandemic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fomites</b> are {{associated}} particularly with hospital-acquired infections (HAI), {{as they are}} possible routes to pass pathogens between patients. Stethoscopes and neckties are two such <b>fomites</b> associated with health care providers. Basic hospital equipment, such as IV drip tubes, catheters, and life support equipment, can also be carriers, when the pathogens form biofilms on the surfaces. Careful sterilization of such objects prevents cross-infection.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two modes}} of transmission: via {{aerosols}} of respiratory droplets and from <b>fomites</b> (contaminated surfaces), including direct person-to-person contact.|$|E
50|$|The {{virus is}} {{transmitted}} {{directly and indirectly}} by <b>fomites</b> and birds {{and can be found}} throughout the body, including neurons and most soft tissues.|$|E
50|$|The {{virus is}} shed in the faeces and thus {{transmission}} is horizontal, via the direct faecal-oral route and also indirectly via <b>fomites.</b> Vertical transmission is also possible.|$|E
50|$|GaHV-1 is shed in {{respiratory}} secretions and {{transmitted by}} droplet inhalation or via <b>fomites.</b> A previously unexposed flock will develop cases {{for two to}} eight weeks following introduction. The incubation period is two to eight days.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of transmission {{has been linked}} to close contact, especially in nosocomial infections. Chronic care facilities and doctors' surgeries are also known to be transmission 'hotspots' with transmission occurring via aerosols, large droplets and also <b>fomites</b> (contaminated surfaces).|$|E
50|$|Turkey coronaviruses {{are members}} of the family Coronaviridae that infect turkeys, {{especially}} poults, leading to gastrointestinal disease. Viruses include turkey enteritis virus and bluecomb disease virus. Transmission is horizontal via the faeces, and can be direct or indirectly spread by <b>fomites.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shared boots, wraps, {{grooming}} supplies, and horse-handler's hands can all {{serve as}} <b>fomites,</b> carrying the causative organism(s) from one individual to another. For this reason, mud fever {{should be considered}} a contagious disease, and general hygiene steps should be taken to limit cross-contamination.|$|E
50|$|Scarlet fever {{is usually}} spread by the aerosol route (inhalation), {{but may also}} be spread by skin contact or by <b>fomites.</b> Although it is not {{normally}} considered a food-borne illness, an outbreak of scarlet fever due to infected chicken meat {{has been reported in}} China.|$|E
5000|$|One {{leading cause}} of {{preventable}} blindness is trachoma. The bacterial infection is transmitted through contact with eye-seeking flies, fingers, and <b>fomites.</b> Prevention components are facial cleanliness which requires water for face washing and environmental improvement which includes safe disposal of excreta to reduce fly populations.|$|E
50|$|M. gallisepticum can be {{transmitted}} within some poultry eggs, which can come from infected breeders to progeny. Also, M. gallisepticum can be infected via infectious aerosols and through contamination of feed, water, and environment as well as human activity on <b>fomites</b> which can come from equipment and shoes. When birds are stressed transmission can occur more rapidly through aerosols and respiratory which spread through the flock. When {{they are in a}} flock, transmission occurs by direct and indirect contact from the movement of the birds, people and <b>fomites</b> from infected species. With many outbreaks, the source of the infection in the flock is unknown. Some sources that could possibly cause infection and transmission are cold weather, poor air quality, concurrent infections, and some live virus vaccinations.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstay}} of eradication is {{the identification and}} removal of persistently infected animals. Re-infection is then prevented by vaccination {{and high levels of}} biosecurity, supported by continuing surveillance. PIs act as viral reservoirs and are the principal source of viral infection but transiently infected animals and contaminated <b>fomites</b> also {{play a significant role in}} transmission.|$|E
50|$|Transmission of RHD occurs {{by direct}} contact with an {{infected}} animal and <b>fomites.</b> Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or conjunctival pathways. Urine, faeces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious {{for up to a}} month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. <b>Fomites</b> such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.|$|E
50|$|Purpura hemorrhagica may be {{prevented}} by proper management during {{an outbreak of}} strangles. This includes isolation of infected horses, disinfection of <b>fomites,</b> and good hygiene by caretakers. Affected horses should be isolated at least one month following infection. Exposed horses should have their temperature taken daily and should be quarantined if it becomes elevated. Prophylactic antimicrobial treatment is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|Shigella can be {{transmitted}} through food, including salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and meat. Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route. Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers {{are the most common}} causes of contamination. Apart from hand-to-mouth infection, shigellosis is transmitted through <b>fomites,</b> water and mechanical vectors like houseflies.|$|E
5000|$|Most trypanosomes {{develop in}} tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), in its {{biological}} vector, about {{one to a}} few weeks. When an infected tsetse fly bites an animal, the parasites are transmitted through its saliva. It can also be spread by <b>fomites</b> such as surgical instruments, needles, syringes. The most important vectors {{are thought to be}} horseflies (Tabanidae) and stable flies (Stomoxys spp.).|$|E
5000|$|Like all hantaviruses, {{transmission}} {{to humans}} is primarily through aerosolized rodent excreta and hand-to-mouth contamination from <b>fomites.</b> No human-to-human transmission has been documented. Longquan City, Zhejiang province, China, has a persistently {{high rate of}} human infection with GOUV. There is speculation that a variant strain of GOUV is transmissible from human-to-human. However, this {{has not yet been}} confirmed with epidemiological trace-back analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Variola minor is of {{the genus}} orthopoxvirus, which are DNA viruses that {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm of the affected cell, rather than in its nucleus. Like variola major, alastrim was spread through inhalation of the virus in the air, which could occur through face-to-face contact or through <b>fomites.</b> Infection with variola minor conferred immunity against the more dangerous variola major.|$|E
50|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 4 is {{a member}} of the Herpesviridae family. It is part of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and genus Rhadinovirus.Infection is normally sub-clinical but can cause reproductive disease in cattle such as endometritis, vulvovaginitis and mastitis. Transmission is both vertical and horizontal. It can also be indirectly spread by <b>fomites.</b> Distribution is worldwide and the virus infects a range of ruminants, including bison, buffalo, sheep and goats.|$|E
