40|$|Coffee {{roasting}} is {{a highly}} energy intensive process {{with much of the}} energy being lost in intermittent cycles as discharged heat from the stack. In this work, combined heat and power (CHP) systems based on micro gas-turbines (MGT) are investigated for providing heat to the roasting process. Much of the heat released in a coffee roaster is from the afterburner that heats up the flue gases to high temperatures in order to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants. An interesting solution for utilizing waste heat is assessed through energy and material balances of a rotating drum coffee roasting with partial hot gas recycling. A cost assessment methodology is adopted to compare the profitability of three proposed system configurations integrated into the process. The case study of a major coffee torrefaction plant with 500 kg/h production capacity is assumed to carry out the thermo-economic assessment, under the Italian energy framework. The CHP options under investigation are: (i) regenerative topping MGT coupled to the existing modulating gas burner to generate hot air for the roasting process; (ii) intermittent waste-heat recovery from the hot <b>flue-gases</b> through an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine coupled to a thermal storage buffer; and (iii) non-regenerative topping MGT with direct recovery of turbine outlet air for the roasting process by means of an afterburner that modulates the heat demand of the roasting process. The results show that the profitability of these investments is highly influenced by the natural gas/electricity cost ratio, by the coffee torrefaction production capacity and by the intermittency level of discharged heat. The MGT appears as a more profitable option than waste-heat recovery via the ORC engine due to the intermittency of the heat source and the relatively high electricity/heat cost ratio...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The Pacific Northwest is a {{particularly}} good candidate for a power plant fired with wood since the wood products industry is so important in the area. The combined cycle concept for such a plant has increased in popularity due to the generally greater efficiency of the gas turbine part of the cycle. An optional addition to a power plant of this type is a dryer utilizing hot <b>flue-gases</b> to dry the fuel so that less energy would be lost up the stack. The focus of this thesis is an analysis of this dryer option {{and its effect on}} the requirements for the combustor and on the overall plant performance. A base case power plant design was provided by Biomass Energy Corporation for study here at Oregon State University. The components in the cycle were modeled on a computer and linked together with an executive program to simulate the entire plant performance. Among the computer models are programs for the combustor and dryer performance. These programs simulate the component performance through an energy balance and are not intended to represent one specific size or type of that component. The basecase design incorporates a rotary drum dryer, wood pulverizers, and a suspension burner which requires strict fuel specifications in size and moisture content. Computer simulations were run to determine the effect of varying the air-fuel ratio and the wood moisture content entering and leaving the dryer. Of particular significance were the results of simulating the plant performance with various amounts of drying. Conflicting conclusions exist in the literature about using a dryer in a wood fired power plant. The results of this analysis however, show that the optimum performance of this power plant occurs when only a moderate amount of drying is done. Performance tends to increase with increasing fuel moisture into the combustor (less drying), however when no drying is done, performance drops, and when only a very small amount of drying is done, problems may occur in the boiler. Also, as expected, performance increases with decreasing fuel moisture as it arrives at the plant location. The effect of increasing the air-fuel ratio into the system while holding the airflow constant is that of increased plant efficiency and decreased power output. If the choice is made to dry the fuel only a moderate amount, then a different type of combustor from the suspension type must be used. Grate type burners will accept fuel of up to 60...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{of fixed}} fuel beds in grate {{furnaces}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques within production of heat and power from solid fuels. The grate furnace used to be a working horse for combustion of hard coal, while today the incitement of using renewable fuel sources has turned biomass and municipal waste into dominating fuel types. These fuels are more conveniently managed by the robust grate furnace than by, for example, fluidised bed or suspension boilers. However, the introduction of the, in many cases, complicated and heterogeneous biomass and waste fuels have, while at the same time subjected to increasingly stringent demands on efficiency and emission of harmful substances, given rise to diffuse challenges to the operation and design of grate furnaces. The influence of the heterogeneous fuels and the low air flow rate required for low nitric oxide emissions are, to a large extent, unclear. The outcome is that different furnaces not only rely on diverging strategies of design and operation – they also show a variety of disturbance characteristics. To make way for more efficient use of modern biomass fuels in grate furnaces, by improving the understanding of the combustion situation and disturbance characteristics, the following steps were made in this study: (1) a set of grate furnaces were investigated separating hands-on problems from underlying research oriented questions, (2) three methods for detecting and measuring disturbances in grate furnaces were developed, and (3) the fundamentals behind disturbances in the part of a fuel bed of grate furnace dominated by char conversion were addressed by mathematical modelling. The outcome of the inventory of furnaces is that fuel-bed channelling and grate material deterioration are common – the first causing increased emissions of unburned carbon compounds and nitric oxides, while the latter giving rise to high material costs and operation failures. In some furnaces, the disturbances could be detected by logical reasoning and visual observations while abated by hands-on adjustments to the fuel handling, operation conditions or grate design. The continued study adds two instruments to further improve this category: (1) a method of video recording inside furnaces to detect, quantify and fend off disturbing channelling, and (2) a new method of on-line monitoring of the fuel moisture content to detect disturbing changes in fuel moisture content during operation. Furthermore, a third developed method of analysing the residence time field of the gas flow in a furnace by mathematical modelling provides an opportunity to optimise the furnace chamber for both steady conditions and transient disturbances. The inventory of furnaces also identified some fundamental question marks concerning the conversion of the fuel bed – how channels in the fuel bed arise and how these disturbances may be avoided, also during low combustion air flow, without causing grate-material deterioration. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of two-dimensional conversion of a fixed char bed was developed and used for investigating these matters, in which it was confirmed that a provoked change of bed porosity may cause process disturbing channelling. An obvious solution to avoid bed-channelling is, therefore, to create an as homogeneous fuel bed as possible. However, the structure of the fuel bed may only to a certain extent be affected; the low cost of the inferior quality fuel is, to a large extent, attributable to the fact that it is heterogeneous and, furthermore, advanced fuel pre-treatments drastically reduce the economical outcome. Thus, the most powerful parameter to avoid disturbances in a heterogeneous fuel bed is to manipulate the distribution of air by means of grate design. Here, a considerable flow resistance across the grate – an effect which may be achieved by reducing the amount and/or size of the air holes in the grate rods – was found to dampen channelling. The CFD modelling, however, indicates that the placing or shaping of these holes, under certain circumstances during the char conversion, may cause thermal and/or carburizing material deterioration – one of the most common disturbances in the inventory of furnaces. Consequently, recommendations for placing of holes along the lower part of a combustion grate, counter-acting the risk of grate material deterioration, could be given from the modelling outcome. These recommendations, which also include recirculation of <b>flue-gases</b> into the combustion air, may in a straight forward manner be applied to the design of future grate furnaces to improve the combustion of heterogeneous fuel beds...|$|R

25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use <b>flue-gas</b> desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E
40|$|For the {{reported}} series of tests, the largest reductions in NOx emissions were achieved (together with maximum combustion efficiencies) {{by using a}} primary-to-secondary-air ratio of for the fluidised bed (FB). Under such an operating condition, high freeboard-temperatures could be attained, e. g. up to 200 Â° C above that of the bed, so promoting the combustion of unburnt carbon-fines in the freeboard zone, i. e. secondary combustion ensued. This tended to counteract {{the effect of the}} reduced rate of carbon combustion in the bed, i. e. {{as a result of the}} increased rate of oxidation occurring in the freeboard. Reductions in both the NOx and SO 2 emissions could be achieved by using such a two-stage combustion process, without affecting adversely the overall combustion efficiency. If a primary-to-secondary-air ratio of (rather than) was employed, the rate of SO 2 emissions fell, but the temperature uplift in the freeboard zone was less pronounced and a reduction in combustion efficiency of 2 % was observed. The rates of emissions of NOx and SO 2 could also be reduced by the adoption of wise choices for the design and operation procedure of the fluidised-bed combustor (FBC). For example, a 45 % decrease in the rate of NOx emissions was achieved in one test merely by halving the bed's depth. The lower the available oxygen-concentration (including that provided by recycled <b>flue-gases)</b> within the bed, the smaller was this decrease. On the other hand, a doubling of the bed's depth led to a reduction in the SO 2 emission of approximately 4 %, provided that the in-bed oxygen concentration was maintained sufficiently high, so as to promote sulphation of the ash and any limestone present in the bed. The location of the secondary-air nozzle (i. e. in the freeboard zone) also had significant influences on the emission rates of the NOx and SO 2. A 13 % reduction in the rate of NOx emissions was achieved by increasing the height (above the sparge pipes) of the secondary-air's nozzle from 1 Â· 5 to 2 Â· 6 m. The larger this height, the greater the opportunity for char-NOx-reducing reactions (for which high-temperature conditions are preferred within the freeboard) to ensue, prior to the secondary-air injection. However, the rates of SO 2 emission fell by ~ 10 % when the height of the secondary-air's nozzle was reduced from 2 Â· 6 to 1 Â· 5 m above the sparge pipes. This was due presumably to the increased residence times of the ash and limestone sorbents (for facilitating sulphation) in the freeboard, under the oxidising condition (following secondary-air injection), which favours the complete sulphation of the sulphidated ash/lime to CaSO 4. In the presently reported series of tests, the rate of NOx emissions could be reduced by up to 83 % merely by adjusting the bed's depth and the secondary-air's nozzle-height, although these alterations led simultaneously to a 14 % increase in the rate of SO 2 emissions, and vice versa. Thus, the emissions of NOx and SOx could be controlled by the use of an appropriate design of FBC. The choice made, in practice, usually depends on which of these emission rates is critical with respect to complying with the environmental-pollution directives. Great care must be taken when comparing emission rates from the FBs, either of different sizes or incorporating alternative methods of air distribution, in order to take account of scaling effects. It is unwise, for instance, to use observations from a laboratory-size FBC to predict the quantitative behaviour of an industrial-size (i. e. large) FBC unit. This arises because of the variations in the oxygen concentration, resulting from the usually non-homogeneous, relatively less effective fluidisation achieved in the large bed; the rates of NOx emissions from the large FBC tend to be smaller (as a result of the existence of pockets of relatively low concentration oxygen in the bed) and simultaneously the rates of SO 2 emission are invariably higher. In the presently reported tests, under otherwise nominally similar conditions, an approximate halving of the rate of NOx emissions resulted when using the larger FBC (rather than the small one) together with a doubling of the SO 2 -emission rates, even though the average percentages of oxygen present in the flue gases remained identical for both the small and large FBC units. The recommended bed-depth depends upon what emission one seeks to reduce. However, where feasible, for an industrial-size combustor, it is wise to employ a shallow bed (~ 340 mm depth, when static) in order to incur relatively low operating costs. ...|$|R
