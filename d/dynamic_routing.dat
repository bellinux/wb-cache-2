50|$|Static routing {{is a form}} of routing {{that occurs}} when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than {{information}} from a <b>dynamic</b> <b>routing</b> traffic. In many cases, static routes are manually configured by a network administrator by adding in entries into a routing table, though this may not always be the case. Unlike <b>dynamic</b> <b>routing,</b> static routes are fixed and do not change if the network is changed or reconfigured. Static routing and <b>dynamic</b> <b>routing</b> are not mutually exclusive. Both <b>dynamic</b> <b>routing</b> and static routing are usually used on a router to maximise routing efficiency and to provide backups in the event that <b>dynamic</b> <b>routing</b> information fails to be exchanged. Static routing can also be used in stub networks, or to provide a gateway of last resort.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 58 - 62). Mobile ad-hoc {{networks are}} becoming more popular {{as the use of}} mobile computers is increasing. The biggest challenge faced in such networks is continuous and random change in the topology. Table driven routing protocols where not designed for such networks. For this reason new routing protocols that can handle continuous change of topology where created. Two existing popular protocols for ad hoc mobile networks are <b>Dynamic</b> Source <b>Routing</b> (DSR), and Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV). DSR has the advantage of making heavy use of routing information to reduce the routing load, where as AODV has the advantage of using sequence numbers, which guarantees that at all time we are using non stale routing entries. In this thesis we present the implementation of Sequence Driven <b>Dynamic</b> Source <b>Routing</b> (SDDSR). SDDSR is an on-demand routing protocol, which builds upon two existing on-demand routing protocols: DSR and AODV. We use the NS- 2 simulator to show the experimental results of the new protocol. The results showed better packet delivery as well as less routing load.

40|$|In this paper, the <b>Dynamic</b> Traffic <b>Routing</b> {{problem is}} defined as the {{real-time}} point diversion of traffic during non-recurrent congestion. This <b>dynamic</b> traffic <b>routing</b> problem is then formulated as a feedback control problem that determines the time-dependent split parameters at the diversion point for routing the incoming traffic flow onto the alternate routes in order to achieve a user-equilibrium traffic pattern. Feedback linearization technique is used to solve this specific user-equilibrium formulation of the <b>Dynamic</b> Traffic <b>Routing</b> problem. The control input is the traffic split factor at the diversion point. By transforming the dynamics of the system into canonical form, a control law is obtained which cancels the nonlinearities of the system.
