5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a <b>Fourier</b> transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical <b>Fourier</b> transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A <b>Fourier</b> transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fourier</b> {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, <b>Fourier</b> first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the <b>Fourier</b> series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the <b>Fourier</b> series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete <b>Fourier</b> transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E
5|$|The fast <b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} is an algorithm for rapidly computing the discrete <b>Fourier</b> transform. It is used {{not only}} for calculating the <b>Fourier</b> coefficients but, using the convolution theorem, also for computing the convolution of two finite sequences. They in turn are applied in digital filters and as a rapid multiplication algorithm for polynomials and large integers (Schönhage-Strassen algorithm).|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} <b>Fourier</b> transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, {{it is necessary that}} these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) in order to ensure the existence of the <b>Fourier</b> integral. For example, the <b>Fourier</b> transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} <b>Fourier</b> transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph <b>Fourier,</b> who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, <b>Fourier</b> had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication {{of the results of the}} expedition in the monumental series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that <b>Fourier</b> invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, <b>Fourier</b> did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Michelson interferometers {{are used}} in tunable narrow band optical filters and as the core {{hardware}} component of <b>Fourier</b> transform spectrometers.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} {{displayed}} formulas are usually {{referred to as}} the Plancherel formula and the <b>Fourier</b> inversion formula respectively.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's work, {{as well as}} {{experimental}} results obtained by Jean Perrin, later inspired Norbert Wiener in the 1920s to use a type of measure theory, developed by Percy Daniell, and <b>Fourier</b> analysis to prove {{the existence of the}} Wiener process as a mathematical object.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of <b>Fourier</b> series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical <b>Fourier</b> transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E
25|$|Actually, {{fractional}} <b>Fourier</b> transform is {{a rotation}} operation {{on the time}} frequency distribution. From the definition above, for α=0, {{there will be no}} change after applying fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform, and for α=π/2, fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform becomes a <b>Fourier</b> transform, which rotates the time frequency distribution withπ/2. For other value ofα, fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform rotates the time frequency distribution according to α. The following figure shows the results of the fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform with different values ofα.|$|E
25|$|One {{motivation}} for the <b>Fourier</b> transform comes {{from the study of}} <b>Fourier</b> series. In the study of <b>Fourier</b> series, complicated but periodic functions are written as the sum of simple waves mathematically represented by sines and cosines. The <b>Fourier</b> transform is an extension of the <b>Fourier</b> series that results when the period of the represented function is lengthened and allowed to approach infinity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fourier</b> {{variants}} {{can also}} be generalized to <b>Fourier</b> transforms on arbitrary locally compact Abelian topological groups, which are studied in harmonic analysis; there, the <b>Fourier</b> transform takes functions on a group to functions on the dual group. This treatment also allows a general formulation of the convolution theorem, which relates <b>Fourier</b> transforms and convolutions. See also the Pontryagin duality for the generalized underpinnings of the <b>Fourier</b> transform.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{fundamental}} {{definition of a}} <b>Fourier</b> transform is an integral, functions that can be expressed as closed-form expressions are commonly computed by working the integral analytically to yield a closed-form expression in the <b>Fourier</b> transform conjugate variable as the result. This is the method used to generate tables of <b>Fourier</b> transforms, including {{those found in the}} table below (<b>Fourier</b> transform#Tables of important <b>Fourier</b> transforms).|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the subject}} of <b>Fourier</b> {{analysis}} encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics. In the sciences and engineering, the process of decomposing a function into oscillatory components is often called <b>Fourier</b> analysis, while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as <b>Fourier</b> synthesis. For example, determining what component frequencies are present in a musical note would involve computing the <b>Fourier</b> transform of a sampled musical note. One could then re-synthesize the same sound by including the frequency components as revealed in the <b>Fourier</b> analysis. In mathematics, the term <b>Fourier</b> analysis often refers {{to the study of}} both operations.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} question about <b>Fourier</b> series, asked by <b>Fourier</b> {{himself at the}} beginning of the 19th century, is whether the <b>Fourier</b> series of a continuous function converges pointwise to the function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} spectroscopy is {{an efficient}} method for processing spectra data obtained using interferometers. <b>Fourier</b> transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) {{is a common}} implementation of infrared spectroscopy. NMR also employs <b>Fourier</b> transforms.|$|E
25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the <b>Fourier</b> transform, in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals {{in a form that}} has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the <b>Fourier</b> transform, such as the short-time <b>Fourier</b> transform or fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) <b>Fourier</b> transform being the continuous wavelet transform.|$|E
25|$|If f is {{continuous}} and its <b>Fourier</b> coefficients are absolutely summable, then the <b>Fourier</b> series converges uniformly.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} function {{is closely related}} to the <b>Fourier</b> transform: the {{characteristic function}} of a probability density function p(x) is the complex conjugate of the continuous <b>Fourier</b> transform of p(x) (according to the usual convention; see continuous <b>Fourier</b> transform – other conventions).|$|E
25|$|An {{equivalent}} statement can be {{made about}} <b>Fourier</b> transforms, since the characteristic function is essentially a <b>Fourier</b> transform.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} <b>Fourier</b> transform on Rn {{is still}} an area of ongoing research, particularly concerning <b>Fourier</b> transformation on more general objects such as tempered distributions. For instance, if we impose some requirements on a distribution f, we can attempt to translate these requirements {{in terms of the}} <b>Fourier</b> transform of f. The Paley–Wiener theorem is an example of this. The Paley–Wiener theorem immediately implies that if f is a nonzero distribution of compact support (these include functions of compact support), then its <b>Fourier</b> transform is never compactly supported. This is a very elementary form of an uncertainty principle in a harmonic analysis setting. See also: Convergence of <b>Fourier</b> series.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} the generalization to <b>Fourier</b> transforms on arbitrary finite groups, which act on functions G → C where G is a finite group. In this framework, the standard DFT {{is seen as}} the <b>Fourier</b> transform on a cyclic group, while the multidimensional DFT is a <b>Fourier</b> transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} may {{be defined}} in some cases for non-integrable functions, but the <b>Fourier</b> transforms of integrable functions have several strong properties.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} of {{the square}} wave generates a frequency spectrum that presents {{the magnitude of the}} harmonics that make up the square wave (the phase is also generated, but is typically of less concern and therefore is often not plotted). The <b>Fourier</b> transform {{can also be used to}} analyze non-periodic functions such as transients (e.g. impulses) and random functions. The <b>Fourier</b> transform is almost always computed using the Fast <b>Fourier</b> Transform (FFT) computer algorithm in combination with a window function.|$|E
25|$|Harmonic {{analysis}} on Euclidean spaces deals with {{properties of the}} <b>Fourier</b> transform on Rn that have no analog on general groups. For example, {{the fact that the}} <b>Fourier</b> transform is rotation invariant. Decomposing the <b>Fourier</b> transform into its radial and spherical components leads to topics such as Bessel functions and spherical harmonics.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{are divided}} {{as to how}} much to credit Lagrange and others for the {{development}} of <b>Fourier</b> theory: Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler had introduced trigonometric representations of functions, and Lagrange had given the <b>Fourier</b> series solution to the wave equation, so Fourier's contribution was mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represented by a <b>Fourier</b> series.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{complete}} set of Hermite functions provides {{a resolution of the}} identity, the <b>Fourier</b> transform can be represented by such a sum of terms weighted by the above eigenvalues, and these sums can be explicitly summed. This approach to define the <b>Fourier</b> transform was first done by Norbert Wiener. Among other properties, Hermite functions decrease exponentially fast in both frequency and time domains, and they are thus used to define a generalization of the <b>Fourier</b> transform, namely the fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform used in time-frequency analysis. In physics, this transform was introduced by Edward Condon.|$|E
25|$|Explicit {{numerical}} integration {{over the}} ordered pairs can yield the <b>Fourier</b> transform output value for any desired {{value of the}} conjugate <b>Fourier</b> transform variable (frequency, for example), so that a spectrum can be produced at any desired step size and over any desired variable range for accurate determination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases corresponding to isolated peaks. Unlike limitations in DFT and FFT methods, explicit numerical integration can have any desired step size and compute the <b>Fourier</b> transform over any desired range of the congugate <b>Fourier</b> transform variable (for example, frequency).|$|E
25|$|The usual {{interpretation}} of the <b>Fourier</b> transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the {{interpretation of}} the inverse <b>Fourier</b> transform is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional <b>Fourier</b> transforms can transform a signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional <b>Fourier</b> transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.|$|E
25|$|This is G, {{since the}} <b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} of this integral is easy. Each fixed τ contribution is a Gaussian in x, whose <b>Fourier</b> transform is another Gaussian of reciprocal width in k.|$|E
25|$|S′(Rn), a {{subspace}} of D′(Rn). These distributions {{are useful}} if one studies the <b>Fourier</b> transform: all tempered distributions have a <b>Fourier</b> transform, {{but not all}} distributions in D′(Rn) have one.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} (FT) decomposes {{a function}} of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. The <b>Fourier</b> transform of {{a function of}} time itself is a complex-valued function of frequency, whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency. The <b>Fourier</b> transform is called the frequency domain representation of the original signal. The term <b>Fourier</b> transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time. The <b>Fourier</b> transform {{is not limited to}} functions of time, but {{in order to have a}} unified language, the domain of the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain. For many functions of practical interest, one can define an operation that reverses this: the inverse <b>Fourier</b> transformation, also called <b>Fourier</b> synthesis, of a frequency domain representation combines the contributions of all the different frequencies to recover the original function of time.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the Dirac delta function, {{although}} not a function, is a finite Borel measure. Its <b>Fourier</b> transform is a constant function (whose specific value depends upon {{the form of the}} <b>Fourier</b> transform used).|$|E
25|$|In particular, a DCT is a Fourier-related {{transform}} {{similar to}} the discrete <b>Fourier</b> transform (DFT), but using only real numbers. The DCTs are generally related to <b>Fourier</b> Series coefficients of a periodically and symmetrically extended sequence whereas DFTs are related to <b>Fourier</b> Series coefficients of a periodically extended sequence. DCTs are equivalent to DFTs of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with even symmetry (since the <b>Fourier</b> transform of a real and even function is real and even), whereas in some variants the input and/or output data are shifted by half a sample. There are eight standard DCT variants, of which four are common.|$|E
25|$|In signal {{processing}} terms, a function (of time) is {{a representation of}} a signal with perfect time resolution, but no frequency information, while the <b>Fourier</b> transform has perfect frequency resolution, but no time information: {{the magnitude of the}} <b>Fourier</b> transform at a point is how much frequency content there is, but location is only given by phase (argument of the <b>Fourier</b> transform at a point), and standing waves are not localized in time – a sine wave continues out to infinity, without decaying. This limits the usefulness of the <b>Fourier</b> transform for analyzing signals that are localized in time, notably transients, or any signal of finite extent.|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, the <b>Fourier</b> {{transform}} {{often takes}} a time series or {{a function of}} continuous time, and maps it into a frequency spectrum. That is, it takes a function from the time domain into the frequency domain; it is a decomposition of a function into sinusoids of different frequencies; {{in the case of}} a <b>Fourier</b> series or discrete <b>Fourier</b> transform, the sinusoids are harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the function being analyzed.|$|E
