40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study examines}} the hedging effectiveness of stock index futures for five emerging futures markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand. The hedging effectiveness is examined {{with respect to}} the impact of the recent 2008 financial crisis. Several hedging strategies to estimate hedge ratios (MVHRs) have been proposed in the literature. While these strategies hold theoretical appeal, there is no clear evidence as to their effectiveness in reducing the market risk. Using daily time series data from January 1 st, 2004 to April 26 th, 2012 for all the indices futures markets (except for Thailand, from April 28 th, 2006 to April 26 th, 2012); this study uses four different hedging strategies to estimate the MVHRs. Specifically, the conventional OLS model, Bivariate Vector Autoregression model (Bivariate-VAR), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Bivariate-GARCH model with cointegration are employed. Then the hedging effectiveness is measured based on the risk-return and the minimum variance framework. The empirical results indicate the following; firstly, the MVHRs estimated from the Bivariate-GARCH are slightly relatively superior. Secondly, during the crisis period, the MVHRs have increased for the Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong), FTSE STI (Singapore) and KLCI (Malaysia) implying higher hedging costs to the investors. Whereas, for the TAIEX (Taiwan) and SET 50 Index Thailand), the MVHRs have decreased and investors benefit from lower hedging costs. Besides, during the post-crisis period, the MVHRs have decreased for the Hang Seng Index and significantly increased for the FTSE STI, KLCI, TAIEX and SET 50 Index. Furthermore, all the four <b>hedging</b> <b>techniques</b> achieve significant risk reductions in the hedged portfolio compared to the unhedged position for all the five stock indices. Finally, although the performances of all <b>hedging</b> <b>techniques</b> did not vary significantly, it is certainly that the OLS perform slightly better than the other <b>hedging</b> <b>techniques</b> in improving the hedging effectiveness for all the five emerging futures market. Importantly, investors in the given markets should consider their level of risk aversion when hedging as the Bivariate-GARCH and the VECM performs well in-terms of returns...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we assess the partial hedging {{problems}} by formulating hedging strategies that minimize conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) {{of the portfolio}} loss under stochastic interest rate environment.

The contracts under consideration are based on two risky assets which satisfy a two-factor jump-diffusion model: one asset is responsible for future gains, {{and the other one}} is a stochastic guarantee. As most life insurance products are long-term contracts, it is more practical to consider the problem in a stochastic interest rate environment. In our setting, the stochastic interest rate behaviour is also described by a jump-diffusion model. In addition, quantile <b>hedging</b> <b>technique</b> is developed and exploited to price such finance/insurance contracts with initial capital constraints.
