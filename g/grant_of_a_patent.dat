5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} {{to be put to}} the Enlarged Board of Appeal in an effort to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer a number of questions to the Enlarged Board. In its opinion G 3/08, the Enlarged Board rejected the referral as inadmissible.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>patent</b> is <b>a</b> {{statutory}} grant which confers on an inventor or his legal successor {{the right to}} exclude others from using the invention. <b>Patents</b> have <b>a</b> limited duration, usually <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> at least 20 years.

50|$|Opposition is {{a process}} {{provided}} by some patent law systems in which a third party can oppose the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{in an attempt to}} prevent (or revoke) the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> In the European Patent Office, for example, any person may file opposition to the grant of a European patent within nine months from grant.In Israel, a third party may oppose an allowed application for three months after publication of the allowed application.|$|E
5000|$|A {{standard}} {{patent application}} is a patent application containing {{all of the}} necessary parts (e.g. a written {{description of the invention}} and claims) that are required for the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> A standard patent may or may not result in the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> depending upon the outcome of an examination by the patent office it is filed in.

5000|$|In August 2013, {{news reports}} {{surfaced}} about Robo-Taxi, a proposed driverless vehicle taxicab service from Google.

50|$|In other words, {{the grant}} {{procedure}} before the EPO is the procedure {{leading to the}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European <b>patent</b> or to the refusal to grant <b>a</b> European <b>patent.</b> The procedure starts with the filing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> application and ends with the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European <b>patent</b> or the refusal of the patent application by the EPO, or {{the withdrawal of the}} application by the applicant, or its deemed withdrawal. The prosecution of European patent applications until grant typically takes several years.|$|R
5000|$|Court actions {{relating}} to the entitlement to the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European <b>patent</b> must be brought before the national court which has the jurisdiction.

50|$|The <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{provides}} the inventor temporarily with an exclusive legal right, thereby securing {{a means to}} redeem the costs of research (by charging a higher price for its invention or by license fees from others who wish to practice it).|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} obtaining the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{begins with the}} {{preparation}} of a specification describing the invention.

50|$|The <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{gives the}} {{inventor}} a monopoly {{in the market}} for its product.

2500|$|Ayahuasca {{has also}} stirred debate {{regarding}} intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge. In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> on the ayahuasca vine B. Caapi. It allowed this patent {{based on the}} assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) and the Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition) objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen [...] "ownership" [...] of the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.|$|R
5000|$|As another example, <b>a</b> European <b>patent</b> {{application}} {{consists of}} [...] "a {{request for the}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European <b>patent,</b> <b>a</b> description <b>of</b> the invention, one or more claims, any drawings {{referred to in the}} description or claims, and an abstract."

50|$|However, {{the first}} {{applicant}} to file has the prima facie {{right to the}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> Under the first-to-invent system, when two people claim the same invention, the USPTO would conduct an interference proceeding between them to review evidence of conception, reduction to practice and diligence.

50|$|First to file (FTF) {{and first}} to invent (FTI) are legal {{concepts}} that define who {{has the right to}} the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for an invention.

50|$|Patent {{prosecution}} {{describes the}} interaction between applicants and their representatives, and a patent office with regard to a patent, or an application for a patent. Broadly, patent prosecution can be split into pre-grant prosecution, which involves negotiation with a patent office for the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> and post-grant prosecution, which involves issues such as post-grant amendment and opposition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} [...] "negotiating" [...] or [...] "arguing" [...] with a patent {{office for the}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> and {{interaction}} with a patent office with regard to a patent after its grant, is known as patent prosecution.

50|$|The {{earliest}} law {{required that}} a working model of each invention be submitted with the application. Patent applications were examined {{to determine if}} an inventor was entitled to the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> The requirement for a working model was eventually dropped. In 1793, the law was revised so that patents were granted automatically upon submission of the description. A separate Patent Office was created in 1802.|$|E
50|$|An {{applicant}} is free {{to abandon}} an application during the search and examination process. An application may be abandoned if, for example, prior art is revealed which will prevent the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> and the applicant decides to save cost by terminating the application. An application may be deemed abandoned by the patent office if the applicant fails to meet any of {{the requirements of the}} application process, for example replying to an examination report.|$|E

40|$|The <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> by the European Patent Office to Myriad Genetics on the {{sequence}} of the BRCA- 1 gene in 2001 prompted the Dutch Minister of Healthcare and the Minister of Education, Culture and Science to ask for advice.

Another recommendation (by Van de Bunt) entitled: 'A code of gene patenting' was also published in 2003. The KNAW report recommends, among others: <b>a</b> redefinition <b>of</b> the 'research exemption' and renewed discussion on a 'grace period'. The Van de Bunt report concludes, among other things, that some holders of gene patents cause unwanted side effects, but that the patent system itself provides sufficient possibilities to prevent these side effects. In a comment on both reports, the Dutch Ministry of Healthcare concluded: 'There {{is no reason to}} change the current patent system'.
