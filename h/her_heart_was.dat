5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Marie died on 18 July 1938, at 5:38p.m., {{eight minutes}} after lapsing into a coma. Her two eldest children, Carol and Elisabeth, {{accompanied}} by Prince Michael, were at her deathbed. Two days later, on 20 July, Marie's body {{was brought to}} Bucharest, where she lay in state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace. Her coffin was surrounded by flowers and glowing tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars. Thousands of people filed by Marie's bier during the three-day lying in state and, on the third day, the palace was opened for factory workers. Marie's funeral cortege {{made its way to}} the train station, passing under the Arch of Triumph. Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery, where she was interred. Marie's heart, according to her own wishes, was placed in a small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her Stella Maris chapel in Balchik. In 1940, after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II, <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Bran Castle. There, Ileana built a chapel to house the heart, kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E

25|$|The Duchess of Longueville (1619–1679), Anne Geneviève de Bourbon, {{sister of}} the Louis, Grand Condé and {{protector}} of Port Royal, offered substantial donations for construction of the building. After her death, her remains were interred at Port-Royal des Champs. When the abbey was destroyed, <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> deposited in the chapel of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Palmer {{went back}} to her alma mater, Lexington High School in Massachusetts, to {{collaborate}} with her old director and mentor Steven Bogart on a workshop piece for the department's spring production.

25|$|Perisho's partially-clothed {{body was}} found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a dinghy. Perisho's throat had been slashed and her head had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was {{extensively}} mutilated and <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt's appearance matched a composite sketch of a man seen crossing U.S. Route 1 near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, Monroe County investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{stories are}} {{associated}} with the time preceding her death. The elderly Sister Bourgeoys was said to have given up her life to God in order to save that of a younger member of the Congregation who had fallen ill. After intense prayer, it is said that the young nun was cured and Marguerite fell terribly ill, dying soon thereafter. Her appeal continued after her death, as she was well known and highly regarded. The convent held an afternoon visitation open to the public; people treasured objects that they touched to her hands at this time, which became considered spiritual relics. Her body was kept by the parish of Ville-Marie, but <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> removed and preserved as a relic by the Congregation.|$|E

500|$|Just {{five months}} {{before the arrival of}} troops on behalf of Gian Gastone's Spanish heir, Violante Beatrice of Bavaria, Dowager Grand Princess of Tuscany, Governor of Siena, died. During the funeral procession, her hearse briefly paused before the Pitti, an action that incensed the Grand Duke, who ordered the hearse to move along in words a {{contemporary}} dubbed [...] "unfit for the lowest of harlots, let alone for a gentle high-born princess". The bulk of Violante Beatrice's remains were interred in the Convent of Saint Teresa, Florence; <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> placed in her husband's coffin in the Medicean necropolis, San Lorenzo. When in 1857 her sarcophagus was re-discovered, it bore the imperial stamp of Napoleon I of France, who had had it moved from the convent to San Lorenzo. On 26 February 1858, she was restored to the convent, brought there in the royal hearse.|$|E
500|$|The Loogaroo is {{an example}} of how a vampire belief can result from a {{combination}} of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo. The term Loogaroo possibly comes from the French loup-garou (meaning 'werewolf') and is common in the culture of Mauritius. However, the stories of the Loogaroo are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States. During the late 18th and 19th centuries, there was a widespread belief in vampires in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and Eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term [...] "vampire" [...] was never actually used to describe the deceased. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or [...] "consumption" [...] as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death and <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> cut out and burnt to ashes.|$|E
2500|$|The Duchess {{then took}} up {{residence}} at the Château de la Muette, where she died on 21 July 1719, {{at the age of}} twenty-three. According to Saint-Simon, the autopsy revealed that [...] "the poor princess" [...] had in her womb a new fetus with several weeks of gestation. On Saturday 22 July 1719, <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> taken to the Val-de-Grâce church in Paris, and on 24 July 1719, she was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Her funeral arrangements were made by Saint-Simon himself.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{interest}} in interferon {{led her to}} approach Dr. Sidney Pestka at Roche Pharmaceutical Company and be hired at Hoffman-La Roche. For a time, the Changs endured the difficulties of a commuter marriage: Nancy {{lived and worked in}} Parsippany, NY; Tse Wen commuted to Pennsylvania each week to work at Centocor. [...] Eventually Nancy joined Centocor as a bench-level diagnostician. <b>Her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> still in research, and she took part in Centocor's involvement in therapeutic research. She brought in several new projects, including HIV/AIDS research. [...] Nancy’s team participated in a consortium, which sequenced the HIV genome structure. Nancy was instrumental in developing the first diagnostic assay to detect HIV infection by employing a peptide segment of HIV as the solid-phase antigen in the immunoassay. [...] She was Director of Research at Centocor from 1982 to 1986.|$|E
2500|$|... that lone figure, like {{a figure}} in Scripture, of the woman sitting on the stone at the turning to the mountain, to warn Burley [...] {{that there is a}} lion in his path; and the fawning Claverhouse, {{beautiful}} as a panther, smooth-looking, blood-spotted; and the fanatics, Macbriar and Mucklewrath, crazed with zeal and sufferings; and the inflexible Morton, and the faithful Edith, who refused [...] "to give her hand to another while <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> with her lover in the deep and dead sea." [...] And in The Heart of Midlothian we have Effie Deans (that sweet, faded flower) and Jeanie, her more than sister, and old David Deans, the patriarch of St. Leonard's Crags, and Butler, and Dumbiedikes, eloquent in his silence, and Mr. Bartoline Saddle-tree and his prudent helpmate, and Porteous, swinging in the wind, and Madge Wildfire, full of finery and madness, and her ghastly mother.|$|E
2500|$|The autopsy was {{performed}} {{the next day}} by Golay, who discovered that the weapon, which {{had not yet been}} found, had penetrated [...] into Elisabeth's thorax, fractured the fourth rib, pierced the lung and pericardium, and penetrated the heart from the top before coming out the base of the left ventricle. Because of the sharpness and thinness of the file the wound was very narrow and, due to pressure from Elisabeth's extremely tight corseting, the hemorrhage of blood into the pericardial sac around the heart was slowed to mere drops. Until this sac filled, the beating of <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> not impeded, which is why Elisabeth had been able to walk from the site of the assault and up the boat’s boarding ramp. Had the weapon not been removed, she would have lived a while longer, as it would have acted like a plug to stop the bleeding.|$|E

2500|$|In {{people with}} cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), where both lungs {{need to be}} replaced, it is a technically easier operation with {{a higher rate of}} success to replace both the heart and lungs of the recipient with those of the donor. As the recipient's original heart is usually healthy, it can then be transplanted into a second recipient in need of a heart transplant, thus making the person with CF a living heart donor. [...] In a 2016 case at Stanford Medical Center, a woman who was needing a heart-lung transplant had cystic fibrosis which had led to one lung expanding and the other shrinking thereby displacing her heart. [...] The second patient who in turn received <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> a woman with right ventricular dysplasia which had led to a dangerously abnormal rhythm. [...] The dual operations actually required three surgical teams including one to remove the heart and lungs from a recently deceased initial donor. [...] The two living recipients did well and in fact had an opportunity to meet six weeks after their simultaneous operations.|$|E
2500|$|Being a yōkai, Himari {{finds herself}} torn between {{her desire to}} protect Yuto, and her nature as a bloodthirsty demon cat. Through research, Shizuku informs Yuto that Himari's {{ancestors}} were the type of evil yōkai that killed and ate humans, saying that Himari takes pleasure in the hunt and loses herself to the bloodlust. Initially, Himari does not realize when she loses control, describing it as if <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> swallowed up into a black pool. Himari eventually acknowledges {{that she is a}} beast after a fight with Kuesu, but she is tended to by Yuta. In response Himari kisses him, saying that it is a [...] "gift of mercy" [...] for letting her stay by his side. Towards the end of the series in the fight against Tamamo-no-Mae, Himari bites her, absorbing most of her demonic powers. This results in Himari losing control with her darker demonic half, which eventually becomes visible to those around her. The series ends when Yuto enters into Himari's subconscious, and saves her before her darker half takes full control of her heart.|$|E
2500|$|Karen sought {{therapy for}} her eating {{disorder}} with psychotherapist Steven Levenkron in New York City. In April, she briefly returned to Los Angeles for recording, including a Carpenter / Bettis tune [...] "You're Enough" [...] and a Roger Nichols / Dean Pitchford song, [...] "Now". Richard noticed that while Karen's {{interpretation of the}} songs was as strong as ever, he felt the timbre was weak owing to her poor health. He was unimpressed with Levenkron's treatment of Karen, which he considered worthless. In September, Karen called Levenkron to say <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> [...] "beating funny" [...] and she felt dizzy and confused. Admitting herself into hospital later that month, she was hooked up to an intravenous drip; she ended up gaining [...] in eight weeks. On November 8, she left the hospital and despite pleas from family and friends, she announced that she was returning home to California {{and that she was}} cured. Her last public appearance was on January 11, 1983, for a photo session celebrating 25 years of the Grammy Awards.|$|E
