The small forward control lorry Nalle-Sisu KB-24 came to market in 1955. Other notable models introduced in the 1950s are the heavy <b>dumper</b> <b>trucks</b> K-36, the first 6×4 driven Sisu, K-32, and K-44 with a North European specialty, 4×4+2 layout.|$|R

5000|$|Progress and {{innovation}} were {{not confined to}} Glensanda. In 1985, Torr Works quarry acquired the O & K Mobile Crusher, a five storey high plant which can walk to the current working location, instead of a conventional fixed building which needs to be fed by <b>dumper</b> <b>trucks.</b> Four Class 59 locomotives were commissioned from the USA to pull even heavier and longer loads from Torr Works to stone terminals in southern England. Foster Yeoman was the first national company to run private locomotives on the then British Rail track, and achieved the British records for length and weight of a single train.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} trucks were 6x6 flatbeds with gross weights of 103 tonnes; {{the third was}} built as a 6x4 <b>dumper</b> <b>truck,</b> for the uranium mine at Bessines-sur-Gartempe; the fourth was another flatbed truck with 102 tonne gross weight, or 190 tonnes as a tractor. It was {{experimentally}} fitted with a Turbomeca jet engine in 1962, but fuel consumption was excessive, so the conventional diesel engine was fitted again.|$|E
50|$|To {{bring in}} 10,000 tonnes of hoggin would have {{required}} 1,000 round trips for a Morooka MST-2200vd tracked <b>dumper</b> <b>truck.</b> The contractors Alaska designed and built an experimental light railway from a forest track to the cutting. By this they reduced the compaction of the soil of the forest by eliminating heavy dumper movements. This allowed work to continue even in wet weather. It also resulted in lower fuel consumption and less noise and pollution. The project cost of £214,500 included plant hire and labour (£106,500) and infill materials (£108,000).|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the railway was to reduce the {{environmental}} impact of bringing so much material on site. The Morooka <b>dumper</b> <b>truck</b> has an engine of 250 HP whereas Alaska thought that they could shift the same 10 tonnes of gravel in a train powered by a Boxer 532DX mini-skid, a tracked vehicle running on the rails, which has a 32 HP engine. Thus the emissions savings would be substantial. There ought also to be less surface damage. The railtrack had a calculated ground pressure, when loaded by a train carrying a load of 10 tonnes, of under 3 psi, to avoid the sleepers sinking into the occasionally very wet ground. Therefore, no ballast was needed.|$|E

5000|$|Rolls-Royce diesels {{came into}} {{selection}} in 1955 in Sisu K-36, the strongest flatbed hauler in Finland at its time. The 250-hp engine type was C6SFL. Later the same engines {{were used in}} some <b>dumper</b> <b>trucks</b> and in 1961 in K-50SS, the up-to-date largest automobile built in the Nordic countries. In 1966 SAT produced vehicles with 300-hp Rolls-Royce diesels; the Sisu K-142SS {{was one of the}} most powerful trucks in Finland and advertised as [...] "the king of the highways". The Rolls-Royce Eagle engines became to the selection in 1967. The 1970 introduced R- and M-series had initially the 282-hp Eagles; a number of variants with different outputs were presented after.|$|R

The heavy machine guns and the flamethrower were mounted on a tripod on the lorry bed. To assure widespread destruction, the column would detonate a van bomb after the initial assault.|$|E
50|$|In 1950's Hudsons {{recognised}} {{the threat}} to their business {{in the construction industry}} from rubber tyred road vehicles. To meet this challenge they introduced their own range of road vehicles starting in 1960 with the LEEDSALL <b>dumper</b> <b>truck.</b> This was followed by the KIWI mobile yardcrane,the TIMISER low loading trailer and the FRONTOMATIC concrete truckmixer. These developments initially provided replacement work for the declining orders for railway equipment and to consolidate this, a Contractor's Equipment division was formed in 1964. In 1968 a separate building was opened on the main Wakefield-Bradford Road with showrooms and land for demonstration purposes. With the demise of the Gildersome works the company became a sales and service organisation for construction plant and machinery e.g. Ford, Barford, Kubota.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEarthworks {{are part}} of the {{construction}} of any type of ground transport infrastructure. In many road and railway infrastructures earthworks represent up to 30 to 50 % of total cost of the construction. Moreover, earthworks involve the use of heavy mechanical equipment (e. g., excavators, <b>dumper</b> <b>trucks,</b> bulldozers and rollers) and repetitive activities that are responsible for large amounts of carbon emissions with negative impact to the environment. In this context, the optimization of earthworks construction activities is becoming increasingly important in recent years, while effective and practical integrated solutions have not been established so far. As such, this work introduces a novel optimization integrated system for earthwork tasks. In this integrated system, the optimization is carried out on various fronts, namely minimization of execution cost and duration, while attempting to reduce environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions. In order to achieve this, the integration of a wide array of technologies is required, so as to allow for a proper adjustment to reality. These range from evolutionary computation and data mining (i. e., soft computing), to geographic information systems and linear programming. The former are used firstly to provide realistic estimates of the productivity of available resources (i. e., equipment), and secondly to perform their optimal allocation throughout the construction site. Concurrently, the latter are employed for supporting the optimization of resource and material management, {{as well as of the}} trajectories associated with transportation of material from excavation to embankment fronts. The system has been validated using real-world data stemming from a Portuguese road construction site. Results show that the proposed system is very competitive when compared with the manual allocation methodologies currently used for the design and construction of earthworks. In fact, the system can output several different resource distribution solutions, which comprehend a trade-off between the referred optimization objectives, enhancing the flexibility of design by allowing the user to select the solution that best fits the project restrictions (e. g., deadline, budget). As such, the system is capable of allocating the available equipment in a way that maximizes its potential and productivity, while indirectly guaranteeing minimum carbon emissions in each possible solution. These results emphasize the importance of using this kind of decision support/optimization tools in the design and construction of earthworks...|$|R
