500|$|In {{the example}} above, the [...] "free space channel" [...] has been divided into {{communications}} channels according to frequencies, and each channel is assigned a separate <b>frequency</b> <b>bandwidth</b> {{in which to}} broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called [...] "frequency-division multiplexing". [...] Another term for the same concept is [...] "wavelength-division multiplexing", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.|$|E
500|$|The other {{meaning of}} the term [...] "channel" [...] in {{telecommunications}} is seen in the phrase communications channel, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium {{so that it can be}} used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5MHz (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a <b>frequency</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of about 180kHz (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [...] "carrier frequencies". Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200kHz, and the difference between 200kHz and 180kHz (20kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.|$|E

The album featured appearances from Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr and comedian Simon Day. Beken described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as [...] "self-consciously musically written and less sample-based" [...] compared to the members' previous work. Living had been in production since 2001, but due to members' other obligations, it was delayed for several years. The album received mixed critical reactions, with reviewers such as The Sun comparing the album favourably to the music of DJ Shadow and Röyksopp while other publications, such as The Times, called it [...] "Orb-lite" [...] and proclaimed it to be [...] "Deep Forest-style sludge". Soon after the album's release, Cauty left the Transit Kings on [...] "extended leave", leaving the project in indefinite limbo.

40|$|Laser {{generated}} ultrasound {{systems have}} historically been more complicated and expensive than conventional piezoelectric based systems, and this fact has relegated the acceptance of laser based systems to niche applications for which piezoelectric based systems are less suitable. Lowering system costs, while improving throughput, increasing ultrasound signal levels, and improving signal-to-noise are goals which will help increase the general acceptance of laser based ultrasound. One current limitation with conventional laser generated ultrasound is a material s damage threshold limit. Increasing the optical power to generate more signal eventually damages the material being tested due to rapid, high heating. Generation limitations for laser based ultrasound suggests the use of pulse modulation techniques as an alternate generation method. Pulse modulation techniques can spread the laser energy over time or space, thus reducing laser power densities and minimizing damage. Previous experiments by various organizations using spatial or temporal pulse modulation {{have been shown to}} generate detectable surface, plate, and bulk ultrasonic waves with narrow <b>frequency</b> <b>bandwidths.</b> Using narrow <b>frequency</b> <b>bandwidths</b> improved signal detectability, but required the use of expensive and powerful lasers and opto-electronic systems. The use of a laser diode to generate ultrasound is attractive because of its low cost, small size, light weight, simple optics and modulation capability. The use of pulse compression techniques should allow certain types of laser diodes to produce usable ultrasonic signals. The method also {{does not need to be}} limited to narrow <b>frequency</b> <b>bandwidths.</b> The method demonstrated here uses a low power laser diode (approximately 150 mW) that is modulated by controlling the diode s drive current and the resulting signal is recovered by cross correlation. A potential application for this system which is briefly demonstrated is in detecting signals in thick composite materials where attenuation is high and signal amplitude and bandwidth are at a premium...|$|R
