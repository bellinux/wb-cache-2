5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as <b>gibberellic</b> acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{groundbreaking}} research, Paul K. Boss and Mark R. Thomas of the CSIRO Plant Industry and Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture in Glen Osmond, Australia, {{found that}} Pinot Meunier has a mutation (VvGAI1) that stops it from responding to <b>gibberellic</b> acid, a plant growth hormone. This leads to different, white-haired, leaf and shoot growth, {{and also to}} a slight stunting in growth, explaining why Pinot Meunier plants {{tend to be a}} bit smaller than Pinot noir. The mutation exist only in the outermost cell layer of the cultivar, the L1 or 'epidermal' layer, meaning Pinot Meunier is a chimera. Through tissue culture, it is thus possible to separate out plants containing both the mutant (L1) and non-mutant (L2) genotypes, yielding a normal Pinot noir -like genotype and an unusual looking L1-genotype vine with compressed internodes and thickly clustered leaves. The mutants could not produce full-grown tendrils, it seems that <b>gibberellic</b> acid converts grapevine flower buds into tendrils.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gibberellic</b> acid (also called Gibberellin A3, GA, and GA3) is {{a hormone}} found in plants and fungi [...] Its {{chemical}} formula is C19H22O6. When purified, it {{is a white}} to pale-yellow solid.|$|E
50|$|Gibberellins are tetracyclic {{diterpene}} acids. There are {{two classes}} {{based on the}} presence of either 19 or 20 carbons. The 19-carbon gibberellins, such as <b>gibberellic</b> acid, have lost carbon 20 and, in place, possess a five-member lactone bridge that links carbons 4 and 10. The 19-carbon forms are, in general, the biologically active forms of gibberellins. Hydroxylation also has a great effect on the biological activity of the gibberellin. In general, the most biologically active compounds are dihydroxylated gibberellins, which possess hydroxyl groups on both carbon 3 and carbon 13. <b>Gibberellic</b> acid is a dihydroxylated gibberellin.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an effort to find the most effective method of breaking seed dormancy in the species in order to increase rates of germination.

50|$|All known {{gibberellins}} are diterpenoid acids {{that are}} synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in plastids and then modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol {{until they reach}} their biologically-active form. All gibberellins are derived via the ent-gibberellane skeleton, but are synthesised via ent-kaurene. The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery. <b>Gibberellic</b> acid, {{which was the first}} gibberellin to be structurally characterized, is GA3.|$|E
50|$|Atropa {{belladonna}} {{is rarely}} used in gardens, but, when grown, {{it is usually}} for its large upright habit and showy berries.Germination of the small seeds is often difficult, due to hard seed coats that cause seed dormancy. Germination takes several weeks under alternating temperature conditions, but can be sped up {{with the use of}} <b>gibberellic</b> acid. The seedlings need sterile soil to prevent damping off and resent root disturbance during transplanting.|$|E
50|$|In tobacco, {{infection}} of R. fascians leads to hyperexpression of a cytochrome P450, homologue to a gene involved in inactivation of abscisic acid in Arabidopsis thaliana, of a <b>gibberellic</b> acid oxidase, which inactivates this hormone and its precursors, a proline dehydrogenase, {{which has its}} transcription induced by cytokinin and turns proline into glutamic acid, and a factor involved in molybdenum cofactor, needed for sulfur, carbon and nitrogen metabolism control and for abscisic acid synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Ion {{trapping}} is {{also important}} outside of pharmacology. For example, it causes weakly acidic hormones to accumulate in the cytosol of cells. This is important in keeping the external concentration of the hormone low in the extracellular environment where many hormones are sensed. Examples of plant hormones that are subjected to ion trapping are abscisic acid, <b>gibberellic</b> acid and retinoic acid. Examples of animal hormones subjected to ion trapping include Prostacyclin and Leukotrienes.|$|E
50|$|To yield {{sufficient}} fruit, Black Corinth grapes need to {{be carefully}} managed. In ancient times, girdling was a standard practice to increase the set and size of seedless grapes, until {{the discovery of the}} plant hormone <b>gibberellic</b> acid, and its ability {{to do the same thing}} with less labor. Historically, Black Corinth stock was probably kept for its pollen-producing abilities, so other female flowered varieties (with naturally higher yields) would set full crops.|$|E
50|$|As {{photosynthesis}} becomes inhibited by dehydration, {{the grain}} filling process becomes increasingly reliant on stem reserve utilisation. Numerous {{studies have reported}} that stem reserve mobilisation capacity is related to yield under dehydration stress in wheat. In rice, a few studies also indicated that this mechanism maintains grain yield under dehydration stress at the grain filling stage. This dehydration tolerance mechanism is stimulated by a decrease in <b>gibberellic</b> acid concentration {{and an increase in}} abscisic acid concentration.|$|E
5000|$|These stages {{can also}} be defined by the hormones that are {{regulating}} the process which are as follows: Stage I, cytokinin promoted, causing the lateral bud to form since cytokinin {{plays a role in}} cell division; Stage II, auxin is promoted, resulting in apical dominance ("imposition of inhibition"); Stage III, cytokinin released resulting in outward growth of the lateral bud; and Stage IV, auxin is decreased and <b>gibberellic</b> acid is promoted which results in cell division, enabling the bud or branch to continue outward growth.|$|E
50|$|Fruit can be {{obtained}} all year round from the Pixie. The Pixie's fruit is a black fruited grape with seeds in it. Cluster length usually maxes out at 10 cm in length and the vines that are not regularly thinned tend to grow a lot of fruit and in turn slow growth and {{reduce the number of}} flowers produced. Seeds can {{be obtained}} and there have been known results of seedlings growing and showing flowers. However, due to a reduced sensitivity to gibberellins a <b>Gibberellic</b> Acid treatment is necessary when undergoing seed germination.|$|E
50|$|Modern wheat {{varieties}} have short stems, {{the result}} of RHt dwarfing genes that reduce the plant's sensitivity to <b>gibberellic</b> acid, a plant hormone that lengthens cells. RHt genes were introduced to modern wheat varieties in the 1960s by Norman Borlaug from Norin 10 cultivars of wheat grown in Japan. Short stems are important because the application of high levels of chemical fertilizers would otherwise cause the stems to grow too high, resulting in lodging (collapse of the stems). Stem heights are also even, which is important for modern harvesting techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Bakanae (バカナエ) (pronounced [...] "ba-ka-na-eh") or bakanae disease(馬鹿苗病, バカナエビョウ, Bakanae-byou), {{from the}} Japanese for [...] "foolish seedling", {{is a disease}} that infects the rice plant. It {{is caused by the}} fungus Gibberella fujikuroi, the {{metabolism}} of which produces a surplus of <b>gibberellic</b> acid. In the plant, this acts as a growth hormone, causing hypertrophy. The afflicted plants, which are visibly etiolated and chlorotic, are at best infertile with empty panicles, producing no edible grains; at worst, they are incapable of supporting their own weight, topple over, and die (hence [...] "foolish seedling disease").|$|E
50|$|Compared with Thompson Seedless, the berry {{weight and}} {{diameter}} of Thomcord are larger, but cluster tightness is similar. The berry length ranged between 18.2 and 18.3 mm and the diameter ranged from 16.7 to 17.2 mm in tests between 2001 and 2002. The berries weigh between 2.72 and 3.38 g, averaging 2.85 g in 2002, {{which is on}} par with Venus, but heavier than Sovereign Coronation, {{and even more so}} than Thompson Seedless. The fruit's size has not been shown to increase appreciably by girdling the vines or by applying <b>gibberellic</b> acid when the berries set.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gibberellic</b> acid is {{sometimes}} used in laboratory and greenhouse settings to trigger germination in seeds {{that would otherwise}} remain dormant. It is also widely used in the grape-growing industry as a hormone to induce the production of larger bundles and bigger grapes, especially Thompson seedless grapes. In the Okanagan and Creston valleys, it is also used as a growth replicator in the cherry industry. It is used on Clementine Mandarin oranges, which may otherwise cross-pollinate with other citrus and grow undesirable seeds. Applied directly on the blossoms as a spray, it allows for Clementines to produce a full crop of fruit without seeds.|$|E
50|$|With the {{availability}} of molecular genetics in Arabidopsis and rice the mutant genes responsible (reduced height(rht), gibberellin insensitive (gai1) and slender rice (slr1)) have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of <b>gibberellic</b> acid, a phytohormone involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division. Stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilisers on commercial yield.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, Heriot-Watt awarded her {{an honorary}} Doctorate of Science [...] for her {{discovery}} of <b>gibberellic</b> acid, {{which was an}} advantage for the maltsters, as it shortened the malting process. At that occasion, the Dean of the Faculty of Science, Professor Philip G. Harper, mentioned that Macleod’s association with the brewing industry puts her in the same fraternity as other scientists, such as James Watt (power), Louis Pasteur (pasteurisation), Peter Griess (colour chemistry), Joseph Williams Lovibond (colour physics), Gosset (statistics) and the man after whom the medal was named. He {{said that she was}} recognised nationally and internationally with distinction as a university teacher, scholar, scientist, technologist and as a brewer.|$|E
50|$|Colloidal silver (commonly {{abbreviated}} CS) suppresses ethylene {{production in}} bud sites, stimulating male characteristics. Spraying selected leaves, branches and - {{in cases where}} {{a large amount of}} seed is desired - whole plants with colloidal silver solution has become a preferred method of obtaining feminized seeds. Most plants treated with CS will turn intersex within 2 weeks of triweekly treatment, producing viable pollen within 4. <b>Gibberellic</b> acid has also been used for the same purpose, but it is harder to acquire than colloidal silver and can be difficult to dissolve into solution. One method of obtaining colloidal silver utilizes a small direct current power supply and two pieces of solid silver jeweler's wire, or silver coin.|$|E
50|$|Physiological {{dormancy}} prevents embryo {{growth and}} seed germination until chemical changes occur. These chemicals include inhibitors that often retard embryo growth {{to the point}} where it is not strong enough to break through the seed coat or other tissues. Physiological dormancy is indicated when an increase in germination rate occurs after an application of <b>gibberellic</b> acid (GA3) or after Dry after-ripening or dry storage. It is also indicated when dormant seed embryos are excised and produce healthy seedlings: or when up to 3 months of cold (0-10 °C) or warm (=15 °C) stratification increases germination: or when dry after-ripening shortens the cold stratification period required. In some seeds physiological dormancy is indicated when scarification increases germination.|$|E
50|$|Arabidopsis, a plant, and Gibberella fujikuroi, a fungus, possess {{different}} GA pathways and enzymes. P450s in fungi perform functions {{analogous to}} the functions of KAOs in plants. The function of CPS and KS in plants is performed by a single enzyme, CPS/KS, in fungi. In fungi, the GA biosynthesis genes are found on one chromosome, but in plants, they are found randomly on multiple chromosomes. Plants produce low amount of GA3, therefore the GA3 is produced for industrial purposes by microorganisms. Industrially the <b>gibberellic</b> acid can be produced by submerged fermentation, but this process presents low yield with high production costs and hence higher sale value, nevertheless other alternative process to reduce costs of the GA3 production is Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) that allows the use of agro-industrial residues.|$|E
