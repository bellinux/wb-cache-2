40|$|Contribution No. 143 of the Aquaculture Department of SEAFDEC. The {{effect of}} the rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, grown on unialgal {{cultures}} of Isochrysis galbana, Tetraselmis sp. and Chlorella sp. on the hepatocytes of milkfish fry was evaluated by electron microscopy. Rotifers grown on the three different species of phytoplankton brought about different ultrastructural features in milkfish fry hepatocytes. Best results were obtained from fry reared on Isochrysis-fed rotifers. The use of marine Chlorella-fed rotifers as <b>feed</b> for <b>fry</b> resulted in the poorest hepatocyte ultrastructure, indicating that this was nutritionally the least adequate cultured food.

50|$|Betta pallifina are {{relatively}} undemanding {{when it comes}} to care of bettas. They tolerate harder water conditions than most of their relatives. They adapt quickly to life in captivity. They should be kept in species-only tanks; one pair can comfortably occupy a 24-inch tank (60 centimeters), while two pairs should be kept in a 30-inch tank (75 centimeters). The tank should have many hiding places, plants, and driftwood. pH should be kept in the range of 6.6-7.4, though a level that is under or over this is fine if kept stable. Feeding is easy, as they will readily take most foods offered. As for any fish, it is recommended that the tank is cycled to prevent ammonia or nitrites from harming the fish. Water current caused by a filter does not cause problems with Betta pallifina, since they come from forest streams and can handle current better than most species of Betta. They will eat a large variety of live foods, such as white worms (Enchytraeus albidus), grindal worms (Enchytraeus buchholzi), wingless fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and brine shrimp. Captive fish will readily take pelleted and flake foods, as well as frozen and freeze dried foods, though these should be soaked prior to <b>feeding.</b> <b>Fry</b> should be fed baby brine shrimp, microworms, or infusoria.|$|R
50|$|Well-fed {{adults do}} not often eat their own young, {{although}} sometimes safe zones {{are required for}} the fry. Specially designed livebearer birthing tanks, which can be suspended inside the aquarium, are available from aquatic retailers. These also serve to shield the pregnant female from further attention from the males, which is important because the males sometimes attack the females while they are giving birth. It also provides a separate area for the newborn young as protection from being eaten by their mother. However, if a female is put in the breeder box too early, it may cause her to have a miscarriage. Well-planted tanks that offer barriers to adult guppies shelter the young quite well. Guppy grass, water sprite, water wisteria, duckweed, and java moss are all good choices. A continuous supply of live food, such as Daphnia or brine shrimp, keep adult fish full and may spare the fry when they are born. Young fry take roughly {{three or four months}} to reach maturity. <b>Feeding</b> <b>fry</b> live foods, such as baby brine shrimp, microworms, infusoria and vinegar eels, is recommended. Alternatives include finely ground flake food, egg yolk, and liquid fish food, though the particulates in these may be too large for the youngest fry to eat.|$|R

The effects of supplementation of dietary phospholipid from marine (krill) or plant (soy lecithin) sources were investigated in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. First <b>feeding</b> <b>fry</b> were fed diets containing either krill oil or soybean lecithin supplying phospholipid at 2. 6 %, 3. 2 %, 3. 6 % and 4. 2 % of diet. Fish were sampled at ~ 2. 5 g (~ 1, 990 °day post fertilization, dpf) and ~ 10 g (2, 850 °dpf). By comparison of the intestinal transcriptome in specifically chosen contrasts, {{it was determined that}} by 2, 850 °dpf fish possessed a profile that resembled that of mature and differentiated intestinal cell types with a number of changes specific to glycerophospholipid metabolism. It was previously shown that intact phospholipids and particularly phosphatidylcholine are essential during larval development and that this requirement is associated with the inability of enterocytes in young fry to endogenously synthesize sufficient phospholipid for the efficient export of dietary lipid. In the immature phase (~ 1, 990 °dpf), the dietary phospholipid content as well as its class composition impacted on several biochemical and morphological parameters including growth, but these differences were not associated with differences in intestinal transcriptomes.

40|$|A {{decline in}} the quality of the {{freshwater}} fish seed available to small-scale farmers in Asia has been identified as an important constraint on the development of aquaculture in the region. There is a need for simple and reliable methods of determining the quality of seed at the farm gate or hatchery. The present study was carried out, in the field, to develop and evaluate a stress challenge test for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, Linn.) fry as the effects of stress on fish performance have been well documented and similar tests are used elsewhere in the sector. Formalin and iodized salt were used as reference toxicants. LC 50 values were estimated using mortality figures resulting from exposure of marketable-sized fry to saline and formalin solutions. The two test concentrations, 24 ppt for saline and 500 p. p. m. for formalin, were used as reference toxicants in acute, static bioassays to challenge fry reared under different conditions during the post sex-reversal, nursery period.

Subsequently, all fish were then fed {{under the same}} conditions with a commercial, marine-based, diet for 15 weeks and thereafter challenged with a second V diet (Diet Vchallenge, 10 % FM/ 0 % FO) for 6 weeks. Diploid and triploid siblings were run in parallel to examine ploidy effects. Growth performance, feed intake, nutrient utilisation and intestinal morphology were monitored. Fish initially given Diet Vstimulus (V-fish) showed 24 % higher growth rate and 23 % better feed efficiency compared with M-fish when later challenged with Diet Vchallenge. There {{was no difference in}} feed intake between nutritional histories, but increased nutrient retentions highlighted the improved utilisation of a V diet in V-fish. There were generally few significant effects of nutritional history or ploidy on enteritis scores in the distal intestine after the challenge phase as only V-triploids showed a significant increase (P< 0 · 05) in total score. The data highlighted that the positive effects were most likely a result of nutritional programming and the ability to respond better when challenged later in life may be attributed to physiological and/or metabolic changes induced by the stimulus.

40|$|In recent decades, {{aquaculture}} {{has become}} an increasingly {{important part of the}} world economy. Other than marketing concerns, the biggest challenge facing fish farmers is to control the many complex abiotic and biotic factors that influence the success of fish rearing. An example of the complexity involved in managing aquatic systems is the need to control opepod populations by manipulating the pond environment. Copepods play major roles in pond ecosystems, serving as 1) food for small fish, 2) micropredators of fish and other organisms, 3) fish parasites, 4) intermediate hosts of fish parasites, and 5) hosts and vectors of human diseases. Planktonic animals, especially rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods of the order Cyclopoida are the most important food items in freshwater aquaculture, and copepod nauplii are especially valuable for <b>feeding</b> <b>fry.</b> Copepods used as natural food are either cultured or collected from natural water bodies. Adult and advanced copepodid stages of cyclopoids are micropredators that target early life stages of cyprinids (Cyprinidae). Other copepods in aquaculture are fish parasites. The most common adult copepod parasites of freshwater fishes are Lernaea cyprinacea, Ergasilus sieboldi (and related species), Salmincola californiensis, S. edwardsii, Achtheres percarum, Tracheliastes maculatus, and Caligus lacustris. In addition, copepodids of Lernaea and chalimus larvae of Achtheres and Salmincola attach to gill filaments and cause epithelial hyperplasia and may be indirectly responsible for fish-kills. Copepods are also intermediate hosts for important fish parasites, including tapeworms and nematodes. Damage from these parasites may lead to fish mortalities or reduce the market value of the fish products. Finally, copepods serve as intermediate hosts for parasites that infect humans and can serve as vectors of serious human diseases like cholera. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

BP was reduced by <b>feeding</b> <b>fried</b> whole egg hydrolysate but not by the non-hydrolyzed product suggesting a critical role for in vitro digestion in releasing anti-hypertensive peptides. Egg white hydrolysate and defatted egg yolk hydrolysate (but not egg yolk hydrolysate) also had similar effects. Reduction in BP was accompanied by the restoration of nitric oxide (NO) dependent vasorelaxation and reduction of plasma angiotensin II. Fried whole egg hydrolysate also reduced plasma levels of triglyceride although it was increased by the non-hydrolyzed sample.

The effect fo varying dietary crude protien on growth and spawning frequency of tilapia was determined under laboratory conditions. The weight of male fish increased as dietary crude protein increased; however, weight gain of male fish did not follow a definite due to the asynchronous nature of spawning of the tilipia. Results suggested that when diets contain high-quality protein, and feedig is at station level, the influence of increasing dietary protein on spawning frequency and growth of the females are not cxonsiderable. In another study, tilapia broodstock in cages and tanks had the best growth and highest fry production when fed a 40 % CP diet. Ipil-ipil leaf mal as a sole or major source of dietary protein caused weight loss among tilapia breeders, drastic reduction in fry production, and eventually cessation of reproduction. The growth of breeders describers decreased significantly with the incorpotion of more than 40 % ipil-ipil in the diet.

40|$|Background Atlantic salmon {{have been}} subject to {{domestication}} for approximately ten generations, beginning in the early 1970 s. This process of artificial selection will have created various genetic differences between wild and farmed stocks. Each year, hundreds of thousands of farmed fish escape into the wild. These escapees may interbreed with wild conspecifics raising concerns for both the fish-farming industry and fisheries managers. Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between domesticated and wild salmon is essential to the continued sustainability of the aquaculture industry and to the maintenance of healthy wild stocks. Results We compared the transcriptomes of a wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon population (Figgjo) and a Norwegian farmed strain (Mowi) at two life stages: yolk sac fry and post first-feeding fry. The analysis employed 44 k oligo-microarrays to analyse gene expression of 36 farmed, wild and hybrid (farmed dam x wild sire) individuals reared under identical hatchery conditions. Although some of the transcriptional differences detected overlapped between sampling points, our results highlighted the importance of studying various life stages. Compared to the wild population, the Mowi strain displayed up-regulation in mRNA translation-related and down regulation in nervous and immune system -related pathways in the sac fry, whereas up-regulation of digestive and endocrine activities, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and lipid metabolism and down-regulation of environmental information processing and immune system pathways were evident in the <b>feeding</b> <b>fry.</b> Differentially regulated pathways that were common among life stages generally belonged to environmental information processing and immune system functional groups. In addition, we found indications of strong maternal effects, reinforcing the importance of including reciprocal hybrids in the analysis. Conclusions In agreement with previous studies we showed that domestication has caused changes in the transcriptome of wild Atlantic salmon and that many of the affected pathways are life-stage specific We highlighted the importance of reciprocal hybrids to the deconvolution of maternal/paternal effects and our data support the view that the genetic architecture of the strains studied highly influences the genes differentially expressed between wild and domesticated fish...|$|R

To assess differential life stage sensitivity to common EDCs, we carried out short-term (4 day) exposures using three doses each of 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), 17 β-estradiol(E 2), and nonylphenol (NP) on four early life stages; embryos, yolk-sac larvae, <b>feeding</b> <b>fry</b> and 1 year old smolts. Differential response was compared using vitellogenin (Vtg, a precursor egg protein) gene transcription. Smolts were also examined for impacts on plasma Vtg, cortisol, thyroid hormones (T 4 /T 3) and hepatosomatic index (HSI). Compound-related mortality was not observed in any life stage, but Vtg mRNA was elevated in a dose-dependent manner in yolk-sac larvae, fry and smolts but not in embryos. The estrogens EE 2 and E 2 were consistently stronger inducers of Vtg than NP. Embryos responded significantly to the highest concentration of EE 2 only, while older life stages responded to the highest doses of all three compounds, as well as intermediate doses of EE 2 and E 2. Maximal transcription was greater for fry among the three earliest life stages, suggesting fry {{may be the most}} responsive life stage in early development. Smolt plasma Vtg was also significantly increased, and this response was observed at lower doses of each compound than was detected by gene transcription suggesting plasma Vtg is a more sensitive indicator at this life stage. HSI was increased at the highest doses of EE 2 and E 2, and plasma T 3 was decreased at the highest dose of EE 2. Our results indicate that all life stages are potentially sensitive to endocrine disruption by estrogenic compounds and that physiological responses were altered over a short window of exposure, indicating the potential for these compounds to impact fish in the wild...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{carried out}} to study of factors influencing on trout production in Khorasan Razavi Province using a cross sectional data of 105 trout producers and estimation of trout production function in 2008. Results showed that farms' area, number of <b>fry,</b> <b>feed,</b> fish farming period and water flow have positive effect on trout production and water temperature and fish losses have negative effect on it. Farms area, water temperature degree, number of <b>fry,</b> <b>feed,</b> fish farming period, water flow, water source, labor and fish losses elasticities are 0. 282, - 1. 428, 0. 216, 0. 422, 1. 641, 0. 430, - 9. 19 x 10 - 4, - 1. 407 and - 0. 157, respectively. The highest positive effect is due to fish farming period that shows trout producers harvest earlier of economic harvesting time and supply to market. The highest negative effect is due to water temperature that shows it is high. Use of farms' area, number of fry, water flow and feed are at stage 2. Water temperature and fish losses are at stage 3. Effect of Farms area, water temperature degree, number of <b>fry,</b> <b>feed,</b> fish farming period, water flow, water source, labor and fish losses on fish production are 15. 46, - 78. 30, 11. 85, 23. 14, 89. 99, 23. 58, - 5 x 10 - 2, - 77. 15 and - 8. 60 kg, respectively. Fish cost price is 23518. 16 rial kg - 1 that sale 30000 rial kg - 1 at market. Cost, revenue and gross revenue of trout estimated 49. 13, 62. 67, 13. 54 rial/day/fish, respectively. Gross margin (income) is 6481. 84 rial kg - 1. Regard to results, fish feed management, supplying of farms water from river and spring, try to decrease of water temperature to 15 - 16 °C, fish harvesting in income maximization time and farm environmental management suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to confirm the}} {{requirement}} for dietary phospholipid in Atlantic salmon and better define the level and period of requirement. Thus, the effects of dietary supplementation with phospholipid supplied by krill or soy lecithin were investigated in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. First <b>feeding</b> <b>fry</b> were fed diets containing 55 % protein and 17 % lipid supplemented with krill oil or soybean lecithin in a regression design at five levels, 1. 5 (unsupplemented), 2. 6, 3. 2, 3. 6 and 4. 2 % total phospholipid and fish were sampled at 1 g (1400 ˚day post fertilisation, dpf), 2. 5 g (1990 ˚dpf), 5 g (2350 ˚dpf), 10 - 20 g (2850 ˚dpf) and smolt (3800 ˚dpf). Survival was high overall with a positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 59 - 0. 72) between survival and dietary phospholipid supplementation. Growth was improved by phospholipid with highest growth achieved in fish fed krill phospholipid at 2. 6 % and in fish fed soy lecithin at 3. 6 %. The pattern of growth differed between fish up to 2. 5 g and that from 2. 5 g onwards with SGR (0 - 2. 5 g) being significantly higher in fish fed 2. 6 % krill phospholipid and 3. 6 % soy phospholipid compared to the basal diet, whereas {{there was no difference}} in SGR (2. 5 g-smolt) between the treatments. Intestinal steatosis was observed in 2. 5 g fish fed the unsupplemented diet (20 % prevalence) and lower levels of soy (10 % prevalence), whereas it was absent from 2. 5 g fish fed krill oil and higher levels of soy lecithin (≥ 3. 2 %), and fish at all later stages. Prevalence of vertebral deformities was low but was reduced by increasing dietary phospholipid with krill oil generally being more effective. The results were consistent with salmon having a dietary requirement for dietary phospholipid in early life stages...|$|R
