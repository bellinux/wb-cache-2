2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E

'I {{thought perhaps}} the pain {{would go off}} {{in a day or}} two; and, besides, I did not want to make you unhappy,' {{answered}} the man, who was by this time quite sure he had been suffering tortures, and had borne them like a hero.

2500|$|Negative {{scores are}} common, and {{occasionally}} even the victor's score may be negative. Score totals are {{announced at the}} conclusion of the show. Fry has said, [...] "I think we all agree that nobody in this universe understands QI's scoring system." [...] John Lloyd, QIs creator, has, on one occasion, admitted that not even he <b>has</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. According to the Series A DVD, guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but none has so far exercised that right.|$|R
60|$|Faith's amiable wish was fulfilled. The {{next day}} found Aunt Martha {{still unable to}} rise. Carl, too, was still sick and easily prevailed on to stay in bed. Neither Faith nor Una <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> sick the boy really was; a watchful mother {{would have had a}} doctor without delay; but there was no mother, and poor little Carl, with his sore throat and aching head and crimson cheeks, rolled himself up in his twisted bedclothes and {{suffered}} alone, somewhat comforted by the companionship of a small green lizard in the pocket of his ragged nighty.|$|R

"----you can't judge--in fact (this {{is nothing}} personal, you know) I don't suppose it's {{possible}} for Westerners to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> precious family ideals are to Easterners. Of course we're probably silly about them, and it's splendid, your wheat-lands, and not caring who your grandfather was; {{but to make}} up for those things we do have to protect what we have gained through the generations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{must say}} I would take almost {{any chance of}} getting back {{to a place like}} that.

Why, sir, I'll bet you could go back to Hatboro' now, and be there twenty-four hours before anybody would wake up enough to make trouble for you. Mind, I don't say that's what we want you to do. We couldn't make terms for you half as well, with you on the ground. We want you to keep your distance for the present, and let your friends work for you.

I've just learned the greatest wisdom--to know when I'm happy. But, Milt dear---- I say this because I love you. Yes, I do love you. No, don't kiss me. Yes, it is too---- It's far too public.

5000|$|Kinsey {{learns that}} Sutton was {{involved}} in a past [...] "recovered memory" [...] event that proved false, while greatly disrupting his family. Bothered by this, Kinsey traces the dogtag back to the dog's owner, who told her that the dog had been euthanized around that time. No one <b>has</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> the remains ended up in Horton Ravine. Upon returning to Horton Ravine to talk to the neighbors, Kinsey learns that Rain, the four-year-old granddaughter/adopted daughter of the couple that formerly owned the lot, had been kidnapped in a similar fashion just before Mary Claire but was returned unharmed after her parents paid a ransom of $15,000 using marked bills, which also never turned up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he {{will have}} you to look after him." [...] He made a deprecatory gesture, sat down, and took up a paper. I did the same. The papers were old and uninteresting, filled up mostly with dreary stereotyped {{descriptions}} of Queen Victoria's first jubilee celebrations. Probably we should have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze {{if it had not}} been for Hamilton's voice raised in the dining room. He was finishing his tiffin there. The big double doors stood wide open permanently, and he could not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> near to the doorway our chairs were placed. He was heard in a loud, supercilious tone answering some statement ventured by the Chief Steward.|$|R
6000|$|Sewell laughed. [...] "To be sure! We never <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> far {{our little}} candle throws its beams! I'm just {{here for the}} night, on my way from the {{mountains}} to the sea; I'm to be the 'supply' in a friend's pulpit at New Bedford; and I'm here quite alone in the house, scrambling a sermon together. But I'm so glad to see you! You're well, I hope? You're looking a little thin, but that's no harm. Do you enjoy your life with Mr. Corey? I was sure you would! When you come to know him, you will find him one of the best of men--kindly, thoughtful, and sympathetic. I've felt very comfortable about your being with him whenever I've thought of you, and you may be sure that I've thought of you often. What about our friends of the St. Albans? Do you see Mrs. Harmon? You knew the Evanses had gone to Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess so, if it's {{properly}} spent," [...] Mrs. Van Reinberg agreed. [...] "Only {{very few}} of my country-people <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> {{to use it to}} get what they want. They go over the other side and hire great houses, and bribe your great ladies to call themselves their friends, and bribe your young men with wonderful entertainments to come to their houses. They spend, spend, spend, and think they are getting value for their money. Idiots! The great lady whom they are proud to entertain one night is as likely as not to cut them the next. Half the people who go to their parties go out of curiosity, and half to meet their own friends. Not one to see them! Not one because it does them the slightest good to be seen there. They are there in the midst of it all, and that is all you can say. Their motto should be 'on sufferance.' That's what I call going to work the wrong way." ...|$|E
60|$|At Long Key the Gulf Stream is {{offshore}} five miles. The water shoals gradually {{anywhere from}} two feet near {{the beach to}} twenty feet five miles out on the reef. When {{there has been no}} wind for several days, which is a rare thing for Long Key, the water becomes crystal clear and the fish and marine creatures are an endless source of interest to the fisherman. Of course a large boat, in going out on the reef, must use the channel between the keys, but a small boat or canoe can go anywhere. It is remarkable how the great game fish come in from the Stream across the reef into shoal water. Barracuda come right up to the shore, and likewise the big sharks. The bottom is a clean, white, finely ribbed coral sand, with patches of brown seaweed here and there and golden spots, and in the shallower water different kinds of sponges. Out on the reef the water is a light green. The Gulf Stream runs along {{the outer edge of the}} reef, and here between Tennessee Buoy and Alligator Light, eighteen miles, is a feeding-ground for sailfish, kingfish, amberjack, barracuda, and other fishes. The ballyhoo is the main feed of these fishes, and it is indeed a queer little fish. He was made by nature, like the sardine and mullet and flying-fish, to serve as food for the larger fishes. The ballyhoo is about a foot long, slim and flat, shiny and white on the sides and dark green on the back, with a sharp-pointed, bright-yellow tail, the lower lobe of which is developed to twice the length of the upper. He has a very strange feature in the fact that his lower jaw resembles the bill of a snipe, being several inches long, sharp and pointed and hard; but he has no upper lip or beak at all. This half-bill must be used in relation to his food, but I do not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> this is done.|$|E

50|$|The {{accident}} occurred {{just before}} 1 o'clock. The train was rounding a curve, but a fairly easy one, {{as compared to}} some of the curves higher up the line.

50|$|The other idea, {{which is}} the idea that's locked away in Shapirov's brain, is to couple Planck's {{constant}} {{with the speed of}} light, so that when one is decreased, the other is increased.

5000|$|Beach {{grew up in}} Mount Kisco, New York {{and began}} running at 16.

50|$|Santa Maria del Fiore {{was the new}} {{cathedral of}} the city, and by 1418 the dome {{had yet to be}} defined. When the {{building}} was designed in the previous century, no one <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> such a dome was to be built, given that it was to be even larger than the Pantheon's dome in Rome and that no dome of that size had been built since antiquity. Because buttresses were forbidden by the city fathers, and because it was impossible to obtain rafters for scaffolding long and strong enough (and in sufficient quantity) for the task, it was unclear how a dome of that size could be constructed without it collapsing under its own weight. Furthermore, the stresses of compression were not clearly understood, and the mortars used in the period would set only after several days, keeping the strain on the scaffolding for a very long time.|$|R
50|$|A {{party with}} whom I have conversed, says no one <b>has</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> much the secession cause has been {{strengthened}} since PRICE'S march to Lexington, and particularly since its surrender.

The rebels prophesy that before ten years have elapsed the Confederacy will be the greatest, most powerful, and prosperous, nation on the globe, and that the United States will decay, and be forced to seek the protection of England to prevent their being crushed by the South.|$|R
5000|$|BMW {{psychologist}} and researcher Bernt Spiegel {{has found that}} non-motorcyclists and novice motorcyclists usually share the fatalistic attitude described by Thompson, insofar as they think that high speed motorcycling is like a game of chicken or Russian roulette, where the rider tests his courage to see how close he can come to [...] "the edge", or specifically the limit of traction while braking or cornering, without <b>having</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> close he is to exceeding that limit and crashing.
