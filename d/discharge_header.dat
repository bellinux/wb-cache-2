5000|$|On 27 August 2009, {{the third}} unit was stopped when a hole {{was found in}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>header</b> of a pump. According to the {{automated}} radiation control system, the radiation situation at the plant and in its 30 km monitoring zone was normal. The plant's management refuted rumors of an accident and stated that the third unit was stopped for a [...] "short-term unscheduled maintenance", with a restart scheduled for 31 August 2009.|$|E
40|$|The {{circulating}} water {{system is a}} very important system in Ghazlan Steam Power Plant- 4276 MW, as it supplies the sea water to the tubes side of the Condensers during normal operation. A large butterfly cross-connect valve was installed at the {{circulating water}} pumps <b>discharge</b> <b>header</b> to isolate the pumps and the header for maintenance. A forced unit shutdown occurred due to valve's shafts end leakage and collapse after maintenance work. This paper explains the wrong design location of the valve in the piping as the root cause of the problem. Analysis with ASME reference will be presented. This paper will also present potential solutions and actions taken as a lesson learned to avoid occurrence in other plants...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 21 Installations {{utilizing}} multiple {{reciprocating pump}} equipped with common suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>headers</b> can experience severe problems including cavitation, piping vibration and fatigue failure, or destruction of pump components. Typically, {{the source of}} these problems is the interaction between naturally pulsating reciprocating pumps and the piping system. In the past, field testing was used to define the problems which were eliminated {{by trial and error}} methods, usually by installing suction and discharge dampeners or modifying system piping. However, advances in analytical techniques and data acquisition equipment have lead to better understanding of the system/pump relationship. This information is now available for use in designing reciprocating pump installations, thus eliminating the pulsation problems of the past...|$|R
40|$|Two-phase <b>discharge</b> from <b>headers</b> has {{relevance}} to many industrial applications, particularly in nuclear-safety analysis during postulated loss-of-coolant accidents. The main {{objective of this}} study is to assess the ability of commercial CFD codes in predicting the flow phenomena and flow parameters associated with two-phase discharge from a stratified region through a small side branch. Results were obtained for the critical heights at the onsets of gas and liquid entrainment, as well as the mass flow rate and quality during two-phase discharge. All results are in good agreement with existing experimental data. However, the computation time required to obtain these results was found to be excessive...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is created {{of the dynamic}} response of pressures caused by flow inputs to an existing distributed helium refrigeration system. The dynamic system studied consists of the suction and <b>discharge</b> pressure <b>headers</b> and compressor portions of the refrigeration system used to cool the superconducting magnets of the Tevatron accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The modeling method involves identifying the system from data recorded during a series of controlled tests, with effort made to detect locational differences in pressure response around the four mile accelerator circumference. A review of the fluid mechanics associated with the system indicates linear time invariant models are suitable for the identification, particularly since the governing equations of one dimensional fluid flow are approximated by linear differential equations. An outline of the experimental design and the data acquisition system are given, followed by {{a detailed description of}} the modeling, which utilized the Matlab programming language and associated System Identification Toolbox. Two representations of the system are presented. One, a black box model, provides a multi-input, multi-output description assembled from the results of single input step function testing. This description indicates definite variation in pressure response with distance from the flow input location, and also suggests subtle differences in response with the input location itself. A second system representation is proposed which details the relation between continuous flow changes and pressure response, and provides explanation of a previously unappreciated pressure feedback internal to the system...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} {{fuel gas}} preparation, {{there are several}} compositional properties that must be controlled within specified limits. This allows client plants to use the fuel gas mixture safely without having to adjust and control the composition themselves. The variables to be controlled are the Higher Heating Value (HHV), Wobbe Index (WI), Flame Speed Index (FSI), and Pressure (P). These variables are controlled by adjusting the volumetric flow rates of several inlet gas streams of which some are makeup streams (always available) and some are wild streams that vary in composition and availability (by-products of plants). The inlet streams need to be adjusted in the correct ratios to keep all the controlled variables (CVs) within limits while minimising {{the cost of the}} gas blend. Furthermore, the controller needs to compensate for fluctuations in inlet stream compositions and total fuel gas demand (the total <b>discharge</b> from the <b>header).</b> This dissertation describes the modelling and model validation of an industrial fuel gas header as well as a simulation study of three different Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies for controlling the system while minimising the overall operating cost.
