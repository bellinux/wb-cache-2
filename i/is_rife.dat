5|$|Corruption <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> at all levels; Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2005 named Chad (tied with Bangladesh) as {{the most}} corrupt country in the world. Chad's ranking on the index has {{improved}} only marginally in recent years. Since its first inclusion on the index in 2004, Chad's best score has been 2/10 for 2011. Critics of President Déby have accused him of cronyism and tribalism.|$|E
5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate of the wilderness area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.|$|E

25|$|On maps {{a united}} realm, Inkarra <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with kings great and small who {{constantly}} scheme {{for power and}} place. The greatest is the Storm King Zandaros, both the High King of Inkarra and perhaps the mightiest human Air Wizard. As High King, all other kings of Inkarra must pay tribute to Zandaros. The Inkarrans despise the Rofehavanish, who they call the Dayborn, considering them to be utter barbarians.|$|E
25|$|Paranoia is {{a humorous}} {{role-playing}} game {{set in a}} dystopian future similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Logan's Run, and THX 1138; however, {{the tone of the}} game <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with black humor, frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy. Most of the game's humor is derived from the players' (usually futile) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to The Computer's arbitrary, contradictory and often nonsensical security directives.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuities {{reports on}} and {{analyzes}} the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> {{with examples of}} male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller, Philip Roth, and Norman Mailer. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material to demonstrate that women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of Act One {{is set in}} the local preacher Reverend Samuel Parris's attic. His ten-year-old daughter, Betty Parris, lies motionless. The previous evening, Reverend Parris discovered Betty, some other girls, and his Barbadian slave, Tituba, engaged in some sort of pagan ritual in the forest. The village <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with rumors of witchcraft and a crowd gathers outside Rev. Parris' house. Parris becomes concerned that the event will cause him to be removed from his position as the town's reverend. He questions the girls' apparent ringleader, his niece Abigail Williams, whom Parris has been forced to adopt after her parents were brutally killed in the Pequot War. Abigail denies they were engaged in witchcraft, claiming that they had been dancing. Afterwards, the wealthy and influential Thomas Putnam and his wife, Ann arrive. At the Putnams' urgence, Parris reluctantly decides to invite Reverend John Hale, an expert in witchcraft and demonology, to investigate and leaves to address the crowd.|$|E

500|$|Some authors criticised Shakira's first English album for the clumsy rhyme of its songs. Elizabeth Mendez Berry's {{article in}} [...] "Vibe" [...] is {{particularly}} indicative in this sense. [...] In reference to Shakira's texts in English, the journalist wrote: [...] "While her Spanish-language albums sparkled with elegant wordplay, this record <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with cliches, both musically and lyrically. [...] For Anglophone Latin lovers, Shakira's lyrics are best {{left to the}} imagination." ...|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the concert, Archbishop of Singapore, William Goh, {{expressed}} his dissatisfaction over the performance, claiming: [...] "Many have expressed their concern and even {{outrage at the}} performer’s disrespectful use of Catholic and other Christian symbols during her performances. Social media <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with comments about Madonna's blasphemous music and even props". Goh later explained {{that it was not}} possible to be permissive in a country like Singapore with multi-racial and religious segments, since artistic express might be construed as disrespectful among active practitioners of a particular religion. The performance of the song at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> {{with the}} {{constant}} presence of fear which {{manifests itself in}} a seemingly endless variety of outlets. Alvarez depicts quite vividly the fear evoked in the girls' mother, Laura, near the chronological beginning of the book, as she [...] "sees the black V.W. , and her heart plummets right down to her toes". Even after the García family has spent several years in the United States, safe {{from the threat of}} Trujillo's retribution, a relentless paranoia continues to plague Carlos, their father, [...] "who still lives in fear of the SIM and who is afraid to speak of 'revolt' out loud". This initial fear of Carlos' punishment {{for his role in the}} attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the García family’s flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives. The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted by the fear of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced.|$|E
500|$|The male {{displays}} {{in a tree}} in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviours such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over three or four days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when re-nesting following nest failure. The nest is a small untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing <b>is</b> <b>rife.</b> The clutch size can be anywhere from one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval-shaped and measure [...] Incubation lasts around 23days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with down at hatching, but are not capable of fending for themselves; they become capable of regulating their temperature at 9–12days and are fully feathered in 13–21days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2weeks, fledge at 30days and become independent at around the 45th day.|$|E

Vice Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels) calls Veronica {{into his office and}} gives her {{detention}} for having keys to his file cabinet. Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E
500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby {{wrote in}} his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna's singing in the song [...] "deserved a {{commendation}} for bravery and {{was a sign that}} she was going to set herself challenges." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which <b>is</b> <b>rife</b> with emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. The bottom line is that this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'." [...] Dorothy Holmes from Telegram & Gazette said that [...] "'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' sounds like her perfect adult contemporary staple." ...|$|E
