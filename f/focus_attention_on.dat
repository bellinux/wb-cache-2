5|$|Development {{began in}} 2006 {{following}} {{the completion of}} Jump Ultimate Stars as Ganbarion's first original title. The main concept was born from the desire to create a game scenario based around purification and love. Character numbers and plot twists were {{kept to a minimum}} to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Elena's plight. Due to recurring problems implementing the relationship mechanics and working with the Wii's controls, Pandora's Tower went through an extended development period. Despite releasing in Europe, Nintendo did not plan a North American release: prior to the announcement of Xseed Games picking up the title, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. Upon release, Pandora's Tower had modest commercial success and was met with mixed to positive reviews; praise went to the story and elements of combat, while the control scheme and graphics were faulted.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E
5|$|The woman, who is {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that}} the angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E

In 2011, the University of Kansas' Department of English, {{in collaboration with the}} Hall Center for the Humanities and in partnership with The Fortnightly Review, began awarding an annual Trollope Prize. The Prize was established to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Trollope's work and career.|$|E

25|$|At {{about the}} same time that Saunders was {{disseminating}} her theories and developing her hospice, in 1965, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler Ross also began to consider the social responses to terminal illness, which she found inadequate at the Chicago hospital where her American physician husband was employed. Her 1969 best-seller, On Death and Dying, was influential on how the medical profession responded to the terminally ill, and along with Saunders and other thanatology pioneers helped to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the types of care available to them.|$|E
25|$|The downing of {{the flight}} had {{resulted}} {{in the death of}} 38 Australian citizens and residents. In the lead up to the 2014 G20 meeting in Brisbane, Tony Abbott sought to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Russia's role in the shooting. In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the APEC meeting in Beijing, Abbott reportedly told the president that Australia had information that the missile that destroyed the plane had Russian origin and that Russia should consider apologising and offering appropriate restitution to the victims of the shooting. Russia continued to deny involvement.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{concerned}} {{parties have}} addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, the African Wildlife Foundation, and others, are trying to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations {{to help with the}} conservation of this species.|$|E

Black History Month is an attempt to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> previously neglected aspects of the American history, chiefly the lives and stories of African Americans. It is observed during the month of February to coincide with the founding of the NAACP and the birthdays of Frederick Douglass, a prominent African-American abolitionist, and Abraham Lincoln, the United States president who signed the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Campbell was {{transferred}} to the posts of Minister of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs. Notable events during her tenure included dealing with the controversial issue of replacing shipborne helicopters for the navy and for search and rescue units. The actions by Canadian Airborne Regiment in the military scandal known as the Somalia Affair also first emerged while Campbell was minister. When the Liberal Party of Canada took power, the incident became the subject of a lengthy public inquiry, continuing to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Campbell and the PCs.|$|E
25|$|At stake, beyond {{commercial}} {{speculation and}} financial profit, were {{the questions of}} when Cubism began, who {{led the way in}} its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent {{role in the development of}} this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.|$|E

25|$|What {{began with}} the English {{parliament}} asserting a new authority and William looking to expand alliances against France quickly developed into a major distraction, with William being forced to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Ireland and Scotland, and parliament having to fund the armies needed to overcome the Jacobites. This distraction helped keep Britain from intervening on the continent and contributed to twenty years of peace in Europe, while continuing unrest forced the British state to develop repressive strategies with networks of spies and informers as well as increasing its standing army. While Jacobitism increasingly appealed to the disaffected, it inherently bowed to higher authority and thus reinforced the social order. It left the British state strengthened {{to deal with the}} more revolutionary movements that developed later in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The formal psychometric {{measurement}} of creativity, {{from the standpoint}} of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic and <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It {{should be noted that the}} London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.|$|E
25|$|WAP's {{decision}} to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> pornography and prostitution in Times Square drew unexpected support from Broadway theater owners and city development agencies despairing at the increasing crime and urban blight {{in the neighborhood}} of Times Square. Carl Weisbrod, the head of the Mayor's Midtown Enforcement Project, helped them secure rent-free office space from the 42nd Street Redevelopment Corporation, in an empty bar and restaurant storefront {{that they were able to}} use until a buyer could be found (they occupied the storefront for more than two years, until two adjacent buildings collapsed during a renovation). St. Malachy's, a Midtown actors' chapel, contributed surplus desks. When Bob Guccione tried to buy the storefront space (in order to open an establishment to be named the Meat Rack), WAP alerted neighborhood residents, who protested and defeated the proposed deal.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{popular music}} has been {{recognized}} as a leading conveyor of changing perceptions and as shape of the consciousness of citizenry, serving to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> issues of cultural, moral or even political significance. In China {{over the last few}} decades, popular music has become an important vehicle for expressing aspects of the dramatic social change that is recreating the cultural identity of this huge and important nation. However, the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1970 had significant impact on the country’s economy and culture. In the past 50 years, there have been intensive political and economic changes in China, and the adjustment from a planned economy to a socialist-market economy fostered the emergence of popular music in China under the communist ideology. Therefore, popular music in China is very different from that in western countries due to different political structures and cultural and social values.|$|E
25|$|Left 4 Dead {{uses the}} 2008 version of Valve's Source engine, with {{improvements}} such as multi-core processor support and physics-based animation to more realistically portray hair and clothing, {{and to improve}} physics interaction with enemies when shot or shoved in different body parts. Animation was also improved to allow characters to lean realistically when moving in curved paths. Rendering and artificial intelligence were scaled up {{to allow for a}} greater number of enemies who can navigate the world in better ways, such as climbing, jumping, or breaking obstacles. Lighting was enhanced with new self-shadowing normal mapping and advanced shadow rendering that is important to convey information about the environment and player actions. Wet surfaces and fog are used to create mood. Many kinds of post processing cinematic visual effects inspired by horror movies {{have been added to the}} game. There is dynamic color correction that accentuates details based on importance, contrast and sharpening to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> critical areas, film grain to expose details or imply details in dark areas and vignetting to evoke tension and a horror-film look.|$|E
