Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's <b>fears</b> by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

They are sensitization, bewilderment and <b>fear.</b> She explained that so much nervous illness {{is no more than}} severe sensitization kept alive by bewilderment and <b>fear.</b> Dr. Weekes analyzed <b>fear</b> as two separate fears; the first <b>fear</b> and the second <b>fear.</b> She explained that first <b>fear</b> is the <b>fear</b> that comes reflexively, almost automatically. The patient usually immediately recoils from it, and as he/she does, he/she adds a second <b>fear</b> to the first. Second <b>fear</b> is the <b>fear</b> the patient adds to the first <b>fear.</b> Examples of second <b>fear</b> are [...] "Oh, my goodness! Here it is again! I can't stand it!. It is the second <b>fear</b> that is keeping the first <b>fear</b> alive, keeping the sufferer sensitized, keeping them nervously ill.|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} developed a procedure to study <b>fear</b> incubation in which rats given 100 tone-shock pairings over 10 days show low <b>fear</b> 2 days after conditioned <b>fear</b> training and high <b>fear</b> after 30 days. Notably, <b>fear</b> 2 days after 10 sessions of <b>fear</b> conditioning {{is lower than}} <b>fear</b> seen 2 days after a single session of <b>fear</b> conditioning, suggesting that <b>fear</b> is suppressed. Here, we investigate the potential role of CB 1 receptor activation by endocannabinoids in this <b>fear</b> suppression. We gave rats 10 days of <b>fear</b> conditioning and then gave systemic injections of the CB 1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 before a conditioned <b>fear</b> test conducted 2 days later under extinction conditions. A second test was conducted without any injections {{on the following day}} (3 days post-training) to examine <b>fear</b> extinction retention. SR 141716 injections did not increase <b>fear</b> expression 2 days after extended <b>fear</b> conditioning or affect within-session extinction, but impaired retention of between-session <b>fear</b> extinction in the day 3 test. These data suggest that CB 1 receptor activation is not suppressing <b>fear</b> soon after extended <b>fear</b> conditioning in the <b>fear</b> incubation task. The data also add to an existing literature on the effects of CB 1 receptors in extinction of conditioned <b>fear...</b>|$|R

According to Freud, <b>fear</b> of death results in death drive. In Gulliver’s Travels, the episodes of the Struldbruggs and the Houyhnhnms reveal <b>fear</b> of death. In the episode of Struldbruggs, <b>fear</b> of death is illustrated through <b>fear</b> of abandonment and <b>fear</b> of loss. <b>Fear</b> of abandonment and <b>fear</b> of loss cause the Struldbruggs to long for physical death to end emotional death. In the episode of Houyhnhnms, <b>fear</b> of death is represented by <b>fear</b> of intimacy. <b>Fear</b> of intimacy is expressed in Houyhnhnms’ cold attitudes to their friends and their family members...|$|R

Many road safety advertisers use <b>fear</b> appeals, such as “shock” advertising, that result in <b>fear</b> arousal, leaving the viewer feeling extremely tense.

5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were <b>fears</b> of a {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine.

As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until <b>fears</b> were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E

40|$|Pavlovian <b>fear</b> conditioning, {{also known}} as {{classical}} <b>fear</b> conditioning is an important model {{in the study of}} the neurobiology of normal and pathological <b>fear.</b> Progress in the neurobiology of Pavlovian <b>fear</b> also enhances our understanding of disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and with developing effective treatment strategies. Here we describe how Pavlovian <b>fear</b> conditioning is a key tool for understanding both the neurobiology of <b>fear</b> and the mechanisms underlying variations in <b>fear</b> memory strength observed across different phenotypes. First we discuss how Pavlovian <b>fear</b> models aspects of PTSD. Second, we describe the neural circuits of Pavlovian <b>fear</b> and the molecular mechanisms within these circuits that regulate <b>fear</b> memory. Finally, we show how <b>fear</b> memory strength is heritable; and describe genes which are specifically linked to both changes in Pavlovian <b>fear</b> behavior and to its underlying neural circuitry. These emerging data begin to define the essential genes, cells and circuits that contribute to normal and pathological <b>fear...</b>|$|R

The <b>fear</b> in birth, which we have designated as <b>fear</b> of life, seems to me actually the <b>fear</b> of having to live as an isolated individual, and not the reverse, the <b>fear</b> of loss of individuality (death <b>fear).</b> That would mean, however, that primary <b>fear</b> Urangst corresponds to a <b>fear</b> of separation from the whole vom All, therefore a <b>fear</b> of individuation, on account of which I would like to call it <b>fear</b> of life, although it may appear later as <b>fear</b> of the loss of this dearly bought individuality as <b>fear</b> of death, of being dissolved again into the whole ins All.

40|$|Advertising is {{embedded}} into everyday American life. Many television commercials aim {{to connect with}} the audience on an emotional level. Amongst these emotions, <b>fear</b> is often used to gain consumer attention. Theorists believe that moderate <b>fear</b> is the most effective level of <b>fear</b> to gain consumer attention, and cause behavioral changes. The emotion of <b>fear</b> also has effects on human physiology. Two different theories describe that the emotion of <b>fear</b> is linked to frontal lobe asymmetry, claiming that the emotion of <b>fear</b> will activate {{the right side of the}} frontal lobes. This study examined the modulated levels of <b>fear</b> (low, moderate and high) to determine if <b>fear</b> does activate the right hemisphere of the frontal lobes. Specifically, this study predicted that moderate <b>fear</b> would activate the right hemisphere of the frontal lobes by decreasing amplitude and frequency of alpha EEG waves, more than low and high <b>fear.</b> Significant results were not found when comparing moderate <b>fear</b> to low and high <b>fear</b> in the right frontal lobe. However, mean scores for moderate <b>fear</b> compared to low and high <b>fear</b> scores reveal a trend of activation indicating moderate <b>fear</b> to activate the right hemisphere more than the other two levels of <b>fear.</b> Also, results show significant differences in alpha activation when moderate <b>fear</b> was compared to happy and neutral advertisements...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that humans can become fearful after exposure to olfactory <b>fear</b> signals, yet these studies have reported the effects of <b>fear</b> chemosignals without examining emotion-relevant input from traditional communication modalities (i. e., vision, audition). The question that we pursued here was therefore: How significant is an olfactory <b>fear</b> signal in the broader context of audiovisual input that either confirms or contradicts olfactory information? To test this, we manipulated olfactory (<b>fear,</b> no <b>fear)</b> and audiovisual (<b>fear,</b> no <b>fear)</b> information and demonstrated that olfactory <b>fear</b> signals were as potent as audiovisual <b>fear</b> signals in eliciting a fearful facial expression. Irrespective of confirmatory or contradictory audiovisual information, olfactory <b>fear</b> signals produced by senders induced <b>fear</b> in receivers outside of conscious access. These findings run counter to traditional views that emotions are communicated exclusively via visual and linguistic channels. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R
