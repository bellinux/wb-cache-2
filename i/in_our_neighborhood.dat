5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close binary system of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E

[...] Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake's Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city's downtown area.

Safe Street Teams provide a reassuring presence in neighborhoods by walking the beat hile cultivating local relationships, pursuing proactive crime prevention measures, enforcing public safety, and improving quality of life. Community policing builds trust and reduces crime in Boston's neighborhoods. The BPD Safe Street Teams create clean, safe and orderly environments, increase positive interaction with local youth, and listen to the concerns of residents while offering tangible solutions. In April 2011, the City of Boston presented its comprehensive plan at a Youth Violence Summit in Washington, D.C. The Obama Administration selected the City of Boston along with five others to participate in the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention. Participants shared knowledge and experience, as well as develop comprehensive community-based plans to prevent youth and gang violence. Building upon a strong foundation of existing relationships and best practices, the City of Boston and its partners developed a multidisciplinary plan to reduce violence <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> The plan includes evidence-based crime prevention, intervention, enforcement, and reentry strategies; improves information sharing and coordination; and enhances civic engagement on multiple levels through a shared mission of youth violence prevention and reduction.
