5|$|Cariappa's {{alliance}} with the Indian Army was spread {{over a period of}} around three decades, during which he had broad experience of staff and command work. After his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. With a view toward ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964. He was also instrumental <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> up the Directorate of Resettlement (later Directorate General Resettlement), an inter-service organisation under the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare, Ministry of Defence, that looked after the various issues surrounding the resettlement of retired soldiers, especially those who retired young.|$|E

Just five days after Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700million, and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas.|$|E

5000|$|Perceptually {{unrelated}} stimuli {{may come}} to be responded to {{as members of a}} class if they have a common use or lead to common consequences. An oft-cited study by Vaughan (1988) provides an example. [...] Vaughan divided a large set of unrelated pictures into two arbitrary sets, A and B. Pigeons got food for pecking at pictures <b>in</b> <b>set</b> A but not for pecks at pictures <b>in</b> <b>set</b> B. After they had learned this task fairly well, the outcome was reversed: items <b>in</b> <b>set</b> B led to food and items <b>in</b> <b>set</b> A did not. Then the outcome was reversed again, and then again, and so on. Vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals, associating reward with a few pictures <b>in</b> one <b>set</b> caused the birds to respond to the other pictures <b>in</b> that <b>set</b> without further reward, as if they were thinking [...] "if these pictures <b>in</b> <b>set</b> A bring food, the others <b>in</b> <b>set</b> A must also bring food." [...] That is, the birds now categorized the pictures <b>in</b> each <b>set</b> as functionally equivalent. Several other procedures have yielded similar results.|$|R
