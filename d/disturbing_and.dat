5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> {{have been used}} in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E

25|$|In January 2017, The A.V. Club posted an {{analysis}} of the scene where Zev meets the character John Kurlander. The review noted some surface-level similarities between Norris' work as John and his role as Hank Schrader on Breaking Bad, but its main focus was on how events in 2016 and growing vocalization of white supremacists served to make the scene much more <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> realistic than it felt when the film premiered in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Lord Raglan's Hero Pattern lists many {{religious}} figures whose bodies disappear, or {{have more than}} one sepulchre. B. Traven, author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, wrote that the Inca Virococha arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he walked across the water and vanished. It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero's human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> collecting the hero's remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Entering somebody's {{personal}} space is normally {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain {{personal space}}, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> uncomfortable, though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{in people}} with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that are not there, and may reflect Lewy bodies or AD pathology in the temporal lobe. Delusions may include reduplicative paramnesia and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. These hallucinations are not necessarily <b>disturbing,</b> <b>and</b> in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them, or be conscious they are not real. People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were a}} number of films made for {{television}} that had World War III as a theme. ABC's The Day After (1983), PBS's Testament (1983), and the BBC's Threads (1984) depicted nuclear World War III. The three movies show a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which sends its troops marching across Western Europe. These films inspired many to join the anti-nuclear movement. Threads is notable for its graphically <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> realistic depictions of post-nuclear survival, depicting a nuclear strike on Sheffield, the effects of a nuclear winter in Britain, and the complete collapse of human civilization caused by the war..|$|E
25|$|Smart's unsentimental {{paintings}} encompass lonely urban vistas {{that seem}} both <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> threatening. Isolated individuals seem lost in industrial wastelands, full of high rise construction, concrete street-scapes and an eerie feeling of harmony and equilibrium – where silence and stillness create a deathly ambience. 'The express rape of the landscape' is one title hanging over Smart's paintings, {{referring to the}} freeways, street signs, trucks, oil drums, containers, buildings and concrete dividers that are the ever-present subjects of his work. At the same time his paintings – full of bold colours and perfect symmetry – are beautiful. The repetition of road signs in his works, for example, suggest an inconclusive direction and a world outside the frame is tantalising suggested.|$|E

25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and Lewy body dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most <b>disturbing,</b> <b>and</b> the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as quetiapine, or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|Casaubon has {{a romance}} with a Brazilian woman named Amparo. He leaves Italy {{to follow her}} and spends a few years in Brazil. While living there, he learns about South American and Caribbean spiritualism, and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies {{that he is the}} mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Agliè has a {{seemingly}} infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the Occult. While in Brazil, Casaubon receives a letter from Belbo about attending a meeting of occultists. At the meeting Belbo was reminded of the Colonel's conspiracy theory by the words of a young woman who was apparently in a trance. Casaubon and Amparo also attend an occult event in Brazil, an Umbanda rite. During the ritual Amparo falls into a trance herself, an experience she finds deeply <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> embarrassing, as she is Marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences. Her relationship with Casaubon falls apart, and he returns to Italy.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father disliked {{children}} and wanted {{none of his}} own, finding them noisy, but around five years into their marriage his wife became pregnant. This child, an apparently healthy daughter, caught pneumonia after her father found her cries <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> placed her in the garage, and {{died at the age}} of ten weeks. Their second child, born approximately a year later, was a boy diagnosed with Rh incompatibility who died at two days of age, either from complications of Rh incompatibility or from choking on his own mucus. Three years later they had another son, who doctors described as healthy despite also having Rh incompatibility. His father forced his wife to keep him quiet, causing significant physical and linguistic developmental delays. When he reached the age of four his maternal grandmother took over his care for several months, and he made good progress with her before she eventually returned him to his parents.|$|E

500|$|USA Today {{television}} critic Robert Bianco {{posited that}} the characters were not successful owing to an imbalance between the initial {{appeal of the}} Muppets to youth and the mature comedy used in Henson's other endeavors.

[...] Their leader Thomas Morton encouraged behavior that the Pilgrims found objectionable and dangerous. [...] The men of Merrymount built a maypole, drank liberally, refused to observe the Sabbath, and sold weapons to Native Americans. [...] Bradford found the weapons sales particularly <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> ordered Standish to lead an expedition to arrest Morton in 1628.|$|E
500|$|Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw {{attended}} four schools, all {{of which}} he hated. His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: [...] "Schools and schoolmasters", he later wrote, were [...] "prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them <b>disturbing</b> <b>and</b> chaperoning their parents." [...] In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier. During this period, Shaw was known as [...] "George Shaw"; after 1876, he dropped the [...] "George" [...] and styled himself [...] "Bernard Shaw".|$|E

Claudia Puig from USA Today praised her for [...] "remain consistently convincing" [...] to her role which is both [...] "powerful and chilling ...
