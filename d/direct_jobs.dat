40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in <b>direct</b> <b>job</b> creation programs as part of the active labour market policy, especially in the OECD European countries. This study provides a review, with a special reference to cost-effectiveness of Canadian <b>direct</b> <b>job</b> creation programs introduced by the Canadian federal government over the last two decades. The review brings diverse evaluation findings into a common focus and draws evaluation lessons about {{what works and what does}} not work with special reference to their cost-effectiveness over time. The paper finds that the cost-effectiveness of <b>direct</b> <b>job</b> creation programs improved considerably over time as program design was continuously modified. Also, the lessons drawn from the available evaluations highlight important structural and design issues. ...|$|R
40|$|Using the German Socio-Economic Panel 1984 - 2006 and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) {{this paper}} investigates job-to-job {{mobility}} (<b>direct</b> <b>job</b> mobility) and job mobility via unemployment (indirect job mobility) {{at the beginning}} of the employment career in Germany and the UK. The analyses show that, in Germany’s rigid labour market, <b>direct</b> voluntary <b>job</b> mobility brings permanent income rewards. Indirect job mobility, on the other hand, has a long-lasting scar effect for voluntary job movers. In contrast, in the UK not only voluntary <b>direct</b> <b>job</b> mobility but also voluntary indirect job mobility is rewarded by income gains. ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{competing}} theoretical expectations and conflicting empirical results concerning {{the impact of}} partisanship on spending on active labour market policies (ALMPs). This paper argues that one should distinguish between different ALMPs. Employment incentives and rehabilitation programmes incentivize the unemployed to accept <b>jobs.</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>job</b> creation reduces the supply of labour by creating non-commercial jobs. Training schemes raise the human capital of the unemployed. Using regression analysis this paper shows that the positions of political parties towards these three types of ALMPs are different. Party preferences also depend on the welfare regime in which parties are located. In Scandinavia, left-wing parties support neither employment incentives nor <b>direct</b> <b>job</b> creation schemes. In continental and Liberal welfare regimes, left-wing parties oppose employment incentives and rehabilitation programmes {{to a lesser extent}} and they support <b>direct</b> <b>job</b> creation. There is no impact of partisanship on training. These results reconcile the previously contradictory findings concerning the impact of the Left on ALMPs...|$|R
