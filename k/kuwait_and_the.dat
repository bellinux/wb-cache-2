5|$|The Al Bin Ali {{were the}} {{dominant}} group controlling the town of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula, originally the center of power of the Bani Utbah. After the Bani Utbah gained control of Bahrain, the Al Bin Ali had a practically independent status there as a self-governing tribe. They used a flag with four red and three white stripes, called the Al-Sulami flag in Bahrain, Qatar, <b>Kuwait,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Later, different Arab family clans and tribes from Qatar moved to Bahrain to settle {{after the fall of}} Nasr Al-Madhkur of Bushehr. These families included the Al Khalifa, Al-Ma'awdah, Al-Fadhil, Al-Mannai, Al-Noaimi, Al-Sulaiti, Al-Sadah, Al-Thawadi and other families and tribes.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{to hold an}} inter-continental {{sporting}} event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Games were proposed {{to be held in}} 1985. Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games. In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor {{built the}} first all-hydrogen {{refinery}} in <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company. It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices. In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served {{more than half of the}} world's government-owned oil companies.|$|E

25|$|Turkey's {{economy was}} {{battered}} by the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The UN embargo on Iraq required {{the ending of}} oil exports through the Kirkuk-YumurtalÄ±k pipelines, resulting {{in the loss of}} the pipeline fees. In addition, the economy may have lost as much as US$3 billion in trade with Iraq. Saudi Arabia, <b>Kuwait,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates (UAE) moved to compensate Turkey for these losses, however, and by 1992 the economy again began to grow rapidly.|$|E
25|$|After the 1970s {{oil boom}} in the Middle East, {{numerous}} Indians emigrated to work in Persian Gulf countries. This work was done on a contractual basis rather than permanently as in the 19th century cases. The countries in the Persian Gulf have a common policy of not naturalising non-Arabs, {{even if they are}} born there. Some Persian Gulf nations grant citizenship if the family has lived there for many generations or years. Two examples are <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> UAE.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{believe that}} the {{original}} rift from al-Nusra Front {{was part of a}} Qatar-led effort to rebrand al-Nusra Front, and provide it with new support, a move that could increase external aid for the terrorist group. Another analysis of Jund al Aqsa's rift and reunification states that it's a reflection of al-Qaeda's strategy of downplaying its official ties to these groups, and a strategy of diversifying its investments, especially with regards to affiliations with Qatar and <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of political will in their countries to combat terrorism and terror financing.|$|E
25|$|Ford's market {{presence}} in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region. Saudi Arabia, <b>Kuwait,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment. Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were Ford Crown Victorias. In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Infantry Division's Support Brigade held a Casing of the Colors {{ceremony}} for the brigade and Support Battalion colors during retreat at Cameron Field on 8 September 2005. The event signified the unit's deployment to Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 470 soldiers of the Support Brigade were the first personnel from the division to deploy to Iraq. They left in late September 2005. The brigade made two stops {{along the way to}} Camp Taji, one at Camp Buehring, <b>Kuwait,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other at Camp Anaconda, Iraq. Soldiers trained for two weeks at Camp Beuhring. The training went from basic firing skills like confirming their zero to more quick individual training at the close-quarters marksmanship course and reacting to a suspicious vehicle at an entry control point. The soldiers' training reached its peak with live-fire convoy exercises, where soldiers moved vehicles into defensive and offensive positions, moved disabled vehicles and requested medical evacuations for injured personnel.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Frank Lorenzo {{was forced}} to retire after 18 years {{at the helm of}} Texas International and later Texas Air and Continental Airlines, selling the {{majority}} of his Jet Capital Corporation to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). According to William F. Buckley, in his September 17, 1990 article on National Review, the sale to SAS was conditioned on Lorenzo leaving the company. On December 3, 1990, Continental filed for its second bankruptcy, due to Lorenzo dedicating himself almost full-time to Eastern Air Lines acquisition and labor relations issues, the 1990 Iraqi invasion of <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> resultant Gulf War had prompted a dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel, and People Express had been highly leveraged {{at the time of its}} merger with Continental. In addition to Lorenzo embarking on deals which saddled the airline with other carriers' debts, he also began consolidating the different airlines into one system. That resulted in a fleet comprising numerous aircraft types and liveries.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the ending}} of the British Raj in India, British {{interest}} in the Middle East remained strong: Britain had treaty relations with Jordan and Iraq and was the protecting power for <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Trucial States, the colonial power in Aden, and the occupying power in the Suez Canal. Many right-wing Conservative MPs, organised in the so-called Suez Group, sought to retain this imperial role, though economic pressures made maintenance of it increasingly difficult. Britain did seek to maintain its huge military base in the Suez Canal zone and, in the face of Egyptian resentment, further develop its alliance with Iraq, and the hope was that the Americans would assist Britain, possibly through finance. While the Americans did co-operate with the British in overthrowing the Mosaddegh government in Iran, after it had nationalised British oil interests, the Americans developed their own relations in the region, taking a positive view of the Egyptian Free Officers and developing friendly relations with Saudi Arabia. Britain was eventually forced to withdraw from the canal zone and the Baghdad Pact security treaty was not supported by the United States, leaving Eden vulnerable to the charge of having failed to maintain British prestige.|$|E
