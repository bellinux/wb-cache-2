40|$|AbstractNearby retinal {{ganglion}} cells often fire action potentials in near synchrony. We {{have investigated}} the circuit mechanisms that underlie these correlations by recording simultaneously from many ganglion cells in the salamander retina. During spontaneous activity in darkness, three types of correlations were distinguished: broad (firing synchrony within 40 – 100 ms), medium (10 – 50 ms), and narrow (< 1 ms). When chemical synaptic transmission was blocked, the broad correlations disappeared, but the medium and narrow correlations persisted. Further analysis of the strength and time course of synchronous firing suggests that nearby ganglion cells share inputs from photoreceptors conveyed through interneurons via chemical synapses (broad correlations), share excitation from amacrine cells via <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> (medium), and excite each other via <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> (narrow). It appears that the firing patterns in the optic nerve are strongly shaped by electrical coupling in the inner retina...|$|R

50|$|An <b>electrical</b> <b>{{junction}}</b> may {{be either}} a thermoelectricity junction, a metal-semiconductor junction or a p-n junction (p-type semiconductor-n-type semiconductor junction). Junctions are either rectifying or non-rectifying. Non-rectifying junctions are called ohmic contacts. Electronic components employing rectifying junctions include p-n diodes, Schottky diodes and bipolar junction transistors.|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} and fine structural events accompanying synapse formation have been followed while identified neurones of known function make contact in tissue culture. Particular pairs of identified neurones {{isolated from the}} central nervous system (CNS) of the leech form chemical synapses; other pairs of cells form nonrectifying <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions,</b> rectifying <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions,</b> mixed chemical and electrical synapses or no synapses at all, depending upon the partners that have been paired. Moreover, certain specific regions on the cell surface (such as the soma, initial cell segment or axon tips) preferentially develop chemical or electrical synapses. Of particular interest are the large, serotonergic Retzius cells that form mixed chemical and electrical synapses in culture, as in the animal. When these cells are juxtaposed at their initial segments, {{it has been shown that}} chemical synapses can develop reliably within 6 h of contact in culture. Shortly after transmission can be detected physiologically, the principal features of synaptic structure are evident.

Environmental groups strongly opposed construction because the bay was an important feeding ground for birds, which would be lost following impoundment.

These morphologies sometimes arise spontaneously as an effect of a templating or directing agent present in the synthesis such as miscellar emulsions or anodized alumina pores, or from the innate crystallographic growth patterns of the materials themselves. Some of these morphologies may serve a purpose, such as long carbon nanotubes used to bridge an <b>electrical</b> <b>junction,</b> or just a scientific curiosity like the stars shown at right.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{ceiling fan}} weighs between 15 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many {{junction}} boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan in operation exerts many additional stresses—notably torsion—on the object {{from which it}} is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the National Electric Code (document NFPA 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> box listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box.|$|E

It is applied as a process for adhering two multilayers, especially a substrate and deposited surface layer. The process involves bombarding layered samples with doses of ion radiation {{in order to promote}} mixing at the interface, and generally serves as a means of preparing <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions,</b> especially between non-equilibrium or metastable alloys and intermetallic compounds.

By studying the two subgraphs - the directed graph of chemical synapses and the undirected graph of <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> - we observe that adding a small number of undirected edges dramatically reduces the number of components in the complete graph. Under random node and edge removal, the C. elegans graph displays a remarkable structural robustness. We then compare these results with the vulnerability of a number of canonical graph models.

5000|$|The 2009 {{breakdown}} {{was caused}} by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called [...] "a perfect storm" [...] of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant. But the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's [...] "wet well" [...] from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, {{only one of the}} four sewage pumps could convey sewage out of the wet well, and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> boxes placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot-deep wet well filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the wet well then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there.|$|E
50|$|The ball turret {{has been}} {{restored}} and a machine gun (with new ammo box) mounted {{in one of the}} waist gunner positions. New gun barrels were fabricated and added to the tail and chin positions and a fully refurbished, modified top turret has been installed. Both the ball turret and top turret can be manually operated. New signage (part of an Eagle Scout project) directs visitor attention to, and provides information about, various features of the aircraft. Crew station equipment, particularly in the radio compartment and tail gunner positions are being restored, replaced with new surplus items, or if necessary, fabricated in preparation for reinstallation when structural repairs are completed in those positions. The tail cone has been removed and structural repairs in it are nearing completion after the tedious task of stripping all old paint was completed. The same is true of the radio compartment where structural repairs are underway following the laborious task of stripping paint. All equipment from the nose has been removed from the aircraft. Stripping paint from the nose and performing much needed repairs there will follow completion of the tail gunner and radio operator positions. Wooden components have been rebuilt or refabricated, including the floor in the waist, an <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> box in the bomb bay, two ammo boxes (the first two of several), the tail gunner seat, the radio operator’s desk (using mostly original wooden components), and the navigator’s desk with the restoration and re-fabrication of interior wooden doors is still in progress. All props have been stripped and prepared for painting plus the tail wheel assembly and main landing gear have been cleaned and repainted. Restoration of peripheral equipment such as bombs and bomb carts is also nearing completion.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose the}} concept of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> in a junctionless (JL) field-effect-transistor (FET) to {{illustrate}} the transfer characteristics of the JL FET. In this work, nanowire (NW) junctionless poly-Si thin-film transistors are used to demonstrate this conception of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction.</b> Though the dopant and the dosage of the source, of the drain, and of the channel are exactly the same in the JL FET, the transfer characteristics of the JL FET is similar to these of the conventional inversion-mode FET rather than these of a resistor, which is because of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> at the boundary of the gate and the drain in the JL FET. The <b>electrical</b> <b>junction</b> helps us to understand the JL FET, and also to explain the superior transfer characteristic of the JL FET with the gated raised S/D (Gout structure) which reveals low drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) and low breakdown voltage of ion impact ionization...|$|E
40|$|In cardiac muscle, the {{intercalated}} disk (ID) at {{the longitudinal}} cell-edges of cardiomyocytes provides as a macromolecular infrastructure that integrates mechanical and electrical coupling within the heart. Pathophysiological disturbance in composition of this complex {{is well known}} to trigger cardiac arrhythmias and pump failure. The mechanisms underlying assembly of this important cellular domain in human heart is currently unknown. We collected 18 specimens from individuals that died from non-cardiovascular causes. Age of the specimens ranged from a gestational age of 15 weeks through 11 years postnatal. Immunohistochemical labeling was performed against proteins comprising desmosomes, adherens junctions, the cardiac sodium channel and gap junctions to visualize spatiotemporal alterations in subcellular location of the proteins. Changes in spatiotemporal localization of the adherens junction proteins (N-cadherin and ZO- 1) and desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin and plakophilin- 2) were identical in all subsequent ages studied. After an initial period of diffuse and lateral labelling, all proteins were fully localized in the ID at approximately 1 year after birth. Nav 1. 5 that composes the cardiac sodium channel and the gap junction protein Cx 43 follow a similar pattern but their arrival in the ID is detected at (much) later stages (two years for Nav 1. 5 and seven years for Cx 43, respectively). Our data on developmental maturation of the ID in human heart indicate that generation of the mechanical junctions at the ID precedes that of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> with {{a significant difference in}} time. In addition arrival of the <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> (Nav 1. 5 and Cx 43) is not uniform since sodium channels localize much earlier than gap junction channels...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac scars, often dubbed ‘dead tissue’, {{are very}} much alive, with heterocellular {{activity}} contributing {{to the maintenance of}} structural and mechanical integrity following heart injury. To form a scar, non-myocytes such as fibroblasts are recruited from intra- and extra-cardiac sources. Fibroblasts perform important autocrine and paracrine signaling functions. They also establish mechanical and, as is increasingly evident, <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> with other cells. While fibroblasts were previously thought to act simply as electrical insulators, they may be electrically connected among themselves and, under some circumstances, to other cells including cardiomyocytes. A better understanding of these biophysical interactions will help to target scar structure and function, and will facilitate the development of novel therapies aimed at modifying scar properties for patient benefit...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{measured}} the single-molecule conductance of 1, n-alkanedithiol molecular bridges (n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) on a graphene substrate using {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) -formed <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions.</b> The conductance values of this homologous series ranged from 2. 3 nS (n= 12) to 53 nS (n= 4), with a decay constant β_n of 0. 40 per methylene (−CH_ 2) group. This result is explained {{by a combination of}} density functional theory (DFT) and Keldysh− Green function calculations. The obtained decay, which is much lower than the one obtained for symmetric gold junctions, is related to the weak coupling at the molecule−graphene interface and the electronic structure of graphene. As a consequence, we show that using graphene nonsymmetric junctions and appropriate anchoring groups may lead to a much-lower decay constant and more-conductive molecular junctions at longer lengths...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of individual intercellular <b>electrical</b> <b>junctions</b> has been examined in eight-cell Xenopus embryos using linear systems analysis. Morphological evidence for corresponding intercellular contacts {{has been sought}} by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The electrical investigation indicated that each cell is directly coupled {{to each of the}} other seven cells by identical resistive junctions. Scanning electron microscopy of the cell surfaces of cleaved embryos revealed protrusions from the surfaces of the cells which could mediate such intercellular connections. Light microscopy of serial sections through the embryos also showed fine processes of the cell surfaces which come into contact with several other cells. The complete intercellular connectivity suggested by these results appears to be an extension of similarly close connectivity in the two- and four-cell embryos. The possible significance of this high connectivity to morphogenesis is discussed...|$|R
