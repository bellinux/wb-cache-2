This paper proposes an interactive rendering method of <b>cloth</b> <b>fabrics</b> under environment lighting. The outgoing radiance from <b>cloth</b> <b>fabrics</b> in the microcylinder model is calculated by integrating {{the product of}} the distant environment lighting, the visibility function, the weighting function that includes shadowing/masking effects of threads, and the light scattering function of threads. The radiance calculation at each shading point of the <b>cloth</b> <b>fabrics</b> is simplified to a linear combination of triple product integrals of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function, multiplied by precomputed spherical Gaussian convolutions of the weighting function. We propose an efficient calculation method of the triple product of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function by using the gradient of signed distance function to the visibility boundary where the binary visibility changes in the angular domain of the hemisphere. Our GPU implementation enables interactive rendering of static <b>cloth</b> <b>fabrics</b> with dynamic viewpoints and lighting.

5000|$|In textile terminology, threads {{that run}} {{the length of}} the fabric (longitudinally) are warp ends. Threads running {{laterally}} from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the loom, are weft picks. Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The weave used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the <b>fabric</b> <b>cloth.</b> Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as [...]75 in. Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded.

5000|$|Until the mid {{eighteenth century}} the {{agricultural}} workers on Briercliffe would supplement their income {{by having a}} wooden handloom at home where they would weave coarse woollen and mixed <b>fabric</b> <b>cloth.</b> Between 1770 and 1820, the huge increase in the availability of cheap machine spun cotton caused many families to leave {{the land and the}} whole family would start to weave cotton. It was their main source of income. In 1830, there were 171 Briercliffe families running 606 looms. This involved 968 persons: the population of the parish had expanded from 956 to 1755. Most worked in the existing farmhouses or the newly built weavers' cottages with the loom shop above the living space. These were in Haggate, Lane Bottom and Holt Hill. Country weavers were paid by piece-rate and were vulnerable to the varying market conditions, and unlike the weavers in towns who formed combinations to organise collective industrial action, they accepted the hardship. During the final boom years of the 1820s, the spinning mill owners used the increased profits to invest in power looms which were installed in weaving sheds in or alongside the steam driven spinning mills. [...] The 1830s were a time of hardship, and the population declined to 1498. The other employment was in the stone quarries. In Lane Bottom there was 'handloom factory' owned by the Smith family of Hill End, but there and in their cottage loomshops, handloom weavers competed for ever decreasing work in the sections of weaving for which the powerloom had not been adapted. Briercliffe had the labour but did not have available capital switch its economy to factory production.|$|E

The bed bugs {{were exposed to the}} conidial spores placed soaked onto a <b>fabric</b> <b>cloth</b> for 1  h and the mortality counts were recorded daily until 14 days. Results: Mean survival times based on Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed no significant differences between all the concentrations in both the fungal isolates: T.  harzianum and A.  tubingensis. However, the evaluation of both the isolates in terms of virulence resulted in low lethal hours in all the concentrations except for the high concentration of A.  tubingensis (LT 50  =  44. 629  h) at the conidial exposure of 1  ×  106  spores/mL. Rapid mortality of the bed bugs was observed from Day 6 to Day 12, ranging from 13 % to 90 % in all three concentrations of A.  tubingensis. With reference to the T.  harzianum exposure, the concentration of 1  ×  104  spores/mL displayed a gradual increase in the percentage mortality of 90 on Day 14. Conclusions: Approaches to the bed bugs treatment should be explored in-depth using a natural biological agent like fungus especially A.  tubingensis to reduce this pest population, in order to replace chemical methods...|$|E
40|$|Upward {{flame spread}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} a thin <b>fabric</b> <b>cloth</b> consisting of 75 % cotton and 25 % fiberglass. The sample is sandwiched symmetrically with stainless steel plates with the exposed width varying between 2 to 8. 8 cm from test to test and > 1. 5 m tall. The bottom edge was ignited resulting in a symmetric two sided flame. For the narrower samples (. 5 cm), two sided flame growth would proceed until reaching some limiting value (15 - 30 cm depending on sample width). Fluctuation or instability of the flame base on one side would initially become visible and then the flame base would retreat downstream and cause extinguishment on one side. Detailed examination of the still images shows that the fuel continues to vaporize from the extinguished side due to the thermally thin nature of the fuel. But, due to the remaining inert fiberglass mesh, which acts as a flashback arrestor, the extinguished side {{was not able to}} be reignited by the remaining flame. The remaining flame would then shrink in length due to the reduced heat transfer to the solid to a shorter length. The one-sided flame will spread stably with a constant speed and a constant flame length {{to the end of the}} sample. A constant length flame implies that the pyrolysis front and the burnt out fronts move at the same speed. For the wider samples (. 7 cm), no one-sided extinction is observed. Two-sided flames spread all the way to the top of the sample. For these wider widths, the flames are still growing and have not reached their limiting length if it exists. Care was taken to minimize the amount of non-symmetries in the experimental configuration. Repeated tests show that blow-off can occur on either side of the sample. The flame growth is observed to be very symmetric during the growth phase and grew to significant length (> 10 cm) before extinction of the flame on one side. Our proposed explanation of this unusual phenomenon (i. e. stronger two]sided flame cannot exist but weaker one-sided flame can) is as follows: The observed one-sided extinction is a blow- off induced by buoyant entrainment. It is known that the flammable diffusion flame regime is bounded by quenching and blow]off limits when varying incoming air velocity. The narrowest samples tested (between 2 and 5 cm) begin within the flammable range, but as the flame grows, the buoyancy driven air velocity increases at the neighborhood of the flame base. The initially stable flame crosses the extinguishment boundary resulting in a flame blow-off. When one-side of the flame extinguishes, the remaining side shrinks due to the reduced heat transfer to the solid. This reduces the induced velocity and the flame becomes stable. It is proposed that this may have implications to upward flame growth beyond this experiment...|$|E
