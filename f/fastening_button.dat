40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the validity of}} testing <b>button</b> <b>fastening</b> ability as a measurement of hand disability in patients with myotonic dystrophy. Forty subjects with myotonic dystrophy were tested {{on their ability to}} <b>fasten</b> four shirt <b>buttons.</b> The association between <b>button</b> <b>fastening</b> ability, strength of selected proximal upper limb muscles and lateral pinch grip was determined. A significant association (F((4, 35)) = 7. 55, p <. 001) was demonstrated between proximal upper limb strength and <b>button</b> <b>fastening</b> ability, but there was no relationship with lateral pinch grip strength. Myotonia was not a factor affecting <b>button</b> <b>fastening</b> performance. Comparison of these results with those of a group of 13 subjects with other neuromuscular diseases showed <b>button</b> <b>fastening</b> disability in myotonic dystrophy could not be attributed solely to proximal upper limb weakness but is a valid measure of hand disability. A standard for normal <b>button</b> <b>fastening</b> performance was also determined...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{develop an}} {{assessment}} {{that describes the}} skeletal muscle manifestations in myotonic dystrophy subjects and then use it to quantify the presentation of skeletal muscle disability and to show change over time. Design: A quantified skeletal muscle assessment was developed and applied three times {{over a two-year period}} at intervals around 12 months. Thirty-six subjects with myotonic dystrophy and 20 subjects without neuromuscular disability were evaluated. The assessment comprised manual muscle testing of five pairs of muscles, measuring neck flexor strength with a strain gauge, respiratory function tests, power and lateral pinch grip strength, all tests of impairment, Assessment of the ability to move from sitting to standing and <b>fasten</b> <b>buttons</b> tested disability. Results: Results from subjects with myotonic dystrophy were compared to the normal data. The subjects with myotonic dystrophy were significantly weaker in proximal upper limb muscles, quadriceps, tibialis anterior muscles and neck flexor muscles as well as power and lateral pinch grips. There was also significant reduction in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Significant disability was seen in the myotonics in moving from sitting to standing and in <b>fastening</b> <b>buttons,</b> Over the two-year study period proximal upper limb and lower limb muscle strength, FVC and sit-to-stand ability declined significantly. Power grip declined but lateral pinch grip and FEV 1 improved significantly. <b>Button</b> <b>fastening</b> ability improved significantly. Conclusion: The test developed was shown to be reliable and sensitive to the change in skeletal muscle manifestations in subjects with myotonic dystrophy who were shown to be significantly weaker than normal subjects...|$|R

50|$|The fact {{which has}} {{affected}} the makers of wire staples for shoe manufacturing is the invention of a machine which, by its simplicity, superior capabilities, its cheapness and accuracy, has practically driven all other methods of <b>fastening</b> <b>buttons</b> to shoes out of use. The older and clumsier methods, on the allegations of the bill, have been completely superseded. From this invention there results a large market for wire staples, adapted in size and shape to use with the new mechanism, and a second consequence is the complete cessation of the demand for button fasteners not adapted {{to be used with}} complainant's machine.|$|R

Six-on-two and six-on-one (as shown in the picture on the right) are the common button stances, but others exist.

5000|$|Button-Fastener had patents on {{machines}} for <b>fastening</b> <b>buttons</b> to high-button shoes with staples. This was a labor-intensive operation formerly done by hand at higher cost. The invention saved considerable labor {{in making the}} shoes, although commercially exploiting the invention presented a marketing problem. The machines were worth much more to high-volume users than to low-volume users, since the labor-saving benefits were directly proportional {{to the number of}} shoes on which the machines <b>fastened</b> <b>buttons.</b> But if Button-Fastener tried to sell the machines at different prices to the different users, there would be problems. First, it would be difficult or impossible to determine in advance of sale how intensively each shoe manufacturer would use the machines. Second, if the machines were sold cheaply to low-volume users, it would have been difficult or impossible to prevent those buyers from reselling their machines to those manufacturers that [...] "should" [...] pay a high price. But Button-Fastener came up with a business model that solved the problem. It sold the machines subject to a condition spelled out in a plate fastened to each machine, that the machine must use only the staples that Button-Fastener made and sold. As it told the court in its legal papers, [...] "it makes nothing in the sale of its machines, and ... the entire profits of its business are made in the sale of staples." [...] In effect, the tie-in operated as a counter on the machines, counting the number of uses made of the invention. An above-market price for the staples provided a patent royalty proportional to use of the invention.|$|R

Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata {{regularly}} and admitted patients {{to the university}} hospital for detailed examinations. A more complete picture of the symptoms exhibited by patients was gradually uncovered. The disease developed without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a loss of sensation and numbness in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or <b>fasten</b> <b>buttons.</b> They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch, and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing, and swallowing. In general, these symptoms deteriorated and were followed by severe convulsions, coma, and eventually death.

She shows them the difference between paintings that merely demonstrate craft and paintings that evoke feeling as well. She struggles to paint again by overcoming her physical limitations as well as her own artistic difficulties. She finally creates a good work of art and sets it aside to dry. She has, incidentally, professed a complete disdain for the spoken and printed word. She insists that artistically rendered images are the only worthwhile media for expressing [...] "truth".|$|R
