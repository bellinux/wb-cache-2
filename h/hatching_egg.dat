5000|$|Broiler breeder farms raise {{parent stock}} which produce fertilized eggs. A broiler <b>hatching</b> <b>egg</b> is never sold at stores {{and is not}} meant for human consumption. The males and females are {{separate}} genetic lines or breeds. The chicks they produce will therefore be hybrids or 'crosses'. Since the birds are bred mainly for efficient meat production, producing eggs can be a challenge. In Canada, the average producer houses 15,000 birds that begin laying hatching eggs at 26 weeks of age. Each bird will lay about 150 hatching eggs for the next 34 to 36 weeks. This cycle is then repeated when the producer puts another flock of 26 week-old birds into his barns {{to begin the process}} again. As a general rule, each farmer produces enough broiler hatching eggs to supply chicks for 8 chicken producers. (Other sources indicate a parent hen will lay about 180 eggs in a 40-week production period.) ...|$|E

They chose the latter and stole the as-yet-unhatched Lily from Maleficent; Maleficent was weak from giving birth/laying the egg and was consequently unable to defend herself or her child.

50|$|The {{existing}} and defined biosimilar pathway, {{taking into consideration}} the complexity of biologics and its follow-on products, is neither applicable for NBCDs and its similars. Since NBCDs are by definition not biologicals but are rather synthetic. However, basic principles {{can be used for}} an NBCD similar evaluation. Since the NBCD follow-on versions are not identical but only similar to the originator product, they are never the same as it is with generic small molecule products. NBCDs and their similars containing nanoparticulate can also be referred to as nanosimilars (see figure 1). A stepwise quality, non-clinical and clinical approach is suggested for market approval of NBCD nanosimilars and to show comparability. There is a lack of non-clinical models to test such products like e.g. the rodent approach addressed by EMA in their reference paper for the NBCDs iron sucrose and its similars. Recently, the <b>hatching</b> <b>egg</b> model was used as an alternative model to study time-dependent iron concentrations in heart and liver avian tissues for various intravenous iron complexes applied in equimolar doses. Such models need in-depth evaluation and validation to demonstrate robustness and to further define potential use in an evaluation and comparison testing. When evaluated similar enough, the challenge then still is to define to either use them as a therapeutic alternative or as an equivalent product and if at the end the follow-on version can substitute the reference product or can be interchanged which also needs head-to-head comparisons in patients to prove therapeutic equivalence and comparable safety.|$|E

At home that night his co-worker Allan brings in a stone tablet they interpret as a map of an island in a lake, though they can't translate all of it. He decides to spend the summer vacation doing fieldwork and brings his children Ragnhild and Brage with him. When Sigurd et al. land in Finnmark they meet up with Allan's field partner Elisabeth and hired guide Leif and have to hike for days, crossing the old WWII boundary with Russia. They make a raft and get over to the small island [...] "Eye of Odin" [...] without incident. The party splits up, the children wandering off in boredom and exploration. Ragnhild finds more Russian leftovers and Brage finds a cave. The party all descends into the cave and start finding Viking relics. Brage finds an interesting rock in the shallow water and stows it in his rucksack for later. Leif is unimpressed with Sigurd's plan to turn the pieces over to a museum in Oslo and takes them at gunpoint, stranding the rest in the cave. As he is paddling back across the lake in the party's raft he gets taken from below by an un-visaged thing. Elisabeth climbs up the cave wall and re-establishes the ropes so the others can escape the cave too. They sleep in a bunker that Ragnhild found only for the men to re-descend the cave to look for more pieces. They discover the cave isn't a hidey hole for treasure but a graveyard for a giant pebble-skinned sea serpent that the Vikings likely used as a format for their dragon-prowed ships. This causes them to reassess their earlier opinion, that the stone tablet is not in fact a map but a warning. Meanwhile, Brage's [...] "rock" [...] is {{shown to be a}} <b>hatching</b> <b>egg</b> for the same sea serpent family. In fright they capture it in an old metal box and latch it in. The infant serpent's squeals transmit down the bunker's cable into the water and alert the adult serpent who hauls the bunker into the lake, {{trying to get to the}} baby. Elisabeth and the children escape out the rear with some assistance, the box inadvertently coming with them. Allan finds the box as he gathers tools for their escape from the island and unfortunately decides to bring it along as the proof he needs after six years of field work, hiding the fact from the rest of the group. While they shoot one sea serpent in order to escape the lake, four more surface and follow the infant's sounds. They find that the serpents are not exclusively water bound as they are followed onto dry land. The party attempts to escape through an underground bunker system by starting the faulty electrical system and find a ceiling door out. Allan is first through the door but then starts to act like the late Leif, demanding that the box be handed up to him before he passes down the rope. Before this comes to pass however, he is taken by the serpents and one crashes down into the bunker tunnels to continue the search. The children are able to run but Elisabeth and Sigurd are knocked out cold. He comes to as the serpent is cornering his children and figures to try and return the baby serpent. The sound of the baby's squeals distracts the adult from the children and it accepts the infant serpent from Sigurd, slithering off without further harm. The remaining party of four are able to leave and travel back home without further incident.|$|E

An important part of hatchery sanitation starts with the sanitation of <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs.</b> These eggs are the major source of organic material entering the hatchery and may harbor pathogenic organisms. Egg sanitation is also critical to the production of high quality day-old broiler chicks. Since the discontinuation of the use of formaldehyde fumigation to sanitize <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs,</b> a great deal of research has been conducted to find a suitable replacement. The germicidal effects of ultraviolet (UV) light (radiation) of wavelength 254 nm (UV-C) is well documented. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective at reducing bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds and fungi on a variety of substances and surfaces including eggshells. Therefore, studies were conducted to test the effects of UV irradiation on microbial populations on eggshells and the hatchability of broiler <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs.</b> High intensity UV light (> 14 mW/cm?) was utilized to sanitize incubator flats of 42 <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> in an enclosed cabinet. Laboratory trials were first conducted with broiler <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> to access the effects of UV light on the conductance of the treated eggs and to screen for any detrimental effects on embryo viability or hatchability. No significant differences were found for eggshell conductance, embryo mortality, <b>hatch</b> of fertile <b>eggs</b> (HFE) or internal microbial contamination of eggs. Larger field studies were then conducted at commercial broiler breeder facilities to evaluate the effects of UV irradiation in a commercial setting. Hatchability of UV-treated eggs was significantly reduced in field trial 1, but was significantly improved in trial 2. Microbial contamination of dead embryos and meconium samples from day-old chicks were also evaluated. Significant reductions in numbers of contaminated eggs for UV-treated eggs compared to controls were observed in various trials. It is concluded that UV irradiation of <b>hatching</b> <b>eggs</b> may be a feasible alternative to formaldehyde fumigation...|$|R
