50|$|Premature {{chromosome}} condensation (PCC), {{also known}} as premature mitosis, occurs in eukaryotic organisms when mitotic cells fuse with interphase cells. Chromatin, a substance that contains genetic material such as DNA, is normally found in a loose bundle inside a cell's nucleus. During the prophase of mitosis, the chromatin in a cell compacts to form condensed chromosomes; this condensation is required {{in order for the}} cell to divide properly. While mitotic cells have condensed chromosomes, interphase cells do not. PCC results when an <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> fuses with a mitotic cell, causing the <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> to produce condensed chromosomes prematurely.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{animal and plant}} systems support the 'long axis rule'. The studied systems include the mouse embryo, Drosophila epithelium, Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers [...] and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).The {{mechanism}} of the 'long axis rule' relies on <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> long axis sensing. However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on {{the orientation of the}} cell division is made by the spindle apparatus. The spindle apparatus then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> long axis. The cell then divides along the spindle apparatus orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ) participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in Drosophila melanogaster and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{orientation}} of cell division along the long {{axis of the}} <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> [...] the century-old Hertwig's rule [...] has profound roles in tissue proliferation, morphogenesis, architecture and mechanics. In epithelial tissues, {{the shape of the}} <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> is influenced by cell adhesion, mechanical stress, neighbour topology, and planar polarity pathways. At mitosis, epithelial cells usually adopt a rounded shape to ensure faithful chromosome segregation and to promote morphogenesis. The mechanisms underlying <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> shape sensing in tissues are therefore unknown. Here we show that in Drosophila epithelia, tricellular junctions (TCJs) localize force generators, pulling on astral microtubules and orienting cell division via the Dynein-associated protein Mud independently of the classical Pins/Gαi pathway. Moreover, as cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks, encoding information about <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. Finally, experimental and simulation data show that shape and mechanical strain sensing by the TCJs emerge from a general geometric property of TCJ distributions in epithelial tissues. Thus, in addition to their function as epithelial barrier structures, TCJs serve as polarity cues promoting geometry and mechanical sensing in epithelial tissues...|$|E

40|$|Six patients, five {{with acute}} myeloid leukemia (AML) and one with a myelodysplastic {{syndrome}} (MDS), {{were found to have}} monosomy 7 by conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis. Repetitive DNA sequences from the heterochromatic region of human chromosomes 1 and 7 were used as probes for in situ hybridization experiments on <b>interphase</b> <b>cells</b> of these patients. A double hybridization protocol was used to reveal the particular chromosomes as distinct spots or clusters of signals within interphase nuclei. The chromosome 1 sequence served as an internal control. Simultaneous detection of the sequences showed the presence of two normal number 1 chromosomes and a missing 7 chromosome from individual cells. While cytogenetic preparations showed only - 7 metaphases in 3 AML and 1 MDS patients, in situ hybridization of <b>interphase</b> <b>cells</b> showed many normal cells as well as the presence of - 7 in fully mature granulocytes.

40|$|Heat {{denaturation}} of DNA in situ, in unbroken cells, was {{studied in}} relation to the cell cycle. DNA in metaphase cells denatured at lower temperatures (8 ~ 176 lower) than DNA in <b>interphase</b> <b>cells.</b> Among <b>interphase</b> <b>cells,</b> small differences between G 1, S, and G 2 cells were observed at temperatures above 90 ~ The difference between metaphase and <b>interphase</b> <b>cells</b> increased after short pretreatment with formaldehyde, decreased when cells were heated in the presence of 1 mM MgCI 2, and was abolished by cell pretreatment with 0. 5 N HC 1.

These in situ results remain in contrast to the published data showing no difference in DNA denaturation in chromatin isolated from <b>interphase</b> and metaphase <b>cells.</b> It is likely that factors exist which influence the stability of DNA in situ are associated with the super-structural organization of chromatin in intact nuclei and which are lost during chromatin isolation and solubilization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} {{allows the}} enumeration of chromosomal abnormalities in <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei. This process is called dot counting. To estimate the distribution of chromosomes per cell, {{a large number of}} cells have to be analysed, particularly when the frequency of aberrant cells is low. Automation of dot counting is desirable because manual counting is tedious, fatiguing, and time consuming. We have developed a completely automated fluorescence microscope system that counts fluorescent hybridization dots for one probe in <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei. This system works with two fluorescent dyes—one for the DNA hybridization dots and one for the cell nucleus. A fully automated scanning procedure has been used for the image acquisition. After an image is acquired it has to be analysed in order to find the nuclei and to detect the dots. This article focuses upon the dot detection procedure. Three different algorithms are presented. The problems of ‘overlapping ’ dots and split dots are discussed. The automated dot counter has been tested on a number of normal specimens where DAPI was used for the nucleus counter stain and a centromeric probe was used to mark the chromosome 12. The slides contained lymphocytes from cultured blood. The performance of the different algorithms has been evaluated and compared with manually obtained results.

Cell-free protein synthesis and RNA polymcrase activity were also greatly depressed in extracts of metaphasc cells.

40|$|The {{rod-shaped}} fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which undergoes {{cycles of}} monopolar-to-bipolar tip growth, {{is an attractive}} organism for studying cell-cycle regulation of polarity establishment. While previous research has described factors mediating this process from <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> tips, we found that division site signaling also impacts the re-establishment of bipolar cell growth in the ensuing cell cycle. Complete loss or targeted disruption of the non-essential cytokinesis protein Fic 1 at the division site, but not at <b>interphase</b> <b>cell</b> tips, resulted in many cells failing to grow at new ends created by cell division. This appeared due to faulty disassembly and abnormal persistence of the cell division machinery at new ends of fic 1 D cells. Moreover, additional mutants defective {{in the final stages}} of cytokinesis exhibited analogous growth polarity defects, supporting that robust completion of cell division contributes to new end-growth competency. To test this model, we genetically manipulated S. pombe cells to undergo new end take-off immediately after cell division. Intriguingly, such cells elongated constitutively at new ends unless cytokinesis was perturbed. Thus, cell division imposes constraints that partially override positive controls on growth. We posit that such constraints facilitate invasive fungal growth, as cytokinesis mutants displaying bipolar growth defects formed numerous pseudohyphae. Collectively, these data highlight a role for previous cell cycles in defining a cell’s capacity to polarize at specific sites, and they additionally provide insight into how a unicellular yeast can transition into a quasi-multicellular state...|$|E
