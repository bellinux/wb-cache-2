2500|$|There are 627 flora species {{identified}} by Serra and Carvalho (1989) as under pressure and considered endangered, which included two medicinal plants: tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum) and sundew (Drosera rotundifolia). Based on the protection list of botanical species, and UICN categories: 18 are considered in risk of extinction, 17 are vulnerable and [...] one is rare. They also identified two species as extinct {{within the park}} boundaries: a geranium (Geranium lanuginosum) and <b>fragrant</b> <b>orchid</b> (Gymnadenia conopsea). There are three endemic species. Those factors that have been identified that threaten these habitats include: natural and manmade fires, use of forest for fuel wood and agricultural use of habitats.|$|E

50|$|The Fuqua Orchid Center {{is home to}} {{the largest}} {{collection}} of species orchids on permanent display in the U.S. and hosts a wintertime display known as Orchid Daze. Its unique Tropical High Elevation House provides the correct habitat for montane orchids and companion plants from around the equator at elevations of 6,000 to 10,000 feet. An Air Washer System, technology adapted from the textile industry, was combined with traditional greenhouse heating and cooling to create this environment and allows rare orchids to thrive.

40|$|Patterns of ploidy {{variation}} among {{and within}} populations can provide valuable {{insights into the}} evolutionary mechanisms shaping the dynamics of plant systems showing ploidy diversity. Whereas data on majority ploidies are, by definition, often sufficiently extensive, much less {{is known about the}} incidence and evolutionary role of minority cytotypes. Ploidy and proportions of endoreplicated genome were determined using DAPI (4, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole) flow cytometry in 6150 Gymnadenia plants (<b>fragrant</b> <b>orchids)</b> collected from 141 populations in 17 European countries. All widely recognized European species, and several taxa of less certain taxonomic status were sampled within Gymnadenia conopsea sensu lato. Most Gymnadenia populations were taxonomically and/or ploidy heterogeneous. Two majority (2 x and 4 x) and three minority (3 x, 5 x and 6 x) cytotypes were identified. Evolution largely proceeded at the diploid level, whereas tetraploids were much more geographically and taxonomically restricted. Although minority ploidies constituted 2 of the individuals sampled, they were found in 35 of populations across the entire area investigated. The amount of nuclear DNA, together with the level of progressively partial endoreplication, separated all Gymnadenia species currently widely recognized in Europe. Despite their low frequency, minority cytotypes substantially increase intraspecific and intrapopulation ploidy diversity estimates for <b>fragrant</b> <b>orchids.</b> The cytogenetic structure of Gymnadenia populations is remarkably dynamic and shaped by multiple evolutionary mechanisms, including both the ongoing production of unreduced gametes and heteroploid hybridization. Overall, {{it is likely that the}} level of ploidy heterogeneity experienced by most plant species/populations is currently underestimated; intensive sampling is necessary to obtain a holistic picture...|$|R

50|$|Coullemelle is {{situated}} on the D109 and D188 crossroads, some 19 mi south of Amiens. It is located close to the Paris meridian {{at the edge of}} the Amiens plateau and of the Beauvaisis. Its territory, 954 hectares wide, is in contact with the lands of the neighboring villages of Grivesnes, Cantigny, Villers-Tournelle, Rocquencourt, Quiry-le-Sec and Esclainvillers. Its soil dates from the Tertiary. Under a layer of silt, one finds argillaceous chalk and flints. The plateau slopes gently to the north-east from 160 meters at a place called Le Crocq down to 120 meters in the Coullemelle and Grivesnes valleys. Located 80 kilometers from the sea, the village benefits from a temperate and healthy climate. At the North exit of the Coullemelle wood lies a larris, that is a zone of lawn and poor lands, most interesting for geologists and botanists. The dry valleys of Simie, Langueron, mont Foucart and Coullemelle, oriented N.E.-S.W., ties cuts through the chalky plateau that descends into the dry ravine occupied by trees but also by calcicole lawns. One may find there lady <b>orchids,</b> <b>fragrant</b> <b>orchids,</b> red epacris, superb violet anemone that are exceptional in France, as well as very rare cruciate anemones. The larris, unsuited to culture and which served as a pasture for sheep, are unfortunately more and more overgrown with underbrush.|$|R
50|$|The {{cultural}} landscape formed by mankind {{over the centuries}} also has {{a great variety of}} habitats and plants however, today, the extensive grassland areas are amongst the most threatened and heavily cultivated habitats. It is on the semi-arid grasslands and juniper heaths that the silver thistle, symbol of the Rhön region, grows, alongside gentians, pasque flowers and wood anemones, as well as orchids like the early purple, <b>fragrant</b> and fly <b>orchids.</b> Rarer flowers include the various bee orchids and the military, lady, burnt, green-winged, man, pyramidal, frog and lizard orchids. Along the southern fringes of the Rhön, on the so-called slopes of steppe heathland (Steppenheidenhängen) grow warmth-loving plants such as white rock-rose, erect clematis and honewort.|$|R
5000|$|Utcubamba (hispanicized spelling), in Quechua Utkhupampa (utkhu cotton, pampa a large plain, [...] "cotton plain"), is one {{of seven}} provinces of the Amazonas Region, Peru. It was created by Law#-23843 on May 30, 1984. Its capital is Bagua Grande and its {{principal}} attraction is the Tourist Corridor of Utcubamba where the valley becomes notably closer forming [...] "the canyon of Utcubamba". These conditions modify the climate in a substantial way and create a radical ecological shift.

50|$|Caburn {{is unusual}} within the South Downs {{for having a}} south-facing scarp slope. The site has the largest British {{population}} of burnt-tip orchid. There is also the rare small-leaved sweet-briar, and the typical <b>fragrant</b> and pyramidal <b>orchids.</b> Invertebrates include Adonis and chalkhill blue butterflies and the scarce forester moth. Populations of stonechats live in scrubby bushes such as gorse near the golf club and in the valley below, along with other song birds such as blue tits. Herring gulls and carrion crows often fly overhead and hundreds of domestic sheep graze the area. There is a sheltered cave with a water trough where lost sheep can rest safely if they stray away from the flock on a dark night when the farmer is rounding up the animals.|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] As the {{economic}} crisis swept across Asia in 1997, gutting purchasing power in many countries, one potential silver lining seemed possible: a drop in demand for rhino and tiger parts, tortoises, wild <b>orchids,</b> <b>fragrant</b> woods, and other increasingly rare products of the region's forests. Though threatened with extinction, these and many other plants and animals, esteemed as medicinal marvels or status symbols, have fueled a vigorous trade buoyed by rising regional prosperity and market globalization. Today, contrary to expectation, the commerce in wild species and their products has increased substantially. The economic collapse that has been felt most keenly in Southeast Asia, combined with the continued relative prosperity of China and strong American and European economies, stimulates the flow of resources out of Southeast Asia and into East Asia and the West. Now, unexpectedly, it is increasing personal hardship that may pose {{the greatest threat to}} already endangered species and habitats, as cash-needy citizens turn to their forests for the income that their regular jobs and crops no longer provide.
