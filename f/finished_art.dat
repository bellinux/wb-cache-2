5|$|The Washington Park {{neighborhood}} {{has been the}} setting for works of popular literature. James T. Farrell's Studs Lonigan trilogy is set in Washington Park. In Richard Wright's novel Native Son, Bigger Thomas drives the drunken Jan Erlone and Mary Dalton around Washington Park, as the two embrace. In addition to hosting the DuSable Museum, the park hosts Fountain of Time, the world's earliest concrete <b>finished</b> <b>art</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Time {{is in the}} Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park {{community}} area on Chicago's South Side, {{near the}} Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time {{is considered to be}} the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first <b>finished</b> <b>art</b> piece to be made of any type of concrete.|$|E

25|$|The Western {{tradition}} of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is {{widely seen as}} producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's David. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and {{the emphasis on the}} depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as <b>finished</b> <b>art</b> works.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the cover art, the team {{collaborated with the}} English studio Ilovedust. They {{wanted it to be}} easily recognized and stand out from the cover art of other video games in stores. They also wanted it to represent the game's characteristics: [...] "intensity", [...] "fun in the end times" [...] in a [...] "dynamic and vibrant world". There were three different iterations of the cover art, with major changes made to the game's protagonist throughout its development, as the studio struggled with the protagonist's portrayal. Insomniac was ultimately satisfied with Ilovedust's <b>finished</b> <b>art</b> design.|$|E
2500|$|Schulz {{decided to}} produce {{all aspects of}} the strip himself from the script to the <b>finished</b> <b>art</b> and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of Peanuts. Thus, the strip was able to be {{presented}} with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing [...] "its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions." [...] Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: [...] "This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business." ...|$|E

2500|$|She would {{contribute}} coloring across the company's line, including its war comics and its celebrated but notoriously graphic horror comics, and also {{worked on the}} comics' production end, as well as [...] "doing little touch ups and stuff" [...] on the art.
