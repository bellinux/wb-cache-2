50|$|Alkylation of 2-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-one with glycidol affords <b>diproqualone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples of quinazolinones include cloroqualone, <b>diproqualone,</b> {{etaqualone}} (Aolan, Athinazone, Ethinazone), mebroqualone, mecloqualone (Nubarene, Casfen), and methaqualone (Quaalude).|$|E
50|$|<b>Diproqualone</b> is {{the only}} {{analogue}} of methaqualone that is still in widespread clinical use, due to its useful anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects {{in addition to the}} sedative and anxiolytic actions common to other drugs of this class. There are still some concerns about the potential of <b>diproqualone</b> for abuse and overdose, and so it is not sold as a pure drug but only as the camphosulfonate salt in combination mixtures with other medicines such as ethenzamide.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{allosteric}} modulators: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, certain carbamates (ex. carisoprodol, meprobamate, lorbamate), thienodiazepines, ethanol (alcohol), etomidate, glutethimide, kavalactones, meprobamate, quinazolinones (ex. methaqualone, etaqualone, <b>diproqualone),</b> neuroactive steroids, niacin/niacinamide, nonbenzodiazepines (ex. zolpidem, eszopiclone), propofol, stiripentol, theanine, valerenic acid, volatile/inhaled anesthetics, and lanthanum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diproqualone</b> is a quinazolinone class GABAergic {{and is an}} {{analogue}} of methaqualone {{developed in}} the late 1950s by a team at Nogentaise de Produits Chimique. It was marketed primarily in France and some other European countries. It has sedative, anxiolytic, antihistamine and analgesic properties, resulting from its agonist activity at the Î² subtype of the GABAa receptor, antagonist activity at all histamine receptors, inhibition of thecyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, and possibly its agonist activity at both the sigma-1 receptor and sigma-2 receptor (the function of these receptors and their clinical relevance {{has not yet been}} determined). <b>Diproqualone</b> is used primarily for the treatment of inflammatory pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis,1 and more rarely for treating insomnia, anxiety and neuralgia.|$|E
