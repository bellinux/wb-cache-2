5|$|The Červená hora {{image was}} {{especially}} valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110°, starting 51° above the southern horizon, passing the zenith just 1° westward and disappearing only 19° above the northern horizon (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also {{equipped with a}} rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the fireball, allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4°, the fireball's angular velocity was lower than {{the resolution of the}} instrument. The Svratouch <b>image</b> <b>recorded</b> the trajectory only for about 15°, beginning at 30° above the northwest horizon, and the pictured fireball was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.|$|E
500|$|One {{image of}} spots is {{insufficient}} to reconstruct the whole crystal; it represents only a small slice of the full Fourier transform. To collect all the necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step-by-step through 180°, with an <b>image</b> <b>recorded</b> at every step; actually, slightly more than 180° is required to cover reciprocal space, due to the curvature of the Ewald sphere. However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as 90° or 45° may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least once, to avoid developing a [...] "blind spot" [...] in reciprocal space close to the rotation axis. It is customary to rock the crystal slightly (by 0.5–2°) to catch a broader region of reciprocal space.|$|E

40|$|DE 102007009828 A 1 UPAB: 20080930 NOVELTY - The <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> device has a {{superimposing}} device (4), a visibility aiding {{device for}} generating image signals. A video spectacle (2) has a transparent visual element (3), where the image signal is {{received by the}} video spectacle. The image signal is superimposed on the visual element as an optical image. The image signal {{of one of the}} <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> device and signal derived from the <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> device, is transmitted to the superimposing device as the image signal by a signal transmission device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a tool element, particularly a soldering iron. USE - <b>Image</b> <b>recording</b> device for use in a vacuum gripper, for use in a robot with a robot arm, for an <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> method, for soldering process, for produced parts or workpieces, particularly for printed circuit board, for manual assembly requirements in frames, for adjustment and readjustment of robot arms (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> device has a superimposing device, a visibility aiding device for generating image signals, where the video spectacle has a transparent visual element, where the image signal is received by the video spectacle, thus ensures a image documentation with coupling of the image signal processing device with a storage medium...|$|R

50|$|Adjusting the slit to only allow {{electrons}} {{which have}} lost a specific amount of energy {{can be used to}} obtain elementally sensitive images. As the ionisation signal is often significantly smaller than the background signal, it is normally necessary to obtain more than one image at varying energies to remove the background effect. The simplest method is known as the jump ratio technique, where an <b>image</b> <b>recorded</b> using electrons at the energy of the maximum of the absorption peak caused by a particular inner shell ionisation is divided by an <b>image</b> <b>recorded</b> just before the ionisation energy. It is often necessary to cross-correlate the images to compensate for relative drift of the sample between the two images.|$|E

40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{provided}} for recording density {{changes in a}} flow field surrounding a moving object. A mask having an aperture for regulating the passage of images is {{placed in front of}} an <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> medium. An optical system is placed in front of the mask. A transition having a light field-of-view and a dark field-of-view is located beyond the test object. The optical system focuses an image of the transition at the mask such that the aperture causes a band of light to be defined on the <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> medium. The optical system further focuses an image of the object through the aperture of the mask so that the image of the object appears on the <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> medium. Relative motion is minimized between the mask and the transition. Relative motion is also minimized between the <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> medium and the image of the object. In this way, the image of the object and density changes in a flow field surrounding the object are <b>recorded</b> on the <b>image</b> <b>recording</b> medium when the object crosses the transition in front of the optical system...|$|R
