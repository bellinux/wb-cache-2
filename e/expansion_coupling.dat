40|$|We {{determine}} the effective dynamics for a spinless charged particle, {{in the presence}} of electromagnetic fields, constrained to a space curve. We employ the thin-layer procedure and a perturbative expansion for the Schrödinger equation is derived.

However, there is always a gauge transformation that allows decouple the dynamics. We find that the effective Schrödinger equation in the curve contains an induced Zeeman coupling, independent of the curvature and torsion, which has not been previously reported. This coupling is characteristic of reducing the dimension by two and allows to identify an induced magnetic moment. Comment: 7 pages. To be published in Europhysics Letter...|$|R

Practical performance of the "k"-centres FC method is demonstrated through simulation studies and data applications including growth curve and gene expression profile data.

For realistic cold atomic gas experiments, we show that the phase diagram of the quasi- 2 D system can be characterized using two 2 D scattering parameters: the scattering length and the effective range.

Using a low-density <b>expansion</b> <b>coupled</b> with a variational approach, we investigate the fate of such trimers in the many-body system as the attractive interactions are decreased (or, conversely, as the density of particles is increased).

I then use phylogeographic patterns and variation in life history characteristics between P. ochraceus and P. brevispinus to test predictions about selection acting on bindin divergence among conspecific populations. I discover that divergence in the repetitive bindin domain structure may be partly influenced by concerted evolution within species.

This radical change in circumstances led to rethinking of the foundations of human organization and, in particular, the industrial economy and the economic theory behind it.
