60|$|Meanwhile the gossips, {{like the}} sibyls after {{consulting}} their leaves, arranged and combined the information of the evening, which flew next morning through a hundred channels, {{and in a}} hundred varieties, through the world of Fairport. Many, strange, and inconsistent, were the rumours to which their communications and conjectures gave rise. Some said Tennant and Co. were broken, and that all their bills had come back protested--others that they had got a great contract from Government, and letters from the principal merchants at Glasgow, desiring to have shares upon a premium. One report stated, that Lieutenant Taffril had acknowledged a private marriage with Jenny Caxon--another, that he had sent her a letter upbraiding her with the lowness of her birth and education, and bidding her an eternal adieu. It was generally rumoured that Sir Arthur Wardour's affairs had fallen into irretrievable confusion, and this report was only doubted by the wise, because it was traced to Mrs. Mailsetter's shop,--a source more famous for the circulation of news than for their accuracy. But all agreed that a packet from the Secretary of State's office, had arrived, directed for Mr. Lovel, {{and that it had}} been forwarded by an orderly dragoon, despatched from the head-quarters at Edinburgh, who had galloped through Fairport without stopping, except just to inquire the way to Monkbarns. The reason of such an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>mission</b> to a very peaceful and retired individual, was variously explained. Some said Lovel was an emigrant noble, summoned to head an insurrection that had broken out in La Vende'e--others that he was a spy--others that he was a general officer, who was visiting the coast privately--others that he was a prince of the blood, who was travelling incognito.|$|E

50|$|His {{writings}} {{were not}} well {{received by the}} authoritarian cantonal government under Landamano Giovanni Battista Quadri, but his ideas were shared {{by a majority of}} the Ticino's legislative body, and they helped effectuate a constitutional reform and change of government. In the following years of reform, Franscini held several cantonal political offices: As a state secretary, from 1830 to 1837 and from 1845 to 1847, he prepared resolutions and laws for the cantonal government. He himself was an elected member of this government between 1837 and 1845, and again between 1847 and 1848. Franscini also represented the canton of Ticino at the Tagsatzung in 1841, 1843, 1845, and 1846. During his various tenures of office, Franscini was frequently sent on <b>extraordinary</b> <b>missions,</b> such as relief and calming missions in the Mendrisiotto during a cholera epidemic in 1836, and again during the famine of 1847. That same year he helped establish the armed defense in the Ticino to meet an unruly retreat of the Sonderbund's troops who were losing the War of the Sonderbund. On a national level, he attended intercantonal conferences on trade, customs, and postal services, and, in 1847, received a mandate to mitigate a peaceful change to liberal order in the Valais after its defeat in the War of the Sonderbund. The Tagsatzung also sent him on a fact-finding mission to Naples, where Swiss mercenaries had been accused of atrocious behavior while suppressing uprisings preceding the revolutions of 1848.|$|R

5000|$|Lysistrata ( [...] or Attic Greek: , Lysistrátē, [...] "Army Disbander") is {{a comedy}} by Aristophanes. Originally {{performed}} in classical Athens in 411 BCE, it is a comic {{account of a}} woman's <b>extraordinary</b> <b>mission</b> to end the Peloponnesian War by denying all {{the men of the}} land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace—a strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career. It was produced in the same year as the Thesmophoriazusae, another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition. At this time, Greek theatre was a profound form of entertainment, which was extremely popular for all audiences as it addressed political issues relevant to that time.|$|E

A study of these policy decisions leads to the conclusion that a renewed commitment to Africa and to the healing of South Africa as well as a new missional paradigm are paving the way for a focus on local communities.

40|$|The initial 72 {{hours after}} a {{large-scale}} crisis are critical in terms of preserving life and property, {{and the private sector}} and its critical infrastructure are often called upon to assist government organizations in such events. However, little research explores the unique circumstances surrounding the relationship between public-private partnerships and community resilience in strategic communities including military installations and ports. Using Bryson, Crosby, and Stone 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of cross-sector collaboration, the purpose of this grounded theory study was to develop a theory of private sector engagement and collaboration with military base and port community leaders in response to large scale crises. Data were collected through interviews with 43 public, private, and military sector leaders in six strategic communities of the East, Gulf, and West coasts. Data from ReadyCommunities Partnership symposia summaries were also considered. Data were coded and analyzed using Eisenhardt 2 ̆ 7 s grounded theory procedures. Findings resulted in the identification of emergent themes from which the mutual mission theory emerged. This theory acknowledges the key elements of tension between private sector incentives to collaborate and the undercurrent of sector-silo bias. Further, {{the findings of this study}} support collaboration through policy with incentives to institutionalize <b>extraordinary</b> community-based mutual <b>missions</b> while overcoming sector-silo bias. Positive social change may be achieved through utilization of the applied mutual mission theory by military base and port community leaders in order to better leverage private sector engagement in response to national crises...|$|R
40|$|Research objectves: To {{study the}} forms and means of fiscal support for the travel and {{accommodation}} of the Horde’s ambassadors and officials in the territory of subordinate peoples (with the example of Russian principalities). Research materials: A diverse group of written historical sources of Russian, Western European, Persian, Mongolian, Chinese origin (annals and acts), historical materials, source studies, and archaeological research. Results and novelty of the research: Keeping local authorities informed of imperial orders, clarification of tax, and military duties required constant interaction of management services at various levels. Accommodating the stays of “strong ambassadors”, basqaqs, “chislenniks”, darugachis and other officials of the Horde’s administrative apparatus was provided {{at the expense of}} the treasury and required financial expenses. The subjugated, tax-paying population and the local administration were obliged to maintain these categories of officials, as noted by a Chinese official, Xu Ting. Juwayni designated such charges, which included the provision of military units, with the term “tuzga”. In another place, the Persian author separated the tuzga from the provision of troops. Describing the return from the Khagan of Khorasan ruler, Amir Korguz, Juwayni stressed that the tuzga was prepared for him and yarlyks were read out only after that. Hence, in the 1250 s, the charges for the travel and accommodation of the Horde’s ambassadors and officials was designated as “tuzga”. It included forage, food, utensils and other support for the movement of an official (equipment, shelter/tents). During such receptions, the will of the supreme ruler was conveyed to the local subordinate rulers (yarliks were read and the yasas proclaimed). Apparently, this permanent tax gradually turned into an extraordinary one or the obligation to pay it was assigned to special categories of the taxable population. However, <b>extraordinary,</b> unplanned embassy <b>missions</b> caused the need to collect additional funds. Evidence in sources of Russian origin suggest that such a charge was equal to one percent of the total amount of the annual tribute...|$|R
