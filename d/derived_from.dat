5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E

5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E

5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E

The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E
5|$|People from Birmingham {{are called}} Brummies, a term <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the city's {{nickname}} of Brum.
