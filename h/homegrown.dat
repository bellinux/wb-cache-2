5|$|Between the {{two stages}} of the MLS Re-Entry Draft, D.C. United signed D.C. United Academy player Ethan White.

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2013 season, the Sounders {{replaced}} starting goalkeeper Michael Gspurning with Toronto's Stefan Frei. Several veteran players, including Eddie Johnson, Patrick Ianni, Jhon Kennedy Hurtado, Mauro Rosales, and Steve Zakuani, left the club {{as part of}} a major restructure; Brad Evans was named as club captain. Marco Pappa, an experienced MLS player and Guatemalan international, was added to the team. <b>Homegrown</b> player DeAndre Yedlin was transferred overseas to Tottenham Hotspur {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} has {{struggled}} to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from <b>homegrown</b> to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As {{a percentage of the}} available arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Omaha's {{rich history}} in rhythm and blues, and jazz {{gave rise to}} a number of {{influential}} bands, including Anna Mae Winburn's Cotton Club Boys and Lloyd Hunter's Seranaders. Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city's <b>homegrown</b> talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a <b>homegrown</b> Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2016 season, Obafemi Martins {{abruptly}} {{left the}} club to sign with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. in the Chinese Super League, {{a move that would}} hamper the Sounders' offense during the season. The move was mitigated somewhat by the signing of <b>homegrown</b> product Jordan Morris. GM Lagerwey also traded Marco Pappa and Lamar Neagle to other clubs in the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Queer Eyes American success caused {{television}} networks {{in several countries}} to syndicate the American episodes, {{with a number of}} countries creating their own local versions of Queer Eye for broadcast in their countries. However, few of these <b>homegrown</b> versions have proven as successful as the original, and most did not last long before cancellation. Licensing of the format is managed by NBCUniversal.|$|E
5|$|With {{a largely}} <b>homegrown</b> squad, in which seven {{players of the}} {{starting}} 11 were products of their youth academy, La Masia, Barcelona defeated the defending champions Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on 27 May 2009, to earn their third Champions League title. This completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish side, having already won the La Liga and Copa del Rey in that season.|$|E
5|$|After the {{disappointment}} of the Gaspart era, {{the combination of}} a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o and Rafael Márquez, combined with <b>homegrown</b> Spanish players Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|Gyllenhaal's first films—her {{feature film}} debut {{at the age}} of 15, Waterland (1992); A Dangerous Woman (1993); and <b>Homegrown</b> (1998)—were {{directed}} by her father; the last two also featured her brother; they had supporting roles as children. With their mother, she and Jake appeared in two episodes of Molto Mario, an Italian cooking show on the Food Network. After graduating from college, she played supporting roles in films like Cecil B. Demented (2000) and Riding in Cars with Boys (2001). Gyllenhaal later achieved recognition in her own right playing her real brother's on-screen sister in the indie cult hit Donnie Darko (2001).|$|E
5|$|Lana {{makes her}} first {{literary}} appearance in Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. In Strange Visitors, Lana attempts {{to organize a}} fund raiser for {{the family of a}} school mate, Stewart, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her effort is rendered moot when Lex Luthor and Dr. Donald Jacobi, a con artist that comes to Smallville, pick up Stewart's medical bills after a meteor rock removes all of the malignant cancer cells in his brain. In Smallville: Dragon, Lana visits an antiques dealer, Mrs. Mayfern, looking for a gift for her boyfriend, Whitney. When she leaves she breaks up with Whitney and starts dating Clark. It is eventually discovered that she was hypnotized by Mrs. Mayfern, whose <b>homegrown</b> herbal tea is fertilized by meteor rocks.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase <b>homegrown</b> food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
5|$|Back in Paris {{with two}} years of his grant remaining, Bizet was {{temporarily}} secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new <b>homegrown</b> talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, and of a shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca is the {{residence}} of some well-known Romanian musicians. Examples of <b>homegrown</b> bands include the popular Romanian rock band Compact, the modern pop band Sistem—which {{finished third in the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2005, the rhythm and blues band Nightlosers, the alternative band Luna Amară, Grimus—the winners of the 2007 National Finals of Global Battle of the Bands, as well as a large assortment of electronic music producers, notably Horace Dan D. The Cheeky Girls also grew up in the city, where they studied at the High School of Choreography and Dramatic Art. While many discos play commercial house music, the city has an increasing minimal techno scene, and, to an extent jazz/blues and heavy metal/punk. The city's nightlife, particularly its club scene, grew significantly in the 1990s, and continues to increase. Most entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city centre, spreading from the oldest one of all, Diesel Club, on Unirii Square. The list of large and fancy clubs continues with Obsession The Club and Midi, the latter being a venue for the new minimal techno music genre. These three clubs are classified as the top three clubs in the Transylvania-Banat region in a chart published by the national daily România Liberă. The Unirii area also features the Fashion Bar, with an exclusive terrace sponsored by Fashion TV. Some other clubs in the centre are Aftereight, Avenue, Bamboo, Decadence, Kharma and Molotov Pub. Numerous restaurants, pizzerias and coffee shops provide regional as well as international cuisine; many of these offer cultural activities like music and fashion shows or art exhibitions.|$|E

25|$|Between 1993 and 2001, {{the major}} attacks or {{attempts}} against U.S. interests stemmed from militant Islamic jihad extremism {{except for the}} 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

Former CIA Director Michael Hayden considers <b>homegrown</b> terrorism to be the most dangerous threat and concern faced by American citizens today.
