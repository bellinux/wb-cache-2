This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I {{have never seen a}} document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E
500|$|A. Yes, that as well, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> too. The {{transports}} to the camps, the transports {{from the}} camps {{to the work}} sites, the transfers from camp to camp following {{the interests of the}} Economic-Administrative Head Office, the work inside the concentration camp - all of these concepts are covered by [...] "special treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} war I never disobeyed an order, but when General Seidemann ordered Graf and me to fly to the British sector and {{surrender}} to avoid the Soviets, {{with the rest of}} the wing to surrender to the Soviets, I could not leave my men. [...] That would have been bad leadership.|$|E

500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was above}} all {{influenced}} by Odd Man Out (1947) - [...] "I still {{consider it as}} one of the best movies I've ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else... I always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is true {{that the}} music I traffic in, along with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and others, has never gained a great popularity. But that was true of the {{so-called}} difficult music of earlier centuries, too. And <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have noticed, as we have held our ground, {{that there has been a}} softening of response. There are now those who are beginning to find expressive beauty in a music that was at first rejected entirely." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazare {{once told}} the Bala {{that he was}} [...] "not aware of the {{exchange}} between him (Shodhan) and Vinoo, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Vinoo was not too keen that Deepak play. I suppose Vinoo found Deepak's attitude casual. ... (Shodhan) {{was not interested in}} touring (after the final Test of the series) ... Maybe {{it had to do with}} his business commitments. He had made himself unavailable for the tour of Pakistan and it might have been because Vinoo was the captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I have {{something}} to say to you," [...] he persisted. [...] "I {{have something}} new, something <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> something <b>that</b> has just come to me. You must listen, Ruth." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "It's been a {{long time}} coming, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I'm really, really elated," [...] Miller said. [...] "I'm really, really happy. I've been working really hard this season, and I'm very grateful.. It [...] would be on my mind, but the only thing I can do is to go on and perform to my best. If the coach or the {{selectors}} see it fit, then they will select me. I can't say that I deserve a game or not. So I'll just wait and see what they'll do." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was much}} talk but little really {{known about the}} reasons for the break-up. While many fans focused on Enigk being a reborn Christian, Enigk and other band members later downplayed that aspect. In a letter {{addressed}} [...] "To Seth and other readers", Enigk responded to rumors regarding his faith. Dismissing the connection between his conversion and their break-up, Enigk wrote, [...] "I took a shot on calling upon God. He answered me. My pain was gone. I was full of joy. I had hope again. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the true God is the one who is in the Bible, Jesus Christ," [...] and, [...] "I would be a fool to say that He hasn't worked miracles in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Knowles from Metal Exiles and Kenneth Morton from Highwire Daze were at {{the press}} {{presentation}} on May 1, 2013 in The Viper Room. Morton recalls: [...] "the songs contained within were absolutely breathtaking. The album is sure to go down as a big and glorious comeback for the legendary band", and Knowles said that, [...] "While I didn't hear anything on this record that was truly unlike anything else from a previous Queensrÿche release, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this record reveals a band that has been rejuvenated, and showcases the sounds fans have wanted to relive on a Queensrÿche record for many years. (...) Queensrÿche prove {{that they have the}} drive to reinvent themselves, and release a solid album they and the fans can be proud of." [...] Following this presentation, Century Media made digitally watermarked review copies available to select reviewers, requesting them to not publish their review until the first week of June.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> openly, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot {{see what}} {{the story of the}} {{penitent}} thief {{has to do with a}} death-bed repentance; and for this plain reason, that the penitent thief did not die in his bed.|$|R

2500|$|Ginsberg talked {{openly about}} his {{connections}} with communism and {{his admiration for}} past communist heroes and the labor movement {{at a time when}} the Red Scare and McCarthyism were still raging. He admired Fidel Castro and many other quasi-Marxist figures from the 20th century. In [...] "America" [...] (1956), Ginsberg writes: [...] "America, I used to be a communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry". Biographer Jonah Raskin has claimed that, despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy, Ginsberg held [...] "his own idiosyncratic version of communism". On the other hand, when Donald Manes, a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the Communist Party, Ginsberg objected: [...] "I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the Communist party, nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. government or any government by violence. ... <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capitalist that I have observed".|$|E
2500|$|Paramount {{declined}} to produce Babylon 5, but later announced Deep Space Nine was in development, {{two months after}} Warner Bros. announced its plans for Babylon 5. Straczynski stated that, {{even though he was}} confident that Deep Space Nine producer/creators Rick Berman and Michael Piller had not seen this material, he suspected that Paramount executives used his bible and scripts to steer development of Deep Space Nine. He and Warner did not file suit against Paramount, largely because Straczynski didn't see it as a productive option, with negative repercussions for both TV series. In 1993 he responded to a Deep Space Nine fan who saw the lack of legal action as proof that Straczynski's allegation was unfounded, [...] "If there is any (to use your term) winking and nudging going on, it's on the level of 'Okay, YOU (Paramount) know what happened, and *I* know what happened, but let's try to be grownup about it for now,' though <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the shapechanging thing nearly tipped me back over the edge again. [...] If there are no more major similarities that crop up {{in the next few weeks}} or months, with luck we can continue that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
