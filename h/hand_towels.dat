5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black <b>hand</b> <b>towels.</b> Because the <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Skin {{grafting}} is {{the most}} common method used for wound coverage in Plastic Surgery. Firm contact of the skin graft with the graft bed is essential for good take. Tie-over dressing is essential for this. Numerous methods have been described for this purpose. AIM To introduce a new method of tie-over dressing - “Tent in” technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this method, sterile synthetic <b>hand</b> <b>towel</b> is used for graft fixation along with sponge and staples. The sterile synthetic <b>hand</b> <b>towel</b> is available along with the disposable theatre gown. It is a type of synthetic nonwoven cloth, which is stretchable only in one direction. This method was tried in 30 patients with various indications and over different sites. RESULTS The patient group consisted of 18 males and 12 females. The age ranged from 16 yrs. to 71 yrs. (mean 51. 2 yrs.). Among 30 cases included in this study, the graft take was excellent in all except two. In all cases in which this procedure was used, there were no seroma or haematoma under the skin grafts. CONCLUSIONS ‘Tent in’ technique is a novel method for placing tie-over dressing. This method is simple, fast and easy to practice. Excellent graft take is obtained by this technique.

50|$|Preventative action {{revolves}} around personal hygiene and the cleanliness {{of the living}} quarters. The rate of reinfection can be reduced through hygienic measures, and this is recommended especially in recurring cases.The main measures are keeping fingernails short, and washing and scrubbing hands and fingers carefully, especially after defecation and before meals. Under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> should be changed daily. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them. Children should wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean. Food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs. Household detergents have {{little effect on the}} viability of pinworm eggs, and cleaning the bathroom with a damp cloth moistened with an antibacterial agent or bleach will merely spread the still-viable eggs. Similarly, shaking clothes and bed linen will detach and spread the eggs.|$|E
50|$|Bernardo and Collier {{arrive in}} Monte Carlo, {{and enter the}} hotel where {{unidentified}} Jake had checked in. Bernardo replies the lobby his own name that Jake used from his purloined wallet. The lobby tells them that he is out to the beach, and Bernardo finds him covering the topless female sunbathers with <b>hand</b> <b>towels.</b> He removes them, but accidentally includes a sensitive, aged sunbather, who calls the police due to his perversion. After {{he was released from}} prison by Collier, Bernardo's twitching sensation is increasing, and he proves to her that having Jake with him turns him insane every time Jake causes trouble. In the diner, Collier advices him to stay calm so he will be fine. When he hears the piano tune and is annoyed by twitches, he rushes for it and finds Jake. When Jake finds Collier, he departs the building, causing Bernardo to chase after him, but causing the police to follow them.|$|E
50|$|The main {{elements}} of the house design were inherited from those used for the previous celebrity series. Viewers first previewed the new Big Brother house during Celebrity Big Brother 2011 {{in preparation for the}} intake of regular housemates on the night of 9 September 2011. Differences included the walls being changed from a fish theme to a forest theme, and the bedroom being made over with fresh textiles and gold mirrored furniture for the regular housemates. In the bathroom, the installation of a transparent double shower cabinet with a frosted central band offered minimal privacy. There was {{a clear view of the}} shower's unclothed occupant from the house and garden but the frosting obscured the user's private parts from a clear view. There was a large central free-standing oval bath, with small pink and blue <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> provided. The bathroom was mainly blue and pink with a sofa and a clear view of the goings on from the living room and garden. Some of the house space was converted to create a luxury apartment for houseguest Pamela Anderson during her stay in the house earlier in the series. Following Anderson's departure, the luxury bedroom was used for a variety of tasks. The wall of faces in the living room was also changed on Day 3 with the new housemates' faces added. These turn blue to indicate the nominated housemates and red to indicate an evicted housemate or to mark that a housemate has walked.|$|E

5000|$|Although a slaveholder, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that Terrell may have put some of his slave property under the name of his son John Dabney Terrell Jr., in order to avoid a pending law suit against him in Tennessee, and the subsequent loss of such property. Terrell died on the 10th day of May 1850, at the age of seventy-five, whereupon his slave property fell unto his wife, Lydia. At her death in 1853, most of his registered enslaved persons came under the possession of his son Edward Garland Terrell, while John D. Terrell Jr. retained his own property in persons. During John Sr.'s lifetime, however, he had also bequeathed some of his slave property to his other children, as can be seen by legal deeds in the Alabama State Archives. At his own request, Terrell was buried in a sitting posture within a walnut coffin that was made somewhat like unto a chair replete with a box-like covering, and which coffin was let down into a grave dug deep within one of three Indian mounds located at Military Ford. [...] He was buried while draped in a panther vest (given to him by an Indian chieftain), along with a blanket that was spread over his shoulders, as well as other accessories (e.g. a gun and a water bucket and dipper, wash pan and <b>hand</b> <b>towels),</b> as was customary amongst some Native American Indians.|$|E
30|$|In {{hospital}} A, all of {{the clinical}} outpatient rooms had functioning sinks as did the ward areas (but some of those lacked soap); however, hand-drying facilities were inadequate. <b>Hand</b> <b>towels</b> were sometimes provided but there was often just one cloth towel and no receptacle for used towels, {{which is likely to}} lead to reuse of <b>hand</b> <b>towels.</b> In hospital B, there were 4.57 clean cloth <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> on average per sink; but in hospital A, there were just 0.75 clean cloth towels on average.|$|E

40|$|In rural Turkey, trousseaux are a {{personal}} and socially representative collection of textile practices, economies, and desires. This paper addresses the questions of how, when, why and in what forms handweaving {{gave way to the}} collection of mass-produced commodities and handmade goods reflecting urban styles in trousseaux. It considers how local communities abandon cultural heritage production for their own consumption and make the transition to desiring, making and buying decorative goods, which reflect current fashions in both local and national terms. The paper is based on long-term ethnographic research in rural villages in western Anatolia, where handweaving once demonstrated cultural heritage and a residual nomadic lifestyle, but now is commodified for export markets. As this shift in the role of weaving took place, goods in trousseaux changed as well. Beginning in the 1960 s and accelerating in the 1980 s, young women, their mothers, and future mothers-in-law, both unable to afford handwoven goods, and in part, lacking an interest in them, took up crochetwork by making doilies and tablecloths, and decorating headscarves (oya), and <b>hand</b> <b>towels.</b> They took up knitting socks (patik) and embroidery, as well, producing decorative textiles, some of which are given away after marriage in the creation of networks of friendship among married and unmarried women and girls. In addition to considering how textiles shift in meaning and function, thus identifying the effects of commodification, this paper also considers how new goods, utilizing differentskills, create new social relationships in rural life...|$|E
