5|$|Marchant {{began at}} the Chelsea Amateur Cycling Club, which did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> banked cycling track and was trained by Norton and Maurie Cramer. Marchant rose to {{prominence}} by winning the 500metres (m) time trial at the 1955 Victorian Championships for juniors in only his second year of competition. He then won the 5 mile title and the 500m time trial at the Australian Junior Championships. He added a silver medal in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Torres was {{initially}} {{sent to the}} minors to begin 2004 but was recalled on April 7 without playing a game for Toledo when Dmitri Young broke his leg. He only appeared in three games (and didn't <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> plate appearance) before the Tigers attempted to outright him to the minors. Instead {{of going to the}} minors, Torres requested his release. He was granted free agency on April 22.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E

5|$|The 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will {{span the}} island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The {{addition}} of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current East West Line, and will {{play an important role}} in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line. This line will <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{numerical}} digit 0 {{is usually}} written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.|$|E

25|$|On average, the headway {{between each}} tram {{departure}} is approximately 1.5 minutes during peak hours. In the past, trams had a maximum speed of 40km/h. However, since early 2008, {{the maximum speed}} of some trams was increased, with a maximum speed of 50km/h now enabled on most trams - {{a few of them}} <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> maximum speed of 60km/h. The maximum capacity of each tramcar is 115 people.|$|E
25|$|The Stadium {{does not}} have covered stands, there are no flood lights, the stadium does not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> digital scoreboard. The stadium has no proper white screens instead it uses old school {{portable}} cloth screens. The pitch is not well-managed either, the curator uses a hand-rolled roller which makes pitch management even more difficult. There are no practical arrangements for video coverage of a match. The stadium has eight entrances and a well-built pavilion.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Hillcrest Labs {{introduced}} the Loop pointer, {{a remote control}} that used Hillcrest's Freespace motion control technology to allow users to control their televisions with natural gestures. The Loop had just four buttons and a scroll wheel. Freespace-enabled remote controls use radio waves to communicate with a USB antenna connected to a computer that is also connected to the television, so {{they do not need}} to be pointed at the PC, or <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> direct line of sight.|$|E

25|$|The target {{launch date}} was {{originally}} January 1985. Smith and Holland had eleven months {{in which to}} write, cast and shoot the whole thing. However, in February 1984, they did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date. However, this was later to be changed to February.|$|E
25|$|Giant Eagle has {{the highest}} share of any {{supermarket}} chain in the Pittsburgh area, largely due to being a de facto monopoly in the region (only Aldi and stores supplied by Supervalu such as Shop 'n Save, FoodLand, Save-A-Lot, and County Market <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> presence in the area, let alone significant market share), but has lost some market share in recent years due to Walmart's construction of supercenters in the area, as well as no frills supermarkets attracting value-seeking customers such as Aldi, Save-A-Lot, and relative newcomer Bottom Dollar, in 2014 Bottom Dollar ceased its business in Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|Cipollini {{also became}} famous for extravagant clothing, {{especially}} racing uniforms, sporting custom-made skin suits. Some of his memorable kits include a muscle suit, zebra, and tiger prints, and a techno-skinsuit {{inspired by the}} 1982 film Tron. Off the course, Cipollini and his Saeco squad dressed as ancient Romans during a rest day at the 1999 Tour de France, to celebrate Julius Caesar's birthday and to commemorate Cipollini's record fourth consecutive Tour de France stage win. He was fined for wearing an all-yellow outfit while leading the Tour de France; this practice to wear more yellow and <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> yellow bike has since become generally accepted.|$|E

25|$|The Alliance {{nominated}} {{candidates in}} all 83 electoral divisions and three {{candidates for the}} Senator-in-waiting, for the 2004 Alberta election, which was held on November 22, 2004. The party was excluded from Global Television's leaders' debate because it had not elected any members in the 2001 election, which was held before the party was founded. Some Alliance members noted that in the 1997 election, the Alberta New Democratic Party leader was allowed in the debate (as was then Social Credit leader Thorsteinson), even though the NDP had no MLAs at the time. They {{also noted that the}} NDP did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> full slate of candidates in the 1997 election.|$|E
25|$|Capone became {{increasingly}} security-minded and desirous of {{getting away from}} Chicago. As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper car on a night train to Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock, or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on Palm Island, Florida in Biscayne Bay between Miami and Miami Beach. He never registered any property under his name. He did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bank account, but always used Western Union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000.|$|E
25|$|Even in the {{earliest}} times the chief qualifications demanded of the hazzan, in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature {{as well as the}} prayer motifs (known as steiger), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The hazzan was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to Isaac of Vienna (13th century), a young hazzan having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. Maimonides decided that the hazzan who recited the prayers on an ordinary Sabbath and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he might <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach {{at the time of his}} appointment.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for Thrushcross Grange {{has long been}} traced to Ponden Hall, near Haworth, which is very small. Shibden Hall, near Halifax, is perhaps more likely. The Thrushcross Grange that Emily describes is rather unusual. It sits within an enormous park, as does Shibden Hall. By comparison, the park at Chatsworth (the home of the Duke of Devonshire) is over two miles (3.2km) long but, as the house sits near the middle, {{it is no more}} than a mile and a half (2.4km) from the lodge to the house. Considering that Edgar Linton apparently does not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> title, this seems unlikely. There is no building close to Haworth that has a park anywhere near this size, but there are a few houses that might have inspired some elements. Shibden Hall has several features that match descriptions in the novel.|$|E
25|$|Costco has a {{wide variety}} of {{changing}} inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products. Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages. The produce items that require refrigeration are kept in a walk-in refrigerator, and several locations <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> walk-in refrigerator for dairy items.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not grow up in the same strict manor as her husband, perhaps she did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it difficult for her to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E
