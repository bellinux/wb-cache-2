500|$|PokerTracker 3 is {{also known}} for its {{integrated}} heads-up display, a transparent video overlay <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> that makes statistics and notes are readily available during play. The HUD allows an online poker player to focus his attention on the poker table {{he or she is}} playing at, rather than on the PokerTracker application. The HUD provides a vast array of realtime statistics for in-game analysis, customizable to the user's preference. In addition to the statistics available constantly during play on the poker window, detailed statistics are available in a pop-up window, accessible via a single mouse click. Marbella Slim of the Daily Star used the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in an analogy with the HUD: [...] "In some scenes, you get to see what the robot Terminator is seeing and he has all these data streams in front of his vision - it's a HUD or a head-up display." [...] Unlike other poker tracking products, PokerTracker 3 includes a HUD as part of the basic program. [...] The PT3 HUD, which automatically overlays a player's opponents' statistics next to their avatars, is essentially a built-in version of the formerly available PokerAce HUD.|$|E

2500|$|Later in his career, Coren {{shifted to}} the study of canine {{behavior}} and the relationship that people have with their dogs. This shift away from neuropsychological research also marked a shift in his publishing strategy, away from single study publications in research journals, to publication of his new data as part of material presented in book form. Many of his books on dogs do contain hithertofore unpublished empirical data. For example, his book [...] "The Intelligence of Dogs" [...] is based on a survey sent to all of the dog obedience judges in the United States and Canada, and resulted in the ranking of 110 dog breeds by intelligence. This ranking caused a rather large media stir. His book [...] "Why we love the dogs we do" [...] looks at the personality of people and how the owner's personality predicts their relationship with various dog breeds. It is based on a survey of more than 6000 people who took a personality test and reported on their experiences with the various dogs that they have owned. This book proved to be very popular and Coren's personality test is now used by some dog shelters to determine whether prospective owners are suitable for a particular breed of dog. Similarly, his book [...] "Why does my dog act that way?" [...] uses data from approximately a thousand dogs to determine features of the personality of various dog breeds. However other books that he has written on dog behavior have provided less formal <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> and in these his creative contribution is based on the organization and interpretation of the research of others, {{as is the case in}} [...] "How to speak dog". These books have also been well accepted and have been proven to be very popular.|$|E

40|$|In a world {{progressively}} {{suffering from}} information overload, simplicity in information design becomes {{a quality of}} increasing relevance. Simplicity in visual <b>data</b> <b>presentations</b> creates clarity that facilitates good decision-making. In decision-making, as elsewhere, we can’t make a silk purse of a sow’s ear. Mediocre visual <b>data</b> <b>presentations</b> have three unwanted effects. They cause decision makers to use more time than necessary digesting the information on hand, they hinder decision makers to understand problems and evaluate possible decisions, and they inspire decision makers to neglect available information in favour of unfounded guesswork. Simplicity in information design fights all three undesired effects. The simplicity in demand is functional simplicity. Functional simplicity in information design is concerned with improving usability and utility of information {{and should not be}} confused with minimalism, which is a matter of aesthetics. Functional simplicity in information design means more understanding with less reading. That in turn leads to more effective and more efficient decision-making. Functional simplicity in information design goes beyond raw reduction of <b>data</b> <b>presentations.</b> It involves size, variation/repetition, and structure. All three dimensions of simplicity influence the amount of redundancy that creates the delicate balance between necessity and superfluity, between understanding and boredom. The measure of redundancy that is both necessary and sufficient should be determined with a view to the context and the expected culture of the intended target groups. This paper pins down the concept of functional simplicity, discusses its importance in data designed for decision, and examines the three dimensions of simplicity one by one. Finally, it looks into the need for redundancy in several types of <b>data</b> <b>presentations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Pharmaceutical {{advertisements}} are {{an important}} means of bringing drug information to physicians. Most advertisements are intended only to raise awareness, though there are those that do seek to persuade through presentation of research findings. Researchers have questioned {{the quality of the}} research reported in advertisements and wonder whether these advertisements would lead to im-proper prescribing. Methods: A consecutive 6 -month sample of advertisements in 4 general medical journals, 3 from the United States and 1 from Canada, were reviewed to determine how research results are presented in pharmaceutical advertisements. Results: During this time there were 187 distinctive advertisements, with 43 <b>data</b> <b>presentations</b> in the 33 advertisements that contained quantitative research results. These results were examined using a critical appraisal worksheet. References to randomization and blinding were found in less than one half of the 43 <b>data</b> <b>presentations.</b> P values were frequently provided, but confidence intervals and references to power and number needed to treat were not provided in any of the advertisements. Conclusions: Descriptions of research in pharmaceutical advertisements were brief and incomplete, and they inconsistently provided the basic design and statistical information needed to judge the result...|$|R

DPA is neither an IT nor a business skill set but exists as a separate field of expertise. Often confused with data visualization, <b>data</b> <b>presentation</b> architecture is a much broader skill set that includes determining what data on what schedule and in what exact format is to be presented, not just the best way to present data that has already been chosen. Data visualization skills are one element of DPA." ...|$|E
