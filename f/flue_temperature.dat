It {{has previously been}} shown that the coke oven <b>flue</b> <b>temperature</b> {{in the first few}} hours of coking is a key determinant of coke size. In this paper, the authors present a new programmed heating approach, which is called pulsed heating,aiming to increase coke mean size at a given average <b>flue</b> <b>temperature.</b> The approach takes into account the charging sequence in coke oven batteries and the authors demonstrate how existing operating practice can be modified in batteries with suitable heating systems to achieve the desired heating programme. A mathematical model of fissure formation provides a prediction of the increase in coke mean size using pulsed heating, compared with standard heating. Pilot scale experiments have also been performed to validate the modelling approach. The results of the modelling indicate that the mean coke size can be increased by several millimetres in some cases, although results from the pilot scale show that pulsed heating increases coke size, but by a smaller amount than that predicted by the model. The potential advantages and limitations of pulsed heating are discussed, as well as opportunities for further investigation of the approach...|$|E

40|$|Between April 2003 and April 2004 a project, {{funded by}} Technology New Zealand, was {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} computer model of a wood burning heater for use at Applied Research Services Ltd. Applied Research Services Ltd is a science and engineering research company that specialises in the testing of wood burning heaters. The computer model will be owned by Applied Research Services Ltd and {{will be used to}} improve the design of their customers' heaters so that they may pass the particulate emissions and efficiency standards of AS/NZS 4013 : 1999. The computer model used the software program, Engineering Equation Solver as a platform to solve the model equations. EES was particularly easy to use and more emphasis was able to he placed on the actual modelling. The final model included over eight hundred variables and equations. It included radiant, convective and conductive heat flows, over thirty heat balances, Arrhenious based rate expressions and many empirical equations derived from experiments and data acquired at Applied Research Services Ltd. At the beginning of this project the objective was for the model to match the test results to within 10 %. This has been met for the tests on the high airflow setting where the model error is 4 % for <b>flue</b> <b>temperature,</b> 8 % for heater output and 16 % for flue oxygen. Unfortunately on low airflow setting, the model does not reach this target with model errors of 18 % for <b>flue</b> <b>temperature,</b> 25 % for heat output and 13 % for <b>flue</b> <b>temperature.</b> The excellent results for the high flow setting are partially attributed to the use of calibration factors. The calibration factors model the processes in wood combustion that could not be modelled by this project, due to lack of time and resources. Some of these factors are the proportion of air that flows onto the charcoal ember bed or logs, radiation shape factor changes due to firebox geometry, convection heat transfer coefficients changing with turbulence. The calibration of the model only has to be completed once for each heater. The reason why the model does not work as well on low airflow setting is that with less airflow the proportion of air to the charcoal bed opposed to the logs would decrease, therefore decreasing the burn-rate. This model can he used to determine the changes to a heater's performance from changes to air inlet areas, insulation type and thickness, wetback size, baffle size, primary vs secondary air, air bypass ratio and door size. The model provides all the results that are obtained from an emissions test plus extra information such as the amount of excess air, smoke conversion in each combustion zone, flame temperatures and distribution of heat output. The smoke conversions for each combustion zone are particularly helpful in diagnosing where problems with the combustion occur. The reasons for incomplete combustion, lack of temperature or oxygen, can be found and fixed by increasing either insulation or air areas. The model can be used by Applied Research Services Ltd to improve heater designs. For the short term this will involve the author working as a part-time consultant. The project could be built on by another student by using CFD modelling for the sections of the wood burning process not modelled by this model and adding a graphical user interface to make the model easier to use...|$|E

40|$|This study {{incorporates}} the potential use of Variable Frequency Drives on various motors {{as well as}} areas of improved heat transfer in an older, mid-sized coal fired power plant. In power plants, fluid flow rates are often controlled using dampers or valves while the motors that power the pumps stay at full speed resulting in {{a significant amount of}} wasted electrical power; energy is also lost due to poor heat recovery prior to gases leaving the system. By examining pump usage as well as additional heat available for recovery, potential energy savings will be determined. 	Preliminary results of five motors suggested for variable frequency drive application show annual savings that total 31. 1 GWh, resulting in a 1. 66 % increase in overall plant efficiency.

For every degree reduction of the <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> by means of heat recovery that is reused elsewhere in the cycle, 2 Billion BTU of coal would be saved annually. One realistic scenario suggested heat recovery resulting in a 120 °F degree reduction of <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> amounting to a 2. 54 % increase in cycle efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the main physical characteristics and operating conditions of a fireplace and a stove {{commonly used in}} Portugal for domestic heating based on biomass combustion. The fuel used was wood from pine (softwood) and eucalyptus (hardwood). The general trend during the batch combustion of wood logs was characterized by three main periods: i) a first period of fuel heating followed by fuel drying and initial steps of devolatilization without {{the existence of a}} visible flame, ii) a second period characterized by devolatilization, ignition, combustion of volatiles and char, during which a vigorous flame is observed, and iii) a third period, mainly identified by the combustion of the char, during which there are only localized small visible flames over the char particles. Each of these periods is characterized by specific fuel consumption rate, <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> and <b>flue</b> gas composition. The main differences between the wood combustion conditions in the fireplace and in the stove include: i) a lower <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> in the fireplace, ii) a higher combustion flue gas flow rate in the fireplace, iii) a higher rate of fuel consumption in the stove, and iv) higher CO, total hydrocarbon and particle emission factors during the combustion of wood in the fireplace. Differences between hardwood and softwood combustion were also pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{ninety percent}} of U. S. {{coal-fired}} utility boilers are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP). Cost effective retrofittable ESP technologies are the only means to accomplish Department of Energy's (DOE) goal of a major reduction in fine particulate and air toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. Particles in the size range of 0. 1 to 5 {micro}m typically escape ESPs. Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, molybdenum and antimony, concentrate on these particles. This is the main driver for improved fine particulate control. Vapor phase emissions of mercury, selenium and arsenic are also of major concern. Current dry ESPs, which operate at temperatures greater than 280 F, provide little control for vapor phase toxics. The need for inherent improvement to ESPs has to be considered keeping in perspective the current trend towards the use of low sulfur coals. Switching to low sulfur coals is the dominant approach for SO{sub 2 } emission reduction in the utility industry. Low sulfur coals generate high resistivity ash, which can cause an undesirable phenomenon called ''back corona. '' Higher particulate emissions occur if there is back corona in the ESP. Results of the pilot-scale testing identified the ''low temperature ESP'' concept to have the biggest impact for the two low sulfur coals investigated. Lowering the <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> to 220 F provided the maximum impact in terms of decreased emissions. Intermediate operating temperatures (reduction from 340 to 270 F) also gave significant ESP performance improvement. A significant reduction in particulate emissions was also noted when the flue gas humidity was increased (temperature held constant) from the baseline condition for these moderately high resistivity ash coals. Independent control of flue gas humidity and temperature was an important and a notable element in this project. Mercury emissions were also measured {{as a function of}} <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature.</b> Mercury emissions decreased as the <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> was lowered, indicating the native ability of ash to capture the mercury. Pulsed operation of the ESP with the SIR module provided a 2 to 3 -fold reduction in emissions at the higher operating temperatures. In light of the positive results from Phase I, we propose proof of concept testing in the field in Phase II. The main objective of the Phase II testing would be to determine the ESP performance improvement as a function of <b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature</b> and humidity for a range of low-sulfur coals being fired by utilities. Equally important will be the long-term evaluation of the risk of corrosion and plugging (due to acid condensation) associated with low temperature operation. The impact of higher flue gas velocities (lower SCA-specific collection area), compared to the laboratory pilot program, would also need to be evaluated. A secondary objective would be to examine mercury capture by the ESP at the different temperatures and with sorbent injection...|$|R
3000|$|... where Ps is {{sensible}} heat loss (MJ/kgcomb), Pi, is heat loss from incomplete combustion (MJ/kgcomb) and LHV is {{lower heating value}} (MJ/kgcomb). Sensible heat loss (Ps) corresponds to the energy the combustion gases have when extracted compared to the reference conditions of the combustion process. When these losses are higher, the internal energy of the flue gas (<b>flue</b> gas <b>temperature)</b> is greater. They also increase with flue gas flow, which increases with excess air, and this also increases the flow of flue gas, transporting a greater amount of heat.|$|R
