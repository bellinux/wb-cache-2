New technologies are being developed and adopted in each mode of freight transportation. The one technology that affects all modes is information technology. Information technology related to the coordination of logistics and supply chain management, has the capability of affecting all the modes in a similar way. This technology in the <b>form</b> of <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchange</b> has begun to automate, and reduce the costs of, paper flow required to move goods from shippers, through carriers and transfer points, to consignees.

40|$|When an {{organization}} embarks on e-commerce it rarely {{has a chance}} to re-engineer its existing business applications. However, if these business applications were built using an application framework, then one might hope to reuse many of the existing legacy applications in the new e-commerce context. This paper examines the general issues created by migrating applications to e-commerce, and proposes an architecture for application frameworks that must support e-commerce. 1. Introduction 1. 1. E-Commerce The current general definition of e-commerce is the ability to do business on-line via the internet. Traditional e-commerce focused on business-tobusiness transactions over proprietary networks in the <b>form</b> of EDI (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Interchange).</b> The outcome of this limited business-to-business form of ecommerce were, among others, ffl Increased efficiency of order processing, ffl Reduced costs due to just-in-time inventory management, ffl Locking-in trading partners by requiring all s [...] ...|$|R

These texts are demonstrating in an electronic documents format hosted on the web. The documents exchanged using special <b>forms</b> in an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Interchange</b> (EDI) environment. Using web text mining approaches to mine documents in EDI environment could be new challenging guidelines in web text mining. Applying text-mining approaches to discover knowledge previously unknown patters retrieved from the web documents by using partitioned cluster analysis methods such as k- means methods using Euclidean distance measure algorithm for EDI text document datasets is unique area of research these days. Our experiments employ the standard K-means algorithm on EDI text documents dataset that most commonly used in electronic interchange. We also report some results using text mining clustering application solution called WEKA. This study will provide high quality services to any organization that is willing to use the system.

40|$|AbstractIn {{education}} system, {{there is}} a need to collect data from the education providers, to facilitate informative decision making by the policy makers. Data collection is handled using tools like questionnaires, online surveys, online <b>forms</b> submission, and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Interchange.</b> This paper presents, EwayDataCollect, a tool for online data collection in education system. EwayDataCollect leverages the web service technology for data collection. It uses web service interface which is interoperable and supports communication between heterogeneous environments. The tool enables computer to computer data collection of both, statistical and detailed data. It facilitates collection of data from any number of educational providers. EwayDataCollect consists of three components: (1) Eway-Invocation, (2) DCF-Dissemination, and (3) Eway-Processing. The first component is responsible for registering the data requestor, accepting Data Capture Format (DCF) and details like URLs and email-ids of data providers. The task of second component is to disseminate DCF to the data providers. The third component of tool collects filled DCF from the data provider's registered URL. The collected data is parsed and stored in a database. EwayDataCollect is faster and easier to use. EwayDataCollect architecture, implementation and application are presented in this paper...|$|R

Despite its potential benefits, however, many enterprises are still reluctant to implement EDI at least partly due to the difficulties of justifying the investment. This paper describes a long-term research project investigating the development of a generic EDI cost/benefit metric. The project is divided into two phases: an initial phase, in which individual researchers develop metrics for individual organisations; and a second phase, in which these metrics are tested and refined into a generic format.
