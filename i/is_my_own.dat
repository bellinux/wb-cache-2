25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E

Having demonstrated Persian power at Naxos, Datis now intended to show clemency {{to the other}} islands, if they submitted to him. He sent a herald to the Delians, proclaiming: [...] "Holy men, why have you fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So return now to your homes and dwell on your island." [...] Datis then burned 300 talents of frankincense {{on the altar of}} Apollo on Delos, to show his respect for one of the gods of the island. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of Aegean on its way to Eretria, taking hostages and troops from each island.|$|E

500|$|Although some British {{thought that}} Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer, Allenby {{retained}} him in command. However he overrode Chauvel's own preference {{to appoint a}} Royal Horse Guards officer, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse, known as [...] "Wombat", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. A [...] "brass-bound brigadier" [...] was quoted as saying, [...] "Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian." [...] On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, [...] "I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand – it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> trade – but Fate has willed it otherwise." [...] At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode's [...] "arms length" [...] style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.|$|E

[...] "But despite the number of writers and changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The fact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a gesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died at age 48 in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere." [...] Selznick, in a memo written in October 1939, discussed the film's writing credits: [...] "ou can say frankly that of the comparatively small amount of material in the picture which is not from the book, most <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personally, and the only original lines of dialog which are not my own are a few from Sidney Howard and a few from Ben Hecht and a couple more from John Van Druten. Offhand I doubt that there are ten original words of [...] Garrett's in the whole script. As to construction, this is about eighty per cent my own, and the rest divided between Jo Swerling and Sidney Howard, with Hecht having contributed materially to the construction of one sequence." ...|$|E

[...] I must forget all else and all others and all further service until that is clear.’" [...] MacLeod places this struggle {{in the context of}} the incarnation, [...] "...he has become a man and must accept not only the appearance but the reality." ...|$|E

De Janzé's condition quickly improved and she was first able to talk with relatives on 30 March.

2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E
2500|$|William Diaper (1685–1717) was an English poet of the Augustan era. Little {{is known}} about his life. He was born in Bridgwater, Somerset and {{attended}} Balliol College, Oxford as a pauper, where he took his BA in 1702. In 1709 he was ordained a deacon at Wells and became a curate in the parish of Brent, which he describes in disparaging terms in a poem of the same name, calling it [...] "nature's gaol". By 1712, he had made contacts in the London literary world and become a protégé of Jonathan Swift, who refers to the poet several times in his Journal to Stella. In March 1712, Swift writes:Here is a young fellow has writ some Sea Eclogues, poems of Mermen, resembling pastorals of shepherds, {{and they are very}} pretty, and the thought is new. Mermen are he-mermaids; Tritons, natives of the sea. Do you understand me? I think to recommend him to our Society to-morrow. His name is Diaper. P— on him, I must do something for him, and {{get him out of the}} way. I hate to have any new wits rise, but when they do rise I would encourage them; but they tread on our heels and thrust us off the stage.In December 1712, he continued his account of Diaper's progress:This morning I presented one Diaper, a poet, to Lord Bolingbroke, with a new poem, which is a very good one; and I am to give him a sum of money from my lord; and I have contrived to make a parson of him, for he is half one already, being in deacon’s orders, and serves a small cure in the country; but has a sword at his a—— here in town. ’Tis a poor little short wretch, but will do best in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper give him a living.In another letter, Swift refers to Diaper's being ill:I was to see a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, in a nasty garret, very sick. I gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bolingbroke, and disposed the other sixty to two other authors, and desired a friend to receive the hundred pounds for poor Harrison, and will carry it to him to-morrow morning. I sent to see how he did, and he is extremely ill; and I very much afflicted for him, for he <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> creature, and in a very honourable post, and very worthy of it. I dined in the City. I am in much concern for this poor lad. His mother and sister attend him, and he wants nothing.|$|E
