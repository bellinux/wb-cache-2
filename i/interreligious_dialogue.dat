In March 2006, he placed both the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace under a single president, Cardinal Renato Martino. When Martino retired in 2009, the Councils each received its own preside once again. Also in March 2006 the Pontifical Council for <b>Interreligious</b> <b>Dialogue</b> was briefly merged into the Pontifical Council for Culture under Cardinal Paul Poupard. Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007 <b>Interreligious</b> <b>Dialogue</b> was restored to its separate status again with its own president. In June 2010 Benedict created the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation, appointing Archbishop Rino Fisichella its first president. On 16 January 2013 Pope Benedict transferred responsibility for catechesis from the Congregation for the Clergy to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization.|$|E

Furthermore, the result of this research detail shows that the social construction of religious elites on religious pluralism is: first, according to Islam fundamentalist elites, that the construction of religious pluralism is deontic-diachronicl non-reductionistic. According to moderate Islam, the construction of religious pluralism is normative; second, the religious attitude of Islam fundamentalist is exclusive-lslam centric and according to elites moderate Islam is inclusiveIslamcentric in one side, and inclusive theocentric in other side. While, the construction of religious pluralism according to Christian moderate elitess is plural; third, the pattern of relation of fundamentalist elites is co-existence, and the pattern of relation moderate elites (both Islam or Christianity) is pro-existence.

40|$|Despite the {{incredible}} amount of literature written about <b>interreligious</b> <b>dialoguing,</b> scant critical attention {{has been devoted to}} mapping out the potential logical consequences of the enterprise. This is regrettable, especially given the high hopes many expect to achieve through participation. The critical literature from various traditions was reviewed using textual criticism as the analytical lens. Seven logical outcomes were subsequently identified and explicated herein using the following taxonomy. Namely: (a) nothing happened, (b) understanding, (c) insightfulness, (d) tolerance, (e) conversion, (f) frustration, and (g) defection. It was concluded that the a priori understanding of these potential outcomes would significantly moderate future delegate expectations. In addition, professional awareness of the range, depth and contours of these dialogic consequences had important ramifications for both participant preparation and event organisation. Practical suggestions for dealing with various impediments were proffered as appropriate. Further research into this important praxis area was recommended...|$|R

40|$|Malaysia is {{a country}} that is rich for the {{diversity}} of its people. This diversity {{can be seen from the}} aspect of faith, ethnicity, language, culture, and so on. In facing a society that is pluralistic in nature, several initiatives have been taken by the government and non-government bodies in ensuring understanding and unity among Malaysians. Among the initiatives taken are <b>interreligious</b> <b>dialogues.</b> In this regard, many among Malaysian thinkers have proposed some approaches and concepts of inter-faith dialogue that should and may be implemented in the context of Malaysia. For that purpose, this paper examined the forms of inter-religious dialogues in Malaysia from the perspective of Malaysian contemporary Muslim thinkers. The methodology utilized in this study is textual analysis, particularly the writings of these thinkers on this issue. This article concludes that there are several forms of inter-religious dialogues that are easily implemented, as well as the difficult ones in the context of Malaysia due to certain obstacles...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is <b>interreligious</b> <b>dialogues</b> and {{cooperation}} examined from a sociological point of view: To obtain higher status in the international systems {{it is in the}} interest of the various religious traditions to cooperate and appear as a united system, since <b>interreligious</b> <b>dialogues</b> and cooperation can be used as an anti-secular strategy. There is today a great number of interreligious social agencies, institutions and organisations that work to improve the world through projects in developing countries, fight against violations of human rights, and focus on environmental issues. Against the background of the secular international society, it is very likely that these socially engaged activities also may be used as one way for religion to once again become a power to reckon with. The thesis examines how religious adherents, on the basis of a common concern for humanitarian and ecological matters, can cooperate in an anti-secular agenda through an interreligious movement. One of the main points in this examination is to show how the partners engaged in these collaborations first and foremost are of the ‘liberal’ wings, and how the interreligious collaborations lack the participation of the ‘conservative’ wings. This absence shows the intrareligious difference. It is precisely the absence of intrareligious dialogues which may constitute the greatest challenge in the pursuit of the anti-secular goals and the wide support for the interreligious movement in general. To discuss these topics the thesis analyses the Parliament of the World’s Religions (in 1993, 1999 and 2004), which works as a reflection of the interreligious movement. At the Parliament in 1993 one of the paroles was ‘No world peace without dialogue between the religions’, but it is just as important to stress the ‘dialogue within the religions’. In addition, the thesis shows how the organisationing of the events has become closely connected to certain anti-secular agencies which work towards an increased religious influence on the UN system, and how acts of religious exclusivism/fundamentalism may have influenced the programs of the Parliament. The universalistic attitude promoted by the interreligious movement and the Parliament may be seen as expressions of Western ideas, since the majority of the participants have Western backgrounds. However, the intrareligious differences are not the result of cultural differences. For intrareligious dialogues between ‘liberals’ and ‘conservatives’ to work, a change from the essentialistic discourse to the processual discourse is required...|$|R

2500|$|The Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, {{which works}} towards the {{integration}} of Europe and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for <b>interreligious</b> <b>dialogue</b> and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and pluralist societies; it has described Sufism {{as a symbol of}} tolerance and humanism—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent. According to Philip Jenkins, a Professor at Baylor University, [...] "the Sufis are much more than tactical allies for the West: they are, potentially, the greatest hope for pluralism and democracy within Muslim nations." [...] Likewise, several governments and organisations have advocated the promotion of Sufism as a means of combating intolerant and violent strains of Islam. For example, the Chinese and Russian governments openly favor Sufism as the best means of protecting against Islamist subversion. The British government, especially following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, has favoured Sufi groups in its battle against Muslim extremist currents. The influential RAND Corporation, an American think-tank, issued a major report titled [...] "Building Moderate Muslim Networks," [...] which urged the US government to form links with and bolster Muslim groups that opposed Islamist extremism. The report stressed the Sufi role as moderate traditionalists open to change, and thus as allies against violence. News organisations such as the BBC, Economist and Boston Globe have also seen Sufism as a means to deal with violent Muslim extremists.|$|E
