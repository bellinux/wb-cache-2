5|$|Roberts' son, Kenny Roberts Jr., won the 2000 500cc World Championship, {{making them}} the only {{father and son}} duo to have won the title. Ironically, Roberts has stated that he {{considers}} himself a dirt tracker at heart and only took up road racing because {{it was necessary to}} do so if a rider was going to compete for the Grand National championship. He also said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to remain in the United States to compete in the Grand National championship if Yamaha or another manufacturer had been able to construct a dirt track racer capable of competing with Harley-Davidson.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu had {{originally}} {{calculated that the}} game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but managed {{to reduce the number}} to 56. He has stated that he developed the ideas for the music by first reading through the script and creating the titles for all of the tracks, then composing melodies to match the themes of the story and titles. Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy V was much better than that of Final Fantasy IV. He also claimed that this resulted in the soundtrack release requiring two CDs as opposed to the one CD required for the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack. Uematsu has stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to keep the soundtrack to one CD, {{in order to keep the}} price of the album low.|$|E
60|$|Jim {{insisted on}} {{carrying}} his muzzle-loader on this expedition, believing {{it a more}} trustworthy weapon than the revolver, and Jet made no objections, although <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> that the ancient musket had been left behind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{the best}} thing I have ever heard,' {{answered}} the fox; and as they were two to one the bear had to be content, though in his heart <b>he</b> <b>would</b> much <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a good dinner at once to any friendship.|$|R
60|$|Brooke {{sat down}} again, and making no answer, {{looked away from}} her, for though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> greatly <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> it <b>he</b> {{scarcely}} felt capable of reaching his tent. Then there was silence for several minutes until Mrs. Devine {{came back with the}} wine.|$|R
5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
25|$|In May and June 1909 Wilson {{had been}} tipped to succeed Haig as Director of Staff Duties, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> command of a brigade.|$|E
25|$|Enlisting Andy Johns and Bruce Witkin, {{the group}} began {{recording}} a new material with the group's current lineup {{with the result}} being Tales from the Strip, released in 2005 through Shrapnel Records. In a 2006 interview, singer Lewis stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> releasing the album on a larger label while he also likened the album to a demo.|$|E
60|$|To us {{it seemed}} that so good a man, so kind a heart, so simple a nature, {{deserved}} rest and peace in a grave sacred from the intrusion of prying eyes, and believed that <b>he</b> himself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to <b>have</b> it so, but peradventure our wisdom was at fault in this regard.|$|R
60|$|It {{was close}} upon the hour, and the tickets were being examined, when Mr. Rolles beheld this other fellow-passenger ushered by several porters into his place; certainly, {{there was not}} another {{man in the world}} whom <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> - for it was old John Vandeleur, the ex-Dictator.|$|R
2500|$|When {{he became}} President of MIT, Karl Compton [...] "courted" [...] Slater to chair the Physics Department.

25|$|Former {{councillor}} Rob Davis led {{a protest}} march {{in support of}} Fantino. Some journalists and Ontario Finance Minister Greg Sorbara, whose government shortly afterwards appointed Fantino as Commissioner of Emergency Management, speculated that Miller played an influential behind-the-scenes role in the board's decision not to renew Fantino's contract. Miller denied this, saying that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the board to reserve any decision until September.|$|E
25|$|The TV special, {{with the}} teleplay by Romeo Muller, {{introduced}} several new characters {{inspired by the}} song's lyrics. Muller told an interviewer {{shortly before his death}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to base the teleplay on May's original book, but could not find a copy. Other than Burl Ives, all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan.|$|E
25|$|Since President Lincoln had {{approved}} the Red River Campaign plan before promoting Ulysses Grant to Lieutenant-General and appointed him General-in-Chief, Grant {{felt he could}} not stop the campaign. Grant did try to hurry its execution because <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to use a 10,000man force which was diverted to the campaign to reinforce Major-General William Sherman in Sherman's drive from north Georgia to Atlanta. Grant also {{would have liked to}} have pinned down more Confederate troops in Alabama with an attack on the Confederate stronghold at Mobile.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} made {{a sign of}} assent, {{and sitting}} down upon a ledge of rock took out a cigar. Wyllard now felt more sure of him, since {{it was evident that}} had he meditated any treachery <b>he</b> <b>would</b> naturally <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> him to make the visit unattended. In any case, it seemed likely that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> something to eat in his camp.|$|R
60|$|The fellow {{offered to}} show him to the smoking-room when he had done; and {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> to return at once to his perilous treasure, he had not the courage to refuse, and was shown downstairs to the black, gas-lit cellar, which formed, and possibly still forms, the divan of the Craven Hotel.|$|R
60|$|For the present, the {{question}} in his mind was whether he should continue at his present work, which at any rate sufficed to keep him, or should seek other employment. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> greatly <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> some life of action,--something that would fit him better to bear the fatigues and hardships of war,--but he saw no prospect of obtaining any such position.|$|R
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Tobruk, the Axis gained a port nearer the Aegean–Crete route and {{a large amount of}} British supplies. If the British could not stop the Germans in Egypt, they would take the Suez Canal (forcing Britain to use supply lines twice as long, often {{targeted}} by U-boats) and potentially drive for the oilfields in the Middle East. Hitler rewarded Rommel with a promotion to the rank of field-marshal, the youngest German officer ever to achieve this rank. Rommel remarked <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> Hitler had given him another panzer division instead.|$|E
25|$|Haig, now {{reverting}} to his substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel, continued as {{the commanding officer}} of the 17th Lancers until 1903. The regiment was supposed to stay in South Africa {{but in the end}} returned home sooner than planned. Haig was appointed Inspector-General of Cavalry in India (<b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> command of the cavalry brigade at Aldershot, where French was now GOC), but had first to spend a year on garrison duty at Edinburgh until the previous incumbent completed his term. Haig was appointed Aide-de-Camp to King Edward VII in 1902, remaining in this position until 1904.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Buffett {{entered the}} Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> {{to focus on}} his {{business}} ventures; however, he enrolled due to pressure from his father. Warren studied there {{for two years and}} joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. He then transferred to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln where at 19, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. After being rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in Economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance.|$|E
60|$|We found Mr. Enderton {{standing}} by himself. His face {{was of the}} hue of wood ashes, his expression haggard. He {{reminded me of a}} man who had fallen from a considerable height, and who had been frightened and stupefied by the shock. I comprehended the situation without difficulty, and felt quite sure that had he <b>had</b> the choice <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> a thrashing to the plain talk he had heard from Mrs. Lecks.|$|R
6000|$|Johnson {{was really}} {{anxious to get}} Mr. Polly [...] "into something." [...] His was a {{reserved}} honest character, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> really <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to see his lodger doing things for himself than receive his money for housekeeping. He hated waste, anybody's waste, much more than he desired profit. But Mrs. Johnson was all for Mr. Polly's loitering. She seemed much the more human and likeable of the two to Mr. Polly.|$|R
60|$|Zaki at once {{set to work}} {{to collect}} the {{articles}} needed for the journey; and Gregory obtained, from the transport, another horse and two native saddles. He was well satisfied with his own animal; and, even had he found in the transport yard a better horse, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> his own, as they were accustomed to each other. He bought pistols for himself and Zaki, and a matchlock for the latter.|$|R
25|$|Reith's {{attempts}} to broadcast statements by the Labour Party and TUC leaders were {{blocked by the}} Government; in partial response, he personally vetoed a statement that Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, wished to make, {{in the belief that}} allowing such a statement would give Winston Churchill both motive and opportunity to take over the BBC—something which Churchill had continually advocated {{since the beginning of the}} Strike. Reith admitted to his staff that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to allow the Labour and TUC leaders to broadcast directly. A post-strike analysis carried out by the BBC's Programme Correspondence Department reported that of those polled, 3,696 commended the BBC's coverage, whilst 176 were critical.|$|E
25|$|On September 20, 1918, while hearing confessions, Padre Pio had {{his first}} {{occurrence}} of the stigmata: bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. This phenomenon continued for fifty years, {{until the end of}} his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata smelled of perfume or flowers, a phenomenon mentioned in stories of the lives of several saints and {{often referred to as the}} odour of sanctity. Though Padre Pio said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news about the stigmatic friar began to spread in the secular world. Padre Pio’s wounds are said to have been examined by many people, including physicians.|$|E
25|$|Foch {{had earlier}} refused to send 4 French {{divisions}} to Flanders but now redeployed Maistre’s Tenth French Army to the Somme sector, freeing up British forces. Foch {{was given the}} title of Generalissimo (<b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> “Commander-in-Chief”) (14 April) to give him more clout over Petain, who was still reluctant to release French reserves. Eventually, later in the year, Petain would simply be placed under Foch’s command, although Haig and Pershing retained their right of appeal to their own governments. During a renewed attack (17 April) Foch {{drew attention to the}} valour of the British at First Ypres and refused to send further French reinforcements so as to keep a strategic reserve.|$|E
5000|$|In the film, Kurelek {{reflects}} on his artistic development under the disapproving {{eyes of his}} father. Many paintings besides The Maze are featured in the film, accompanied by the insights of Kurelek and others, including three psychiatrists and a priest. Members of Kurelek’s family are also interviewed, including his wife, sister, mother, and father, [...] "who begrudgingly admits pride in his son’s success, though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a more masculine and lucrative occupation for William." ...|$|R
60|$|Along {{the banks}} and braes of bonny Doune he slowly moved, with weary limbs; looking up to the huge pile of the majestic castle in sickening of heart at the doubt {{that was about to}} become a certainty, and that {{involved}} the happiness or the absolute misery of his sister's life. Nay, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to find that she had perished in her resistance, rather than have become wife to such a man as Walter Stewart.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{exhibitions}} {{were held}} in Paris for example in the galleries Arnaud, Drouin, Jeanne Bucher, Louis Carré, Galerie de France, and every year at the [...] "Salon des Réalités Nouvelles" [...] and [...] "Salon de Mai" [...] where the paintings of all these artists could be seen. At the Drouin gallery one could see Jean Le Moal, Gustave Singier, Alfred Manessier, Roger Bissière, Wols and others. A wind blew over the capital when Georges Mathieu decided to hold two exhibitions: L'Imaginaire in 1947 at the Palais du Luxembourg which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prefer</b> to call abstraction lyrique to impose the name and then HWPSMTB with (Hans Hartung, Wols, Francis Picabia, François Stahly sculptor, Georges Mathieu, Michel Tapié and Camille Bryen) in 1948. In March 1951 was held the larger exhibition Véhémences confrontées in the gallery Nina Dausset where {{for the first time}} were presented side to side French and American abstract artists. It was organised by the critic Michel Tapié, whose role in the defense of this movement was of the highest importance. With these events, he déclared that « the lyrical abstraction is born ».|$|R
25|$|Masude quickly {{climbed the}} Nikkatsu ranks {{to become a}} top director. The {{financial}} success of his star-studded action films, beginning with Yujiro Ishihara in Rusty Knife, ensured that studio heads would continue to assign him top stars and action films. He continued to write for his own films but mostly due to time constraints as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to hire other writers, which did {{after he left the}} studio. The films were made quickly and largely without studio supervision. In one example, Ishihara began drawing huge audiences with The Guy Who Started a Storm which was released during the 1957 New Years season. Theatre owners were displeased that there were no further Ishihara films scheduled before Golden Week of the following year. The studio then order Masuda to make a film with Ishihara in 10 days. Producer Takiko Mizunoe brought him a script by Shintarō Ishihara. Masuda found it much too long to be completed in the given time, rewrote it and then completed the film within 12 or 13 days.|$|E
25|$|When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman formed {{his cabinet}} {{at the end}} of 1905, Morley was made Secretary of State for India. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to have been Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this position, he was {{conspicuous}} in May 1907 and afterwards for his firmness in sanctioning extreme measures for dealing with the outbreak in India of alarming symptoms of sedition. Though he was strongly opposed by some of the more extreme members of the Radical party, on the ground of belying his democratic principles in dealing with the British Raj, his action was generally recognised as combining statesmanship with patience. While firmly opposing revolutionary propaganda, he showed his popular sympathies by appointing two distinguished native Indians to the council and taking steps for a decentralisation of the administrative government. When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman resigned in 1908 and H. H. Asquith became Prime Minister, Morley retained his post in the new cabinet; but it was thought advisable to relieve him of the burden imposed by a seat in the House of Commons, and he was transferred to the Upper House, being created a peer with the title of Viscount Morley of Blackburn, in the County Palatine of Lancaster. He was the first peer to turn down a coat of arms.|$|E

6000|$|In due course, Eustace and {{his legal}} adviser arrived at Pump-court, and, oh! how {{the heart of}} James, the barrister, swelled with pride when, {{for the first time}} in his career, he saw a real {{solicitor}} enter his chambers accompanied by a real client. <b>He</b> <b>would,</b> indeed, <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> it if the solicitor had not happened to be his twin-brother, and the client had been some other than his intimate friend; but still it was a blessed sight--a very-blessed sight! ...|$|R
50|$|The band {{soon became}} {{very popular with}} the {{squatter}} scene, left-wing student and workers' movement and was invited to numerous political events to provide the soundtrack to demonstrations, parties and rallies across Germany which often inspired the audience to translate the message into action afterwards. Thus, many buildings were seized {{after the end of}} a concert, and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts. Reiser later revealed in his autobiography that <b>he</b> sometimes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to just get away with some nice person.|$|R
6000|$|Many years! {{that sounded}} like a reprieve, and sent gladness into Ellen's heart; but somehow it did not seem in the same light to Alfred; he felt that if he were slowly going down hill and wasting away, so as to have no more health or {{strength}} in which to live differently from ever before, the length of time was not much to him, and in his sickly impatience <b>he</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> that it should not be what Betsey kindly called 'a lingering job.' ...|$|R
