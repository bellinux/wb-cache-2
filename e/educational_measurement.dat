40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was to develop teacher performance in <b>educational</b> <b>measurements</b> and evaluations through self-monitoring strategies. Participants comprised 10 administrators and teachers. Qualitative data was collected from informal interviews and a focus group. The {{research was}} conducted in five steps for improving self-monitoring. The results of this research found that the self-monitoring strategies showed that teachers learnt best from the concrete example in the report on test preparation for the Basic Education National test. Teachers intended to learn about learning <b>educational</b> <b>measurements</b> and evaluations through participation in activities. By applying the self-monitoring process, teachers gained further knowledge in learning measurements and evaluations, participating in action planning, as well as greater realization and awareness {{of the importance of}} learning measurements and evaluations...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2006, it was {{announced}} that {{a small percentage of the}} SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers' being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of the 4,411 students who received an incorrect score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when the College Board and Pearson <b>Educational</b> <b>Measurement,</b> the company that scored the SATs, announced they would pay $2.85 million into a settlement fund. Under the agreement each student could either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she felt the damage was greater. A similar scoring error occurred on a secondary school admission test in 2010–2011 when the ERB (Educational Records Bureau) announced after the admission process was over that an error had been made in the scoring of the tests of 2010 (17%) of the students who had taken the Independent School Entrance Examination for admission to private secondary schools for 2011. Commenting on the effect of the error on students' school applications in The New York Times, David Clune, President of the ERB stated [...] "It is a lesson we all learn at some point—that life isn't fair." ...|$|E
