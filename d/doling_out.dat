5|$|Sharon Hawkins (Michele Morgan) – Virgil's older sister, Sharon attends college, but {{she still}} lives at home. She volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center. While they do argue frequently, Sharon and Virgil really do care about each other and are quick {{to come to the}} other's defense if one of them is in danger. After their mother died, Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house after, mostly when it comes to <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> chores between her and her brother and the cooking (which, at least {{according}} to Virgil, Sharon is not good at).|$|E
5|$|Keeping up {{the longstanding}} {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, which seemed to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused of violating the Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was clogging these pipes he would need to answer for it.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although {{he noted that}} the episode was [...] "not Gilligan's best work" [...] and that the writing was [...] "a little spotty", he said [...] "the vibe [...] is very well done." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't {{sitting on the edge of}} my seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a good job at <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, describing it as a [...] "rather fun tale".|$|E

500|$|Zoth said episode 20, {{in which}} [...] "Akane finally snaps", {{was one of}} his most {{expected}} parts from the story. [...] Zoth also said, [...] "Akane has grown as a character, and a detective, and {{in a bit of a}} heavy-handed move, she’s shown transforming into Kogami in Ginoza's eyes". Similarly, Bamboo Dong said, [...] "No longer the dull and meek woman she was for over half the series, [...] now confident and capable, <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> commands that are instantly followed and respected by her comrades". Dong said Akane is an appealing main character who is [...] "worth paying attention to, and her presence on screen is the perfect complement to the much more complex side characters that populate the show". Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku said he found Akane more interesting than Kogami because her overall development. In anticipation for the movie, IGN writer Miranda Sanchez expected to see more interactions between Kogami and Akane due to Psycho-Pass 2 lacking that. However, she noted this bond was not fully explored. Jacob Chapman enjoyed her interactions with Kogami in the role such as one dialogue where Akane starts comparing Kogami with the late villain Makishima. Alexandria Hill from Otaku USA [...] also praised the first interactions between these two characters for its action as it contrasted the heavy use of dialogue in the beginning.|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me {{what you want me to}} buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
500|$|While Favre's {{importance}} {{had initially}} sprung from his influence with the native tribes, particularly the Choctaws, {{as the power}} of these people declined he became much more important as an intermediary during the turbulent times of transition from Spanish to American rule in West Florida. [...] During this period early in the 19th century, the Spanish authorities were losing their hold on West Florida {{for a variety of}} reasons. One such reason was piracy, while another was American encroachment following the Louisiana Purchase. Many Americans felt that West Florida should have been included in the purchase. [...] One means used by Spain to attempt to hold on to this region was to commission several important settlers to work for their government. In this regard, Favre was assigned to confirm land deeds that the Spanish were <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> at an accelerated rate, to attempt to stem the tide of American encroachment. Favre also provided intelligence and military maps to the Spanish concerning the activities of not only the Americans, who were applying pressure from outside the jurisdiction, but also rebels along the Pearl River and nearby coast. The rebels, led by Reuben Kemper and his brothers, were causing difficulties from within, and had been attempting to pull West Florida from Spanish control for several years. Under the Spanish, Favre became known as the commander of the District of Bay St. Louis. Many of the land titles that were awarded by Favre were later reviewed by the United States government and appear in the collection of American state papers.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{also held}} a one-off concert for ArtRave: The Artpop Ball inside a six-storey vending machine at Doritos' annual South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival at Austin, Texas. The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop. The performance received complaints about [...] "glamorizing" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News: [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga herself told Today [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ceremonials {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Laura Foster of Clash called the album a [...] "confident, cohesive effort" [...] {{and found that}} [...] "he steady hand of Paul Epworth on production has helped Florence to take the winning formula of her distinctive vocals and melodies, the twinkling harps and thundering drums, and augment it with string arrangements, subtle electro touches, and gospel choirs." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson praised it as a [...] "confident, unflinching tour de force" [...] and commented, [...] "If her acclaimed 2009 debut, Lungs, was a scrappy shrine to survival and empowerment, its follow-up is a baroque cathedral, bedecked with ornate tapestries made of ghostly choirs, pagan-rhythmic splendor, {{and a whole lot}} of harp." [...] AllMusic critic James Christopher Monger wrote, [...] "Bigger and bolder than 2009's excellent Lungs, Ceremonials rolls in like fog over the Thames, <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> a heavy-handed mix of Brit-pop-infused neo-soul anthems and lush, movie trailer-ready ballads that fuse the bluesy, electro-despair of Adele with the ornate, gothic melodrama of Kate Bush and Floodland-era Sisters of Mercy." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{company of}} Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was {{organized}} somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept {{of which was}} just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in 1594, after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: Philip Henslowe functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by <b>doling</b> <b>out</b> payments and loans. (The silver lining in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. (Francis Langley, builder of the Swan Theatre, operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.) ...|$|E
