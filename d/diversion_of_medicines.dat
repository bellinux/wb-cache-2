40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{rise in the}} nonmedical {{of pharmaceutical}} opioids has presented the United States with a substantial public health problem. Nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers has become increasingly prevalent in the US {{over the last two}} decades, and <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> obtained by prescription is assumed to be a major source of supply for nonmedical opioid use. Policymakers striving to protect population health by ameliorating the adverse outcomes of nonmedical use of opioid analgesics could benefit from a systems-level model which reflects the complexity of the system and incorporates the full range of available data. To address this need, the current project describes the conceptualization and development of a System Dynamics model that is used to complement and leverage results from existing research. Additional testing is needed to authenticate preliminary intervention simulation results, which suggest that a reduction in the initiation of nonmedical use may have a more profound impact on the total number of opioid overdose deaths than more tamper-resistant formulations, decreases in opioid prescribing, or decreases in rates of abuse among medical users. Results indicate that System Dynamics can help to identify points of high leverage for policy interventions as well as bring attention to the unanticipated negative consequences of these interventions...|$|E

C., USA; 3 Africa Fighting Malaria, Cambridge, UKBackground: Antimalarial {{medicine}} diversion {{has been}} seen across numerous African markets {{and can lead to}} serious stock-outs in the public sector, which can be dangerous to countries with high burdens of disease. This study discusses the numbers of diverted antimalarial medicines from several samplings in Africa. Methods: A total of 894 samples of antimalarial medicines were covertly purchased from private pharmacies in 11 African cities from late 2007 to early 2010. All medicine packages were visually inspected for correctness, in line with the protocol established by the Global Pharma Health Fund e. V. Minilab&reg;, as well as for signs of diversion. Results: Overall, 6. 5 % (58 out of 894) of collected antimalarial medicines were found to be diverted, comprising 2. 4 % (5 / 210) of medicines collected in 2007 from six African cities, all of which were artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs); 2. 3 % (3 / 129) of medicines collected in 2008 in Lagos, Nigeria, two of which were ACTs; and 9 % (50 / 555) of medicines collected in 2010 in 10 African cities, 35 of which were ACTs. ACT was by far the most diverted treatment in this study: 15. 6 % (5 / 32) of ACTs collected in 2007, and 30. 7 % (35 / 114) of ACTs collected in 2010. Conclusion: The number of diverted ACTs over the 33 months covered by this study is probably related to the laudable provision of vast amounts of donated or low-priced ACTs across African nations and the actual increase in diversion of these medicines into the private sector. The small sample sizes in this study might exaggerate any problem, but a potentially serious problem may well exist. To the extent that <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> exacerbates stock-outs, this is a public health problem, and a perversion of donor intent, but there are other possible harms of diversion, such as increased trade in counterfeit, and expired and otherwise substandard medicines.

40|$|Background—Nonmedical use of {{pharmaceutical}} opioid analgesics (POA) increased {{dramatically over the}} past two decades and remains a major health problem in the United States, contributing to over 16, 000 accidental poisoning deaths in 2010. Objectives—Create a systems oriented theory/model to explain the historical behaviors of interest, including the various populations of nonmedical opioid users and accidental overdose mortality within those populations. Use the model to explore policy interventions including tamper resistant drug formulations and strategies for reducing <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> opioid <b>medicines.</b> Methods—A system dynamics model was constructed to represent the population of people who initiate nonmedical POA usage. The model incorporates use trajectories including development of use disorders, transitions from reliance on informal sharing to paying for drugs, transition from oral administration to tampering to facilitate non-oral routes of administration, and transition to heroin use by some users, as well as movement into and out of the population through quitting and mortality. Empirical support was drawn from national surveys (NSDUH, TEDS, MTF, and ARCOS) and published studies. Results—Model was able to replicate the patterns seen in the historical data for each user population, and the associated overdose deaths. Policy analysis showed that both tamper resistant formulations and interventions to reduce informal sharing could significantly reduce nonmedical user populations and overdose deaths in the long term, but the modeled effect sizes require additional empirical support. Conclusion—Creating a theory/model that can explain system behaviors at a systems level scale is feasible and facilitates thorough evaluation of policy interventions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Unofficial {{payments}} in health services {{around the world}} are widespread and as varied as the health systems in which they occur. We reviewed the main lessons from social audits of petty corruption in health services in South Asia (Bangladesh, Pakistan), Africa (Uganda and South Africa) and Europe (Baltic States). Methods The social audits varied in purpose and scope. All covered representative sample communities and involved household interviews, focus group discussions, institutional reviews of health facilities, interviews with service providers and discussions with health authorities. Most audits questioned households about views on health services, perceived corruption in the services, and use of government and other health services. Questions to service users asked about making official and unofficial payments, amounts paid, service delivery indicators, and satisfaction with the service. Results Contextual differences between the countries affected the forms of petty corruption and factors related to it. Most households in all countries held negative views about government health services and many perceived these services as corrupt. There was little evidence that better off service users were more likely to make an unofficial payment, or that making such a payment was associated with better or quicker service; those who paid unofficially to health care workers were not more satisfied with the service. In South Asia, where we conducted repeated social audits, only a minority of households chose to use government health services and their use declined over time in favour of other providers. Focus groups indicated that reasons for avoiding government health services included the need to pay for supposedly free services and the non-availability <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> in facilities, often perceived as due to <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> the supplied <b>medicines.</b> Conclusions Unofficial expenses for medical care represent a disproportionate cost for vulnerable families; the very people who need to make use of supposedly free government services, and are a barrier to the use of these services. Patient dissatisfaction due to petty corruption may contribute to abandonment of government health services. The social audits informed plans for tackling corruption in health services. </p...|$|R
