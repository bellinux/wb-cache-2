The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in kelvins. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers (labeled in blue). Note that the colors in this <b>displayed</b> <b>file</b> are being specified using sRGB. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately colored because they are out of the gamut of sRGB therefore they have been interpreted. Also note how the D65 label is not an ideal 6500-kelvin blackbody because it is based on atmospheric filtered daylight.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method to classify the binary document into scalar type or vector type. Any image can be basically classified into 1. Vector image 2. Scalar Image. Vector images are represented as <b>display</b> <b>file</b> containing {{set of drawing}} primitive commands (like move, line, curve, rectangle, circle etc) along with related parameters (like coordinates, angle, radius etc.). Scalar images are represented as pixel information ex. Bitmap. Thus memory required to store vector image is very less than of scalar image. Vector image is best to represent text since letters of text are generally formed by set of primitive drawing commands. If the vector image portions of a binary document are identified, then it can be represented as <b>display</b> <b>file</b> by the <b>display</b> <b>file</b> Generating-programs. Remaining portion of the file i. e. scalar portion can be compressed and kept/sent separately. Initially the binary document images are segmented using Constrained Run Length Algorithm (CRLA) which splits the entire binary image into labeled segment blocks. Next step is to calculate the features for each block according to the block size and data transition (zero-to-one / one-to-zero). Next, the block – features are fed into input layer of Feed Forward Neural Network(FFNN) and it is trained using back propagation method to train the network to classify content of each block into scalar or vector type. Hidden layer and neurons in hidden layer can be developed using constructive approach. FFNN training can be improved using momentum, learning rate and bias if necessary...|$|R
