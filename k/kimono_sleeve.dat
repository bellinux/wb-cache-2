50|$|Men's <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves</b> are {{attached}} to the body of the kimono with {{no more than a few}} inches unattached at the bottom, unlike the women's style of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the <b>kimono.</b> Men's <b>sleeves</b> are less deep than women's <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves</b> to accommodate the obi around the waist beneath them, whereas on a woman's kimono, the long, unattached bottom of the sleeve can hang over the obi without getting in the way.In the modern era, the principal distinctions between men's kimono are in the fabric. The typical men's kimono is a subdued, dark color; black, dark blues, greens, and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte. Some have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono. More casual kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors, such as lighter purples, greens and blues. Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors such as fuchsia.|$|R

These participants are called kurione-zoku (extra=lit. [...] "clionidae gang") because their furisode-like appearance resembles that of clionidae.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bungalow}} apron is {{an item of}} women's at-home clothing.

5000|$|The {{first full}} Clive {{collection}} {{was launched in}} January 1965. It was greeted warmly by the reviewer for The Times, who described it as setting [...] "a mood of high sophistication" [...] with its tunic suits, collarless coats with <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves</b> and suits with culotte skirts. Eveningwear included sarong and sari-style dresses and an evening blouse made of chiffon and 30 yards of ribbon.

6000|$|Because he had {{wished to}} be kind to people, {{because he had been}} pitiful toward Goaty Zapp, Mr. Wrenn was able to {{understand}} that she was trying to be a kindly big sister to him, and he said [...] "Good night, Istra," [...] and smiled in a lively way and walked out. He got out the smile by wrenching his nerves, for which he paid in agony as he knelt by his bed, acknowledging that Istra would never love him and that therefore he was not to love, would be a fool to love, never would love her--and seeing again her white arms softly shadowed by her green <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kenbu (剣舞, occ. 剣武) is {{performed}} in hakama and kimono, wearing tabi, {{a type of}} divided-toe socks. Various other items {{may be used in}} the costume, including hachimaki (a headband used to keep the dancer's hair pulled back) and tasuki (a white cloth strip which ties the <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves</b> out of the way). When these other items are used, a white cloth belt is traditionally worn over the hakama ties. This white belt was originally worn by samurai preparing to go into battle and served to reinforce the hakama ties so that, in the event they were cut, the samurai would not find himself with his pants suddenly heaped around his ankles.|$|R
5000|$|Cheshire {{was one of}} the new villains {{appearing}} in season 5 of the Teen Titans animated series. She appears as a recruit of the Brotherhood of Evil. She resembles her comic incarnation, just apparently younger with a cat mask. She has the ability to turn invisible except for the eyes and grin of her mask, much like the Cheshire Cat in Alice In Wonderland. She is also extremely skilled at martial arts, and uses her long <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves,</b> metal claws and her long hair as her primary weapons. She first captures Speedy for the Brotherhood, and later helps in defeating Herald inside the Brotherhood HQ, but she is not seen {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|R

5000|$|For example, certain {{movements}} {{are designed with}} long <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves</b> in mind; certain motions are intended to move sleeves {{out of the way}} or to prevent them from becoming dirtied in the process of making, serving or partaking of tea. Other motions are designed to allow for the straightening of the kimono and hakama. The silk fukusa cloths are designed to be folded and tucked into the obi (sash); when no obi is worn, a regular belt must be substituted or the motions cannot be performed properly. Kaishi and smaller silk cloths known as [...] (kobukusa) are tucked into the breast of the kimono; fans are tucked into the obi. When Western clothes are worn, the wearer must find other places to keep these objects. The <b>sleeves</b> of the <b>kimono</b> also function as pockets, and used kaishi are folded and placed into them.|$|R
25|$|Kimonos for {{men should}} fall {{approximately}} to the ankle without tucking. A woman's kimono has additional length {{to allow for}} the ohashori, the tuck that can be seen under the obi, which is used to adjust the kimono to the wearer. An ideally tailored <b>kimono</b> has <b>sleeves</b> that fall to the wrist when the arms are lowered.|$|R
50|$|After betraying Soul Society, Gin {{switches}} his captain's attire for {{a similar}} but unmarked garment. He now wears a long, white robe over his normal Soul Reaper hakama. The hilt of his zanpakutō visibly protrudes from under the robe through the opening down to his waist. Later, Ichimaru is seen wearing a white hakama like the arrancar, instead of the black one he first appears in. Gin wears his robe open in a narrow 'V' down to his waist, closed to below the hips, then open again to the hem, which falls about mid-calf. His robe has long bell sleeves where he hides his hands as is done with <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The lining of the robe and edges or layers of the under-robe(s) appear black. From other examples, it is likely he is also wearing black tabi with white waraji. His zanpakutō is not visible with this outfit.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignSherry HaarNell Donnelly {{created a}} stylish, practical, {{affordable}} pink gingham apron frock in 1916, selling out her {{first order of}} 216 dresses the first morning at $ 1 apiece at Peck’s Dry Goods Company in Kansas City. This study investigates the forces behind the success of her dress, and finds that during the early 20 th century, woman’s role became modernized, shifting from that of producer to consumer, and that clothing—in particular, the housedress—was a visible reflection of this shift. Specific attributes contributed {{to the success of}} the apron frock in design and social perspective. First, her housedress incorporated current design elements including <b>kimono</b> <b>sleeves,</b> empire waistline, waist yoke, asymmetrical front closure, and ruffle trimmings sensibly. Socially, mass advertising and mass media articles promoted fashion consciousness in women to look as pretty as those in the ad or article. As a result, integrating trendy design elements into an affordable housedress along with the growing demand for a stylish, yet practical housedress guaranteed the success of Nelly Don’s pink gingham apron frock. As such, the availability and value of the apron frock provide a vivid illustration of woman’s shifting role: its popularity as an alternative to old-fashioned Mother Hubbard housedresses demonstrates both women’s new consumer awareness as well as their growing involvement in the public sphere...|$|R

5000|$|Wakashū (Japanese: , [...] "young person", {{although}} {{never used}} for girls) {{is a historical}} Japanese term indicating an adolescent boy; more specifically, a boy between the ages at which his head was partially shaven (maegami) (about 5-10 years of age), at which point a boy exited early childhood and could begin formal education, apprenticeship, or employment outside the home, and the genpuku coming of age ceremony (mid-teens through early 20s), which marked the transition to adulthood. During this period, the wakashū wore a distinctive hairstyle, with a small shaved portion at the crown {{of the head and}} long forelocks at front and sides, and typically wore <b>kimono</b> with open <b>sleeves</b> (wakiake); boys from wealthier families could wear furisode. After the coming of age ceremony, the forelocks were shaved off, giving the adult male hairstyle (chonmage), and the boy assumed the adult male style of <b>kimono</b> with rounded <b>sleeves.</b> Although any person would be clearly classified as a child, wakashū or adult, the timing of both boundaries of the wakashū period were relatively flexible, giving families and patrons the ability to accommodate the development and circumstances of the individual boy.|$|R

25|$|Kimonos {{range from}} {{extremely}} formal to casual. The level of formality of women's kimono is determined mostly by {{the pattern of}} the fabric, and color. Young women's <b>kimonos</b> have longer <b>sleeves,</b> signifying that they are not married, and tend to be more elaborate than similarly formal older women's kimono. Men's kimonos are usually one basic shape and are mainly worn in subdued colors. Formality is also determined by the type and color of accessories, the fabric, and the number or absence of kamon (family crests), with five crests signifying extreme formality. Silk is the most desirable, and most formal, fabric. Kimonos made of fabrics such as cotton and polyester generally reflect a more casual style.|$|R
50|$|Many women {{celebrate}} {{this day}} by wearing furisode, {{a style of}} <b>kimono</b> with long <b>sleeves</b> that hang down, and zōri sandals. Since most are unable {{to put on a}} kimono by themselves due to the intricacies involved, many choose to visit a beauty salon to dress and to set their hair. A full set of formal clothing is expensive, so it is usually either borrowed from a relative or rented rather than bought especially for the occasion. Men sometimes also wear traditional dress (e.g. dark kimono with hakama), but nowadays many men wear formal Western clothes such as a suit and tie more often than the traditional hakama. After the ceremony, the young adults often celebrate in groups by going to parties or going out drinking.|$|R
5000|$|Like Eastwood's western setting character, Mifune plays a ronin with no name. When pressed, {{he gives}} the {{pseudonym}} Sanjuro Kuwabatake (meaning [...] "Thirty-year-old Mulberry-field"), a reference to his age and something he sees through a window. The convention of hiding the character's arms from view is shared as well, with Mifune's character typically wearing his arms inside his <b>kimono,</b> leaving the <b>sleeves</b> empty. Prior to signing on to Fistful, Eastwood had seen Kurosawa's film and {{was impressed by the}} character. During filming, he did not emulate Mifune's performance beyond what was already in the script. He also insisted on removing some of the dialogue in the original script, making the character more silent and thus adding to his mystery. As the trilogy progressed, the character became even more silent and stoic.|$|R
