50|$|The dual-signal <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> {{torque wrench}} was {{patented}} by the Australian Warren and Brown company in 1948.|$|E
50|$|The wrench {{functions}} in the same general way as an ordinary beam torque wrench. There are two beams both connected to the head end but only one through which torque is applied. The load carrying beam is straight and runs from head to handle, it deflects when torque is applied. The other beam (indicating beam) runs directly above the <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> for {{about half of the}} length then bends away to the side at an angle from the <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam.</b> The indicating beam retains its orientation and shape during operation, because of this there is relative displacement between the two beams. The <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> torque wrench differs from the ordinary beam torque wrench in how it utilises this relative displacement. Attached to the <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> is a scale and onto that is fitted a wedge which can be slid {{along the length of the}} scale parallel to the flexing beam, this wedge is used to set the desired torque. Directly facing this wedge is the side of the angled indicating beam. From this side protrudes a pin, which acts as a trigger for another pin, the latter pin is spring loaded, and fires out of the end of the indicating beam once the trigger pin contacts the adjustable wedge. This firing makes a loud click and gives a visual indication that the desired torque has been met. The indicator pin can be reset by simply pressing it back into the indicating beam.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{three-dimensional}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of interactions of overdense, radiatively cooling and adiabatic jets with dense, compact clouds in frontal and off-axis collisions. Calculated {{for a set of}} parameters which are particularly appropriate to protostellar jets, our results indicate that the interaction produces important transient and permanent effects in the jet morphology. In off-axis interactions, the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> initially describes a C-shaped trajectory around the curved jet/cloud contact discontinuity but the deflection angle tends to decrease with time as the beam slowly penetrates the cloud. Later, when the jet has penetrated most of the cloud extension the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> fades and the jet resumes its original direction of propagation. During the interaction, a weak chain of internal knots develops along the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> and the velocity field initially has a complex structure that later evolves to a more uniform distribution. The average velocity of the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> is consisten...|$|R

50|$|In an AOM a {{laser beam}} is caused to {{interact}} with a high frequency ultrasonic sound wave inside an optically polished block of crystal or glass (the interaction medium). By carefully orientating the laser {{with respect to the}} sound waves the beam can be made to reflect off the acoustic wave-fronts (Bragg diffraction). Therefore, when the sound field is present the <b>beam</b> is <b>deflected</b> and when it is absent the beam passes through undeviated. By switching the sound field on and off very rapidly the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> appears and disappears in response (digital modulation). By varying the amplitude of the acoustic waves the intensity of the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> can similarly be modulated (analogue modulation).|$|R
50|$|It {{employs the}} {{principle}} of applying torque to a <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> rather than a coil spring. This is claimed to help prolong {{the accuracy of the}} wrench throughout its working life, with a greater safety margin on maximum loading and provides more consistent and accurate readings throughout the range of each wrench. The operator can both hear the signal click and see a visible indicator when the desired torque is reached.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new thermal bimorph {{actuator}} {{for large}} out-of-plane displacement is designed, fabricated and tested. The <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> {{is composed of}} polyimide, heater, and polyvinyl difluorides with tetrafluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE). The large difference of {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) of two polymer layers (polyimide and PVDF-TrFE) can generate a large deflection with relatively small temperature rising. Compared to the most conventional micro actuators based on MEMS (micro-electro mechanical system) technology, a large displacement, over 1 mm at 20 mW, could be achieved. The proposed actuator can find applications where a large vertical displacement is needed while keeping compact overall device size, such as a micro zooming lens, micro mirror, micro valve and optical application...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a dynamic adaptive grid method for general two and three dimensional static and transient fluid flow problems solved over structured grids. The technique automatically manipulates the location of grid points within the domain of interest to concentrate cells in regions of high solution activity, thus aiming to improve the accuracy of the overall simulation for a given number of initial grid cells. To achieve this aim the Laplace Poisson Equidistribution equation is used. Furthermore, the work also covers different types and treatment of weight functions needed to represent areas of high solution activity and a range of techniques necessary to make the use of adaptive grids practical, including geometry modelling and grid quality control. The technique is implemented on simple functions and within the commercial CFD code PHOENICS, on fluid flow problems ranging from convection driven flows to shock capturing. The ability of the technique to be used for general grid manipulation is demonstrated by using it to couple PHOENICS with a stress code in the simulation of a <b>deflecting</b> <b>beam</b> in a uniform flow. In addition, a novel technique to adapt grids to solution phenomena using neural nets is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{monitoring}} {{the state of}} a crystal which is suspended in a solution is described which includes providing a light source for emitting {{a beam of light}} along an optical axis. A collimating lens is arranged along the optical axis for collimating the emitted beam to provide a first collimated light beam consisting of parallel light rays. By passing the first collimated light beam through a transparent container, a number of the parallel light rays are deflected off the surfaces of said crystal being monitored according to the refractive index gradient to provide a <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> of <b>deflected</b> light rays. A focusing lens is arranged along optical axis for focusing the deflected rays towards a desired focal point. A knife edge is arranged in a predetermined orientation at the focal point; and a screen is provided.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} at the CERN SPS with 120 GeV/c stored proton beams to assess the possibility of beam halo collimation assisted by bent crystals. A bent crystal was used to deflect horizontally by an angle of about 170 mu rad the beam halo protons in channeling states directing them into a 60 cm long tungsten absorber. The halo loss rate due to nuclear inelastic interactions of protons in the aligned crystal was up to five times smaller than for its amorphous orientation. Channeled fractions, (75 +/- 4) % and (85 +/- 5) % for the two tested silicon crystals, were measured by intercepting the <b>deflected</b> <b>beam</b> with another collimator located between the crystals and the absorber.

The collimating system was studied only after the beam steerer had been fully built and tested. It is based on the photorefractive amplification of a beamlet selected by a shutter array.

The ion beam extraction assembly includes a tectrode construction in which an extraction electrode adjacent the ion source aperture is split into two halves. A differential voltage is applied across the two halves of the extraction electrode to <b>deflect</b> the ion <b>beam</b> being extracted from the ion source electrostatically.

50|$|A {{simple method}} of {{modulating}} the optical beam travelling through the acousto-optic device {{is done by}} switching the acoustic field on and off. When off the light beam is undiverted, the intensity of light directed at the Bragg diffraction angle is zero. When switched on and Bragg diffraction occurs, the intensity at the Bragg angle increases. So the acousto-optic device is modulating the output along the Bragg diffraction angle, switching it on and off. The device is operated as a modulator by keeping the acoustic wavelength (frequency) fixed and varying the drive power to vary the amount {{of light in the}} <b>deflected</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|R
