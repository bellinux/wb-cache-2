5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes <b>differential</b> <b>rotation.</b> The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for measuring electrical currents {{in the solar}} corona. It uses radioastronomical polarization measurements of a spatially-extended radio source viewed through the corona. The observations yield {{the difference in the}} Faraday rotation measure between two closely-spaced lines of sight through the corona, a measurement referred to as <b>differential</b> Faraday <b>rotation.</b> It is shown that the expression for <b>differential</b> Faraday <b>rotation</b> is proportional to the path integral ∮ n B · ds where n is the plasma density and B is the coronal magnetic field. The integral is around a closed loop (Amperian Loop) in the corona.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism that}} causes <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> is turbulent convection inside a star. Convective motion carries energy {{toward the surface}} through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries {{a portion of the}} angular velocity of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiative}} {{zone and}} the convective zone {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo <b>differential</b> <b>rotation.</b> Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences {{in the rate of}} rotation within a star may have {{a significant role in the}} generation of a stellar magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes <b>differential</b> <b>rotation.</b> The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E

With such configuration the accuracy of the computed strains is similar to that of observed displacement. 1...|$|R

The design issues concerning the development of such a versatile system are discussed, in particular how SOLIS will be made independent of a spacecraft used to obtain the data, and also how {{it can be used to}} model three types of solar ystem objects: spheroidal planets and moons, irregularly shaped asteroids and moons, and gas giants with <b>differential</b> <b>rotations.</b> Examples will be given of the initial applications of the system to the selection of Viking Orbiter imagery for Co-Investigators and researchers planning site selection, cartographyand photogrammetry for the forthcoming Mars 94 mission...|$|R
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} {{toroidal magnetic field}} to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move {{into and out of}} the line of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E

50|$|Sunspots {{are caused}} by the Sun's {{magnetic}} fields, as Joseph Larmor theorized in 1919. The solar wind is also governed by MHD.

25|$|A coronal mass {{ejection}} (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting {{primarily of}} electrons and protons (in addition to small quantities of heavier {{elements such as}} helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions. Evolution of these closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales (convection, <b>differential</b> <b>rotation,</b> meridional circulation) somehow leads to the CME. Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>rotation</b> and {{fusion of}} the ventral and dorsal {{pancreatic}} buds {{results in the}} formation of the definitive pancreas. As the duodenum rotates to the right, it carries with it the ventral pancreatic bud and common bile duct. Upon reaching its final destination, the ventral pancreatic bud fuses with the much larger dorsal pancreatic bud. At this point of fusion, the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse, forming the main pancreatic duct. The duct of the dorsal bud regresses, leaving the main pancreatic duct.|$|E
25|$|Starspots are {{regions of}} intense {{magnetic}} {{activity on the}} surface of a star. (On the Sun they are termed sunspots.) These form a visible component of magnetic flux tubes that are formed within a star's convection zone. Due to the <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> of the star, the tube becomes curled up and stretched, inhibiting convection and producing zones of lower than normal temperature. Coronal loops often form above starspots, forming from magnetic field lines that stretch out into the corona. These in turn serve to heat the corona to temperatures over a million kelvins.|$|E
40|$|The Variscan Belt in Iberia {{forms an}} “S” shape double orocline. The {{northern}} orocline, the Cantabrian Orocline (CO), is kinematically constrained as a secondary orocline and {{thought to be}} a thick-skinned feature. The geometry, kinematics and mechanism of formation of the southern orocline, the Central Iberian Orocline (CIO), are still unclear. Several geometries have been proposed for the CIO, most of them suggesting that the Morais allochthonous complex (NE Portugal) is in its core and that the axial trace is parallel to the fold axis of the last major Variscan deformation phase. The aim {{of this study is to}} get better constraints on the geometry and kinematics of the CIO, by combining paleomagnetic directions from the hypothesized hinge with structural analyses of an outcrop in the core of the orocline. Paleomagnetic directions indicate that no <b>differential</b> <b>rotations</b> occurred around the hypothesized hinge zone. The directions from syn-kinematic granites and the Cambrian Tamames limestone formation range from ENE to SE, while post-kinematic granites have directions pointing to the SE. The range of directions is interpreted as a remagnetization during rotation, which is happening because of the intrusion of the post-kinematic granites. This constrains the timing of rotation to the age of the post-kinematic granites, which is between 310 and 298 Ma. No <b>differential</b> <b>rotations</b> were observed around the hypothesized hinge. The ENE direction is similar to directions from the southern flank of the CO, while the SE direction represents the Permian direction and the end of rotation. Structural analyses indicate that three phases of deformation affected the studied outcrop. Deformation phases D 1 and D 3 are quasi-coaxial, whereas perpendicular directions would be expected in the hinge zone if the orocline is the result of buckling of an originally straight mountain belt. This implies that the orocline is not formed by buckling because of D 3 deformation. The results from the paleomagnetic directions and the structural analysis are consistent and indicate that the CIO is not a secondary orocline with the Morais complex in its core. Instead, the studied area forms part of the southern limb of the CO. This means that the geometries proposed by previous authors are not compatible with the data presented in this study. Therefore, taking into account the new data from this study, three new possible geometries for the CIO are proposed...|$|R
50|$|The Parker spiral may be {{responsible}} for the <b>differential</b> solar <b>rotation,</b> in which the Sun's poles rotate more slowly (about a 35-day rotation period) than the equator (about a 27-day rotation period). The solar wind is guided by the Sun's magnetic field and hence largely emanates from the polar regions of the Sun; the induced spiral shape of the field causes a drag torque on the poles due to the magnetic tension force.|$|R

25|$|Surface {{activity}} {{appears to}} be related to the age and rotation rate of main-sequence stars. Young stars with a rapid rate of rotation exhibit strong activity. By contrast middle-aged, Sun-like stars with a slow rate of rotation show low levels of activity that varies in cycles. Some older stars display almost no activity, which may mean they have entered a lull that is comparable to the Sun's Maunder minimum. Measurements of the time variation in stellar activity can be useful for determining the <b>differential</b> <b>rotation</b> rates of a star.|$|E
25|$|Information about helioseismic waves (such as mode {{frequencies}} and frequency-splitting) collected by transforming the oscillation {{data can be}} used to infer numerical details of internal features of the Sun such as the internal sound speed and the internal <b>differential</b> <b>rotation.</b> Equations and analytic relations such as integrals can be manipulated to relate the desired internal properties to the transformed data. The numerical methods used are adapted to the particular internal features examined so as to extract the maximum amount of information, with the least error, from the oscillations about the internal features. This process is termed helioseismic inversion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Vaiont {{landslide}} (Southern Alps, Italy) {{represents one}} of the most catastrophic landslides in the world recorded in the modern history. The landslide, occurred on 9 th October 1963, involved about 3 × 108 m 3 of rock that collapsed in an artificial lake: more than 1900 people died {{as a consequence of the}} tsunami produced by the sudden fall of the mass in the water. Despite the importance of this event, many aspects of the Vaiont rockslide still remain unexplained, particularly its fast emplacement. In order to obtain a better understanding of the Vaiont disaster, this paper focuses on the results of analogue models designed to get insights into the internal and surficial deformation patterns that characterized the sliding rock mass. Plan view reconstructions of surface model displacement reveal that the rock mass is subdivided into compartments with different relative movements and <b>differential</b> <b>rotations,</b> believed to have played a significant role in causing the fast collapse. The deformation of the analogue models, compared with geological cross sections and in-situ data, suggests that sliding of the rock mass was accomplished by the development of some new (or the reactivation of pre-existing) fractures into the rock mass...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{structural}} evolution of the Brive basin and the Paleozoic activity of surrounding major faults in the French Massif Central, we carried out a paleomagnetic study on Early Permian rocks from this basin. Positive-fold tests and solely reversed polarities indicate that the characteristic remanent magnetization {{is likely to be}} primary. Early Permian tilt-corrected site mean declinations vary from 207 °– 167 ° indicating that the Brive basin experienced internal vertical-axis rotations. On the contrary, Late Permian paleomagnetic site means exhibit a circular Fisherian distribution showing no relative rotations. Detailed analyses of Permian paleomagnetic data from five contemporaneous basins of the French Massif Central reveal that these basins share the same equatorial paleolatitude with stable Europe throughout the Permian. However, in Early Permian, three of the five basins experienced <b>differential</b> <b>rotations.</b> The Saint-Affrique basin not only suffered internal deformation during the Early Permian, but the basin as a whole underwent a full-scale counterclockwise vertical-axis block rotation with respect to stable Europe. As a consequence, paleomagnetic data from similar late orogenic basins have to be thus carefully considered for establishment of Apparent Polar Wander paths...|$|R

The Cantabrian Orocline is kinematically well constrained, but the geometry and kinematics of the Central Iberian curve are still controversial. Here, we investigate the kinematics of the Central Iberian curve, which {{plays an important role in}} the amalgamation of Pangea since it may have accommodated much of the post-collisional deformation. We have performed a paleomagnetic study on Carboniferous granitoids and Cambrian limestones within the hinge of the curve. Our paleomagnetic and rock magnetic results show a primary magnetization in the granitoids and a widespread Carboniferous remagnetization of the limestones. Syn-kinematic granitoids show ca. 70 ° counter-clockwise rotations consistent with the southern limb of the Cantabrian Orocline. Post-kinematic granitoids and Cambrian limestones show consistent inclinations but very scattered declinations suggesting that they were magnetized coevally to and after the ~ 70 ° rotation. Our results show no <b>differential</b> <b>rotations</b> between northern, southern limb and the hinge zone.
