5000|$|<b>Finger-jointed</b> lumber - solid {{dimensional}} lumber lengths {{typically are}} limited to lengths of 22 to 24 feet, but can be made longer by the technique of [...] "finger-jointing" [...] by using small solid pieces, usually 18 to 24 inches long, and joining them together using finger joints and glue to produce lengths that can be up to 36 feet long in 2×6 size. Finger-jointing also is predominant in precut wall studs. It is also an affordable alternative for non-structural hardwood that will be painted (staining would leave the finger-joints visible). Care is taken during construction to avoid nailing directly into a glued joint as stud breakage can occur.|$|E
50|$|An I-joist has {{two main}} parts, {{the web and}} flange. The web is {{sandwiched}} between a top and bottom flange, creating the “I” shape. The flange {{can be made from}} laminated veneer lumber or solid wood <b>finger-jointed</b> together for ultimate strength. It is grooved on one side to receive the web. The web is typically made from plywood, laminated veneer lumber, or oriented strand board. After sizing the webs and flanges, they are assembled with water-resistant glue by pressing the web into the top and bottom flange. After assembly, the I-joist is end-trimmed and heat-cured or left at room temperature to reach approximately equilibrium moisture content. Sizes vary according to the I-joist's intended load and span. Depths can range from 9.25 to 24 in and reach up to 80 ft in length, although 40 to 42 ft is more common. The intended use for an I-joist is for floor and roof joists, wall studs and roof rafters in both residential and commercial construction.|$|E

5000|$|Fender {{amplifiers}} {{began making}} {{a name for}} themselves with the Tweed series, so called because of their cloth covering, which is actually varnished cotton twill (tweed is a coarse woollen fabric, commonly used for jackets, coats and caps; it is often woven in a twill pattern, which is likely {{the reason for the}} confusion over naming.) They were produced {{for more than a decade}} and are now eminently collectible and praised for their sound quality. The twill was first used in 1946 on the Dual Professional a twin 10" [...] 6L6 powered model of which only 400 were made before being renamed [...] "the Super Amp" [...] in 1948. These early models are commonly referred to as [...] "TV-Fronts" [...] due to the shape of the cabinet when viewed from above. The Dual Pro was the first twin speaker amp and also the first amp to employ a <b>finger-jointed</b> pine cabinet and the first amp with a top facing control panel. The construction of the amplifiers was changed as well: the chassis are mounted to the back with the tubes pointed down, as opposed to having the chassis mounted on the top of the cabinet. This has the benefit of providing ease of access to the inside while providing a strong top.|$|E
30|$|The {{ends of the}} laminae were {{connected}} with a finger joint. The tensile strength of the <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina was {{different from that of}} a lamina without finger joints. To derive the tensile strength distribution of <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina, 30 pieces of <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae were manufactured for each grade in Table  3. The same grade laminae {{were connected}} using finger joints which were positioned {{in the middle of the}} test span (see Fig.  5). The laminae for making finger joints were selected randomly in a same lamina stock, and cut to 900  mm from 3600  mm lamina. The 900  mm laminae were used for making <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina. Thus, some <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae, 1800  mm length, were fabricated from 1 original lamina, 3600  mm length. Some <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae were fabricated from two different original laminae in a same grade. The experimental procedure for measuring tensile strength for the <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina was the same with that for the non-finger-jointed lamina.|$|E
30|$|For the MOE properties, the 15 - and 18 -mm <b>finger-jointed</b> {{laminated}} bamboo {{members were}} 11.5 and 13.7 %, respectively, {{higher than that}} of the 12 -mm <b>finger-jointed</b> groups when combining the results of finger profile orientation and lamination direction parameters. On the other hand, {{there was no significant difference}} in MOE between the <b>finger-jointed</b> members laminated in both the vertical and horizontal directions and two finger profile orientations.|$|E
30|$|LMWP resin {{penetrated}} sufficiently into <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina.|$|E
30|$|At first, the {{localized}} MOEs and KARs {{within each}} layer in virtual GLT were randomly {{picked up from}} the actual lamina database {{as long as the}} virtual GLT length. Second, localized tensile strengths were generated from the adjusted localized MOE and KAR using Eq. (6). Third, in manufacturing process of GLT, the ends of same lamina grades are connected with finger joint. Thus, <b>finger-jointed</b> strengths were applied according to lamina size and MOE lamina grade. The <b>finger-jointed</b> strengths were generated by the Weibull inverse cumulative distribution function. Weibull parameters for <b>finger-jointed</b> strengths were derived from full-scale tensile strength tests.|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperimental and {{finite element}} (FE) studies of bending {{behaviour}} of <b>finger-jointed</b> timber (Spruce) beams reinforced with CFRP material were performed. Four-point bending tests with distinct reinforcement configurations were proposed {{in order to}} determine stiffness, ductility and strength values of strengthened <b>finger-jointed</b> timber beams. The experimental results obtained under flexure showed that the external bonding of CFRP increased the load-bearing capacity of <b>finger-jointed</b> Spruce timber beams. The numerical results presented here were based on the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) available in Abaqus code, allowing the description of the progressive failure mode of the <b>finger-jointed</b> timber beams under flexural load. The FE models took the different material constitutive laws (wood, CFRP and adhesive) into account, including the bond-slip actions between finger-joints and CFRP-timber interface. The results in terms of load-mid span deflection and failure modes obtained experimentally and numerically were compared. Once the FE simulations were calibrated, the differences between experimental and predicted ultimate loads were around 4. 5 % only. A good agreement was therefore found, proving the relevance of the presented FE models to predict the load-bearing capacity and to capture the failure mode of CFRP-strengthened <b>finger-jointed</b> Spruce timber beams in bending...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, we {{paid attention to}} acoustic emission (AE) as a non-destructive method, and bending test for <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae with starved joints was performed. In addition, for installing the AE monitoring method into the production line of the <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae, a special attachment (jig) for the AE sensor installed into the production line was developed. However, this method with the jig was not efficient for the following two reasons; first, {{it is difficult to}} set the position of the jig. Secondly, it is necessary to stop the production line for the bending process. In this study, the new type jig which installed the AE sensor for the detection of the laminae with starved joints regardless of both the position and the number of finger-joint parts is designed, and the evaluation tests of <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae were conducted by using this jig. That is, the evaluation system which installed the jig was constructed, and hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtua) <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae with starved joints were prepared, and the evaluation tests of finger-joint properties were conducted by using this system. The main results are summarized as follows: The evaluation system for the <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae was constructed. This system was composed of the motive power part, the AE measurement part, and the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. For the laminae with starved joints, the peak of AE signals which were measured by this system corresponded to the position of starved joints in the <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae. In addition, for the laminae with defects such as knots and loosed grain, the peak of AE signals which were measured besides the finger-joint part corresponded to the position of defects. From these results, this evaluation system which installed the jig with AE sensor was promising for detecting of the starved joints and the presence of defects in the <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae. It was found that modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the lamine during the evaluation test with this system could be measured in the grasp of the section size of the laminae beforehand. Therefore, it was suggested that the grading for the laminae after finger-jointing based on MOE could be possible by this system...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>finger-jointed</b> ma bamboo members {{fabricated}} with lamina {{from the middle}} growth height of a bamboo culm showed better bending modulus of elasticity (MOE), being 37.9 % higher than those from the lower growth height. Moreover, a 31.1 % higher bending MOE was obtained for the laminated moso bamboo groups. However, {{there was no significant}} difference in MOE between the <b>finger-jointed</b> members made from two bamboo species and joined by two finger profile orientations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{describes}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of the}} use of CFRP material for strengthening <b>finger-jointed</b> Spruce timber beams. The corresponding experimental work was based on a four-point bending test configuration in order to characterise stiffness, ductility and strength. The results show that the external bonding of CFRP increased the ultimate load-bearing capacity of <b>finger-jointed</b> Spruce timber beams under flexure. FE simulations were also carried out, based on the cohesive zone model (CZM) available in Abaqus software to allow an accurate description of the damage evolution of the bond lines within the finger joint until failure. The FE models incorporated the different materials' nonlinear constitutive laws including bond-slip action between finger joints and CFRP-timber interface. The results indicated increases of 33. 84 % and 16. 7 % for flexural capacity and initial stiffness, respectively, in comparison with unreinforced <b>finger-jointed</b> Spruce specimens. Besides, comparisons of computed and experimental ultimate loads for all tested specimens showed that the absolute error was around 5 %. It is concluded that the developed FE models are able to predict accurately ultimate load and failure mode of <b>finger-jointed</b> Spruce timber beams strengthened with CFRP materials...|$|E
30|$|The tensile {{strength}} distributions of <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina in grades {{are shown in}} Fig.  10. The distribution of higher lamina grade fell {{to the right of}} lower grade lamina. The percentage of grip failure was decreased with increasing lamina grade and size. The <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina is known that a reduction in strength is 15 – 25 % compared to the small clear specimens [21]. Thus, the failure ratio at finger joint was high in the high quality grade which has low defects.|$|E
30|$|In GLT manufacturing, the {{manufacturer}} calculates the required number of lamina. From the calculation, {{the manufacturer}} lists up {{the number of}} lamina for each grade. The over-sized knots than the restraint could be cutoff. Then, the remnant laminae were to be <b>finger-jointed.</b> When the <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina was longer than the finished length of GLT, the <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina would be cut {{to the length of}} GLT. Likewise, the computer model was developed to follow the same manufacturing process. The first input properties of lamina grade required were randomly selected from the corresponding lamina database. These properties were the localized MOEs and the calculated tensile strengths of lamina, which were then assigned to the virtually segmented lamina elements of GLT. Each lamina element in a same grade was assumed to be linked in the longitudinal direction. The next input properties taken sequentially from the database were given to the next link (lamina elements). This assigning process would be repeated to the last lamina element.|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} study, the evaluation {{system for the}} <b>finger–jointed</b> laminae was constructed. This system was composed of three parts. The first part is the motive power part for the hydraulic pomp and cylinder. The second part is the AE measurement part. The third part is the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. In this study, the optimum condition needed in the evaluating test with this evaluation system was examined. In addition, {{the effects of the}} temperature and the open assembly time in finger jointing on the strength properties of the <b>finger–jointed</b> laminae with this evaluate system were examined. The main results are summarized as follows: The peak in the waveform of AE signals obtained by the evaluation system was recognized in the laminae with starved joint. The peak and the starved joint part were corresponded. In evaluation test of the <b>finger–jointed</b> laminae with this system, the necessary conditions set in this test were the deflection and the feed speed, and these optimum conditions were 3 mm and high speed (480 mm/s), respectively. The strength properties of the <b>finger–jointed</b> laminae with the open assembly time showed the tendency to decrease with higher the temperature in jointing. Therefore, {{it became clear that the}} high temperature in jointing was the condition that the starved joint part was caused. The MOE and MOR of the <b>finger–jointed</b> laminae showed the tendency to decrease with increasing the maximum value of the AE accumulated signal. Thus, it was clear that there was a high correlation between the maximum value and the strength properties. Therefore, this evaluation system was promising for the detection of the difference of the bonding performance caused by the influence of bonding conditions such as the temperature and the open assembly time in jointing...|$|E
40|$|Finger {{jointing}} {{of short}} off-cuts for structural purposes particularly for lightweight roof truss and prefabricated timber house is likely an economical method of minimizing wastage and generating benefits. The {{primary goal of}} this research is on the possibility of using <b>finger-jointed</b> timber with metal plate connectors for structural purposes, i. e. in trusses: internal members, top and bottom chord. This research assessed the strength properties of <b>finger-jointed</b> Strength Group B timber and the influence of number of joints and its positioning on strength. The glue applied for finger jointing is polymer isocyanate adhesive or commercially known as Koyo glue. Bending, compression and tension tests were carried out and the results show that the efficiency of the joints in relation to the strength of the unjointed specimens were greatly influenced by the positioning and number of joints. The results obtained from tests indicated that modulus of rupture decreases with the presence of finger joint while modulus of elasticity is not affected. Tests on the performance of connection with metal plate using <b>finger-jointed</b> timber showed small difference in the basic working load as compared to the unjointed specimens. The study suggests that the combination use of <b>finger-jointed</b> timber with metal plate connector for structural purposes is acceptable depending on the joint efficiency, the position and number of the finger joint in the member, and the type of stresses (i. e. compression, tension or bending) in the member...|$|E
30|$|Five Sugi <b>finger-jointed</b> laminas with {{dimensions}} of 27 -mm thick, 120  mm wide and 3000  mm long were used. Each lamina had three finger-joint connections, {{located at the}} middle, and at 300 and 600  mm from {{the right and left}} end of the lamina, respectively. LMWP resin impregnation was conducted using the same method described before. After impregnation, each lamina was cut sequentially into pieces by cross-sectional cutting at 100  mm intervals in a longitudinal direction. To make the LMWP resin visible, ferric chloride solution was applied on one side of cross-section of each piece and the penetration area of LMWP resin into <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina was calculated using image analysis software.|$|E
30|$|K–S test {{indicated}} that the estimated distribution was {{not significantly different from}} the measured distribution at a significance level of 0.01. Especially, the comparison of the bending strength distributions showed that the model estimation fitted well at lower tail (see Fig.  13 b). The difference of the non-parametric 5 % point estimate was approximately 1.1 %. The differences between Set 1 (see Fig.  13 a) and 2 (see Fig.  13 b) were up to about 15  MPa for the higher fractile values. It was caused by the strength of <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina. The strength range of <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina (see Fig.  10) was shorter than that of non-finger-jointed lamina (see Fig.  9).|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{a series}} of {{intensive}} studies on sugi glulam were conducted at ten research institutes in Japan [3], and basic strength data of sugi laminae including <b>finger-jointed</b> laminae were accumulated at the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute (FFPRI).|$|E

30|$|The {{structural}} {{performance of}} <b>finger-jointed</b> laminated bamboo was investigated for two bamboo species {{by considering the}} finger length, profile orientation, lamination direction, culm growth height, and mechanical properties of bamboo materials. Based on the growth height variation and bamboo species, the best <b>finger-jointed</b> laminated bamboo was found for the lamina processed from the middle growth height of a moso bamboo culm with the finger profile shown on the width face of the beam. It was 38.7 % higher in bending strength than the lowest group, with the lamina from the lower ma bamboo culm showing the finger profile on the thickness face of the beam. When considering the finger length and lamination orientation, the strongest <b>finger-jointed</b> laminated bamboo joined with an 18 -mm finger, showing the finger profile on the width face of a vertically laminated beam was 50.1 % higher in bending strength than the lowest group having a 12 -mm finger showing the finger profile on the thickness face of a vertically laminated beam. The laminated ma bamboo showed higher finger-joint efficiency, 11.6 %, than moso bamboo, and the members showing the finger profile on the width surface was 12.3 % better in joint efficiency than that showing on the thickness surface of the beam.|$|E
30|$|The {{structural}} finger-joint {{performance of}} the laminated bamboo members as related to finger geometry, profile formation, lamination orientation, and bamboo species was investigated, and the basic mechanical properties of bamboo materials were examined. The mechanical properties of bamboo material changes along the growth heights of a culm and the tensile strength is {{more sensitive to the}} existence of nodes than bending strength. Note that the bonding strength is more critical among the strength properties for making laminated bamboo products. The <b>finger-jointed</b> laminated bamboo members made from the middle and upper growth heights of culms are higher in both MOR and MOE than those from the lower portions of the culms. In addition, the <b>finger-jointed</b> moso bamboo members showed higher MOR than the laminated ma bamboo members. The flexural performance can be improved as the finger length increases from 12  mm to 15 and 18  mm for the laminated bamboo members. The <b>finger-jointed</b> bamboo members laminated vertically showed a slightly higher MOR than the laminated horizontally, suggesting greater influence of the finger interface on the joint strength than the influence of a node on the flexural strength of the laminated bamboo beam. The MOR of the bamboo members joining a finger profile shown on the width face is higher than the members with the finger profile shown on the thickness face of the beam for all the finger lengths and lamination directions. Based on finger-joint efficiency, moso bamboo is superior to ma bamboo, and the laminated bamboo members showing a finger profile on the width surface is better than those showing a finger profile on the thickness surface of the beam. Superior joint efficiency of the laminated bamboo member joined with the 15 - and 18 -mm finger profile was also found compared to the other 12 -mm <b>finger-jointed</b> bamboo members.|$|E
30|$|In finger-joint designs, Mohammad [5] {{showed that}} the {{critical}} finger profile parameters to achieve high strength were slope and tip sharpness. The tensile strength of <b>finger-jointed</b> lumber is increased with decreasing slope and increasing tip sharpness. Vassiliou et al. [6] measured the most effective connections on the Hungarian oak specimens, regarding the bending strength properties of some <b>finger-jointed</b> oak wooden beams. The increase of finger length from 4 to 10 and 15  mm caused an increase in mean modulus of rapture values. Modulus of elasticity in all the studied joints was not affected by finger jointing and ranged in the same level values of the control solid wood. Using polyvinyl acetate (PVA) for bonding of <b>finger-jointed</b> Beech wood originating from Albania and Greece, {{the effects of the}} finger length (4.5, 6.5 and 9.0  mm), and material origination on bending strength of steamed and un-steamed joints were studied by Vassiliou et al. [7]. Obtained results showed that specimens with 9  mm finger length possess higher values of modulus of rapture compared to the specimens with 4.5 and 6.5  mm finger lengths. The steamed wood specimens showed higher modulus of rapture values than the un-steamed ones. During loading capacity determination of the wooden scarf joints, {{it was found that the}} scarfs of 60 ° and 75 ° are the bests for the adhesion.|$|E
30|$|In {{manufacturing}} a <b>finger-jointed</b> lamina, knots {{that had}} a bigger KAR than approximately 0.4 were removed.

30|$|The {{positions}} of the finger joints were determined by KAR criterion. If a detected knot gave a bigger value than the maximum allowable KAR, the calculated tensile strength {{which was based on}} the KAR and MOE measurements was replaced with the tested tensile strength of finger joint. Laminae that are too short would not be <b>finger-jointed</b> in a real manufacturing process. Thus, a minimum spacing between finger joints was set to be 800  mm in the model.|$|E
30|$|Polyvinyl acetate and {{isocyanate}} (ISO) adhesives {{were previously}} studied for finger joints [11]. Comparing the elastic properties of solid beams with <b>finger-jointed</b> beams of oak wood in both tangential and radial flexural directions, longer finger lengths with PVA adhesive {{did not cause}} any serious change to elastic properties of the beams, while shorter finger lengths with ISO adhesive severely changed the acoustic properties. It was also concluded that, a beam having longer finger lengths may have enhanced acoustical properties similar to solid wood.|$|E
