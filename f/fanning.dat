5|$|<b>Fanning</b> married Andrea Moreno in February 2007 in Brisbane, Australia. Moreno is from Spain, {{where the}} two met while <b>Fanning</b> was writing and {{recording}} Tea & Sympathy in Europe. This relationship followed a twelve-year union <b>Fanning</b> had had with his previous girlfriend, {{and it was this}} break-up (along with the then-recent death of his older brother) which influenced much of the lyrical content and sombre atmospheric mood of Tea & Sympathy. Through Moreno, <b>Fanning</b> has learned to speak some of the Spanish language. <b>Fanning</b> and Moreno have performed together while Powderfinger was on hiatus and <b>Fanning</b> was touring as a solo artist.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Toowong, Brisbane, <b>Fanning</b> was taught the piano by his mother at an early age. At the age of 12, while {{attending}} St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, he began writing music, and upon graduating from St. Joseph's, {{moved on to the}} University of Queensland, where he studied journalism for a short time. He dropped out to pursue a music career, after meeting Ian Haug in an economics class. <b>Fanning</b> joined Haug, John Collins, and Steven Bishop, who had recently formed Powderfinger, and took the role of lead singer. After Bishop left and guitarist Darren Middleton joined, the band released five studio albums in fifteen years and achieved mainstream success in Australia. During Powderfinger's hiatus in 2005, <b>Fanning</b> began his solo music career with the studio album Tea & Sympathy. Powderfinger then reunited in 2007 and released two more albums before disbanding in late 2010.|$|E

40|$|Early <b>fan</b> studies {{positioned}} <b>fans</b> as 'textual poachers' (Jenkins, 1992), {{suggesting that}} <b>fans</b> poach characters and materials from texts {{as an act}} of resistance towards commercial culture to form their own readings through <b>fan</b> cultural production such as <b>fan</b> fiction. As such, <b>fans</b> are often presented as a unified, communal group interacting within the context of <b>fan</b> communities that are considered alternative social communities with 'no established hierarchy' (Bacon-Smith, 1992, p. 41). However, Milly Williamson argued that <b>fans</b> do not all operate from a position of cultural marginality. <b>Fans</b> not only go on to collaborate with the media producers they allegedly poach from, they also "engage in elitist distinctions between themselves and other [...] . fans" (Williamson, 2005, p. 103). In this dissertation, I look at <b>fan</b> cultural production (specifically <b>fan</b> fiction) by appropriating Bourdieu's (1993) theory on the field of cultural production. I also suggest that the field of <b>fan</b> cultural production manifests the principles of a gift economy (Mauss, 1954). In circulating <b>fan</b> cultural production as gifts, <b>fans</b> are entering into a social relationship of reciprocity, where <b>fan</b> reputation, or <b>fan</b> symbolic capital, becomes tied to the gifts presented to the <b>fan</b> community and the social network of the <b>fan</b> author. The accumulation of <b>fan</b> social, <b>fan</b> cultural and <b>fan</b> symbolic capitals creates a subgroup of <b>fans</b> who are often treated like celebrities by their peers, and these <b>fan</b> subcultural celebrities often go on to determine the social and cultural norms of a <b>fan</b> community. This often results in conflict within fandom as <b>fan</b> status is frequently contested and challenged. By employing an ethnographic study on the fandoms of The X-Files, Angel and the re- imagined Battlestar Galactica, I argue that <b>fan</b> culture is not as homogenous as early <b>fan</b> studies proposed as the boundaries of community and <b>fan</b> celebrity status are frequently challenged.

40|$|The Baviaanskloof {{catchment}} is a semi - arid catchment {{located in}} the Cape Fold Mountains of South Africa. Little {{is known about the}} functioning of the complicated Baviaanskloof fluvial system and the role alluvial <b>fans</b> in the fluvial landscape. This thesis will contribute to field of geomorphology and, more specifically, to the field of <b>fan</b> morphometry by producing a standalone <b>fan</b> framework outlining methods to investigate the influence of external and internal control variables on alluvial <b>fans.</b> In this thesis, outcomes of the applied framework and case study are used to develop <b>fan</b> restoration guidelines for the Baviaanskloof Valley. The framework incorporates external and internal <b>fan</b> control variables at a valley-wide and local <b>fan</b> scale. External control variables include accommodation space, base-level change, and drainage basin inputs. Internal control variables include <b>fan</b> style, morphometry and <b>fan</b> channels. In order to apply the framework, <b>fan</b> morphometry data was required. This data was collected by creating a spatial plan of <b>fans</b> and basins in the valley. Outcomes of the applied framework include; an understanding of baselevel change on <b>fans,</b> relationships between <b>fan</b> basin characteristics and the <b>fan</b> surface and insight into <b>fan</b> channel processes. Results of the applied framework are investigated further using bivariate (correlation matrix) and multivariate (principle component analysis and regression analysis) analysis techniques. Significant relationships identified are: drainage basin area versus <b>fan</b> area, <b>fan</b> area and <b>fan</b> slope and drainage basin ruggedness and basin size. The primary outcomes of this thesis include an alluvial <b>fan</b> form-process framework, key considerations to be included in alluvial <b>fan</b> restoration projects and <b>fan</b> restoration guidelines. Contributions of this thesis to broader alluvial <b>fan</b> morphology science includes new insights into general <b>fan</b> literature by compiling a form-process alluvial <b>fan</b> classification framework to identify external and internal <b>fan</b> control variables and identify <b>fan</b> form. Additions have been made to Clarke’s (2010) evolutionary stages to describe stages 4 and 5 of <b>fan</b> evolution that has been adapted to describe <b>fan</b> evolution and differentiate between stages of mature <b>fan</b> evolution. This thesis has also contributed to the study of alluvial <b>fans</b> in South Africa, particularly in the Baviaanskloof Valley. The layout of the procedural guidelines and key considerations for an alluvial <b>fan</b> project provides a guide for rapid <b>fan</b> assessment for maximum cost and time benefits for stakeholders. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton {{was invited}} to join Powderfinger by <b>Fanning</b> and Haug, after they were {{impressed}} by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of <b>Fanning,</b> Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2006, <b>Fanning</b> had hinted towards Powderfinger ceasing their hiatus {{to release}} a sixth studio album. Recorded in Los Angeles, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was {{released}} on 2 June 2007. The title of the album came from a chapter of Brooklyn Follies by Paul Auster, a book that <b>Fanning</b> had read during recording. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums chart.|$|E
5|$|While Powderfinger's style {{focuses on}} {{alternative}} rock, Fanning's solo music is generally {{described as a}} mixture of blues and acoustic folk. <b>Fanning</b> plays guitar, piano, keyboards and harmonica, both when performing solo and also with Powderfinger.

5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. <b>Fanning</b> decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped <b>Fanning</b> to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
