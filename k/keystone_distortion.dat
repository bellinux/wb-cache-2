50|$|The {{simplest}} {{application of}} image geometry correction {{is a specific}} case known as <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> correction derived from Keystone effect. <b>Keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> gets {{its name from the}} symmetric trapezoidal distortion resulting from misaligned projector placement in the vertical dimension (although the term is generally applied to the non-symmetric quadrilateral shape that occurs from an off-axis projection in both dimensions). Keystone correction capabilities are now included in most projectors currently available on the market, allowing users to move the image both vertically and horizontally. Even with this feature, the degree of adjustment available is limited, and image quality may suffer. Keystone correction is ideal for simple business (i.e. conference room) adjustments. For more complex distortion correction, an external processor is required.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} correct {{horizontal}} <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> is generally only available on larger or professional level projectors. In most consumer units, this is easily corrected {{by moving the}} projector left or right as necessary, or less often by lens shifting, with similar principles as Tilt-shift photography.|$|E
50|$|Projector Stacking is an {{advanced}} form of keystone correction. In this application, {{two or more}} projectors are projected onto exactly the same surface. Since the two projectors cannot occupy exactly the same space, the output of each {{must be at least}} slightly corrected for <b>Keystone</b> <b>Distortion.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Projector camera {{systems are}} {{basically}} systems {{that can serve}} as improvement to projector based applications by addition of visual feedback to the projector. However, unless the projector is precisely aligned to the presentation screen, the resulting image suffers from perspective (<b>keystone)</b> <b>distortions</b> requiring manual optical or digital correction. This process is manually hard during continuous movement of projector and screen of projection. Misalignment of projector and projected surface cause projective transform which change the shape of image. This paper propose a method to find largest area rectangle inside any quadrilateral. An uncalibrated, low-resolution digital camera is used to infer the projector-screen geometry and to automatically determine the parameters.

40|$|A {{major problem}} with {{interactive}} displays based on front-projection is that users cast undesirable {{shadows on the}} display surface. This situation is only partially-addressed by mounting a single projector at an extreme angle and warping the projected image to undo <b>keystoning</b> <b>distortions.</b> This paper demonstrates that shadows can be muted by redundantly-illuminating the display surface using multiple projectors, all mounted at different locations. However, this technique alone does not eliminate shadows: multiple projectors create multiple dark regions on the surface (penumbral occlusions) and cast undesirable light onto the users. These problems can be solved by eliminating shadows and suppressing the light that falls on occluding users by actively modifying the projected output. This paper categorizes various methods {{that can be used}} to achieve redundant illumination, shadow elimination, and blinding light suppression, and evaluates their performance.

50|$|Edge Blending is a {{companion}} application to image geometry correction. Edge blending enables the seamless projection {{of a large}} image using several overlapping projectors. Since <b>Keystone</b> <b>Distortion</b> (and frequently the requirement of projection onto a non-flat surface) is a built-in requirement of almost all Edge Blending systems, the pairing of Edge blending and image geometry correction in the same video signal processor is a natural one.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the origins, characteristics {{and effects of}} image distortions in stereoscopic video systems. The geometry of stereoscopic camera and display systems is presented first. This {{is followed by the}} analysis and diagrammatic presentation of various image distortions such as depth plane curvature, depth non-linearity, depth and size magnification, shearing distortion and <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion.</b> The variation of system parameters is also analysed with the help of plots of image geometry to show their effects on image distortions. The converged (toed-in) and parallel camera configurations are compared and the amount of vertical parallax induced by lens distortion and <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> are discussed. The range of acceptable vertical parallax and the convergence/accommodation limitations on depth range are also discussed. It is shown that a number of these distortions can be eliminated by the appropriate choice of camera and display system parameters. There are some image distortions, however, which cannot be avoided {{due to the nature of}} human vision and limitations of current stereoscopic video display techniques. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) measurement systems {{based on}} triangulation, a stereoscopic angle between two distinct viewpoints encodes the depth information. This angle generally generates some distortion known as <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion.</b> In this paper an original 3 -D optical configuration in addition {{with a digital}} light processing system (DLP) is presented which prevents <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion,</b> resulting in less calibration and post-processing work. The DLP is used to project incoherent white light fringes pattern at high frame rate (30 Hz) on a specimen and a CCD camera dynamically captures this projected pattern. Using a phase shifting algorithm, {{the reconstruction of the}} 3 -D shape of the specimen is finally computed. This optical configuration is based on an Â" out of axis Â" aperture method combined with an afocal design for both projection and acquisition. With the combination of these two properties, the stereoscopic effect is obtained without any <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> and a unique objective lens instead of two in a classical 3 -D measurement system is used. As a result of this unique objective lens, the global volume of the measurement device can be easily minimized. This system was designed with the optical software Zemax to limit geometric and chromatic aberrations and to control the diffraction effect. Experiments showed that high surface profile accuracy can be obtained on a variety of surfaces, allowing reverse engineering on micro-scaled objects or precise 3 -D measurements of macro-scaled objects. Also a depth resolution value under 2 μm for a scanned area around 7. 5 x 5. 5 mm is obtained under experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} with {{interactive}} displays based on frontprojection is that users cast undesirable {{shadows on the}} display surface. This situation is only partially-addressed by mounting a single projector at an extreme angle and prewarping the projected image to undo <b>keystoning</b> <b>distortions.</b> This paper demonstrates that shadows can be muted by redundantly-illuminating the display surface using multiple projectors, all mounted at different locations. However, this technique alone does not eliminate shadows: multiple projectors create multiple dark regions on the surface (penumbral occlusions). We solve the problem by using cameras to automatically identify occlusions as they occur and dynamically adjust each projector's output so that additional light is projected onto each partially-occluded patch. The system is self-calibrating: relevant homographies relating projectors, cameras and the display surface are recovered by observing the distortions induced in projected calibration patterns. The resulting redundantly-projected display retains the high image quality of a single-projector system while dynamically correcting for all penumbral occlusions. Our initial two-projector implementation operates at 3 Hz. 1...|$|R
40|$|Projection {{systems have}} become the {{ubiquitous}} infrastructure for presentation technology. However, unless the projector is precisely aligned to the presentation screen, the resulting image suers from perspective (<b>keystone)</b> <b>distortions</b> requiring manual optical or digital correction. This tedious process must be repeated whenever the projector or screen is moved and is increasingly relevant given the emerging trend towards highly-portable LCD projection systems. This paper presents a presentation interface that pre-warps the image to be projected {{in such a way}} that the distortions induced by the projector-screen geometry precisely negate the warping. An uncalibrated, low-resolution digital camera is used to infer the projector-screen geometry and to automatically determine the pre-warping parameters. This vision-based system is augmented with a natural interface that enables the user to interactively rene the suggested rectication. Arbitrary distortions due to projector placement are negated, allowing the projector (and camera) to be placed anywhere in the presentation room | for instance, at the side rather than the center of the room. Our solution works with existing projector hardware, and could easily be incorporated into the next generation of LCD projector systems...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D optical endoscopy {{is now a}} {{major challenge}} to allow the high resolution inspection of industrial equipments. The proposed instrument {{is based on a}} flexible image guide (70 000 fibres) and a Digital Micro mirror Device (DMD, 1024 x 768 "on-off" micro mirrors). The optical design is as follows: the light emitted by a 532 nm laser diode is dynamically structured by the DMD chip as a fringes pattern which is phase-shifted due to the active control of the DMD chip and projected onto an object on a circular field of 6 mm in diameter. Due to a telecentric and binocular arrangement that creates a stereoscopic angle, it is possible to get a depth of field of 2 mm along the optical axis without <b>keystone</b> <b>distortions</b> and few disturbances created by defocus and coma aberrations. Then, images are captured by a 1024 x 768 digital camera (not yet moved away by fibres) at 15 fps and directly used in the reconstruction algorithm to access the tri-dimensional shape of the unpainted object. The results are compared to incoherent white light results obtained with white painted mechanical objects. The lateral resolution is 31. 3 µm and the RMS axial resolution is 10 µm for the laser-based design after speckle attenuation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully-automatic method for keystone correction. The two key concepts are: (1) {{a digital camera}} is used to observe the projected image; (2) the image to be displayed is prewarped so that the distortions induced by the projection system will exactly undo the <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion.</b> The result is that an arbitrarily mounted projector (in an unknown orientation) displays a perfectly aligned and rectilinear image, as shown in Figure 1...|$|E
40|$|All-reflective imaging {{systems that}} are {{asymmetrical}} and eccentric {{have the advantage of}} providing more degrees of freedom to improve image quality. A disadvantage of these asymmetrical imaging systems is that they suffer from asymmetric mapping. This asymmetric mapping manifests itself mainly in the presence of <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> and anamorphism. Due to the increase in degrees of freedom, the complexity of such systems escalates; thus, the designer is confronted with the difficult task of determining optimal starting points. This work addresses several first-order aspects of the design and characterisation of asymmetrical, all-reflective, aspherical, eccentric imaging systems. In contrast to the work of Stone and Forbes, which is based upon the theory of Hamiltonian optics and includes both the first- and second-order considerations, this work is based upon the theory of collineation. Because of the inherent simplicity of the collinear mapping, which is a projective transformation, we are able to present a simple but certainly not naive way of designing and characterising such asymmetrical all-reflective imaging systems. The simplicity of this proposition has the advantage that we can gain insights into asymmetrical mapping behaviour. Specifically, we apply the collinear mapping model on all-reflective asymmetrical imaging systems resulting in the description of how the mapping between conjugate planes may be described. First we will define <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> and anamorphism. Then we will introduce and investigate the significance of the Cardinal points and planes, the Scheimpflug condition and the horizon planes and show how they are applied in the designing of imaging {{systems that are}} free of both <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> and anamorphism. Having established a first-order layout of the optical system, we will then develop a process for converting the first-order layouts into imaging systems consisting of real aspheric surfaces...|$|E

The method of constructing such a type of an optical system is discussed in detail. The method is useful to directly obtain the correct fingerprints using a CCD camera...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} of remote sensing images {{is a valuable}} tool for defining future Earth observation systems, optimizing instrument parameters, and developing and validating data-processing algorithms. A scene simulator for optical Earth observation data has been developed within the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) hyperspectral mission. It produces EnMAP-like data following a sequential processing approach consisting of five independent modules referred to as reflectance, atmospheric, spatial, spectral, and radiometric modules. From a modeling viewpoint, the spatial module is the most complex. The spatial simulation process considers the satellitetarget geometry, which is adapted to the EnMAP orbit and operating characteristics, the instrument spatial response, and the sources of spatial nonuniformity (<b>keystone,</b> telescope <b>distortion</b> and smile, and detector coregistration).

HyspIRI is one of the Tier 2 Decadal Survey Missions. HyTES will provide information on how to place the filters on the HyspIRI Thermal Infrared Instrument (TIR) as well as provide antecedent science data. The pushbroom design has 512 spatial pixels over a 50 -degree field of view and 256 spectral channels between 7. 5 micrometers to 12 micrometers. HyTES includes many key enabling state-of-the-art technologies including a high performance convex diffraction grating, a quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) focal plane array, and a compact Dyson-inspired optical design. The Dyson optical design allows for a very compact and optically fast system (F/ 1. 6). It also minimizes cooling requirements due to the fact it has a single monolithic prism-like grating design which allows baffling for stray light suppression. The monolithic configuration eases mechanical tolerancing requirements which are a concern since the complete optical assembly is operated at cryogenic temperatures ((is) approximately 100 K). The QWIP allows for optimum spatial and spectral uniformity and provides adequate responsivity or D-star to allow 200 mK noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) operation across the LWIR passband. Assembly of the system is nearly complete. After completion, alignment results will be presented which show low <b>keystone</b> and smile <b>distortion.</b> This is required to minimize spatial-spectral mixing between adjacent spectral channels and spatial positions. Predictions show the system will have adequate signal to noise for laboratory calibration targets...|$|R

The Spaceborne Infrared Sounder for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (SIRAS-G) {{represents}} {{a new approach}} for imaging spectrometry in the infrared suitable for Earth observation from both low-Earth and geosynchronous orbit. SIRAS-G, selected for development under NASA’s 2002 Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), is an instrument concept of lower mass and power than contemporary instruments offering enhanced capabilities for atmospheric temperature, water vapor, and trace gas column measurements. At the core of SIRAS-G are modular grating spectrometers that provide high spectral resolution with high spatial resolution. Both the spectral range and resolution of these spectrometers can be modified to match science measurement needs. The flight instrument concept is intended for atmospheric sounding, using 2048 spectral channels, with a nominal spectral resolution (λ/∆λ) of between 700 and 1500.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a compact underwater stereoscopic video camera. The camera was specifically developed for use on Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) which are operated extensively in the offshore oil and gas industry. The camera has been used at the oil and gas fields operated by Woodside Offshore Petroleum off the north-west coast of Western Australia. The camera is 11 cm in diameter, 24 cm long and weighs just under four kilograms. The camera housing contains a pair of miniature video cameras and an internal 3 D multiplexer which generates the single video output signal (in the field- sequential 3 D video format). Since the camera outputs a single video signal (although in 3 D), it can be easily interfaced with an underwater ROV's existing video system. The 3 D video signal is transmitted to the surface by a single video channel where it is viewed on a stereoscopic display installed in the ship-based control room. The camera provides several improvements over the first underwater stereoscopic video camera developed by the Centre in 1991. One of the notable improvements is the camera's reduced size, which offers a number of operational benefits. The optics of the camera have also been improved by using parallel camera axes to eliminate <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion</b> and depth plane curvature...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{distinction}} between an ordinary optical system {{and one which}} is both unobscured and reflective is that {{the elements of the}} latter must be tilted or decentered with respect to one another. In general, this results in an optical system which has no axis of rotational symmetry, and therefore the classical aberration theory of symmetric systems is no longer applicable. Furthermore, the image becomes anamorphic and keystone distorted, due to the relative tilt between the object and the optical surfaces. The first part of this work is the development of a semi-analytic treatment of the properties (through third order) of systems possessing large tilts and decentrations. The Gaussian properties of both the image and pupil are described in terms of tilt, decentration, magnification, <b>keystone</b> <b>distortion,</b> and anamorphic distortion parameters. In computing these parameters, it is important {{to take into account the}} transferred components of the parameters, which are due to the Gaussian properties of the preceding surfaces. The third order properties are computed using the fact that each optical surface, together with its associated entrance pupil, form an optical subsystem which possesses an axis of approximate symmetry. About this axis, the aberration contributions of that surface may be described in the classical wave aberration expansion. The coefficients in this expansion may be corrected for the non-circular appearance of both the object and pupil, using the parametric description of their Gaussian form. the aberration fields due to the various surface contributions are then combined vectorally to yield the resultant aberration field in the image plane. The vector theory is applied to the analysis of several optical systems, and the accuracy of the theory verified by comparison with raytrace data. As a demonstration of the usefulness of the theory to an optical designer, a three mirror unobscured system was designed using a methodology derived from the theory. At each step, the design options are explained, and the probable results are discussed. The residual aberrations of the resulting system are studied, and the selection of another design starting point is discussed from the point of view of the theory...|$|E
