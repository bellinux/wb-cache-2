Báthory wished to recreate his native country into an independent, strong power, but the unfavorable <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> did not allow him to significantly advance any of his plans in that area. In addition to Hungarian, he was well versed in Latin, and spoke Italian and German; he never learned the Polish language.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{having been}} {{prompted}} by the new <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> and the recent strike wave in Poland, in September 1988 preliminary talks between government representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in Magdalenka. Numerous meetings took place involving Wałęsa and the minister of internal affairs, General Czesław Kiszczak among others, {{at that time and}} in the following year, behind the scenes of the official negotiations conducted then. In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E

A major component of this build up was a vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses. Some $175 million was allocated to construction under the Expansion Program, as it became known.|$|E

5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After {{the first few}} months he found the pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the <b>international</b> <b>situation,</b> in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable <b>international</b> <b>situation,</b> the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> {{significantly}} {{weakened the}} hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to Prussia. Soon after the treaty was signed, the <b>international</b> <b>situation,</b> and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing of a powerful neighbor in this process – where in fact Prussia felt those reforms were not in its best interest, and felt threatened by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, Prussia refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, Prussia aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1938 Adolf Hitler {{personally}} stated that gaining Klaipėda {{was one of his}} highest priorities, second only to gaining the Sudetenland. When Poland presented its ultimatum to Lithuania in March 1938, Germany openly declared that {{in the event of a}} military clash between Poland and Lithuania, its army would invade Lithuania to capture Klaipėda and a large portion of western Lithuania. A week after Lithuania accepted the Polish ultimatum, Germany presented an eleven-point memorandum that demanded freedom of action for pro-German activists in the region and a lessening of Lithuanian influence there. Its points were worded in a deliberately vague manner, which would enable Germany to accuse Lithuania of violations. Lithuania chose to postpone dealing with the problem, hoping that the <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> would improve. In the meantime it hoped to give the German population no reasons for complaint.|$|E
5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E

5|$|Lenin {{was back}} in Galicia when the First World War broke out, an <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> that he had paid little {{attention}} to. The war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to his Russian citizenship, Lenin was deemed a spy by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In August, they arrested him and imprisoned him in Nowy Targ, although they released him once his anti-tsarist credentials were explained. To escape {{the violence of the}} eastern front, Lenin and his wife moved to neutral Switzerland, settling in Bern, although in February 1916 they moved to Zurich, which was cheaper. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party had supported the German war effort, thereby contravening the Stuttgart resolution of the Second International that all socialist parties would oppose the international conflict. As a result, Lenin saw the Second International as defunct. In particular, he denounced German Marxist Karl Kautsky for supporting the German Social-Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|Lezica {{informed}} Cisneros of {{the request}} for an open cabildo and the Viceroy consulted Leiva, who spoke in favor of it. The Viceroy summoned military commanders {{to come to the}} fort at 7pm, to demand military support. There were rumors that it could be a trap to capture them and take control of the barracks. To prevent this, they took command of the grenadiers that guarded the Fort and seized the keys of all entrances while meeting with the Viceroy. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the Regiment of Patricios, responded on behalf of all the criollo regiments. He compared the current <b>international</b> <b>situation</b> with that prevailing {{at the time of the}} mutiny of Álzaga over a year earlier, pointed out that Spain was now almost entirely under Napoleonic control and that the undefeated Spanish provinces were very small in comparison with the Americas. He rejected the claim of sovereignty of Cadiz over the Americas, and concluded that the local armies wanted to look after themselves, rather than following the fate of Spain. Finally, he pointed out that the Supreme Central Junta that appointed Cisneros as Viceroy no longer existed, so he rejected Cisneros' legitimacy as Viceroy and denied him the protection of the troops under his command.|$|E

40|$|Arab Monarchical States {{still remain}} in the {{contemporary}} world. This fact is contradictory to the familiar theory on monarchies that they would collapse as time went by. This paper tackles this puzzle, identifying Arab Monarchical States as variants of modern political regimes. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the regime-stabilizing mechanism of Jordan, considering seven issues that are crucial for regime maintenance. The analysis sets three levels for examination: domestic situations, Arab region <b>situations,</b> and <b>international</b> <b>situations.</b> The Jordanian regime uses several resources for coping with these issues, but these resources at the same time work as constraints on the regime. Moreover, the nature of these resources changes as the society changes. As for the conclusion, this paper implies the importance of taking these changes into consideration, which affects the Arab Monarchical States more than other regime types, because the Arab Monarchical States are influenced not only by domestic situations, but also by Arab regional <b>situations</b> and <b>international</b> <b>situations...</b>|$|R
