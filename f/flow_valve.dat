25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free <b>flow</b> <b>valve,</b> preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible. If there is no free <b>flow</b> <b>valve,</b> as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E
25|$|Demand valve failure. This {{is a minor}} {{problem if}} there is a free <b>flow</b> <b>valve,</b> but the dive will {{normally}} be terminated, as the bailout will not last long if needed.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{breakage}} of one {{of three}} <b>flow</b> control <b>valves</b> on the previous flight, STS-126, the <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> of all orbiters were subjected to tests to determine if Discovery was safe to fly. These valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the Space Shuttle Main Engines, creating an even flow. Following the testing of the valves, mission managers decided to postpone the launch, and engineers were asked to replace the suspect <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> with valves that had less flight time.|$|R

25|$|Helmet flood. Depending on the {{severity}} of the flood, this can range from an annoyance to an emergency. A slow leak can be controlled by opening the free <b>flow</b> <b>valve,</b> which will drive a moderate flow of water out of the exhaust valve. A neck dam failure usually has this effect.|$|E
25|$|Broken faceplate. This {{is a real}} emergency, {{but very}} {{unlikely}} as the faceplate is usually a highly impact-resistant polymer and should not shatter. It can be mitigated by opening the free <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> and holding the opening level, facing down, and breathing very carefully. a small hole or crack can be covered with a hand to slow the leak.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E
50|$|Straight-through <b>flow</b> <b>valves,</b> such as rotary-shaft ball valves, are {{typically}} high-recovery valves. High recovery valves are valves that lose little energy due to little flow turbulence. Flow paths are straight through. Rotary control valves, butterfly valve and ball valves are good examples.|$|R
40|$|Impedance {{characteristics}} of hydraulic components have a signifcant efect on pressure ripple levels in hydraulic circuits. These pressure ripples lead to vibration of pipework and associatedfittings {{and are a}} source of unreliability and noise. This paper describes an experimental investigation of restrictor and <b>flow</b> control <b>valves</b> using a specially designed circuit. For a restrictor valve, {{it was found that the}} impedance characteristics were influenced by fluid compressibility, fluid inertia, valve vibration and downstream impedance effects. When these effects were taken into account, the valve could be modelled as a simple orijice. The impedance {{characteristics of}} a <b>flow</b> control <b>valve</b> were found to be more complex and wave propagation within the valve fluid passageway had a dominant effect on behaviour.

Examples of application of the <b>flow</b> diverter <b>valve</b> to a liquid rocket and a turbojet aircraft engine are given. Features of the valve include: (1) an independent fluid source is used to activate the <b>flow</b> diverter <b>valve</b> toward its closed position during its initial stage of travel; (2) the flow diverter port area and size is unlimited and the valve travel is unlimited; and (3) the valve housing is fabricated such that the valve can be a one step valve, a two step valve, or include as many steps as are found desirable...|$|R
25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E

50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control <b>flow.</b> <b>Valves</b> most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, compression fittings, glue, cement, flanges, or welding.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for regulating {{pressure of}} treatment fluid during ophthalmic procedures is described. Flow sensing and pressure regulating diaphragms {{are used to}} modulate a <b>flow</b> control <b>valve.</b> The pressure regulating diaphragm {{is connected to the}} <b>flow</b> control <b>valve</b> to urge the valve to an open position due to pressure being applied to the diaphragm by bias means such as a spring. The flow sensing diaphragm is mechanically connected to the <b>flow</b> control <b>valve</b> and urges it to an opened position because of the differential pressure on the diaphragm generated by a flow of incoming treatment fluid through an orifice in the diaphragm. A bypass connection with a variable restriction is connected in parallel relationship to the orifice to provide for adjusting the sensitivity of the flow sensing diaphragm. A multiple lever linkage system is utilized between the center of the second diaphragm and the <b>flow</b> control <b>valve</b> to multiply the force applied to the valve by the other diaphragm and reverse the direction of the force...|$|R
25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply <b>valve</b> to regulate <b>flow.</b> Constant <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage <b>flow</b> control <b>valve</b> where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{this paper}} {{experimentally}} monitors dynamic drilling parameters, including WOB, rotary speed, drilling vibrations during drilling that give {{an indication of}} gas kick. Many studies on kick detection rely on a flow-loop setup including <b>flow</b> <b>valves,</b> choke valve, and pressure sensors to simulate kick experiments. Therefore, {{the uniqueness of the}} current study lies in the utilization of a fully instrumented laboratory scale drilling rig to simulate drilling as the kick is being induced, controlled and monitored.|$|R
50|$|Electronic spirometers {{have been}} {{developed}} that compute airflow rates in a channel {{without the need for}} fine meshes or moving parts. They operate by measuring the speed of the airflow with techniques such as ultrasonic transducers, or by measuring pressure difference in the channel. These spirometers have greater accuracy by eliminating the momentum and resistance errors associated with moving parts such as windmills or <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> for <b>flow</b> measurement. They also allow improved hygiene by allowing fully disposable air flow channels.|$|R

50|$|A second entity, the septum secundum, {{develops}} to {{the right}} of the septum primum and the opening between the upper and lower limbs of the septum secundum is known as the foramen ovale of the heart. The part of the septum primum that remains to the left of the septum secundum acts as a one-way <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> due to the greater pressures in the right atrium compared to the left atrium. At birth, the neonate begins breathing and the associated decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance leads to a reversal of the pressure differential between the atria. The left atrium now has a greater pressure than the right, effectively closing the one-way <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> formed by the two septa. The two septa fuse later in life, to complete the formation of the atrial septum.|$|E
