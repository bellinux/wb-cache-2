40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{identify}} {{risk factors}} for recurrent catheter related bloodstream infections (CR-BSIs). The study was undertaken at the University of Utah Hospital and involved patients who had a CR-BSI followed by catheter removal and reinsertion between January 1998 and February 2002. DesignA retrospective chart review for the cohort study of catheters initially infected, which were then followed to study {{risk factors for}} a subsequent infection. Both central line and peripherally inserted central line catheters {{were included in the}} study. A recurrent CR-BSI was defined as positive blood cultures after three negative cultures, coupled with positive catheter tip culture or no other evident new source of infection. ResultsTwenty-five (34 %) of 73 patients had a recurrent CR-BSI. The first CR-BSI occurred a mean of 20. 4 days after catheter insertion whereas recurrence developed a mean of 12. 1 days after reinsertion (p= 0. 392). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (60 %) were {{the most common cause of}} recurrent infection. The recurrence was more common among the patients who were given blood product transfusion (hazard ratio (HR) 2. 3; confidence interval (CI) 1. 02 – 5. 67, p= 0. 049). In 20 (27 %) patients, catheters were changed over a guidewire. The <b>guidewire</b> <b>catheter</b> exchange was not found to be associated with an increased risk of recurrent infection (p= 0. 582). ConclusionCatheter replacement to a new site, instead of rewiring, was not shown to decrease the risk for recurrent infection.

40|$|Abstract — Interventional {{radiology}} is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure where thin instruments, <b>guidewires</b> and <b>catheters</b> or stents are steered through the patient’s vascular system under X-ray imaging for treatment of vascular diseases. The complexity of these procedures makes training in order to master hand-eye coordination, instrument manipulation and procedure protocols for each radiologist mandatory. In this paper, we present a computer-based real-time simulation of interventional radiology procedures, which deploys a very efficient physics-based thread model to simulate the elastic behavior of <b>guidewires</b> and <b>catheters.</b> A fast collision detection scheme provides continuous collision response, which reveals more details of arterial walls than a centerline approach. Furthermore rendering techniques for realistic X-ray effect have been implemented. Our simulation structure is updated at a haptic rate of 500 Hz, thus contributing to physical realism. I...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Angiographic CT (ACT) {{produces}} CT-like images {{within minutes}} in the angiography suite. We present the cases of 2 patients with intraprocedural aneurysmal rupture in which ACT enabled the neuroradiologist to rapidly assess the extent of bleeding during endovascular treatment. Additionally, ACT revealed pronounced rebleeding within the time between conventional CT and onset of treat-ment. In the management of aneurysmal rupture during coil embolization, ACT may be a valuable adjunct. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial study 1 showed intracranial aneurysms, especially in the anterior circulation, to be treated more effectively with endovascular coiling because of a significant, more beneficial clinical out-come compared with neurosurgical aneurysmal clipping. De-spite technical improvements in <b>guidewires,</b> <b>catheters,</b> and coils, rupture of an aneurysm during endovascular treatment {{is one of the}} most feared complications of endovascular aneu-rysmal therapy.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{many of the}} ostium secundum atrial septal defects can be {{successfully}} closed by percutaneous transvenous approach, surgical method as well is preferred in some cases due to vascular reasons or due to the anatomical characteristics of the defect. Detecting ostium secundum atrial septal defect in a 26 -year-old female patient, who presented with shortness of breath, percutaneous closure procedure was planned. During percutaneous closure, {{it was observed that}} <b>guidewire</b> and <b>catheter</b> persistently went towards patent foramen ovale because of quite flaccid structure of interatrial septum. For this reason, occluder could not be placed in the defect area. Before using the option of surgery for the patient, guidewire and simmons 1 diagnostic catheter were pushed forward towards to the left ventricle and then left atrium by transarterial approach through the femoral artery. <b>Guidewire</b> and the <b>catheter</b> were easily passed through atrial septal defect without passing through patent foramen ovale benefiting from the left atrial pressure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} simple and {{versatile}} catheter system for complex cardiac catheterisation because angiography and pressure measurements during diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterisation are often unsatisfactory. METHODS: The Multi-Track Angio catheter system is a single lumen side-hole catheter with a short distal extension containing a lumen for a standard <b>guidewire.</b> The <b>catheter</b> is introduced over a previously placed guidewire running through this distal extension. It can then be manipulated within the heart by sliding along the guidewire. The tip of the catheter is always stabilised by the guidewire. This stability enhances angiography and pressure recordings. RESULTS: The Multi-Track Angio catheter system was used in 84 patients (age 1 day- 20 years). Thirty one procedures were diagnostic and 53 interventional. The decision to use the Multi-Track Angio catheter was based on three criteria: firstly, unsatisfactory angiography obtained with conventional equipment; secondly, difficult catheter course requiring use of a guidewire; and thirdly, requirement for angiography and pressure recordings during interventional procedures. No complications were encountered. High quality angiography could be performed in all cases without catheter recoil. CONCLUSIONS: The Multi-Track Angio catheter system allows for high quality angiography and pressure recordings during diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterisation. The advantage {{of the system is}} that both angiography and pressure recordings can be performed repeatedly from stable catheter positions using a previously placed guidewire. This reduces the need for <b>guidewire</b> manipulations or <b>catheter</b> exchanges and decreases procedure time and the risk of complications...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of interventional MRI, {{radiofrequency}} (RF) heating at the tips of <b>guidewires,</b> <b>catheters,</b> and other wire-shaped devices has become an important safety issue. Previ-ous studies have identified some of the variables that affect the relative magnitude of this heating but none could predict the absolute amount of heating to formulate safety margins. This study presents the first theoretical model of wire tip heating that can accurately predict its absolute value, assuming a straight wire, a homogeneous RF coil, and a wire that does not extend out of the tissue. The local specific absorption rate (SAR) amplification from induced currents on insulated and bare wires was calculated using the method of moments. This SAR gain was combined with a semianalytic solution to the bioheat transfer equation to generate a safety index. The safety index (°C/(W/kg)) {{is a measure of the}} in vivo temperature change that can occur with the wire in place, normalized to the SAR of the pulse sequence. This index can be used to set limits on the spatial peak SAR of pulse sequences that are used with the interventional wire. For the case of a straight resonant wire in a tissue with very low perfusion, only about 100 mW/kg/°C spatial peak SAR may be used at 1. 5 T. But for ≤ 10 -cm wires with an insulation thickness ≥ 30 % of the wire radius that are placed in well-perfused tissues, normal operating conditions of 4 W/kg spatial peak SAR are possible at 1. 5 T. Further model development to include the influence of inhomogeneous RF, curved wires, and wires that extend out of the sample are required to generate safety indices that are applicable to com-mon clinical situations. We propose a simple way to ensure safety when using an interventional wire: set a limit on the SAR of allowable pulse sequences that is a factor of a safety index below the tolerable temperature increase.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Endovascular {{treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is a technically demanding procedure {{that is based}} on the complexity and multiplicity of steps and the <b>guidewire</b> and <b>catheter</b> manipulations required. Brachial artery catheterization is an adjunctive technique that can facilitate the placement of an endoluminal prosthesis. Methods: Brachial access was used during endoluminal AAA repair in 79 of 103 consecutive patients with a modular-design stent-graft prosthesis at two institutions. Results: Left brachial access facilitated (1) angiography to guide juxtarenal device deployment, (2) antegrade contralateral limb access, (3) device delivery through disadvantaged iliac arteries by means of a brachial femoral wire, (4) access to renal arteries when necessary, and (5) catheter exchanges and a reduction in fluoroscopic positional changes. Complications included one puncture-site pseudoaneurysm, seven hematomas, and 29 patients with extensive ecchymosis. The length of stay was not prolonged in any case. There were no embolic, oculocerebral, or ischemic upper extremity events.
