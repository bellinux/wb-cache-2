5|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the AESC was {{the most}} prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were {{for the betterment of}} South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology. The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party {{for the rest of his}} career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} John's sister Teresa Maria in February 1704, greatly saddened him. It {{caused him to}} avoid {{appearing}} at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John's younger brother, Manuel, Count of Ourém. During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression. In May of that year, he eventually returned to the court and reconciled with the king, saying that his saudades for his sister would not get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> performing his duty to the king.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, Yale was {{a violent}} {{man who did}} not {{hesitate}} to inflict pain on others. When angered by his younger brother Angelo, Yale beat him so badly that he wound up in the hospital. When two extortionists attempted to shake down the popular hat-check operator of a neighborhood restaurant, Yale battered the two unconscious. In May 1920, Yale traveled to Chicago and personally killed longtime gang boss Big Jim Colosimo at the behest of Chicago Outfit friends Torrio and Capone. Colosimo was allegedly murdered because he stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gang making huge bootlegging profits in Chicago. Although suspected by Chicago police, Yale was never officially charged.|$|E
25|$|As in {{the case}} of the other medieval Jewish {{philosophers}} little is known of his life. His family had been distinguished for piety and exegetical skill in Talmud, but though he was known in the Jewish community by commentaries on certain books of the Bible, he never seems to have accepted any rabbinical post. It has been suggested that the uniqueness of his opinions may have put obstacles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> advancement to a higher position or office. He is known to have been at Avignon and Orange during his life, and is believed to have died in 1344, though Zacuto asserts that he died at Perpignan in 1370.|$|E

25|$|Udriște's first-born, Mateiaș, {{was adopted}} by the princely couple and groomed as heir to the throne, but died in 1652, before {{reaching}} maturity. This event inspired the Logothete to write his last poem, a conventional epitaph. His sister died in 1653, and his brother-in-law a year later. Năsturel survived the rise of Constantin Șerban, being for a while reappointed as Spatharios, although he was cousins with the rebel leader Hrizea. A new Prince, Mihnea III, identified Năsturel as one of the boyars standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> political projects, and included him in his murderous purge. The Spatharios was strangled at Curtea Veche, and his body was desecrated in the streets of Bucharest. He was survived by another son, Radu Toma, who held major political offices under George Ducas. His direct line of descent was maintained until the 1874 death of Constantin Năsturel-Herescu.|$|E
25|$|Maroto was in Toledo as {{commanding}} general of that province {{when he was}} visited by Ignacio de Negri y Mendizábal, Count of Negri, {{one of the principal}} Carlist conspirators of 1833. After their conversation, Maroto spent some time considering the revolutionary cause and finally decided, with great calm and certainty, to join it. He was asked if, given his position and standing {{at the head of a}} garrison, he could carry out a military coup, which would have given great support to the cause. Rafael Maroto was a proper and loyal man, and this proposal did not seem ethical to him. He did not want his enlistment in the Carlist ranks to start with a betrayal of the flag to which he had sworn allegiance, or with a flight. He decided to follow a legal path, and started by resigning his command and position within the comandancia general. Once he had broken this link, nothing was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> going over to the other side.|$|E

25|$|When {{he arrived}} at Vologda, he was met at the station by a {{commercial}} agent in whose house he was to live. It was a tiny house and George felt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> host who lived {{with his wife and}} four children. He found another house that belonged to a rich merchant and was well treated by the owner. He shared his exile with his brother Nicholas and with his cousin Dmitry Konstantinovich. They could move freely around town and visited each other frequently. On the morning of 14 July, two days before the murder of Nicholas II and his family, a car with four heavily armed men arrived and collected the Grand Dukes from their lodgings; they were arrested and interned in a small, walled village prison, where they could be more easily guarded. Rumors of the assassination of the tsar reached them while they were there. During these months George Mikhailovich frequently managed to smuggle letters to his wife, the last one dated 27 November 1918. His wife unsuccessfully tried to buy out his freedom and that of the other three Grand Dukes for fifty thousand pounds through the Danish minister in St Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{wished to}} drive the Confederates back from their {{advanced}} positions at Little Bethel and Big Bethel because they had begun attacking and harassing his pickets and patrols with squads from these outposts, threatening his bases outside of Fort Monroe and his lines of communication with them and standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plan {{to move up the}} Peninsula toward Richmond, the new capital of the Confederacy. An escaped slave, George Scott, who was working for the Union Army at Fort Monroe was able to scout the Confederate position at Big Bethel and give a good report to Gen. Butler, but Butler knew little about the Confederate position at Little Bethel, which he assumed was also a substantial installation manned by a large force. Along with his aide, Maj. Theodore Winthrop, already an accomplished author, Butler devised a plan for a night march and surprise attack on the Confederate position at Little Bethel at dawn by columns converging from Newport News and Hampton. Butler's main objective was Little Bethel, where he expected to find a large Confederate force. Only after Little Bethel was taken would the commander in the field proceed to Big Bethel, if he chose to do so.|$|E

[...] In the appendix, however, Brown discloses that he does not see Macdonald as the villain he has portrayed in the book. [...] Brown's distrust of big government leads him to push the conspiracy theory side of the story to Macdonald's detriment, but, in the end, he states that he [...] "would rather have lived in a state run by John A. Macdonald than one run by Louis Riel".|$|E

500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was getting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking {{a couple of years before}} that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy {{in a matter of seconds}} he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thinking process. River was also meant to understand this and explain to Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not open her eyes for more than a second but was determined to do it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, and it was so wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
