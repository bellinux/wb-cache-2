5|$|Madison {{was deeply}} {{read in the}} history of {{government}} and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA {{will be used for}} the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E
5000|$|In 1792, Tench Coxe {{made the}} {{following}} {{point in a}} commentary on the Second Amendment: As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> their private <b>arms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tennessee State Constitution, Article I, Section 26, reads:That the {{citizens}} of this state have a right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> to <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> for their common defense; but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms with a view to prevent crime.State supreme court rulings and state attorney general opinions interpret Section 26 to mean regulation cannot and should not interfere with the common lawful uses of firearms, including defense of the home and hunting, but should only be aimed at criminal behavior. Andrews v. State (1870) and Glasscock v. Chattanooga (1928) defined the meaning of regulating arms. [...] "Going armed", carrying any sort of weapon for offense or defense in public, is a crime, except carrying a handgun for defense is allowed with a state-issued permit.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{different}} {{reasons for this}} amendment, and protecting militias {{was only one of}} them; if protecting militias had been the only reason then the amendment could have instead referred to [...] "the right of the militia to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms" [...] instead of [...] "the {{right of the people to}} <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms".|$|R
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> The concept {{of such a}} right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Gun {{rights activists}} {{in recent decades}} have {{sometimes}} argued for a fundamental natural right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in the United States that both predates the U.S. Constitution and is covered by the Constitution's Ninth Amendment; according to this viewpoint, the Second Amendment only enumerates a pre-existing right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms.</b> The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E

25|$|The Second Amendment {{was based}} {{partially}} {{on the right}} to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in English common law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights of 1689.

25|$|The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution {{protects the}} right of the people to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten {{amendments}} contained in the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the right belongs to individuals, while also ruling that the right is not unlimited and does not prohibit all regulation of either firearms or similar devices. State and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing this right per the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.|$|E
25|$|The years 1880 and 1881 saw a new {{influx of}} {{political}} refugees from Germany, {{activists in the}} socialist movement fleeing the crackdown on radicalism launched with the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878. This influx of new German members, coming {{during a time of}} low ebb of the English-speaking membership, extended Germanic influence in the SLP. Excluded from the voting booth by their lack of citizenship status, many of the newcomers had little use for electoral politics. An SLP German militia sued on Second Amendment grounds to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms</b> in Chicago parades. The Supreme Court ruled against them in Presser v. Illinois, however.|$|E
25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control. On {{the subject of}} the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban on guns and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as gun control created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens so they might develop a better relationship with firearms. Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> <b>arms,</b> he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E

He opposes the Patriot Act, federal use of torture, presidential autonomy, a national identification card, warrantless domestic surveillance, and the draft. Paul also believes that the notion of {{the separation of church and}} state is currently misused by the court system: [...] "In case after case, the Supreme Court has used the infamous 'separation of church and state' metaphor to uphold court decisions that allow the federal government to intrude upon and deprive citizens of their religious liberty." ...|$|E
500|$|People v.

The Court stated that this was because the statute amounted to a wholesale statutory ban on the exercise of a personal right that was specifically named in and guaranteed by the United States Constitution, as construed by the United States Supreme Court. [...] A conviction for Unlawful Possession of a Firearm (UPF) was proper because the possession of handguns by minors was conduct that fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment's protection.|$|E
