40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Epidemiological studies of different populations are essential because clinical presentation, organ involvement, disease severity, and prognosis vary significantly according to region and population. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess <b>epidemiological</b> <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> staging factors, and clinical course in patients with sarcoidosis from a tertiary hospital in Oporto, Portugal. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with sarcoidosis and at least 2 years of follow-up evaluated at the Centro Hospitalar de SÃ£o JoÃ£o between 2000 and 2014. Results: We identified 409 patients with sarcoidosis (females, 58. 9 %; mean age at diagnosis, 38. 9 Â Â±Â  13. 4 years; smokers, 14. 4 %]. All the patients were diagnosed according to the ERS/ATS/WASOG consensus statement and 64. 1 % had evidence of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas in biopsy specimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as part of the diagnostic work-up in 289 patients and 90. 2 % had lymphocytosis (CD 4 /CD 8 ratio â¥Â  3. 5 in 60. 9 % of cases). Exertion dyspnea, cough, and constitutional symptoms were the most common presenting symptoms; 10. 1 % of patients were asymptomatic, 22. 8 % had LÃ¶fgren syndrome, and 50. 5 % had extrathoracic involvement. Radiographic stages of disease according to the Scadding criteria were as follows: stage 0 (5. 2 %), stage I (33. 7 %), stage II (47. 0 %), stage III (8. 4 %), and stage IV (5. 7 %). Impaired respiratory function was observed in 45. 6 % patients and was mostly mild. Systemic treatment was administered in 58. 6 % of cases. Overall, 45. 3 % of patients experienced disease resolution. Conclusion: The <b>epidemiological</b> <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of this cohort of patients with sarcoidosis from the Oporto region in northern Portugal revealed <b>epidemiological</b> <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>characteristics</b> that were generally similar to those described in other Western Europe populations and in the US ACCESS study.

40|$|AbstractNon-tuberculous {{mycobacteria}} are environmental, opportunistic pathogens {{that are}} increasingly being recognized as important causes of many human diseases. Among them, rapidly growing mycobacteria are the most notorious organisms causing infectious keratitis. Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) keratitis commonly occurs after trauma or refractive surgery, and can masquerade as fungal, herpetic or amoebic keratitis. Therefore, the diagnosis is often delayed. Prolonged medical treatment and judicious surgical debridement are {{required in order to}} eradicate the pathogens. Combination therapy with aminoglycosides, macrolides and fluoroquinolones improves the prognosis and decreases the occurrence of drug resistance. However, regardless of the development of new diagnostic techniques and antimicrobials, NTM keratitis remains a clinical challenge for most ophthalmologists. In this article, we provide a concise introduction to the <b>epidemiological</b> features <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of NTM keratitis, and the modern diagnostic tools used for it. We also summarize the current concepts of prevention and treatment for this potentially devastating condition...|$|R

40|$|Background Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened Ebola {{management}} centres (EMCs) in Sierra Leone in Kailahun in June, 2014, and Bo in September, 2014. Case fatality in {{the west}} African Ebola virus disease epidemic has been highest in children younger than 5 years. Clinical data on outcomes can provide important evidence to guide future management. However, such data on children are scarce <b>and</b> disaggregated <b>clinical</b> data across all ages in this epidemic have focussed on symptoms reported on arrival at treatment facilities, rather than symptoms and signs observed during admission. We aimed to describe the <b>clinical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of children aged 5 years and younger admitted to the MSF EMCs in Bo and Kailahun, and any associations between these characteristics and mortality.

Methods: Documentary, quantitative and descriptive study. The research sample consisted of all medical records of patients examined and diagnosed with leprosy in the period from 2007 to 2008, totaling an amount of 55. Data was transcribed, tabulated, numbered and presented in tables and charts. Results: It was observed a concentration of cases in economically active age group; females (37 - 67 %); race brown (36 - 65. 5 %); low schooling level, mostly incomplete primary education (25 - 45. 5 %). The cure rate in 2007 was 95. 5 % (21 cases) and, in 2008, 57. 2 % (19 cases). The number of cases with multibacillary clinical forms was high, revealing the late diagnosis, leading to maintained transmission of the disease.
