5|$|On July 13, 1985, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. He relinquished presidential {{power to the}} Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment, which he specifically avoided invoking. The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful. Reagan resumed {{the powers of the}} presidency later that day. In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> In October, more skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.|$|E
5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E

[...] After drawing his blood, they proceeded to drown their victim. [...] Ghazali struggled, vomiting and losing control of his bowels as he died. [...] Blood kept streaming <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> after his death. [...] While Tan stayed behind to clean the flat, Lim and Hoe disposed of the body.

500|$|Measuring , Torpedo...Los! is an oil {{on canvas}} painting. By {{enlarging}} {{the face of the}} captain relative to the entire field, Lichtenstein makes him more prominent than in the source. He retained the source's [...] "clumsiness" [...] in how the secondary figure is presented and replaced the dialogue with a much shorter [...] "cryptic command". The original source had dialog related to the repeated torpedoing of the same ship, but Lichtenstein cut the entire speech balloon down to two words. He moved the captain's scar <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> to his cheek and he made the captain appear more aggressive by depicting him with his mouth wide open, also opting to leave the eye which was not looking through the periscope open. He also made the ship appear to be more technologically sophisticated with a variety of changes. The scar was actually most readily apparent in panels other than the source from the same story.|$|E
500|$|Masterton {{suffered}} a severe internal brain injury {{during the first}} period of Minnesota's January 13, 1968, game against the Oakland Seals at the Met Center. He carried the puck up the ice at full speed, passing it off as two Seals defenders, Larry Cahan and Ron Harris, converged on him. [...] Masterton was knocked backward in the resulting collision and landed on his head. Like most players of his era, he wasn't wearing a helmet. Referee Wally Harris compared the hit to an explosion, adding [...] "he was checked hard, but I'm sure it wasn't a dirty play." [...] The force of the impact caused Masterton to bleed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> ears and mouth. [...] The impact of the hit caused him to lose consciousness before he hit the ice; according to some accounts, he briefly came to and muttered, [...] "Never again, never again" [...] before passing back out.

500|$|The idea of Lisa dating Nelson {{had been}} around for a while, with several {{different}} versions being pitched. The writers wanted a [...] "silly" [...] Homer story to balance the episode out, and the idea of using the telemarketing scam for this had also {{been around for a}} while. By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the way he does. The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> was decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece of toast, which had Vaseline on it.|$|E

2500|$|W.K.'s major-label debut studio album, I Get Wet, was {{released}} on November 13, 2001 on Island Records. Continuing the sound established by his previous Bulb Records EPs, I Get Wet is characterized by its metal and punk rock influences and lyrical content revolving around partying. The album is also well known for its cover art: a photograph by Roe Ethridge of Andrew W.K. with a stream of blood running <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> onto his chin and neck, which generated minor controversy in Europe after it was seen to represent cocaine abuse. To achieve the effect, W.K. initially said that he struck himself {{in the face with}} a brick during the photo shoot, but later explained that it did not lead to enough blood flow. Consequently, he supplemented his own blood with some of an animal which he got from a butcher's shop. I Get Wet earned positive press from publications such as NME and Kerrang! and featured two UK hit singles, [...] "Party Hard" [...] and [...] "She Is Beautiful", also rising to the top spot on Billboards Top Heatseekers albums chart. At the same time, W.K. also developed a reputation for his highly energetic live shows.|$|E

60|$|<b>From</b> rubbing <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> {{with the}} ruler, to poising {{it in his}} hand and giving it an {{occasional}} flourish after the tomahawk manner, the transition was easy and natural.

[...] (The Sadducees interpreted [...] as if it said: [...] "Let him not come into the holy place except with the cloud of incense, for only thus, with the cloud, am I to be seen on the Ark-cover.") The Sadducee wondered when the opportunity would come for him to fulfill the verse. He asked how, when such an opportunity came to his hand, he could not have fulfilled it. The Baraita reported that only a few days later he died and was thrown on the dung heap and worms came forth <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> Some say he was smitten as {{he came out of the}} Holy of Holies.

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Colter {{teamed up}} with John Potts, another {{former member of the}} Lewis and Clark Expedition, once again in the region near Three Forks, Montana. In 1808, Colter and Potts set out from Fort Raymond once more to negotiate trade agreements with local nations. While leading a group of eight hundred Flathead and Crow Indians back to the trading fort, Colter's party was attacked by a mass of Blackfeet numbering over fifteen-hundred. The Flatheads and Crows managed to force the Blackfeet into retreat, but Colter suffered a leg wound from either a bullet or arrow. This wound was non-serious as Colter quickly recuperated and left Fort Raymond with Potts once more the following year. In 1809, another altercation with the Blackfeet resulted in John Potts' death and Colter's capture. While going by canoe up the Jefferson River, Potts and Colter encountered several hundred Blackfeet who demanded they come ashore. Colter went ashore and was disarmed and stripped naked. When Potts then refused to come ashore he was shot and wounded. Potts in his turn shot one of the Indian warriors and died riddled with bullets fired by the Indians on the shore. His body was brought ashore and hacked to pieces. After a council, Colter was motioned, told in Crow to leave, and encouraged to run. It soon became apparent that he was running for his life pursued by a large pack of young braves.
