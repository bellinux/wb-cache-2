5|$|Hi-5 {{were one}} of Australia's highest paid {{entertainment}} entities, placing in the Business Review Weeklys annual list several times, earning an estimated A$18million in 2009. The members of Hi-5 are employees of the brand and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> equity. Their albums have been certified by ARIA as double platinum (It's a Party), platinum (Jump and Jive with Hi-5, Boom Boom Beat, It's a Hi-5 Christmas) and gold (Celebrate). By 2004 the original line-up had received five consecutive Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards in the same category, Best Children's Album, a then-record. By that time they had also received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program. Foley stated that Hi-5 set a benchmark for a new style of non-traditional children's entertainment. Hi-5 broke into the South East Asian market after the brand was sold by the Nine Network in 2012. Nine renewed its partnership with the franchise in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The backstory {{presented}} in StarCrafts manual {{and in the}} novel Shadow Hunters also shows {{the rise of a}} second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala out of fear of losing their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> anything against their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in any way they can. The Nerazim are presented as nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar) and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim Protoss. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} domed, {{though it may}} lack a roof in {{enclosed}} sites. It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a middle layer of dead grass and leaves, and a lining of feathers, {{as well as of}} paper and other soft materials. Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30cm (8 × 12in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.|$|E

5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization {{and stability of}} the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they {{have a set of}} rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E
