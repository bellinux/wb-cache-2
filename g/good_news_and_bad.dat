40|$|We {{present a}} model in which some of the firm’s {{information}} (“new”) can be disclosed verifiably and some information (“type”) cannot, to show that some firms may voluntarily withhold <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> We describe an equilibrium in which high-type firms withhold <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> whereas low-type firms disclose <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Under some parameter values, this equilibrium exists when other more traditional equilibria are ruled out by standard equilibrium refinements. The model explains some otherwise anomalous empirical evidence concerning stock price reactions to disclosure, provides some new empirical predictions, and suggests that mandatory disclosure requirements may have the undesirable consequence of {{making it more difficult}} for firms to reveal information that cannot be disclosed credibly...|$|R

40|$|The {{negative}} relation between returns and return volatility, {{referred to as}} the “leverage effect”, has been a puzzle in the finance literature since the 1970 s. Strategic disclosure of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withholding of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> provides a potential explanation. <b>Good</b> <b>news</b> disclosures imply a positive share price response and a reduction in residual uncertainty; inferences of bad news imply a negative share price response and a smaller reduction in residual uncertainty. We document that the leverage effect is stronger for firms in industries with greater return synchronicity, following the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and for firms in Canada relative to the U. S. These three patterns suggest that the leverage effect is stronger in environments in which strategic disclosure of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withholding of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> is more likely to characterize disclosure decisions. Thus, the evidence is consistent with the effects of this disclosure strategy on uncertainty as an explanation for the {{negative relation}} between returns and return volatility. Does strategic disclosure explain the ‘leverage effect’? An empirical regularity is that returns are negatively related to return volatility. Black (1976) provided an early explanation for the phenomenon. As returns increase, market leverag...|$|R

30|$|On the {{positive}} side, some prior studies support that higher reporting frequency reduces information asymmetry and put analysts and traders {{on a more}} level playing field as insiders (Leftwich et al. 1981; Schipper 1981; Verrecchia 1990; Botosan and Harris 2000; Yee 2004; Butler et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2012). On the negative side, firms that report more frequently have better incentive to disclose selective information to the market—firms may {{be more willing to}} disclose <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> (Brown et al. 2009). In addition, the accounting quality of more frequent financial reports could be lower if short-term monitoring pressure induces more earnings management (Gigler et al. 2014). In this paper, we argue against the traditional view of higher reporting frequent being necessarily more positive. The results are often not obvious and depend on how the traders process the information.|$|R

In response to a perceived need for further research into this area, an analysis of 60 UK chairman’s statements was conducted in order to test for possible determinants of readability variability. Results show the introduction to the chairman’s statement is systematically easier to read than other parts of the chairman’s statement. No evidence was found to support prior research that, rather than present accounting narratives objectively, managers use readability variability to emphasise <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> obfuscate <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> The thematic structures within the chairman’s statement were investigated to explore whether they were responsible for systematic patterns in the variability of annual report readability.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} managerial (or corporate) caution, defined as the propensity to delay consequential decisions {{in the face of}} uncertainty, and conditional accounting conservatism [...] and document a substitution effect between the two. Economic theory predicts that caution reduces the probability of costly mistakes and improves the quality of information at managers’ disposal. Better-quality information ensures that <b>good</b> <b>news</b> in cautious firms {{is more likely to be}} persistent than in incautious ones, while bad news is more likely to be transitory. As a result, cautious firms report <b>good</b> <b>news</b> sooner <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> new later than incautious firms; i. e., the former exhibit lower conditional accounting conservatism than the latter.

50|$|Naturally {{regenerated}} {{trees in}} an understorey prior to harvesting constitute {{a classic case}} of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> news. Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by aspen, as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba, and elsewhere. Until {{the latter part of the}} last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with final yield to be realized after slow natural succession, but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful. This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce advance growth, leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both hardwoods and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The purpose of share option grants is to align {{the interests of}} managers with those of shareholders. However, share option compensation may encourage opportunistic managerial behaviour aimed at maximising {{the value of their}} share options. Managers may artificially decrease share prices at the grant date which tends to be the value at which the exercise price is set. 			This study will examine whether the following four methods of depressing share prices are prevalent in the UK: 			 			Retrospectively choosing the date on which the option is granted (backdating); 			Pushing forward (delaying) the release of bad (good) news; 			Timing the option grant to occur before (after) the release of good (<b>bad)</b> news; <b>and</b> 			Using impression management to dampen <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> enhance <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> 			Backdating is suggested if the option grant date coincides with market lows significantly more often than would randomly be expected. The existence of significantly negative abnormal returns around grant dates suggests that managers either opportunistically time bad news disclosures (scheduled awards) to coincide with grant dates or time grant dates (unscheduled awards) with bad news disclosures. Finally, significantly higher proportions of unfavourable and pessimistic disclosures may imply managerial impression management...|$|R
