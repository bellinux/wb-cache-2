500|$|David {{has also}} been {{involved}} in other films and television series. David wrote and directed the 1998 film Sour Grapes, about two cousins who feud over a casino jackpot. It was neither a commercial nor a critical success. He appeared in minor parts in two 1980s Woody Allen films– Radio Days and New York Stories– before taking the leading role in Allen's New York-based comedy film Whatever Works (2009). David had a cameo appearance on the HBO series Entourage as a client of Ari Gold, and because his daughters were Hannah Montana fans, David, along with his daughters, guest-starred, as themselves, in the episode [...] "My Best Friend's Boyfriend," [...] {{in which they were}} waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> at a fancy restaurant.|$|E

[...] Blunt, by contrast, found Streep's laugh relaxed her enough to keep her focused on playing a nervous, distracted Emily. The highlight of the session was Streep's first line as Miranda. Instead of the [...] "strident, bossy, barking voice" [...] everyone expected, Hathaway says, Streep silenced the room by speaking in a near whisper. [...] "It was so unexpected and brilliant." [...] At the reading Streep also changed Miranda's last line to [...] "everybody wants to be us" [...] from the original [...] "me".|$|E

500|$|... "In the Name of the Grandfather" [...] was {{directed}} by Ralph Sosa {{and was the first}} episode of the show to be written by Matt Marshall. Marshall pitched the idea in 2007 and the script was ready <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> read later that year, but the Writers Guild of America strike delayed work on the episode. Described by executive producer Al Jean as [...] "an affectionate love letter to Ireland", the episode was inspired by a New York Times article about the effects of Ireland's smoking ban on pubs. Guest stars for the episode include Colm Meaney as Tom O'Flanagan, Glen Hansard as a street musician and Markéta Irglová as an Eastern European woman. Kenneth Branagh and Kathy Ireland were also reported to have roles in the episode but neither appeared in the final version. The episode contains numerous jokes about Ireland and references to Irish culture including the Giant's Causeway, Blarney Castle, James Joyce, Bloomsday, leprechauns, Guinness, Riverdance, U2 and the film Once.|$|E
500|$|... "In the Name of the Grandfather" [...] was {{the first}} episode written by Matt Marshall who had {{previously}} worked on the show as a writers' assistant. In 2007, he pitched the idea of Grampa being neglected and the Simpsons taking him to Ireland. The script was ready <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> read in late 2007, but the Writers Guild of America strike delayed work on the episode. Executive producer Al Jean said the episode {{is intended to be}} [...] "an affectionate love letter to Ireland" [...] because many of the writers have Irish roots. He added, [...] "The episode is based on the experiences of myself {{and a lot of the}} writers on The Simpsons who have Irish ancestry and come back to visit to find it very different, much more hi-tech." [...] According to James L. Brooks, the story was also inspired by a New York Times article about the effects of the smoking ban in Ireland on pubs.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of season two's episodes. David {{came up with the}} idea of the real-time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. When David presented the episode to NBC executives, he received a negative reaction. The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested. Executive Warren Littlefield commented that he thought there were pages missing from the script he had received. David argued that each character had a storyline: Jerry's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where; Elaine's story was that she was very hungry; and George's story was that he was unable to use the phone. NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode. To satisfy the executives, staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group's storyline to be on their way to a one-night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space, and thus introducing a [...] "ticking clock" [...] scenario to the story. When the NBC executives still objected, David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script. Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce [...] "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] without any significant alterations, although they strongly advised them not go through with it, and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season. In 2015, Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host's calling [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza" [...] was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza. [...] "Bonanza" [...] rhymes with [...] "Costanza" [...] and the show's main characters are the [...] "Cartwright" [...] family.|$|E
