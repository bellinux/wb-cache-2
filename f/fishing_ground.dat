5|$|The {{effect that}} seamounts have on fish populations {{has not gone}} unnoticed by the {{commercial}} fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively fished {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical <b>fishing</b> <b>ground,</b> the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.|$|E

25|$|In Vietnam, elegant coracles {{constructed}} with bamboo, are still used from many beaches, {{such as at}} Nha Trang, Phan Thiết and Mui Ne. The coracles are towed in a line behind a motor boat, like beads on a string, to their <b>fishing</b> <b>ground.</b> There the fisherman lay fishing nets in the sea before another tow returns them with their catch.|$|E
25|$|A {{fishing village}} is a village, usually located near a <b>fishing</b> <b>ground,</b> with an economy based on {{catching}} fish and harvesting seafood. The continents and islands {{around the world}} have coastlines totalling around 356,000 kilometres (221,000mi). From Neolithic times, these coastlines, as well as the shorelines of inland lakes and the banks of rivers, have been punctuated with fishing villages. Most surviving fishing villages are traditional.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the mid 1930s, Wyangala was {{earmarked}} as a major tourist attraction and important <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> for the Lachlan Valley. The objective of turning Wyangala into a 'national playground' and resort was the vision of Reg Hailstone, a civic leader of the 1940s and 1950s. Although Wyangala never became a 'tourist resort', Hailstone's vision for a national playground was fulfilled over the proceeding years.|$|E
30|$|Similar {{arguments}} {{could be}} used for the association of distance to <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> which {{we were not able to}} show. Distance to <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> was included in the analysis as a proxy for the availability of fish and therefore a source of animal protein-rich food. Although distance might determine the possibility for fishing, informal talks to people in the area indicated that even if people lived near <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> the lack of money to purchase fishing equipment stopped them from fishing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Questionnaire {{studies were}} carried out on 11 special <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> for anglers in Po-land. Data were {{collected}} on production and economic parameters characterising these fishing gro-unds. Three groups of <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> for anglers were distinguished based on species composition of the catch, but also {{the degree to which the}} respondents had completed the questionnaire forms. Basic production and economic parameters were analysed. Question whether it was justified to classify some water bodies as special <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> for anglers was thoroughly discussed...|$|R
40|$|In the East China Sea, mutual {{seasonal}} {{changes can}} be observed between the Kuroshiwo warm current and the coastal water mass (Fig. 1). Hydrographical conditions on the white marlin <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> depend upon the changes of these two water masses. As shown in the charts (Fig. 3 -A, B, C&D), the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> of white marlins roughly coincide with those of mackerels irrespective of the fishing seasons, hence {{it is to be}} considered that mackerels play a part as a biological factor for white marlins. The <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> in winter are formed in the outside vicinity of the cold front (near Lat. 26 °N) {{in the southern part of}} the East China Sea, while in spring and summer the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> are found in the outside vicinity of the low-salinity front (near Lat. 29 °N) in the eastern part of the East China Sea (Fig. 2). In autumn such frontal areas become undistinguishable and still the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> of white marlins and those of mackerels are formed overlapping each other (Fig. 3 -D), therefore it seems very likely that the formation of the white marlin <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> in autumn depend more on the distribution of mackerels rather than on the hydrographic conditions. ...|$|R
25|$|However, {{most of its}} {{commercial}} tradings focus on retail businesses and restaurants for stationed military consumption. Farm products of Matsu include rice, sugar cane, tea plant, orange. Sea animals, such as fish, clams, and jellyfish, are also popular exports due to its nature as the major traditional industry in Matsu. However, the flourish of <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> is almost exhausted by arbitrary fish bombing by Mainland China fishing boats, while the population of fishes is decreasing as well.|$|E
25|$|In the 1840s, {{when the}} {{railways}} reached {{the coasts of}} Picardy, Normandy and Brittany, the market changed suddenly. The railway saw to the rapid transit aspect of the trade. The chasse-marée vehicle was redundant {{on the main road}} routes but was still used more locally. The important thing then was for the fisherman to make his landing in time to catch the early morning train which took the product to the morning markets in inland towns. In order to make a living, he had to see that with or without wind, he was ashore in time. He would therefore choose his <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> and the time of leaving it with a view to how the tide would carry him to the fish quay for 4 a.m. or thereabouts. Nonetheless, now that he was working to city time rather than the tide, the railway fish quay had to be accessible at all states of the tide. Over the years, the canneries took ever more of his catch so that missing the train did not represent a total loss.|$|E
25|$|For centuries, {{the narrow}} passage {{has been a}} popular <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> for Aboriginal {{communities}} in the area. European settlers also began to congregate there in the summer months to fish. Eventually, the Fraser Canyon became a route used by gold rush miners wishing to access the upper Fraser gold-bearing bars and the upper country beyond up the Fraser and the Thompson. In the 1880s the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built a transcontinental railroad that passed along the bank at Hells Gate, and in 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) began constructing a second track. In 1914 a large rockslide triggered by CNR construction fell into the river at Hells Gate, obstructing the passage of Pacific salmon needing to swim upstream to spawn. Salmon had difficulty passing through the now swifter water, and were appearing in increased numbers downstream below the Hells Gate passage and in tributary rivers and streams {{that they had not}} inhabited before. In the winter of 1914 debris removal began, and in 1915 the river was pronounced clear. However many biologists claim that the river was permanently altered and the salmon migration would forever remain disturbed by the slide.|$|E
25|$|A {{village is}} called a kotan in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, {{particularly}} in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal clan. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R
40|$|Congestion on <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> and {{overfishing}} {{have convinced}} fishermen, economists, and most {{governments of the}} necessity to control access to <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds.</b> The living resources of the sea, however, present particularities which may make the task of redefining international fishing rights more difficult than that of distributing claims to mineral resources...|$|R

500|$|Part of Pettigrew State Park {{surrounds}} Lake Phelps, one of {{the oldest}} lakes in the eastern United States and a former hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> for the Algonquian peoples. [...] Archaeologists have found dugout canoes in the lake that are up to 4,400 years old, preserved by its unusually clean waters. [...] Pettigrew is home to an abundance of wildlife: Lake Phelps is a primary wintering location for several types of waterfowl, including Canada geese and Tundra swans. [...] The park is also home to the woodland creatures, such as raccoons and white-tailed deer, that are commonly found along the east coast of the United States. Lake Phelps contains several species of game fish including largemouth bass and catfish.|$|E
500|$|During the Devensian glaciation, {{the northernmost}} {{part of the}} {{peninsula}} from which Britain was formed was covered with glacial ice, and the sea level was about [...] lower than it is today. This glacial ice advanced and retreated several times during this period, and {{much of what is}} now the North Sea and the English Channel was an expanse of low-lying tundra, which, around 12,000BC, extended northwards to a point roughly parallel with Aberdeenshire, in eastern Scotland. In 1998, archaeologist B.J. Coles named this low-lying area [...] "Doggerland", in which the River Thames flowed somewhat to the north of its current route, joining the Rhine to flow west to the Atlantic Ocean along the line of what is now the English Channel. Human hunters roamed this land, which, by about 8000BC, had a varied coastline of lagoons, salt marshes, mudflats, beaches, inland streams, rivers, marshes, and included lakes. It may have been the richest hunting, fowling and <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> available to the people of Mesolithic Europe.|$|E
500|$|Human {{habitation}} on the Klamath {{dates to}} at least 7,000years ago. Many of the Native American groups along the river depended on the huge runs of Pacific salmon, the third largest on the Pacific coast {{of what is now}} the United States. These groups included the Shasta along the middle and upper parts of the river, the Yurok, Hupa, and Karuk along the canyons of the lower river, and the Modoc, Klamath and Yahooskin in the desert valleys of the upper basin. About [...] of the Klamath River, or half the river's length, was on Shasta territory. The Yurok were the second most prominent group on the river, controlling about [...] of the lower Klamath River and a large section of the Northern California coast. Along with the Hupa and Karuk, the lower to mid-upper Tribes caught salmon from the river with weirs, basket traps and harpoons. Ishi Pishi Falls, a set of rapids on the Klamath River near the confluence with the Salmon River, has been a traditional <b>fishing</b> <b>ground</b> for thousands of years. Most of the upstream groups had a nomadic hunting-gathering lifestyle and did not depend on salmon as much as downstream tribes. The Klamath River's name was recorded by Europeans in the 19thcentury derived from the word klamet or the Klamath Tribe. Prior to European contact, the river was called by many different names, including Ishkêesh and Koke. The Klamath Tribe's name came from the Upper Chinookan word /ɬámaɬ/, literally [...] "they of the river".|$|E

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of black seabream Spondyliosoma cantharus otoliths from three main fishery grounds (Olhao, Sagres and Sesimbra) located along c. 400 km of the Portuguese {{south and west}} coasts was examined. Element:Ca ratios were determined in whole otoliths and otolith cores of young adult specimens of 23 years of age. Using the data from whole otoliths, {{it was possible to}} discriminate among S. cantharus from the three <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> with an average accuracy of 91 %. Differences among <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds</b> were significant for all element:Ca ratios, and otoliths from Sagres had significantly higher levels of all ratios compared to the other <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds.</b> In contrast, the chemical composition of the otolith core, representative of the larval stage, showed limited variation among the <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> with an average discrimination accuracy of only 44 %, although the Mg:Ca ratio of the otolith cores was also significantly higher for the Sagres samples. The data suggest that larval stages experienced a homogenous environment consistent with an offshore oceanic spawning. Juveniles appeared to display local residency on the inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>grounds,</b> areas probably characterized by greater environmental heterogeneity. Spondyliosoma cantharus population structure is consistent with distinct local population units that share a spawning ground providing recruits to different coastal fishery areas...|$|R
