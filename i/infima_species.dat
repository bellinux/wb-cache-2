60|$|By the Aristotelian logicians, {{the terms}} {{genus and species}} were used in a more {{restricted}} sense. They did not admit every class which could be divided into other classes to be a genus, or every class which could {{be included in a}} larger class to be a species. Animal was by them considered a genus; man and brute co-ordinate species under that genus: biped, however, would not have been admitted to be a genus with reference to man, but a proprium or accidens only. It was requisite, according to their theory, that genus and species should be of the essence of the subject. Animal was of the essence of man; biped was not. And in every classification they considered some one class as the lowest or <b>infima</b> <b>species.</b> Man, for instance, was a lowest species. Any further divisions into which the class might be capable of being broken down, as man into white, black, and red man, or into priest and layman, they did not admit to be species.|$|E
60|$|When the <b>infima</b> <b>species,</b> or {{proximate}} Kind, {{to which}} an individual belongs, has been ascertained, the properties common to that Kind include necessarily {{the whole of the}} common properties of every other real Kind to which the individual can be referrible. Let the individual, for example, be Socrates, and the proximate Kind, man. Animal, or living creature, is also a real kind, and includes Socrates; but, since it likewise includes man, or in other words, since all men are animals, the properties common to animals form a portion of the common properties of the sub-class, man. And if there be any class which includes Socrates without including man, that class is not a real Kind. Let the class, for example, be flat-nosed; that being a class which includes Socrates, without including all men. To determine whether it is a real Kind, we must ask ourselves this question: Have all flat-nosed animals, in addition to whatever is implied in their flat noses, any common properties, other than those which are common to all animals whatever? If they had; if a flat nose were a mark or index to an indefinite number of other peculiarities, not deducible from the former by an ascertainable law, then out of the class man we might cut another class, flat-nosed man, which, according to our definition, would be a Kind. But if we could do this, man would not be, as it was assumed to be, the proximate Kind. Therefore, the properties of the proximate Kind do comprehend those (whether known or unknown) of all other Kinds to which the individual belongs; which was the point we undertook to prove. And hence, every other Kind which is predicable of the individual, will be to the proximate Kind in the relation of a genus, according to even the popular acceptation of the terms genus and species; that is, it will be a larger class, including it and more.|$|E
60|$|And here we lose {{even that}} vestige of a meaning {{grounded}} {{in the nature of}} the things themselves, which may be supposed to be attached to the word essence when it is said that genus and species must be of the essence of the thing. There can be no doubt that when the schoolmen talked of the essences of things as opposed to their accidents, they had confusedly in view the distinction between differences of kind, and the differences which are not of kind; they meant to intimate that genera and species must be Kinds. Their notion of the essence of a thing was a vague notion of a something which makes it what it is, i.e., which makes it the Kind of thing that it is—which causes it to have all that variety of properties which distinguish its Kind. But when the matter came to be looked at more closely, nobody could discover what caused the thing to have all those properties, nor even that there was any thing which caused it to have them. Logicians, however, not liking to admit this, and being unable to detect what made the thing to be what it was, satisfied themselves with what made it to be what it was called. Of the innumerable properties, known and unknown, that are common to the class man, a portion only, and of course a very small portion, are connoted by its name; these few, however, will naturally have been thus distinguished from the rest either for their greater obviousness, or for greater supposed importance. These properties, then, which were connoted by the name, logicians seized upon, and called them the essence of the species; and not stopping there, they affirmed them, in the case of the <b>infima</b> <b>species,</b> to be the essence of the individual too; for it was their maxim, that the species contained the “whole essence” of the thing. Metaphysics, that fertile field of delusion propagated by language, does not afford a more signal instance of such delusion. On this account it was that rationality, being connoted by the name man, was allowed to be a differentia of the class; but the peculiarity of cooking their food, not being connoted, was relegated to the class of accidental properties.|$|E
60|$|After the {{recognition}} and definition, then, of the <b>infimæ</b> <b>species,</b> {{the next step}} is to arrange those <b>infimæ</b> <b>species</b> into larger groups: making these groups correspond to Kinds wherever it is possible, but in most cases without any such guidance. And in doing this it is true that we are naturally and properly guided, in most cases at least, by resemblance to a type. We form our groups round certain selected Kinds, each of which serves as a sort of exemplar of its group. But though the groups are suggested by types, I can not think that a group when formed is determined by the type; that in deciding whether a species belongs to the group, a reference is made to the type, and not to the characters; that the characters “can not be expressed in words.” This assertion is inconsistent with Dr. Whewell’s own statement of the fundamental principle of classification, namely, that “general assertions shall be possible.” If the class did not possess any characters in common, what general assertions would be possible respecting it? Except that they all resemble each other more than they resemble any thing else, nothing whatever could be predicated of the class.|$|R
60|$|For {{even the}} greater generalizations, which embrace {{comprehensive}} Kinds containing under them {{a great number}} and variety of <b>infimæ</b> <b>species,</b> are only empirical laws, resting on induction by simple enumeration merely, and not on any process of elimination—a process wholly inapplicable {{to this sort of}} case. Such generalizations, therefore, ought to be grounded on an examination of all the <b>infimæ</b> <b>species</b> comprehended in them, and not of a portion only. We can not conclude (where causation is not concerned), because a proposition is true of a number of things resembling one another only in being animals, that it is therefore true of all animals. If, indeed, any thing be true of species which differ more from one another than either differs from a third, especially if that third species occupies in most of its known properties a position between the two former, there is some probability that the same thing will also be true of that intermediate species; for it is often, though by no means universally, found, that there is a sort of parallelism in the properties of different Kinds, and that their degree of unlikeness in one respect bears some proportion to their unlikeness in others. We see this parallelism in the properties of the different metals; in those of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon; of chlorine, iodine, and bromine; in the natural orders of plants and animals, etc. But there are innumerable anomalies and exceptions to this sort of conformity; if indeed the conformity itself be any thing but an anomaly and an exception in nature.|$|R

If blackness, in the crows {{in which it has}} been observed, be not a property of Kind, but can be present or absent without any difference generally in the properties of the object, then it is not an ultimate fact in the individuals themselves, but is certainly dependent on a cause. There are, no doubt, many properties which vary from individual to individual of the same Kind, even the same <b>infima</b> <b>species,</b> or lowest Kind. Some flowers may be either white or red, without differing in any other respect. But these properties are not ultimate; they depend on causes. So far as the properties of a thing belong to its own nature, and do not arise from some cause extrinsic to it, they are always the same in the same Kind. Take, for instance, all simple substances and elementary powers; the only things of which we are certain that some at least of their properties are really ultimate. Color is generally esteemed the most variable of all properties: yet we do not find that sulphur is sometimes yellow and sometimes white, or that it varies in color at all, except so far as color is the effect of some extrinsic cause, as of the sort of light thrown upon it, the mechanical arrangement of the particles (as after fusion), etc. We do not find that iron is sometimes fluid and sometimes solid at the same temperature; gold sometimes malleable and sometimes brittle; that hydrogen will sometimes combine with oxygen and sometimes not; or the like. If from simple substances we pass to any of their definite compounds, as water, lime, or sulphuric acid, there is the same constancy in their properties. When properties vary from individual to individual, it is either in the case of miscellaneous aggregations, such as atmospheric air or rock, composed of heterogeneous substances, and not constituting or belonging to any real Kind,(191) or it is in the case of organic beings. In them, indeed, there is variability in a high degree. Animals of the same species and race, human beings of the same age, sex, and country, will be most different, for example, in face and figure. But organized beings (from the extreme complication of the laws by which they are regulated) being more eminently modifiable, that is, liable to be influenced by a greater number and variety of causes, than any other phenomena whatever; having also themselves had a beginning, and therefore a cause; {{there is reason to believe}} that none of their properties are ultimate, but all of them derivative, and produced by causation. And the presumption is confirmed, by the fact that the properties which vary from one individual to another, also generally vary more or less at different times in the same individual; which variation, like any other event, supposes a cause, and implies, consequently, that the properties are not independent of causation.|$|E

40|$|In the Categories Aristotle {{claims that}} {{substances}} {{may be the}} subjects of true predications, but that a substance may never be truly predicated of a subject. Yet in the Metaphysics substance is identified with form, although form may be predicated of a subject. The questions posed by these two claims about substance remain {{no matter how the}} puzzle in Aristotelian interpretation is solved. Frege, and most contemporary philosophers, hold that individuals are not predicable of anything. This is reflected in the standard formal semantics of first order logic. The identity of substance and essence, on the other hand, has won little sympathy in the analytic tradition. On close examination, however, it is found that there is little reason to hold that the differences between subjects, or individual terms, and predicates reflects an ontological difference. An adequate language may be formulated in which the distinction between individual terms and monadic predicates is eliminated altogether. Once the claim that substances cannot be predicated is abandoned, {{the question of how to}} distinguish substances from other predicables takes on renewed urgency. A critical examination of recent work on the persistence of objects provides support for the view that material substances are necessarily members of a hierarchy of kinds, from genus to <b>infima</b> <b>species.</b> Substances may be distinguished from a wide variety of material predicables, and may be identified with the remainder. A formal system of quantified modal logic with identity provides a tool for understanding the identity of substance and essence. In this system, predication is interpreted by means of set inclusion, rather than by means of set membership. This is in keeping with some of the traditional views of predication expressed by Aristotle, Porphyry, and the Port-Royal logicians, and it provides a framework for the examination of related problems in philosophical logic...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} deictic abstraction (deictic ideation), taking {{as a point of}} departure Husserl’s prototypical but insufficient description of the act of ideation in which a shade of color comes to givenness as an ideal object, i. e., aber non-individual or abstract object, {{on the basis of a}} perceived individual object. This concept comprises not only color-ideation and ideations (abstractions) of universalities of the sensuous sphere (<b>species</b> <b>infima</b> of certain sounds, noises, smells, tastes), but all acts founded in perceptions in which ideal objects are directly referred to by means of demonstrative expressions (“this,” “like this,” “such,” etc.). This allows various types of deictic ideations or abstractions, corresponding to the degree of universality and the kind of ideal object concerned, to be brought to light through the analysis of particular cases of everyday acts of deictic abstraction, including deictic abstractions of predicative universals of the lowest level of universality (e. g., “this smell of perfume,” “a bug like this”); deictic abstractions of non-predicative universals, especially of universal ways (manners, schemata) of doing something (e. g., of tying a shoelace); and deictic abstractions of individual styles of doing something (e. g., of playing a musical composition in a typical individual way). Deictic abstractions not only turn out to be constitutive for the formation of perceptual concepts of the lower and lowest levels, but also prove to be foundational for all kinds of learning in which schemata of actions are acquired from a model (observational learning). status: publishe...|$|R
