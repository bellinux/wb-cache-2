40|$|Graduation date: 2014 In {{the wake}} of {{policies}} catalyzing settlement through agrarian-based land ‘improvement’, private property rights absorbed water resources through Western water law. Consequently, these dominant user regimes and the doctrine of prior appropriation allocated nearly 80 percent of freshwater resources to agricultural use. Following enactment of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973 agricultural water users {{and the federal government}} were set on a collision course, as private property was now subject to regulatory imposition. Within Western states water bodies contiguous to private agrarian lands host the majority of aquatic species listed under the ESA. Of all the effects associated with agricultural water use, streamflow depletion constitutes the primary source of species imperilment. Customary irrigation practices often dewater streams completely or render aquatic habitat inhospitable. Consequently, curtailment of water use is increasingly sought during enforcement of ESA regulations. Encounters between <b>ESA</b> <b>regulation</b> and impositions upon agricultural water use are largely reactionary, litigious, and costly; this begs the question of remedy. Responses attending to the matter indicate collaborative and precautionary measures as prospective solutions. Within the context of streamflow-based habitat modification the answer consistently indicates transactional mechanisms reallocating water to instream use. Due to priority-based allocation developed through the doctrine of prior appropriation acquisition of senior water rights is imperative for streamflow restoration. Within Oregon's Whychus Creek agricultural water users employed a series of water right transactions serving to bolster instream flow to avert <b>ESA</b> <b>regulation.</b> Many of these transactions have been implemented through Oregon's Conserved Water Program; a unique statute providing benefits for the environment and agricultural water users alike. Through these transactions senior water rights have been reallocated to instream use and are being met, resulting in a robust presence of instream flow...|$|E
40|$|Within a week, {{both the}} Fifth and D. C. Circuits upheld the takings {{prohibitions}} of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, {{as applied to}} species found only in single states, against Commerce Clause challenges. Both cases reach the same result, but the legal analysis used to get there could hardly be more different. In GDF Realty, the Fifth Circuit found the requisite 2 ̆ 2 substantial impact 2 ̆ 2 on commerce by treating the species themselves as commodities and aggregating {{the economic impact of}} all endangered species 2 ̆ 2 takings 2 ̆ 2. The D. C. Circuit, by contrast, held in Rancho Viejo that the true object of <b>ESA</b> <b>regulation</b> is not endangered species, but the commercial development that threatens them, which plainly falls within Congress 2 ̆ 7 s powers to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The two courts saved the threatened arroyo toads and subterranean invertebrates, but they read the Endangered Species Act as if it were two different statutes. This curious divergence can only be understood in light of the unsettled state of Commerce Clause jurisprudence following United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison. Those two decisions upended fifty years of conventional wisdom about the limits on Congress 2 ̆ 7 s power under the Commerce Clause – namely, that there were effectively none – and left lower courts with an uncertain new framework to apply. Of the two cases considered here, Rancho Viejo represents the abler attempt to square the ESA with the new Commerce Clause doctrine, because its analysis is more objective than GDF Realty 2 ̆ 7 s and more clearly satisfies the strictures of Lopez and Morrison. But like GDF Realty, Rancho Viejo must present the ESA 2 ̆ 7 s impact on commerce, which is peripheral in the statutory design, as the Act 2 ̆ 7 s core object – must turn the ESA 2 ̆ 2 inside out, 2 ̆ 2 so to speak – in order to justify it under the Commerce Clause. This cramped conception of the statute does not convincingly justify all of its applications. The shortcomings of Rancho Viejo do not represent sloppiness {{on the part of the}} D. C. Circuit, however. Instead, they reflect the failure of the Lopez and Morrison framework to meet the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s stated aspiration to distinguish 2 ̆ 2 between what is truly national and what is truly local 2 ̆ 2...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which landowners have preemptively destroyed habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCWs) in the forests of North Carolina in order to avoid potential land-use regulations prescribed under the En-dangered Species Act (ESA). Under the ESA, it is illegal to kill an endangered species and it is also illegal to damage its habitat. By preventing the establishment of an old-growth pine stand, landowners can ensure that RCWs do not inhabit their land and avoid <b>ESA</b> <b>regulations</b> that limit or prohibit timber harvest activity. Data from 1984 – 90 on over 1, 000 individual forest plots are used to test predictions about the probability of harvest and the age of timber when it is harvested. We find that increases in the proximity of a plot to RCWs increases the probability that the plot will be harvested and decreases the age at which the forest is harvested. [T]he highest level of assurance that a property owner will not face an ESA issue is to maintain the property in a condition such that protected species cannot occupy the property [...] This {{is referred to as the}} “scorched earth ” technique.

40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has {{for years}} failed to create {{regulations}} that would govern discharges from aquaculture facilities under the Clean Water Act (CWA). As recent cases from Maine have shown, this failure caused salmon producing aquaculture companies {{to do very}} little to reduce the effluent they released directly into the Atlantic. Under the Clean Water Act, however, such polluting is prohibited. Furthermore, under the Endangered Species Act (<b>ESA),</b> additional <b>regulations</b> probably would be imposed on these companies to protect the endangered wild Atlantic salmon that inhabit the rivers and ocean near these facilities. Recent regulations proposed by EPA, however, are probably not stringent enough to meet the statutory requirements of either the CWA or the ESA. While the cleanliness of our waters and the diversity of species should be maintained at the least, these goals can hopefully be reconciled {{with the growth of}} {{an important part of the}} local and national economy...|$|R
5000|$|In Case 14/11 DB Schenker I, the Court held that, the {{objective}} of establishing a dynamic and homogeneous European Economic Area can only be achieved if EFTA and EU citizens and economic operators enjoy, relying upon EEA law, the same rights in both the EU and EFTA pillars of the EEA. As regards {{the substance of the}} case, the Court found that a homogeneous interpretation of the Rules on Access to Documents adopted by <b>ESA</b> and of <b>Regulation</b> 1049/2001 was indispensable. Recital 7 RAD provided that ESA will, in the application of the RAD, strive to achieve a homogeneous interpretation with that of the Union courts and the European Ombudsman so as to ensure at least the same degree of openness as provided for by Regulation 1049/2001. The Court concluded that it was evident that ESA itself aimed to ensure procedural homogeneity by adopting the RAD. In fact, it was required to do so for reasons of reciprocity.|$|R
