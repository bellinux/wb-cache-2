5|$|Having {{originally}} been in {{development for the}} GameCube, <b>Grabbed</b> by the Ghoulies was the first Rare game {{to be published by}} Microsoft after Rare was bought out from Nintendo. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release. Criticism was directed at the art style and gameplay, but the game's graphics were praised. <b>Grabbed</b> by the Ghoulies was nominated for the Console Family Game of the Year prize at the 2004 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.|$|E
5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered {{different}} versions of events, the former more sympathetic to the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura <b>grabbed</b> another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L. D. <b>grabbed</b> the Winchester at the same time, and during the struggle for the gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{then ran}} up behind Kunnert and <b>grabbed</b> {{his arms to}} try to pull {{him away from the}} scuffle. But this only left him defenseless for Washington's first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.|$|E

5|$|Elix Skipper fought Sonjay Dutt in {{the second}} encounter. Skipper {{defeated}} Dutt in the match after he performed a move he calls the Play of the Day, in which he laid his leg on Dutt's head and neck, <b>grabbed</b> Dutt's near arm, and then spun and slammed Dutt to the mat.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{revealed}} at E3 2003, with a playable demo being a mostly complete {{version of the}} game, albeit with a few levels missing. <b>Grabbed</b> by the Ghoulies was released in North America on 21 October 2003, in Europe on 21 November 2003 and in Japan on 29 April 2004, becoming Rare's first game to be released under Microsoft. It was later re-released as an Xbox Originals game for the Xbox 360 on 16 February 2009, later being removed from the store on 16 June 2015. At Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference, the compilation title Rare Replay was unveiled. Rare Replay has a selection of thirty games from Rare's lifetime game library, including <b>Grabbed</b> by the Ghoulies. The game was remastered to run natively on the Xbox One, increasing its resolution and framerate relative to the original Xbox release.|$|E
40|$|WO 2005019072 A UPAB: 20050324 NOVELTY - Device for <b>grabbing,</b> {{transporting}} and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects comprises a <b>grabbing</b> device (1) {{having at}} least two <b>grabbing</b> jaws (2, 3). The first <b>grabbing</b> jaw (2) is placed on a freely accessible first surface {{in the form of}} a surface of the object or a freely accessible side surface of the object. The second <b>grabbing</b> jaw (3) is placed on a second surface {{in the form of a}}n additional freely accessible surface of the object. The first <b>grabbing</b> jaw is pressed with a pressure until an object-specific friction is reached between the first <b>grabbing</b> jaw and the first surface or side surface of the object. The <b>grabbing</b> jaws are arranged at an angle to each other. Before the start of object transport, the <b>grabbing</b> jaws serve as a tilting device about an axis of rotation. Rotation about the base surface edge of the object occurs which restricts the freely accessible side surface of the object with the second <b>grabbing</b> jaw against a support and after rotation th e second <b>grabbing</b> jaw lies underneath the new standing surface of the object. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for: (1) Alternative devices; and (2) Processes for <b>grabbing,</b> transporting and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects. USE - For <b>grabbing,</b> transporting and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects. ADVANTAGE - Stacked objects can be handled with little constructive and financial expenditure. The device can be used to reposition the objects in a quick manner...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to shell-bodied <b>grabs,</b> there are tine <b>grabs,</b> {{exemplified by the}} orange peel <b>grab</b> which has tines (typically 6 or 8) fitted with full plates completely enclosing the product when closed. Other tine <b>grabs</b> have no plate, some have a partial plate. Tine <b>grabs</b> {{have the ability to}} penetrate into dense and integrated products such as scrap metal and ores. They are also often used in recycling plants, handling general waste.|$|R
50|$|Where the <b>grab</b> is a two-piece hinged bucket, it {{is known}} as a shell <b>grab</b> or shell bucket. Working the <b>grab</b> {{requires}} extra cables from the crane jib, so requires a specialised design of crane throughout, not merely an attachment. Some <b>grabs</b> use 2 cables for lift and control, others use 4.|$|R
5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand, with which she <b>grabbed</b> and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has two sons, Jordan and Jackson; he {{separated}} from their mother, Gabrielle Desgagne, his common-law wife, in 2007. In 2000, Brashear was charged with assault following an incident where he <b>grabbed</b> {{a man by the}} neck and shoved him. The incident occurred after the man complained to Desgagne about the couple's infant son crawling on the exercise machines in a communal gym. Brashear received six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault.|$|E
5|$|Don Calò further {{established}} his fortune in 1922 {{when he led}} disgruntled peasants who <b>grabbed</b> land from the aristocratic absentee landlords. Vizzini bought three estates in the Villalba region; he divided them up and handed them over – allegedly without making a penny, according to some – to a cooperative he had founded. According to a local villager, although every peasant got a plot, Don Calò kept more than 12,000 acres (49km²) for himself.|$|E
50|$|While the ADA {{guidelines}} provide {{specifics on}} {{the placement of}} <b>grab</b> bars in public locations, they do not require a specific style. The British Doc M regulations specify a minimum contrast between bars and background. Many public facilities opt for the cheapest <b>grab</b> bars, which usually have an institutional look. However, <b>grab</b> bars are actually available in many styles, finishes and colors. Manufacturers have begun to understand the need {{to blend in with}} home decor, offering <b>grab</b> bars that have style and pizazz. For the home, <b>grab</b> bars {{do not need to be}} ADA compliant, but those guidelines should be considered. In addition to straight <b>grab</b> bars, there are fold-out bars, those that clamp onto the side of the bathtub, L-shaped, U-shaped and corner <b>grab</b> bars. <b>Grab</b> bars are also made with built in LED lighting and can come in many different colours.|$|R
40|$|Discussions of land <b>grabs</b> {{for various}} purposes, {{including}} environmental ends, have expanded in recent years, yet land <b>grabbing</b> remains inconsistently defined and poorly understood. Our ability {{to assess the}} extent to which land <b>grabs</b> are occurring, and to identify the mixture of factors driving land and resource acquisition, is limited. This paper assesses whether a land <b>grab</b> for conservation is happening in southern Chile, and identifies the various driving forces that combine to drive land acquisitions in the region, based on a detailed exploration of the recent massive growth in privately owned protected areas in the region. This paper finds that the various dominant definitions of land <b>grabs</b> each apply only partially to southern Chile, that land <b>grabs</b> for conservation need to be understood as the latest stage in a longer process by which the region's natural resources are incorporated into the Chilean and the global economy, and that green <b>grabs</b> interact in various ways with broader resource <b>grabs,</b> particularly for forestry and hydroelectricity. This case study demonstrates the limitations of some definitions of land <b>grabs,</b> particularly their focus on capitalist accumulation within land <b>grabs,</b> their international nature and their emphasis on legal processes...|$|R

5|$|During the 2010 NBA offseason, LeBron James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas left Cleveland for the Miami Heat, {{which led}} several other {{veterans}} to also leave the team. The departures would thrust Parker, Antawn Jamison and Anderson Varejão {{into the spotlight}} as the veteran leaders for the young team. While Cleveland only managed a conference-worst 19–63 season, {{they were able to}} upset LeBron James' heavily favored Miami Heat on March 29, 2011 in a game where Parker <b>grabbed</b> eight rebounds and scored 20 points.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was <b>grabbed</b> around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

50|$|One major {{difference}} between the <b>Grabber</b> and the Gravity Gun is that the <b>Grabber</b> has a limited charge, and thus can only hold onto an object for several seconds. Additionally, the <b>Grabber</b> creates a distortion effect that can obscure the player's vision when in use however the <b>Grabber</b> can catch projectiles and small creatures, whereas the Gravity gun cannot.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has investigated}} whether {{a combination of}} DEM and MBD {{can be used for}} a reliable and accurate environment for predicting <b>grab</b> unloading performance. A <b>grab</b> is a type of bulk material handling equipment used for unloading materials such as coal and iron ore from vessel to shore. Both a <b>grab</b> and iron ore pellets have been modelled and coupled into a co-simulation. Particle stiffness reductions and coarse graining techniques have been developed and applied to reduce computational costs. The developed large scale coupled grab-pellets model compared very well with validation experiments conducted on a bulk terminal with a scissors <b>grab.</b> A demonstration of virtual prototyping of <b>grabs</b> showed that when this model is implemented in the <b>grab</b> design process significant improvements in <b>grab</b> performance can be achieved.

50|$|Self-dumping <b>grabs</b> {{also have}} a single {{supporting}} rope or chain. The lower girder contains a linkage mechanism with hooks which connect to the upper girder, holding the <b>grab</b> closed. When the <b>grab</b> is lowered onto the spoil, weights release the hooks and allow the <b>grab</b> to open when lifted. A lever may also be fitted {{to this type of}} mechanism to which a long trip rope can be attached which, when pulled by a banksman, releases the catches in the mechanism and allows the <b>grab</b> to open in mid air (e.g. above a lorry or a hopper). The <b>grab</b> usually is fitted with a hydraulic damper to restrict the speed of opening. The clamshell bucket on the left hand side of the photograph on this page at Cardiff is a self-dumping chain <b>grab.</b>|$|R
