40|$|As already {{demonstrated}} by others authors, when {{the performance of}} a heat exchanger is analyzed, a semi-empirical model allows getting good prediction of the experimental results provided that it is accompanied by the application of the suitable correlations for calculating heat transfer coefficients (HTC) and pressure drop (PD) in both refrigerant and air side. Many correlations for calculating these coefficients are available in literature, therefore choose the more suitable of them turns out to be not an easy task. This paper presents a discussion about the methodology to perform a comparison aimed to define the criterion for choosing the most suitable correlation to be used in a simulation model for prediction of heat exchangers performance in refrigeration systems. Differently from others works, where the results of each correlation are compared with those obtained by means specific experiments focused on the local phenomenon visualization, in this work the correlations are compared against the measurements of a complete finned-tube condenser integrated in a traditional air-to-water heat pump. The comparison has been carried out using a model able to discretize the heat exchanger through a finite volume method (FVM). The discussion is supported with a case study which was experimentally tested and numerically modeled. The condenser is a <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> that characterized by two asymmetric circuits. The tube diameter is 7 mm and the fin pitch is 2. 6 mm. The experimental test bench includes a single-speed 34. 3 cm 3 reciprocating-hermetic compressor, a plate evaporator and an electronic valve as expansion device. An accumulator allow adjusting the condenser sub-cooling. A specific test campaign has been designed in order to cover a wide range operating points of the condenser: different air velocities (from 1. 5 m/s to 4 m/s), inlet temperatures (20 - 46 °C) and sub-cooling (0 - 5 - 10 °C) have been taken into account. All the correlations considered were programmed and simulated with the software IMST-ART. In order to avoid the overlapping {{of the effects of the}} different correlations, during the analysis of the two-phase flow, the heat transferred in the one-phase section of the exchanger and the air-side heat transfer coefficient were maintained constant. The analysis of air-side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop was carried out in the same way but keeping constant the coefficients of the refrigerant side. Different accuracy parameters were defined in order to assist the final decision about which correlation is able to provide the best agreement with experimental data. The paper aims to present a discussion about the validation methodology, the analysis of the correlations impact on the model results rather than define the parameters to choose the best correlation...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{formation}} of frost on a forced convection refrigeration coil, operating below the freezing temperature {{is known to}} have the effect of imparing the efficiency of a refrigeration system, This investigation was directed toward the study of the behavior of the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air static pressure drop for a frosted coil. The experiment was conducted with a <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> having staggered tube arrangement, The experimental equipment was so designed that the frost accumulation on the test coil could be measured with a platform scale. A chilled solution of 30 percent by weight of ethylene glycol and water supplied the cooling for the test coil. Tests were run at constant air flow rates of 585, 685 and 775 CFM. In each test the inlet air was maintained approximately at 32 ° F with a specific humidity of 0. 003 lbs of moisture per lb of dry air; the supplied antifreeze solution was kept at about 14 ° F with a flow rate of 1, 853 lbs per hr. Sufficient data were recorded, during each test, to determine the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air static pressure drop through the test coil at various frost accumulations. It was observed that the overall coefficient of heat transfer at constant air flow rate increased slightly as frost first accumulated on the test coil and then decreased after the peak had been reached as the frost continued to increase. The air pressure drop increased continuously with increasing frost accumulation on the test coil. For each increment of frost weight per square foot of coil surface the magnitude of the air pressure drop was found to be greater at the higher air flow rates. The agreement between {{the results of the present}} investigation and the one previously made on the coils having in-line tubes arrangement suggested that the behavior of the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air pressure drop were independent of coil geometry. For a system with a fixed capacity and design conditions the decrease in overall coefficient of heat transfer, during the heavy frosting, would lower the system efficiency by the reduction in the coefficient of performance of the refrigeration system. The increase in pressure drop at increasing frost accumulation on the coil surface would have a direct effect on lowering the system capacity by reducing the air flow in the system. The limited information made available by this investigation was not enough to cover the wide range of operating conditions and heat exchangers encountered in practice. More extensive research would be necessary to provide sufficient information for a better design of the refrigeration systems when the {{formation of}} frost on the heat exchanger surface could not be avoided...|$|E

Comprehensive evaluation of solutions to the highly nonlinear system of equations in the local thermal/hydraulic performance within the tube network was conducted and a new solution method to successively approximate the physics of heat and fluid flow was developed to enhance the solution convergence capability. A segment-by-segment approach within each tube was implemented, to account for two-dimensional non-uniformity of air distribution across the exchanger, and heterogeneous refrigerant flow patterns through a tube. A further sub-dividable-segment model was created in order to address the significant change of properties and heat transfer coefficients in the single-phase and two-phase regime when a segment experiences flow regime change. The effectiveness-NTU method for cross-flow configuration was used also for combined heat and mass transfer problem under dehumidification, by defining equivalent thermal resistance and heat capacity. Object-oriented programming techniques were applied in developing Coil Designer to facilitate flexible and customizable design platform and building graphic user-friendly interface. Coupled heat exchangers with multiple fluids inside different subsets of tubes can be modeled and analyzed simultaneously. A wide variety of working fluids and correlations of heat transfer and pressure drop are available at the user’s choice. The tabular and graphic representation of performance simulation results provides convenience in comprehensive and detailed parametric analysis. The model prediction with Coil Designer was verified against experimentally determined data collected from a number of sources. The simulation tool was shown to be able to predict the heat transfer rate for a variety of coils with good accuracy. Parametric studies were conducted to confirm the capability of the program in exploring all aspects of heat exchanger performance under a wide variation of design and operating conditions.

These heat-transfer correlations can predict the value of the heat transfer coefficient with an accuracy of better than 5 % and are in good agreement with existing heat transfer correlations developed for the same geometry of <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> and modes of heat transfer. The effect of the water flow rate in the heat exchanger coil on the internal heat transfer coefficient is also investigated. This flow rate should be above 4 litre/minute to achieve a high rate of heat-transfer from the wall of the heat exchanger to the water in the pipe. A detailed investigation of the use of horizontal and vertical baffles to increase the effectiveness of heat delivery in the domestic hot water mode has been carried out. Some improvements can be achieved by the use of a horizontal flat plate located {{in the middle of the}} store. This plate, when correctly sized enhances stratification and hence improves the effectiveness of heat recovery. Vertical plate arrangements and a rectangular duct situated around the upper heat exchanger coil were found to be ineffective. However, due to an increased velocity of the water around the heat exchanger, the external heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger was increased by 12 %. The comparison of experimental observations with computer simulations of the development of the thermocline in the store during the space heating mode of operation showed the presence of a jet in the bottom region of the store at the return inlet. The jet induces a significant amount of mixing in the store which reduces the effectiveness of heat recovery. Correlations in terms of Richardson number and effectiveness of heat delivery have been developed to characterize the effect of this jet. An inlet arrangement designed to achieve a Richardson number exceeding 3 significantly reduces the mixing created by the jet and can increase the amount of heat delivered in the space heating mode by approximately 5 %...|$|R
