40|$|In {{automotive}} component {{design criteria}} such as weight, strength, stiffness, manufacturing cost are sensitive issues for boosting its performance {{which in turn}} has direct impact on fuel economy and cost.   This thesis deals with the design of <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> housing for Volkswagen car by using modern topology optimization techniques to the existing design. <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> housing holds the shifting mechanism and guides the lever to select the respective gear for different speed. Optimizing the design in terms of topology, material and structural is very important in arriving at practical solution.   To determine the optimum material layout distribution of material within the component with given set of loads and boundary conditions by placing a constrain on volume by minimizing sum of weighted compliance as well as maximizing lowest eigen value frequency. The process starts by applying loads to the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and constraining it in all directions thereby making the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> a stiff design which can withstand loads from all direction. Boundary conditions {{play a major role in}} designing the component geometry.   Contact formulation has been complex task from several years. Optimization with contact for minimizing the volume by maintaining uniform deformation between  contact surfaces between two commercial softwares, HyperWorks V 10. 0 and TOPO 4 ABQ has been compared with benchmarks.   By using these techniques weight reduction has been achieved in automobile <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> housing and benchmarks with contact condition had been compared using Altair OptiStruct V 10. 0 and TOPO 4 ABQ by Niclas Strömberg. ...|$|R

5000|$|By 1962, {{more than}} 1 million U.S. built cars were factory {{equipped}} with bucket seats; often, these were {{fitted with a}} center console containing a <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and other features between the seats. The popularity of the bucket seat grew {{with the advent of}} sporty compact cars (or [...] "pony cars") such as the Ford Mustang. With the introduction of subcompact-sized automobiles such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, bucket seats were used {{due to the lack of}} seating room and floor-mounted levers for the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and parking brake.|$|R
50|$|Two-speed rear hubs, {{that the}} rider shifted by back pedalling, were common, but some {{featured}} external rear derailleurs with 3 or 5 gear ratios and automotive-like <b>gear</b> <b>shifters</b> {{mounted on the}} top tube.|$|R
50|$|It is a 15-gear {{mountain}} bike {{which is very}} smooth to ride on short or long trips. It has 26-inch wheels with bull bars, and was first manufactured in 1996. It uses Shimano SIS <b>gear</b> <b>shifters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: 23B cockpit. The two {{structural}} pipes (one {{just inside}} of the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter)</b> running length-wise connecting the front bulkhead to the rear section, are unique to 23B and 23C. These are the factory-standard rear view mirror locations ...|$|R
50|$|Newer {{small cars}} and MPVs, like the Suzuki MR Wagon, the Fiat Multipla, the Toyota Matrix, the Pontiac Vibe, the Chrysler RT {{platform}} cars, the Honda Element, the Honda Civic, and the Honda Avancier may feature a manual or automatic transmission <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> {{located on the}} vehicle's instrument panel, similar to the mid-1950s Chryslers and Powerglide Corvairs. Console-mounted shifters are similar to floor-mounted <b>gear</b> <b>shifters</b> in {{that most of the}} ones used in modern cars operate on a horizontal plane and can be mounted to the vehicle's transmission {{in much the same way}} a floor-mounted shifter can. However, because of the location of the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> in comparison to the locations of the column shifter and the floor shifter, as well as the positioning of the shifter to the rest of the controls on the panel often require that the gearshift be mounted in a space that does not feature a lot of controls integral to the vehicle's operation or frequently used controls, such as those for the car stereo or car air conditioning, to help prevent accidental activation or driver confusion, especially in right-hand drive cars.|$|R
25|$|Underbones are small-displacement {{motorcycles}} with a step-through frame, {{descendants of}} the original Honda Super Cub. They are differentiated from scooters by their larger wheels and their use of footpegs instead of a floorboard. They often have a <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> with an automatic clutch.|$|R
50|$|The {{dashboard}} featured Silver interior trims and {{the steering}} wheel included a plastic insert featuring the RenaultSport logo. The <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> was changed from the metal ball featured on the Phase 1 to a Leather wrapped shifter with a silver coloured insert on the top.|$|R
5000|$|... 1993: As {{a result}} of changes to the Cummins diesel engine, the engine cover is {{redesigned}} further to give a much lower profile. Additionally, the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> for the automatic transmission moves {{from the left side}} of the instrument panel to the right side.|$|R
50|$|The Bajaj Legend was {{a popular}} Indian-made motor scooter {{produced}} by Bajaj Auto, Ltd. First produced in 1999, the Legend was powered by a new environmentally friendly 145cc four-stroke, single cylinder engine, coupled to a four speed transmission operated through a classic Vespa-style grip <b>gear</b> <b>shifter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hydro Blue Edition {{featured}} a Hydro Blue color, {{as well as}} matching blue-colored stitching in the seats and <b>gear</b> <b>shifter.</b> Also, the word Sky stitched into the seats is changed to matching-blue color as well. All Hydro Blue Edition Saturn Sky units were sold with the removable silver racing stripe.|$|R
5000|$|The E20 series Caravan and Urvan van and minibus were {{manufactured}} from February 1973 with seating configurations for three, five, seven, {{and up to}} 10 passengers. It was exclusive in Japan to Nissan Bluebird Store, {{while its}} twin the Nissan Homy was exclusive to Nissan Prince Store locations. It was especially popular in Europe, and was again very popular with fire departments and as ambulances in certain countries. It had a somewhat difficult handling, as it was heavy to steer, and was not available with power steering. Also, the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> was located at the floor and {{went all the way}} up to the height of the hand, and had a slight curve. The <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> was nearly 80 cm long, so it was somewhat clumsy to shift, but it came with five gears, unusual in Europe at that time.|$|R
50|$|Initial D Arcade Stage Zero was {{released}} for the Sega Nu2 arcade system board in March 7, 2017. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> (similar {{to the ones}} found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) {{as opposed to the}} sequential ones. The character designs are taken from the new Initial D movie with entirely new BGMs.|$|R
50|$|Sequential {{gearboxes}} {{are also}} used in nearly all modern motorcycles as it is too cumbersome to have a conventional H-pattern shifter and would take up too much space {{in the confines of}} a motorcycle frame. Having control over the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter,</b> typically with the rider's left foot, frees their hands to operate both the clutch and brake without letting go of the handlebars.|$|R
50|$|Two {{limited edition}} {{versions}} of the GT turbo were produced; the GT Limited and the GT Advance, both featured small changes such as different steering wheels and <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> knobs, a rear strut bar, ABS (later versions only) and were distinguishable by their two tone paint scheme. These models also featured an optional LSD which was available with the C153 transaxle.|$|R
50|$|Shift by wire is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear shifting lever and the transmission. The transmission shifting was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> near the center console.|$|R
50|$|Formula Junior version {{utilized}} the Renault 4 speed transaxle, {{and both of}} the Lotus transaxle and this Renault box had the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> lever {{on the left side}} of the driver. An optional gearbox was the VW gearbox with Hewland 4 speed gears. This last gearbox has the added advantage of being able to change gear ratios from behind the gearbox without removing the gearbox from the car.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, two {{versions}} of the Zastava 101 were available: Standard and De Luxe. Standard models offered seats trimmed in imitation black leather, with a black, spherical <b>gear</b> <b>shifter.</b> De Luxe trim brought forth red seats and carpet, chrome trim across the interior door panels and exterior sides of the car, and imitation wood ahead of the front passenger. Zastava's logo was embedded within a transparent shifter knob.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Zastava {{launches}} the 101 GT/GTL 55/65. New, wider chrome bumpers boast integrated {{parking and}} indicator lights. A new radiator mask debuts, along with new side skirts {{and a new}} wheel design. The interior is redesigned, with a new dashboard, steering wheel, <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and hand brake. The suspension is softer, while the car now sits lower, for better stability. The GTL model features revisions to the brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{first in}} its class is the rear bumper with {{integrated}} exhaust outlet, which later {{made its way}} on to the corresponding model year Lexus LS series and the Toyota Crown. A new LED light for the ceiling runs {{from the front of}} the vehicle to the rear, creating a [...] "mood" [...] lighting system. The led system is also incorporated into the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and key area of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Various special {{models have}} also been introduced, such as the Platinum Edition, {{which is based on}} the VR but added a chrome grille, window {{surrounds}} (sedan only), MMCS satellite navigation and Bluetooth. The RX version is derived from the ES but comes with standard alloy wheels. Another model introduced in 2010 was the SX coming with factory alloys, leather steering wheel and <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> as well as factory spoiler.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, {{this series}} of Lancer was {{introduced}} as the CG series in July 2002 with the 2.0-liter 4G94 engine. The 2003 facelift, designated the CH series, introduced a heavily updated VR-X, which included new 16" [...] alloys, stiffer suspension, body styling kit, and <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> borrowed from the Lancer Evolution. In 2004, the new Lancer wagon was introduced as a direct replacement for its ageing circa 1992 predecessor.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a further}} {{attempt to make}} {{something}} for the army, a few four-wheel drive Mokes {{were made by the}} addition of a second engine and transmission {{at the back of the}} vehicle with linked clutches and <b>gear</b> <b>shifters.</b> This did nothing for the ground-clearance problems, and mechanical complications discouraged development beyond the prototype stage. This vehicle was called [...] "The Twini" [...] and was shown to the US Army—again with no success.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{ordered a}} recall of 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees and other cars that use an {{electronic}} <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> because it sometimes {{does not go}} into (or does not remain in) the park position, despite the operator's best intentions. [...] Consumers reported that they {{put the car in}} park and left the engine running, and then were surprised when the car rolled away under power.|$|R

50|$|A {{version with}} {{mechanical}} lock-up of the torque converter from first <b>gear,</b> steering-wheel-mounted <b>shifter.</b> AMG Speedshift {{is also used}} in 7G-Tronic transmission.|$|R
50|$|Other wheels {{include the}} Fanatec Porsche 911 Turbo S Racing Wheel, which {{features}} force feedback, 6 <b>gear</b> stick <b>shifter</b> and 3 pedals(Gas/Brake/Clutch).|$|R
50|$|The Force 1 has two seats, and the {{interior}} is trimmed in leather, suede and Alcantara. A milled aluminum and leather <b>gear</b> <b>shifter,</b> leather and suede sunglass holder, and a hidden milled aluminum pen holder are also included. The Force 1 also features a substantial technology suite, including in-dash navigation, smart phone connectivity and charging, and a wi-fi hotspot housed in the rear spoiler. It is also fitted with a champagne holder, with a two bottle capacity, located between the two seat backs.|$|R
5000|$|A lightly revised A111 was {{introduced}} at the 52nd Turin Motor Show in October/November 1970. A distinguishing feature of these [...] "series 2" [...] cars were double-stacked tail lamps, {{of the same}} design seen on the original A111. New bumpers gained rubbing strips but dispensed with the over-riders (bringing overall length to less than four metres), there was new model badging on the tail, and the interior was partly redesigned, including a new centre console and a shorter <b>gear</b> <b>shifter.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{exterior}} of the FJ concept remained largely unchanged when the final production model debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. However, chief production engineer Akio Nishimura had to significantly alter the amenities offered in Chergosky's interior concept to keep {{the price of the}} production FJ Cruiser reasonable. Unique interior touches like the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> that doubled as a shovel handle, removable interior lights which doubled as flashlights, and flat-folding front seats were removed, though several concept items remained as factory options.|$|R
5000|$|The Vitz [...] "RS" [...] was {{introduced}} in 2001. The [...] "RS" [...] featured revised front and rear bumpers, a mesh grille, black-tinted headlamps, front fog lamps, side skirts, and alloy wheels. Interior upgrades include, sports-oriented front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a leather and chrome <b>gear</b> <b>shifter,</b> and metallic door sill scuff plates. Two engines were available in the [...] "RS", the 1.3-litre [...] 2NZ-FE and the 1.5-litre [...] 1NZ-FE. More powerful brakes and a firmer suspension calibration were also fitted to the [...] "RS".|$|R
