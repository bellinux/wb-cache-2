40|$|The {{context of}} the chapter is an Anglican “liberal Catholic” {{congregation}} in the Church of England, within a multicultural northern UK city, where those who gather represent {{the diversity of the}} globalized, postcolonial world. The chapter highlights the relationship between Anglo-Catholic Eucharistic liturgy, with its Trinitarian form, and feminist commitment to justice-making. The exclusion of feminist reimagining from current rethinking <b>of</b> <b>Trinitarian</b> theology is challenged by affirming the place <b>of</b> a sparse <b>Trinitarian</b> rule, in order to expose heteropatriarchal contraventions of the rule and then to re-site feminist reimagining in relation to it. This enables female imagery for God to infuse, rather than displace, classical liturgical language of God as Father-Son-Spirit, and undermines deeply entrenched heteropatriarchal contraventions. The metaphor <b>of</b> a <b>Trinitarian</b> embrace reflects this opening <b>of</b> the received <b>Trinitarian</b> liturgical form. The impetus for the feminist struggle for justice is found in being swept up into Christ through the Trinitarian missio Dei, in anticipation of the abundant table spread by Divine Wisdom for all people...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a unique analysis <b>of</b> the <b>trinitarian</b> impulses <b>of</b> an important corporate worship practice among the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada (PAOC), the largest Evangelical denomination in Canada. It considers whether an inconsistency {{exists between the}} PAOC’s <b>trinitarian</b> statement <b>of</b> faith and formative expressions of this denomination’s belief conveyed in 82 {{of the most commonly}} used contemporary worship songs from April 2007 to March 2013. Lyrical music, it is defended, {{represents a}} forming, measurable, and confirming indicator among the PAOC of contemporary religious understanding. In order to assess the <b>trinitarian</b> dispositions <b>of</b> the PAOC music lyrics, Colin Gunton’s theology is utilized as a framework for this evaluation. Gunton was a leading figure in the advancement <b>of</b> <b>trinitarian</b> theology before his untimely death in 2003. His balanced integration of the notions of relationality, particularity, and perichoresis provides the rationale for eight qualitative content analyses that are original to this project and intended to verify the trinitarian views in the PAOC lyrics. This analysis is oriented around three major areas <b>of</b> <b>trinitarian</b> assessment: the doctrine of God, human personhood, and cosmology. The data from these content analyses are compiled, presented, and carefully analysed. Then, returning to the <b>trinitarian</b> work <b>of</b> Gunton, implications and considerations for the PAOC are offered. This study shows that Gunton’s trinitarian theology provides a resource to identify and correct the trinitarian deficit and individualistic and cosmologically dualistic orientation of PAOC commonly used songs. Ultimately, this thesis proposes that Gunton, in accordance with several key Pentecostal and worship studies interlocutors, can serve as a helpful theological source for the dynamic practice <b>of</b> a <b>trinitarian</b> faith among the PAOC...|$|R
