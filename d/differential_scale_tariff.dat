40|$|Measurement is a {{fundamental}} issue in management research. However, traditional scale development methods have the drawback of mixing researchers' bias with the scale design. Based on Ding et al. 's (2007) exploratory work, {{a new way to}} develop semantic <b>differential</b> measurement <b>scales</b> is proposed and tested with a survey {{in the context of the}} construction industry. The purpose is to provide researchers and practitioners with a new method to develop semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> for measurement while the bias from their own perspective can be reduced. The reliability and validity of semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> according to the new method are tested with SPSS and Amos 6. 0. The results show that the generated semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> with this method have high reliability and validity. The new way to develop semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scales</b> offers researchers and practitioners one more choice of scale development.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of attitude measurement {{with the political}} campaign process provides the problem area that this study considers. The purpose of this political communication study is to explore in detail and describe various "attitude" profiles of voters and resulting candidate "images" of the 1972 presidential election. These "attitudes" and "images" are determined {{through the use of}} three primary research instruments: the semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale,</b> the Method of Ordered Alternatives, and the political philosophy continuum. In addition to these, a record of actual voting behavior serves as validating support of the measured attitudes. This study deals with "attitudes" toward and candidate "images" of George McGovern, R. Sargent Shriver, Richard M. Nixon, and Spiro T. Agnew, the Democratic and Republican candidates for President and Vice-President in 1972. This descriptive investigation unfolds into three major problem areas: 1. to report and describe "panoramic images" of Nixon,.

40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) {{is a well-known}} technique for transmission of high rate data over broadband frequency-selective channels that mitigates intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by the delay spread of wireless channels. Space Frequency Block Coded technique (SFBC) is a spatial diversity technique used to achieve full transmission diversity with higher capacity. The major drawbacks of OFDM are high Bit Error Rate (BER) and high Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Spacefrequency block coded OFDM system (SFBC-OFDM) is used to reduce the BER and transmit the data. In this paper, the performance of BER vs. SNR in normal OFDM is {{compared to that of}} SFBC-OFDM systems using simulation. Simulation results show that the BER in SFBC-OFDM is less than that in normal OFDM. Selective Mapping (SLM) is used as the existing system. In this technique, the minimum PAPR signal is selected and transmitted by generating different representations of OFDM symbols using different phase sequences. Here, the thesis gives an idea to reduce the PAPR using Clipping and <b>differential</b> <b>scaling.</b> The simulation results show that clipping and <b>differential</b> <b>scaling</b> effectively reduces the PAPR...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} an {{understanding}} of the information seeking process for image documents by focusing on needs for connotative messages. For this purpose, this study attempted to investigate and compare three stages of the image search process in terms of use of image attributes. The three stages of the image search process are identified as initiation, representation and selection, and image attribute levels are defined as color, denotative, and connotative attributes. Data was collected from a survey questionnaire composed of Likert scales, open questionnaires, and Semantic <b>Differential</b> <b>scales.</b> The study found that while color, denotative, and connotative attributes were all considered important by users, color itself did not have critical impact during the representing and selecting stages. Denotative and connotative attributes were important across the overall search process and users employed diverse denotative and connotative terms for finding a satisfactory image under a given task.

40|$|As humans, {{we tend to}} {{perceive}} minds in both living and non-living entities, such as robots. From a questionnaire developed in a previous mind perception study, authors found that perceived minds could be located on two dimensions experience and agency. This questionnaire allowed the assessment of how we perceive minds of various entities from a multi-dimensional point of view. In this questionnaire, subjects had to evaluate explicit mental capacities of target characters (e. g. capacity to feel hunger). However, we sometimes perceive minds in non-living entities, even though we cannot attribute these evidently biological capacities to the entity. In this study, we performed a large-scale web survey to assess mind perception by using the semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> method. We revealed that two mind dimensions emotion and intelligence respectively corresponded to the two mind dimensions (experience and agency) proposed in a previous mind perception study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the attitudes of a selected group of American high school students towards a different nation in general and Iranian's in particular would be affected as a result of presenting them with factual information about that culture through the use of audio-visual aids. One hundred and twenty high school students between ages of 13 - 18 who attended Burris Laboratory School in Muncie, IN. were randomly selected and assigned to an experimental and a control group. The number of students who responded to the questionnaire and participated in the study was 77. There were 40 students in the experimental and 37 students in the control group. A new semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> was developed by the researcher in order to obtain measures of attitude towards Iranians. In order to validate the measurement instrument a pilot study was performed. The study utilized a Posttest- only design. The experimental group received factual information about Iranian culture through a handout and also two series of slide-tape presentations, which were prepared by the investigator. The control group received no treatment. The information on the handout and slides was about Iranian life style, education, religion, art, tribes, industry, clothing, and architecture. The information was intended to be factual rather than political propaganda. Two weeks after the experimental group received the second series of slides the revised semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> was administered to both control and experimental groups. The data was analyzed by a 2 by 2 by 2 multivariate analysis of variance. The following null hypotheses were tested: 1 - There is no significant difference between the means of the experimental and control groups for various outcome factors of the semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> when considered simultaneously. 2 - There is no significant difference between the means of male and female respondents for experimental and control groups for various outcome factors of the semantic <b>differential</b> <b>scale</b> when considered simultaneously. Findings: 1 - There were no significant multivariate interactions (2 or 3 ways). 2 - There were no significant sex differences. 3 - There was a significant treatment difference in a multivariate sense. However the interpretation of the univariates did not permit the attribution of differences to either factor singly. Rather a linear composite of the 2 factors is needed to explain the difference found. Generally these linear composites are not interpretable in a conceptual sense. Conclusion:The results of the study suggest that giving factual information about Iranian culture through use of slide-tape presentation can bring about some change in the attitude of high school students about Iranian people. However the study failed to identify the nature of this change. Further study is needed to identify better the nature of the change as a result of giving factual information.
