5000|$|There {{has been}} great debate if <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> literature, there are {{inconsistencies}} {{with regard to the}} conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They articulated that whether researchers conceptualize <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> as a trait or a state [...] "depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support" [...] (p. 1115). State <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> refers to the goal one has in a particular situation. It is similar to trait <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. However, state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is [...] "specific to the task and context at hand" [...] (p. 5). For example, VandeWalle, Cron & Slocum stated that <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> can be domain specific. They stated that it is possible for an individual to have a strong learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> in their academic domain but not in their work domain. Trait <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> refers to the [...] "consistent pattern of responses in achievement situations based on the individual's standing on <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> dimensions". This view of <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> treats the construct as a stable, individual difference characteristic. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct, stating that <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. These authors found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when [...] "dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation (p. 40). Thus, trait and state <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> interact, so both operationalizations should be considered simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Just over {{a decade}} after Dweck {{conceptualized}} the two-factor model of <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> VandeWalle proposed that <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> is better conceptualized as a three-factor model, further dividing performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> into the dimensions of avoidant performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> (APGO) and prove performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> (PPGO). APGO is centered on the goal of avoiding failure and negative judgment from others centered on lack of competence while PPGO is centered on demonstrating performance to prove competence. Learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> has also been separated into two categories learning approach orientation and learning avoid orientation, however, this conceptualization is neither widely accepted nor substantially proven.According to VandeWalle, Cron & Slocum, APGO and PPGO have differing relationships with various outcome variables, supporting the argument that a three-factor model {{should be used in}} place of the originally conceptualized two-factor model.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} been done to examine the {{relationships}} between students’ <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> (or achievement motivation) and their learning strategies with case studies.

40|$|Objectives: This study examined: (a) whether athletes’ <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> differ across {{training}} and competition; (b) whether <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> predict effort, enjoyment, and psychological skill use differently in {{training and}} competition; and (c) whether <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> predict perceived improvement {{in training and}} perceived performance in competition. Method: Participants were 116 competitive tennis players (mean age = 19. 99, SD = 5. 82), who completed questionnaires measuring <b>goal</b> <b>orientations,</b> effort, enjoyment, and psychological skill use in training and competition, perceived improvement in training, and perceived performance in competition. Results: Dependent t-tests revealed that athletes reported higher task orientation in training than in competition and higher ego orientation in competition than in training, while Pearson product-moment correlations revealed a high cross-contextual consistency for both task and ego <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> between training and competition. Regression analyses indicated that task orientation predicted positively effort, enjoyment, self-talk, and goal setting in both contexts, perceived improvement in training, and perceived performance in competition. An interaction effect also emerged whereby ego orientation predicted positively effort in competition only when task orientation was low or average. Conclusions: The findings suggest that <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> may differ between training and competition; task <b>orientation</b> is the <b>goal</b> that should be promoted in both contexts; and the context may affect the relationship between <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> and effort, enjoyment, and goal setting...|$|R

50|$|Dweck {{postulated}} {{that children with}} learning goals were believed to approach situations with the goal to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations {{with the goal of}} gaining approval from peers and teachers. Similar to Eison, Dweck conceptualized <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> (sometimes referred to as mastery <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> or abbreviated as LGO), seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task. Individuals with a performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence in order to receive favorable judgments and avoid negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's <b>goal</b> <b>orientation.</b> Nicholls believed that the <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> {{to be related to the}} theory of intelligence held by that individual.|$|E

Three studies are presented examining {{the construct validity of}} an instrument assessing global <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> in life in conjunction with a measure of <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> in physical education. It was also investigated whether the effects of global <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> generalize across contexts. Method: Participants were middle school students (N = 351, N = 580 and N = 658) who completed the two <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> instruments, measures of self-regulation, affect and beliefs at the global level of generality and specific to the physical education domain and measures of exercise and academic behaviours. Results: Multi-sample factor analysis established the factorial validity of the global goal orientations' instrument and the distinctiveness of global goals from achievement goals in physical education. Controlling for social desirability effects, the partial correlations of <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> in life with global intrinsic-extrinsic motivation, life satisfaction, pleasant and unpleasant affect in life, purposes of life and perceived purposes of physical education, locomotion and assessment, metacognition in physical education, exercise and academic behaviours, were in the expected direction. In general, global goals made a significant contribution to the explanation of variance of global constructs, while achievement goals in physical education made a unique contribution to the explanation of variance of physical education specific constructs. Discussion: The results support the construct validity of the instrument assessing global <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> in life. They also indicate that global <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> are distinct constructs from <b>goal</b> <b>orientations</b> in physical education. The global goal orientations' measure can be particularly useful for practitioners teaching interdisciplinary and life skill...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{organizational}} context, {{the extent to}} which employees actively seek feedback can positively influence job performance. [...] <b>Goal</b> <b>orientation</b> influences how individuals evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} feedback-seeking opportunities. [...] According to VandeWalle, when individuals have the opportunity to seek feedback, they face a cognitive dilemma between the need for self-assessment and the need for self-enhancement. Since individuals with a learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> are interested in developing competencies, they are more likely to interpret feedback positively and thus engage in more feedback-seeking behaviors to enhance performance. These individuals interpret feedback as valuable information about how to correct errors and improve future performance on a given task. Conversely, individuals with a performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> are likely to interpret feedback as [...] "evaluative and judgmental information about the self" [...] (p. 631), and as a result are less likely to seek feedback. Consequently, individuals with high levels of learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> are more inclined to seek feedback, while individuals with high levels of prove performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> or avoid performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> are less inclined to seek feedback (VandeWalle & Cummings, 1997).|$|E
5000|$|Research has {{produced}} mixed results when examining {{the relationship between}} cognitive ability and <b>goal</b> <b>orientation.</b> For example, Eison found that learning-oriented (learning <b>goal</b> <b>orientation)</b> students had higher levels of cognitive ability than grade-oriented (performance <b>goal</b> <b>orientation)</b> students. However, Dweck and her colleagues were unable to find any relationship between the constructs. [...] Although findings are mixed, [...] "a substantial body of theory and research suggests motivational and ability traits are generally uncorrelated" [...] (p. 130). In a meta-analysis by Payne and her colleagues, cognitive ability and <b>goal</b> <b>orientation</b> {{were found to be}} independent constructs. Accordingly, individuals with high cognitive ability are equally likely to hold learning, prove performance, and avoid performance goal orientations. These authors also found that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond cognitive ability. [...] Based on this research, <b>goal</b> <b>orientation,</b> rather than cognitive ability, serves as useful tool for practitioners to use to predict job performance.|$|E
