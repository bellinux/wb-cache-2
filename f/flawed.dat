40|$|Multiple <b>flaws</b> are {{frequently}} replaced with simpler <b>flaws</b> {{according to the}} <b>flaw</b> alignment rules {{for the purpose of}} engineering assessment. Such rules typically compare the <b>flaw</b> separation distance with the characteristic dimension, such as <b>flaw</b> length or <b>flaw</b> depth. For configurations involving <b>flaws</b> on parallel offset planes, current ASME Boiler code, Section XI, Article IWA- 3300 suggests a fixed distance of 12. 4 mm between the offset <b>flaw</b> planes as a <b>flaw</b> alignment rule. Recent experimental work of Hasegawa et al [4] showed this criteria is not always conservative for ductile fracture. In this paper the analytical and computational methods are used to derive plastic collapse load for plates with twin non-aligned through-wall <b>flaws.</b> Results show that in a multiple <b>flaw</b> geometry the global plastic collapse load is independent of the <b>flaw</b> separation when horizontal and vertical separations between <b>flaw</b> tips are equal. Such geometries are of most interest, since experimental work shows that <b>flaws</b> in such geometries interact over distances several times larger than the characteristic distance (<b>flaw</b> length or thickness). A criteria for <b>flaw</b> alignment based on the ratio of a local to global limit load is derived. A local limit load is defined as the load to cause collapse of the ligament between the <b>flaw</b> tips. It is shown that the separation between parallel <b>flaws</b> should be {{more than three times the}} <b>flaw</b> length to maintain interaction below 15 per cent and ensure a conservative assessment...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} method is proposed to evaluate limit load at incipient plastic collapse for a pipe made of ductile materials with multiple circumferential <b>flaws.</b> Fitness-for-service codes {{such as the}} ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XI specify limit load analysis for a pipe with a single <b>flaw.</b> Multiple <b>flaws</b> caused by stress corrosion cracking have actually frequently been detected in the same or adjacent weld lines. Therefore, some methods of evaluating limit load for a pipe with multiple <b>flaws</b> have been proposed. Bending stress at limit load i. e., collapse bending stress is evaluated regarding actual <b>flaw</b> depths, angles and locations of multiple <b>flaws</b> with these methods. Computational evaluation is required because of the enormous number of repetitive calculations. Thus, simple evaluation {{that can be applied}} to multiple <b>flaws</b> is required to incorporate into the code procedure. A simplified limit load analysis for multiple <b>flaws</b> in a pipe was developed in the present study based on a net-section approach. Multiple <b>flaws</b> were characterized as equivalent symmetric through-wall <b>flaws</b> {{on the basis of the}} sizes and locations of the original <b>flaws.</b> The collapse bending stress for the equivalent <b>flaws</b> was evaluated from simple equations on the basis of the net-section approach. The collapse bending stress for original <b>flaws</b> was determined from a lower value between the largest single <b>flaw</b> in the original <b>flaws</b> and equivalent <b>flaws.</b> The collapse bending stresses were evaluated based on previous and present studies. The results from a comparison demonstrated that the simplified limit load analysis could accurately be applied to a pipe with multiple <b>flaws...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Flaw</b> {{characterization}} of multiple <b>flaws</b> for ductile fractures was verified by comparing results of flat plate fracture tests and <b>flaw</b> combination rules in typical fitness-for-service codes. Single or double coplanar surface <b>flaws</b> were introduced into flat plate specimens made of Type {{304 stainless steel}} using an electric discharge machine. Fracture tests of sixteen flat plates with <b>flaws</b> were conducted using a tensile testing machine. According in results of the fracture tests, collapse behavior for flat plates with double coplanar <b>flaws</b> was divided into two broad categories. One was coalescence behavior, in which the double <b>flaws</b> combined before the wall was penetrated. The other was penetration behavior, in which the wall was penetrated before coalescence. Rules for characterizing multiple <b>flaws</b> in fitness-for-service codes in Japan, the United States, and Europe were surveyed in order to compare them with test results. When the multiple <b>flaws</b> satisfy the criteria of rules in fitness-for service codes, a single combined <b>flaw</b> is assumed to conservatively estimate the limit load analysis for a ductile fracture. <b>Flaw</b> combination rules in typical fitness-for-service codes were found to conservatively estimate ductile fractures...|$|R
