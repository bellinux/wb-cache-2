40|$|AR coating {{design for}} multi-junction solar cells {{can be more}} {{challenging}} than in the single <b>junction</b> <b>case.</b> Reasons for this are discussed. Analytical expressions used to optimize AR coatings for single junction solar cells are extended for use in monolithic, series interconnected multi-junction solar cell AR coating design. The result is an analytical expression which relates the solar cell performance (through J{sub SC}) directly to the AR coating design through the device reflectance. It is also illustrated how AR coating design {{can be used to}} provide an additional degree of freedom for current matching multi-junction devices...|$|E

Our motivation {{is to develop}} a modelling and ver-ification approach accessible to railway engineers: it is vital that they can validate the models and verification conditions, and — in the case of design errors — obtain comprehendable feedback. In this paper we run through a full production cycle on a real double <b>junction</b> <b>case</b> study, supplied by our industrial partner, who contributed at every stage. As our formalization is, by design, near to their way of thinking, they are comfortable with it and trust it.

50|$|This {{is usually}} quoted as the thermal {{resistance}} from <b>junction</b> to <b>case</b> of the semiconductor device. The units are °C/W. For example, a heatsink rated at 10 °C/W will get 10 °C hotter than {{the surrounding air}} when it dissipates 1 Watt of heat. Thus, a heatsink with a low °C/W value is more efficient than a heatsink with a high °C/W value.Given two semiconductor devices in the same package, a lower junction to ambient resistance (RθJ-C) indicates a more efficient device. However, when comparing two devices with different die-free package thermal resistances (Ex. DirectFETTM MT vs wirebond 5x6mm PQFN), their junction to ambient or <b>junction</b> to <b>case</b> resistance values may not correlate directly to their comparative efficiencies. Different semiconductor packages may have different die orientations, different copper(or other metal) mass surrounding the die, different die attach mechanics, and different molding thickness, all of which could yield significantly different <b>junction</b> to <b>case</b> or <b>junction</b> to ambient resistance values, and could thus obscure overall efficiency numbers.|$|R

40|$|We {{model the}} {{dynamics}} of point Josephson junctions in a 1 D microstrip line using a wave equation with delta distributed sine nonlinearities. The model is suitable for both low T_c and high T_c systems (0 and π junctions). For a single junction in the line, we found two limiting behaviors: the ohmic mode where the junction acts as a pure resistor which stops waves and separates the cavity and the junction mode where the wave is homogeneous throughout the strip. This classification allows to bound the IV curves of the system. Two junctions in a strip give generally ohmic modes and combined junction/ohmic modes and yield information about the behavior with an array with many junctions. Finally we use this analysis to understand the many <b>junction</b> <b>case</b> for 0 and π junctions {{and the effect of}} an external magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} parity effect and {{transport}} due to quasiparticles in circuits comprised of many superconducting islands. We develop a general approach {{and show that}} it is equivalent to previous methods for describing the parity effect in their more limited regimes of validity. As an example we study transport through linear arrays of Josephson junctions {{in the limit of}} negligible Josephson energy and observe the emergence of the parity effect with decreasing number of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. Due to the exponential {{increase in the number of}} relevant charge states with increasing length, in multi-junction arrays the parity effect manifests in qualitatively different ways to the two <b>junction</b> <b>case.</b> The role of charge disorder is also studied as this hides much of the parity physics which would otherwise be observed. Nonetheless, we see that the current through a multi-junction array at low bias is limited by the formation of meta-stable even-parity states. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss some}} of the basic {{theoretical}} aspects of current-carrying states in superconducting superlattices with tunnel barriers in the mesoscopic regime, when the superconducting layer thickness is small compared to the BCS coherence length but large compared to the atomic scale. We establish the necessary conditions for the observation of the classical Josephson effect (with sinusoidal current-phase dependence) and derive self-consistent analytical expressions for the critical Josephson current. These expressions are proportional to an additional small factor and have unusual temperature dependence as compared with the single-junction case. For certain parameter values, the superconducting gap exhibits an exponential decrease due to pair-breaking effect of the supercurrent. The supercurrent can completely destroy the superconductivity of the system above a certain characteristic temperature (lower than the transition temperature of individual layers). In this paper, we also study the effect of intrabarrier exchange interactions. We show that this effect is strongly enhanced compared with the single- <b>junction</b> <b>case</b> and can manifest itself in an exponential decrease of the critical temperature.

40|$|Context Anomalous {{junction}} of pancreaticobiliary ducts {{is a condition}} in which the pancreatic duct and the bile duct join outside the duodenal wall with a long common channel. The most accepted classification of various types of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction is the new Komi classification. The majority of cases of type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction are reported from Japan and very seldom from outside Japan. This study evaluates the prevalence of type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction in the Indian population. Objective To retrospectively evaluate the prevalence of type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction revealed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examinations carried out between 1985 and 2005. Design ERCP records of 3, 827 patients satisfying inclusion criteria between 1985 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Main outcome measure Patients demonstrating anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction were identified and classified according to the new Komi classification. Results A total of 101 patients had anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (2. 6 % of all ERCP). Only 2 patients (2. 0 % of all anomalous pancreaticobiliary <b>junction</b> <b>cases</b> and 0. 05 % of all ERCP examinations) had type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary <b>junction.</b> Both <b>cases</b> were associated with choledochal cysts and chronic pancreatitis.

40|$|Two-terminal multijunction {{solar cells}} are a {{promising}} technology to surpass the energy-conversion efficiency of commercial single junction devices. Multijunction solar cells that integrate silicon bottom subcells could allow cost-effective efficiency enhancements and further {{growth in the}} worldwide installed photovoltaic capacity. However, the fabrication and characterization of multijunction devices {{is more complex than}} the standard single <b>junction</b> <b>case,</b> due to optical, electrical and architecture constraints. In this context, this thesis proposes and tests methods for fabrication and characterization of two-terminal multijunction devices, with special emphasis in the bottom silicon subcells. A low-capex, local area back-surface field, silicon cell is adapted for operation in a two-terminal perovskite-silicon tandem device. A contactless voltage loss analysis methodology is developed, and used to optimize the tunnel junction of the device. Finally, a general methodology to identify the shunted cells in two-terminal tandem devices is developed and validated in GaAs/GaAs tandem device. These characterization methodologies allow an adequate diagnosis of quality issues in multijunction solar cells, and provide useful tools for future efficiency improvements. by Juan Felipe Oviedo Perhavec.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a Josephson system under pulsed operation is of utmost importance for developing reliable digital devices working at very high clock frequencies. Information about effect of thermal noise over pulsed operation is also useful to design errors free devices. Recent experiments {{in a system of}} two stacked junctions show that a pulsed operation on the first junction (injector) of the stack drive the Josephson biased second junction (detector) into the resistive state. The experiment was interpreted as pulsed-assisted escape toward resistive state as a consequence of an excitation of large non-linear oscillations in the detector junction that, with the contribution of thermal noise, drives out the junction from the zero voltage state. Moreover, in the same experiment for an unstability of the resistive state toward the zero voltage state under the pulsed operation was also noted. By means of a systematic numerical approach to the problem, we present a study of the pulsed-assisted escape using the framework of the thermal escape theory for the direct transition from zero voltage state to resistive state. We study the single <b>junction</b> <b>case</b> and a stacked configuration as examples of different systems showing pulsed-assisted escape...|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} resistances of a six-terminal graphene {{p-n junction}} under a perpendicular magnetic field are investigated. Because of the chirality of the Hall edge states, the longitudinal resistances {{on top and}} bottom edges of the graphene ribbon are not equal. In the presence of suitable disorder, the top-edge and bottom-edge resistances well show the plateau structures in the both unipolar and bipolar regimes and the plateau values {{are determined by the}} Landau filling factors only. These plateau structures are in excellent agreement with the recent experiment. For the unipolar junction, the resistance plateaus emerge in the absence of impurity and they are destroyed by strong disorder. But for the bipolar junction, the resistances are very large without the plateau structures in the clean junction. The disorder can strongly reduce the resistances and leads the formation of the resistance plateaus, due to the mixture of the Hall edge states in virtue of the disorder. In addition, the size effect of the junction on the resistances is studied and some extra resistance plateaus are found in the long graphene <b>junction</b> <b>case.</b> This is {{explained by the fact that}} only part of the edge states participate in the full mixing.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{thermodynamics}} of clean, layered superconductor/ferromagnet nanostructures using fully self consistent methods {{to solve the}} microscopic Bogoliubov-deGennes equations. From these self-consistent solutions the condensation free energies are obtained. The trilayer SFS junction is studied in particular detail: first order transitions between 0 and π states {{as a function of}} the temperature T are located by finding where the free energies of the two phases cross. The occurrence of these transitions is mapped {{as a function of the}} thickness d_F of the F layer and of the Fermi wavevector mismatch parameter Λ. Similar first order transitions are found for systems with a larger number of layers: examples are given in the 7 layer (3 <b>junction)</b> <b>case.</b> The latent heats associated with these phase transitions are evaluated and found to be experimentally accessible. The transition temperature to the normal state is calculated from the linearized Bogoliubov-deGennes equations and found to be in good agreement with experiment. Thus, the whole three dimensional phase diagram in T,d_F,Λ space can be found. The first order transitions are associated with dips in the transition temperature T_c to the non-superconducting state, which should facilitate locating them. Results are given also for the magnetic moment and the local density of states (DOS) at the first order transition. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

Figure  2 b,c shows the calculated results of critical supercurrent for cases of l/ξ[*]=[*] 0.005 and l/ξ[*]=[*] 0.2, respectively. It can be seen clearly {{that both of them}} exhibit the monotonic decay feature with increasing temperature T. This is due to the thermal effect on Andreev bound states, which tends to reduce Andreev levels in the superconductor gap with increasing temperature T. The less number of Andreev levels contributing to the supercurrent thus leads to the suppressed feature. Besides the similar features, it is worthwhile to note that it also exhibits some different characters between the cases of l/ξ[*]=[*] 0.005 and l/ξ[*]=[*] 0.2. First, the minimum of critical supercurrent is shown as a decay function of T, while it remains nearly constant when the chemical potential of NM is at the Dirac point. Second, it is found that oscillation amplitude of critical supercurrent will disappear with increasing l. The physical origin for those phenomena can be given as follows. In central NM well which is formed by the two superconductor leads, the electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles inside the two interfaces will coherently interfere with each other which results in the formation of Andreev bound states. Through those Andreev levels, critical supercurrent will exhibit an oscillation feature for a short junction (l/ξ[*]=[*] 0.005). On the other hand, for a long junction (l/ξ[*]=[*] 0.2), as the interference effect decays in NM well, the present structure degenerates into a single <b>junction</b> <b>case</b> and then leads to the disappearance of the oscillation feature. In particular, the decay effect of interference exhibits much remarkable for the case of the evanescent mode (chemical potential of NM at the Dirac point). Thus, the minimum of critical supercurrent remains nearly constant.|$|E
