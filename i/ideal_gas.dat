5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an <b>ideal</b> <b>gas.</b> In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible. Additionally, many problems in physical modeling, such as the motion of particles in an <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> or the Ising model of alignment of magnetic charges, are naturally reversible and can be simulated by reversible cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E
5|$|An {{academic}} career required a doctorate, so in 1921 Urey {{enrolled in a}} PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis. His initial attempt at a thesis was on the ionization of cesium vapor. He ran into difficulties, and an Indian physicist published a better paper on the same subject. Urey then wrote his thesis on the ionization states of an <b>ideal</b> <b>gas,</b> which was subsequently published in the Astrophysical Journal. After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater. At the conclusion of his stay, he traveled to Germany, where he met Albert Einstein and James Franck.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E

25|$|An ideal {{material}} {{on which a}} temperature scale can be based is the <b>ideal</b> <b>gas.</b> The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> is directly proportional to its temperature. Some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges {{that they can be}} used for thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is still of practical importance today. The <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> thermometer is, however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics. This is because the entropy of an <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics. The physical reason is that the <b>ideal</b> <b>gas</b> law, exactly read, refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure.|$|E
