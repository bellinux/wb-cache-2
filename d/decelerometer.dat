5000|$|A <b>decelerometer</b> is a {{hand held}} device for {{measuring}} dynamic braking forces during a vehicle road test. A vehicle <b>decelerometer</b> operates {{as if it}} were, and {{it could also be}} known as, an accelerometer as it calculates braking efficiency by using those forces captured during a vehicle's deceleration. A <b>decelerometer</b> is a method by which braking effort can be accessed quickly and easily but it is generally used as an indicator to acceptable brake performance. Low efficiency readings should lead to further investigation on a roller brake tester.|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{centre of}} gravity {{influences}} directly the breaking characteristics. It dues through the actual each axle load and the actual gross weight of the vehicle. This fact is significant by full braking maneuver. Full braking measurements with different operational vehicle conditions - cargo weight and its location on the vehicle â€“ were done to evaluate this influence. The medium sized good vehicle (category N 2) was breaking on a wet asphalt surface. The value of the braking deceleration MFDD and the braking distance was measured by vehicle <b>decelerometer.</b> The results compare different axle- and vehicle load and show the area for future related measurements...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} NASA Diagonal-Braked Vehicle (DBV) test runs were {{performed}} on the soil runway 7 / 25 at Holland landing zone, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, near Pope Air Force Base in March 1995 {{at the request of}} the Air Force C- 17 System Program Office. These ground vehicle test results indicated that the dry runway friction level was suitable for planned C- 17 transport aircraft landing and take-off operations at various gross weights. These aircraft operations were successfully carried out. On-board aircraft deceleration measurements were comparable to NASA DBV measurements. Additional tests conducted with an Army High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle equipped with a portable <b>decelerometer,</b> showed good agreement with NASA DBV data...|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} 3 {{different}} types of brake tester {{used to calculate the}} braking efforts and efficiencies of a motor vehicle. Roller brake testers, which consist of a chassis with a driven roller system; plate brake testers, which consist of 2 parallel measuring plates, and <b>decelerometers</b> which are usually hand held devices.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} diploma thesis {{deals with}} the measurement of car deceleration during engine braking from different starting speeds and different speed gears {{with a sample of}} vehicles. This piece of work consists of a theoretical part, where problem background is defined, selected driving parameters including the manner how to measure them are explained and the facts in the field of structural characteristics of the vehicle are given, further from a design of measurement methodology that gives an overall plan of implementation, all the respective information and a description of handling with <b>decelerometer,</b> further from a real measurement of the deceleration including an interpretation of partial obtained values and finally from the evaluation of all results with appropriate conclusions...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} of the joint test program objectives and scope is given together with the performance capability of the NASA Langley B- 737 instrumented aircraft. The B- 737 test run matrix conducted during the first 8 months of this 5 -year program is discussed with a {{description of}} the different runway conditions evaluated. Some preliminary test results are discussed concerning the Electronic Recording <b>Decelerometer</b> (ERD) readings and a comparison of B- 737 aircraft braking performance for different winter runway conditions. Detailed aircraft parameter time history records, analysis of ground vehicle friction measurements and harmonization with aircraft braking performance, assessment of induced aircraft contaminant drag, and evaluation of the effects of other factors on aircraft/ground vehicle friction performance will be documented in a NASA Technical Report which is being prepared for publication next year...|$|E
