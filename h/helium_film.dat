40|$|A <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> {{suspended}} between elevations on a substrate {{forms an}} excellent surface for a two-dimensional electron gas. With the structure on the substrate a quasi one-dimensional electron {{system can be}} created. Experiments probing the electrical transport properties of this system have {{raised questions about the}} suspended <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> itself. We report measurements of the suspended film using interferometry. The profile is mapped out {{as a function of the}} bulk helium level beneath the substrate. By measuring the electron signal simultaneously the relation between the signal and the film profile can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} helium film-mediated hydrogen-hydrogen {{interactions}} {{account for a}} two orders of magnitude discrepancy between previous theory and recent experiments on cold collision shifts in spin-polarized hydrogen adsorbed on a <b>helium</b> <b>film.</b> These attractive interactions also explain the anomalous dependence of the cold collision frequency shifts on the $^ 3 $He covering of the film.

40|$|We study two {{techniques}} to create electrons in a liquid helium environment. One is thermionic emission of tungsten filaments {{in a low}} temperature cell in the vapor phase with a superfluid <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> covering all surfaces; the other is operating a glowing filament immersed in bulk liquid helium. We present both the steady state and rapid sweep I-V curves and the electron current yield. These curves, having a negative dynamic resistance region, differ remarkably from those of a vacuum tube filament. A novel low temperature vapor-phase electron collector for which the insulating <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> on the collector surface can be removed is used to measure emission current. We also discuss our achievement of producing multi-electron bubbles (MEBs) in liquid helium by a new method. Comment: 28 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} observed {{behavior of}} <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> adsorbed on alkali metal surfaces has confirmed earlier ideas about wetting and prewetting transitions. However, a quantitative {{discrepancy between the}} predicted and observed wetting temperature suggests that a reexamination of the energetics of adsorbed <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> is required. We show how the zero point phonon energy of an alkali-vapor interface can dramatically change the wetting properties of these substrates, in accord with experiment. We investigate the dependence on the exposed facet of the crystal surface. For Rb and Cs, the (110) face is predicted to be wet at zero temperature while the (100) face is not.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{investigation of the}} microwave absorption for two-dimensional electron layers on thin <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> and {{in the presence of}} a cyclotron resonance (CR) magnetic field. To explain the measured data, a recently proposed two-fraction structure of the electron system is used and here described in detail. Hereby the problem of substrate roughness, usually always present for electrons on thin <b>helium</b> <b>films,</b> is taken into account and it turns out to be an important parameter. Within this model the general structure of the microwave absorption becomes understandable and the fraction of localized and free electrons can be precisely determined.

40|$|We {{point out}} that nontrivial quantumstatistics of {{vortices}} in planar superfluid systems has its origin in the Schrodinger equation rather then the Chern-Simons term. Vortices in superfluid <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> are not anyons because <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> are compressible. Quantum Hall effect layers admit vortices with nontrivial statistical interactions thanks to their incompressibility. We consider type II planar superconductors described by time-dependent nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Inside of a vortex core superconductor is in the normal state. Because of that vortices in superconducting films are anyons. We consider also vortex loops in 3 dimensions but a phase factor due to linking of vortex loops' worldsheets is not a topological invariant. Comment: this is a revised version; main idea is the same but it is shown to work well in type II superconductor...|$|R

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown experimentally that the thickness of a saturated <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> is independent of its state of superflow.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{measurement}} we observed the thinning of an adsorbed <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> {{induced by the}} confinement of critical fluctuations a few millikelvin below the lambda point. A capacitor set-up {{was used to measure}} this Casimir effect. In this poster we will present our measurement of an adsorbed <b>helium</b> <b>film</b> of 400 angstroms near the lambda point with a quartz microbalance. For films this thick, we must take into account the non-linear dynamics of the shear waves in the fluid. In spite of the added complications, we were able to confirm the thinning of the film due to the Casimir effect and the onset of the superfluid transition. In addition, we observe a sharp anomaly at the bulk lambda point, most likely related to critical dissipation of the first sound.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} theoretical {{investigations into}} the dynamics of superfluid films {{and the effects of}} disorder on the roughening transition of crystal surfaces. The dynamic theory of superfluid <b>helium</b> <b>films,</b> due to Ambegaokar et al., is refined to improve the precision of the predictions made. A detailed comparison is made between the predictions of the modified theory and the results from experiments on <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> and on superconducting systems. It is found that, despite the modifications in the theory, agreement with experiments on <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> remains only qualitative. Consideration is then given to the effects on the roughening transition of disorder arising from screw dislocations. A crystal surface which is threaded by screw dislocation pairs may be in one of three different states depending on the temperature of the system {{and the way in which}} screw pairs are distributed. At high temperatures the interface is rough: it is not pinned to the lattice. At low temperatures the state of the interface depends on how the screw dislocations are distributed: when distributed as closely spaced pairs they lead to a faceted state with a single ground state energy; when distributed randomly they lead to a state of the interface which, though pinned to the underlying crystal lattice, has a degenerate ground state. It is then shown that the dynamic sine-Gordon formulation of the roughening transition can be used, via a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, to model the dynamic behaviour of superfluid systems. This method provides a re-normalization group framework within which the a. c. linear response can be studied. The ways in which the approach could be extended to study the effects of disorder and atomic layering are also discussed...|$|R

Background Several techniques- thermal conductivity and mass flow [11, third sound [2], persistent currents [3], quartz microbalance [4]- have been used to explore super-fluid properties for ultra-thin films adsorbed on glass, rutile, quartz, etc. Comple-menting these multilayer experiments on heterogeneous substrates, investigations have been made for multilayer <b>helium</b> <b>films</b> adsorbed on Grafoil [S], a relatively homogeneous surface for physical adsorption.
