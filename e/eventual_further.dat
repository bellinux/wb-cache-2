50|$|In 1773, English {{physician}} William Hawes (1736-1808) began publicizing {{the power}} of artificial ventilation to resuscitate people who superficially appeared to have drowned. For a year he paid a reward {{out of his own}} pocket to any one bringing him a body rescued from the water within a reasonable time of immersion. Thomas Cogan, another English physician, who had become interested in the same subject during a stay at Amsterdam, where was instituted in 1767 a society for preservation of life from accidents in water, joined Hawes in his crusade. In the summer of 1774 Hawes and Cogan each brought fifteen friends to a meeting at the Chapter Coffee-house, St Paul's Churchyard, where they founded the Royal Humane Society as a campaigning group for first aid and resuscitation. Some methods and equipment were similar to methods used today, such as wooden pipes used in the victims nostrils to blow air into the lungs. Others, bellows with a flexible tube for blowing tobacco smoke through the anus to revive vestigial life in the victim's intestines, were discontinued with the <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> understanding of respiration.|$|E

Congress viewed the Reagan Administration's anti-Sandinista {{policies}} with extreme skepticism, and were under the impression that the true goal of the CIA operation in Nicaragua was to overthrow the Sandinista government. Congress' efforts resulted in passage of an amendment in late 1982 introduced by Representative Edward P. Boland to the Fiscal Year 1983 Defense Appropriations bill. This is {{the first of a series}} of Boland Amendments prohibiting the CIA, principal conduit of covert American support to the Contras, from spending any money [...] "for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Nicaragua." [...] The CIA, however, interpreted the [...] "purpose" [...] stated in this phrase as the purpose of the CIA rather than the purpose of the enduser. Thus, the CIA argued that since the purpose of the CIA was not to overthrow the government, the fact that the money and military assistance went to people who had this goal did not matter. The subsequent lack of change in the Nicaragua operation significantly contributed to the <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> restrictions imposed by congress in the second version of the Boland amendmentThe majority report stated, [...] " [...] The Central Intelligence Agency was the U.S. Government agency that assisted the contras.

40|$|A key {{requirement}} for precision medicine is the accurate identification of patients that {{would respond to}} a specific treatment or those that represent a high-risk group, and a plethora of molecular biomarkers have been proposed for this purpose during the last decade. Their application in clinical settings, however, is not always straightforward due to relatively high costs of some tests, limited availability of the biological material and time, and procedural constraints. Hence, there is an increasing interest in constructing tissue-based surrogate biomarkers that could be applied with minimal overhead directly to histopathology images and {{which could be used}} for guiding the selection of <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> molecular tests. In the context of colorectal cancer, we present a method for constructing a surrogate biomarker that is able to predict with high accuracy whether a sample belongs to the “BRAF-positive” group, a high-risk group comprising V 600 E BRAF mutants and BRAF-mutant-like tumors. Our model is trained to mimic the predictions of a 64 -gene signature, the current definition of BRAF-positive group, thus effectively identifying histopathology image features that can be linked to a molecular score. Since the only required input is the routine histopathology image, the model can easily be integrated in the diagnostic workflow...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize unexpected mediastinal findings by imaging and pathologic analysis. MethodsEntry criterion for this prospective explorative study was {{mediastinal lymphadenopathy}} as an incidental finding on computed tomography (CT) scans made for indications other than the analysis and staging of neoplasms. Lymph node dimensions were measured on CT scan. Subsequent diagnostic investigations were positron emission tomography, endoscopic ultrasound- or endobronchial ultrasound-guided punctures, and clinical follow-up. ResultsEighty-three patients from eight hospitals met the entry criteria. The median number of Naruke stations with enlarged nodes was 7 (range 3 – 9). The median size of all nodes measured varied between 6 and 14 mm. The median number of lymph node stations with nodes of at least 10 mm was 3 (range 0 – 8). Hilar node enlargement was detected in 77 % of patients. No definitive diagnosis was obtained in 7 of 83 (8 %) patients. Lymphocytes were found in 55 of 83 (66 %) and sarcoidosis in 18 of 83 (22 %) of aspirates. Positron emission tomography showed metabolic activity in 87 % of patients.

A high-speed (up to 5000 frames s? 1) camera is used to visualize the impact and subsequent formation of jet flows and droplets. Unsteady pressure measurements at six locations across the wedge surface are measured at 10 kHz. Two accelerometers (10 g, 100 g) are mounted above the apex of the wedge and measure the vertical acceleration. A purpose-built position gauge and analysis of the synchronized video allows the wedge motion to be captured. The synchronization of these data with the digital images of the impact makes it particularly suitable for the validation of computational fluid dynamics simulations as well as theoretical studies. A detailed experimental uncertainty analysis is presented. The repeatability of the test process is demonstrated and the measured pressures are comparable to previous studies.

To investigate the relevance of such definitions, the authors have performed a series of analyses of curved wide plate tests, using a validated parametric finite element model.

40|$|Background: The genomes {{of several}} {{infectious}} pancreatic necrosis viruses (IPNVs) isolated in Chile were sequenced with a single amplification approach for both segments A and B. The resulting sequences were then {{used to determine the}} conservation of the primer-binding regions used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based diagnostic methods proposed in the literature. Thus, the robustness of each technique was studied, particularly the <b>eventual</b> effect of <b>further</b> mutations within the primer-binding sites. Results: On analysis, most methods currently used to detect Chilean IPNV varieties were deemed adequate. However, the primers were designed to be genogroup specific, implying that most detection methods pose some risk of detecting all strains prevalent in the country, due to the coexistence of genogroups 1 and 5. Conclusions: Negative results must be interpreted carefully given the high genomic variability of IPNVs. Detection techniques (quantitative reverse transcription (qRT) -PCR) based on degenerate primers can be used to minimize the possibilities of false-negative detections...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-six {{patients}} (21 men {{and five}} women) {{with a mean}} age of 54. 8 years have been reinvestigated nine to 62 months (mean 29. 7) after left ventricular aneurysmectomy. Preoperatively left ventricular angiography disclosed an anterior aneurysm in all cases, which was large in 15 (57 %) and small to medium in 11 (42 %). At follow-up a large residual aneurysm was found in five (19 %), a small to medium one in 13 (50 %), and akinesia without aneurysm in eight (31 %). The sum of ST elevation (sigma ST) in praecordial leads in the electrocardiogram was reduced from a mean value of 11. 2 mm to 7. 7 mm. In no patient did ST segments return to normal after operation. Preoperatively, mean sigma ST was identical in patients with large and with small to medium aneurysms. At reinvestigation mean sigma ST was identical in patients with large and with small to medium residual aneurysms as well as in patients with akinesia. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure before angiography was reduced from a mean value of 21. 5 mm to 15. 1 mmHg and after angiography from 26. 7 mm to 21. 1 mmHg. Progression of coronary artery stenoses was a characteristic finding in patients whose left ventricular end-diastolic pressures did not return to normal. These patients had a longer follow-up time than those with no progression of coronary disease, who all showed an improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Six patients who had coronary bypass grafting performed had unchanged left ventricular end-diastolic pressures at follow-up.

40|$|Stellar {{population}} {{studies of}} globular clusters {{have suggested that}} the brightest clusters in the Galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. If the present Galactic globular clusters formed within larger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal halos and/or tails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems. The stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore {{one of the best places}} to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. Here an attempt is made to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globular clusters M 22 and NGC 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster NGC 3201. The stellar parameters from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) are used to identify stars with RAVE metallicities, radial velocities and elemental-abundances consistent with the abundance patterns and properties of the stars in M 22, NGC 1851 and NGC 3201. The discovery of RAVE stars that may be associated with M 22 and NGC 1851 are reported, some of which are at projected distances of ~ 10 degrees away from the core of these clusters. Numerous RAVE stars associated with NGC 3201 suggest that either the tidal radius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound stars extending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. No further extra-tidal stars associated with NGC 3201 could be identified. The bright magnitudes of the RAVE stars make them easy targets for high resolution follow-up observations, allowing an <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> chemical tagging to solidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidal debris. In both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding NGC 1851 and NGC 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is seen, consistent with extended tidal debris from omega Centauri.

40|$|Crack {{propagation}} in ferroelectric materials under cyclic {{electric and}} combined electro-mechanical loading {{has been studied}} by several research groups. In most experiments however, Vickers-indented surface cracks and not through-thickness cracks were used. We studied crack propagation under cyclic electric loading in a commercial, soft ferroelectric lead-zirconate-titanate material. The samples were 40 mm x 5 mm x 1. 5 mm in dimension, poled in the 5 mm-direction with a through-thickness notch {{in the middle of}} the 5 mm side. A cyclic electric field of variable maximum field strength was applied in the 5 mm-direction. Crack propagation was observed in-situ by an optical microscope and recorded simultaneously on video. A crack is found to initiate in the first half cycle antiparallel to the poling direction once the electric field strength exceeds the coercive field strength of the material. In the subsequent cycles the crack propagates perpendicular to the electric field during each half cycle. The electric polarization was also measured so that a dielectric hysteresis could be observed during crack propagation. It was found that the crack does not propagate significantly before global domain switching takes place and stops growing after global domain switching has finished. During the first 10 - 20 cycles the crack propagates in a “steady-state ” with a constant growth rate da/dN. The growth rate depends on the electric field strength. Further cycling leads to a slowing down of the crack with <b>eventual</b> arrest. <b>Further</b> experiments will include combined electrical and mechanical loading with static mechanical and cyclic electrical loads. ...|$|R

For this process the Q-sort method was applied in which a predetermined sample of the readership of two of South Africa‟s most eminent food magazines was involved. It is a reliable psychometric technique based on photographs that is often used in non-food related contexts such as architecture and the travel industry. Quantitatively, the data was factor analysed, from which seven factors emerged that corroborated the results. Findings confirm that Q-sort is a useful research approach for non-verbal communication in settings where, through food images, the technical and artistic messaging of food stylists comes from manipulating the assembly of food image content. It is proposed that, through non-verbal communication, food stylists {{who are able to}} purposefully create food images for print media would be able to effectively influence consumers {{in such a way as}} to bring about changed behavioural intent and <b>eventual</b> purchasing. <b>Further</b> investigation could consider expanding the theoretical base from which food stylists could pursue ways to alter consumers‟ behavioural intent. Put into practice, the findings could be a guide for food stylists when compiling food images that would successfully communicate intended messages.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} mapKITE, a new mobile, {{simultaneous}} terrestrial and aerial, geodata collection and post-processing method. On one side, the method combines a terrestrial mobile mapping system (TMMS) with an unmanned aerial mapping one, both equipped with remote sensing payloads (at least, a nadir-looking visible-band {{camera in the}} UA) by means of which aerial and terrestrial geodata are acquired simultaneously. This tandem geodata acquisition system {{is based on a}} terrestrial vehicle (TV) and on an unmanned aircraft (UA) linked by a 'virtual tether', that is, a mechanism based on the real-time supply of UA waypoints by the TV. By means of the TV-to-UA tether, the UA follows the TV keeping a specific relative TV-to-UA spatial configuration enabling the simultaneous operation of both systems to obtain highly redundant and complementary geodata. On the other side, mapKITE presents a novel concept for geodata post-processing favoured by the rich geometrical aspects derived from the mapKITE tandem simultaneous operation. The approach followed for sensor orientation and calibration of the aerial images captured by the UA inherits the principles of Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO) and adds the pointing-and-scaling photogrammetric measurement of a distinctive element observed in every UA image, which is a coded target mounted {{on the roof of the}} TV. By means of the TV navigation system, the orientation of the TV coded target is performed and used in the post-processing UA image orientation approach as a Kinematic Ground Control Point (KGCP). The geometric strength of a mapKITE ISO network is therefore high as it counts with the traditional tie point image measurements, static ground control points, kinematic aerial control and the new point-and-scale measurements of the KGCPs. With such a geometry, reliable system and sensor orientation and calibration and <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> reduction of the number of traditional ground control points is feasible. The different technical concepts, challenges and breakthroughs behind mapKITE are presented in this paper, such as the TV-to-UA virtual tether and the use of KGCP measurements for UA sensor orientation. In addition, the use in mapKITE of new European GNSS signals such as the Galileo E 5 AltBOC is discussed. Because of the critical role of GNSS technologies and the potential impact on the corridor mapping market, the European Commission and the European GNSS Agency, in the frame of the European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation “Horizon 2020,” have recently awarded the “mapKITE” project to an international consortium of organizations coordinated by GeoNumerics S.

40|$|In {{order to}} better characterise a {{permanent}} modifier based on iridium deposited on zirconium or tungsten treated platforms of transversely heated graphite atomizer, and to gain additional information about its chemical behavior directed to an <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> optimization, a series of experiments were carried out, both by surface techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or ESCA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry on the iridium release from unmodified and various other modified pyrolytic graphite platforms. Special {{attention was paid to}} the influence of the amount of iridium, zirconium carbide coating of the platform surface and the presence of citric acid on the iridium vaporization during pyrolysis and atomization. The processes of iridium losses during pyrolysis and atomization and peak maximum alignment depend on the amount of the iridium deposited on the pyrolytic graphite coated platforms in the presence of nitric acid. A fractional order of release which suggests an atom vaporization from the surface or edges of the iridium islands was estimated. In the presence of citric acid, mass independence and zero order of the atom release were found. The zirconium treatment of the platform results in change of the spatial distribution of iridium and hence its vaporization. Vaporization temperatures as high as 2100 degrees C, and first order of the process of atom generation were obtained, While it was possible to study the iridium atomization from uncoated and zirconium coated surfaces, evidencing a different order for the release process, the same was not possible for the tungsten coated platforms due to an 'overstabilization' that brought the iridium atomization temperature out of the working range of the instrument used, The different chemical behavior of tungsten and zirconium was also confirmed by XPS investigations, With tungsten, evidence of both W-C and W-O bonding was found, while zirconium on the contrary shows only Zr-O bonding and no evidence of carbide bonding. The SEM revealed a highly dispersed distribution of spot-like features whose smallest average diameter was of the order of 0. 1 mu m. The XRF asserted the confinement of iridium in these features and a strict association with zirconium in the case of zirconium treated surfaces. It is worth mentioning that such structure was preserved also after 400 thermal cycles simulating an atomization step at 1900 degrees C despite a quite evident deterioration of the graphite surface, thus confirming the excellent durability of this modifier.

40|$|The study {{describes}} a methodology {{for the analysis}} and design of turbomachinery components at low-fidelity level. This methodology {{is part of a}} broad, object-oriented environment developed at the Rolls-Royce VUTC. The approach described in this thesis is applicable to any axial turbomachinery configuration, however, main emphasis is made on compressors. The purpose of the research is to provide the opportunity to perform forced response, flutter and other unsteady analysis without the need for the expensive CFD runs. This is particularly demanded {{in the early stages of}} the aero-engine design process or in any other cases when the detailed information of the engine is not yet available, however, a broad unsteady parametric analysis based on the existing information is needed. The model uses a linearized form of the mass, momentum and energy budgets to relate small changes in the state of the gas at several positions in the machine to known disturbances at inlet or outlet, or to known changes in the geometry. The chosen approach allows usage of an arbitrary gas model without the assumption of constant gas properties. It also provides a straightforward way to obtain a steady-state solution in a minimal amount of iterations and to evaluate the exact values of the characteristic slopes. The unsteady solution methodology represents an extended and improved Semi-Actuator Disc model. The major improvements are the real geometry application, ability to handle rotating bladerows, loss models implementation and the cascade impedance model. As the solver is linearized, the harmonic perturbations are assumed to have small amplitude compared to the steady-state data and relatively long wavelength, compared to the blade measurements. Thus contributions of several perturbation sources may be superimposed within the model. The model has a block-wise structure, where every block represents a blade or an empty duct. Non-reflecting boundary conditions are applied to the blocks boundary interfaces together with a thought-through method for the angular frequency scattering. This allows assembling a multi-bladerow domain with both rotating and stationary bladerows for the unsteady analysis. A great deal of effort has been made to connect the system to a modern and general representation of the engine geometry. This data is then used to set up the domain geometry with minimal assumptions, thus considering the changes in areas, radii and the slope of the annulus. The complex blade profile information is accessible at any moment during the computation, thus allowing using a chosen set of loss and deviation models. The model uses the same geometry database as used for the CFD and FE analysis, however, any geometry data may be overridden on demand. The model has been validated on a variety of data, from the previous publications, for forced response and flutter and from alternative solvers for distorted casings. The agreement between the calculated results and the reference data is very satisfactory, with nearly exact match for a series of idealized cases. The improvements introduced in this approach, such as cascade impedance model and the loss and deviation model package extend and complete several statements made in previous publications regarding the effect of total pressure loss and presence of the passage end reflections. The model is also validated against more complex reference cases, such as 3 D CFD simulation of the LP turbine blade flutter, providing a good estimation of the damping curve slope in the low-ND region. Having a tip clearance loss model, the non-uniform casing simulations have been setup for evaluation of the relationship between the unsteady mass flow and pressure ratio perturbations. A thorough literature survey is made on the previous publications of the similar subject. The survey reviews a series of the modular systems for the axial turbomachinery analysis and then continues with the investigation of semi-empirical closures for the total pressure loss and outlet flow deviation modelling. The latter two play an essential role in this research as their implementation provides more realistic results, comparable to the heavy CFD runs. Greater part of the survey is devoted to the previous publications on various approaches for 1 D and 2 D unsteady turbomachinery modelling. The research completes with a thorough discussion of the features implemented and the results achieved, concluding with several future work proposals for the <b>eventual</b> <b>further</b> extension of the model as well as its applicability as a keystone for possible construction of a higher-fidelity solver. The primary programming object-oriented environment chosen for the model implementation is C++ with some parts written in FORTRAN. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} hybrid {{life cycle}} assessment was conducted to assess two different methods for hydrogen production. Environmental impacts from nuclear assisted thermochemical water splitting are compared to hydrogen production from natural gas steam reforming with CO 2 -sequestration. The {{results show that the}} two methods have significantly different impacts. The nuclear alternative has lower impacts on global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication, but very much higher for some of the other impact categories. A weighting procedure is not applied, hence no overall ”winner” can be proclaimed. The different impacts relative importance remains a challenge for <b>eventual</b> decision makers. <b>Further</b> the assessment has demonstrated the importance of including economic inputs in a comparative assessment; ordinary process-LCA may produce distorted results since a larger fraction of impacts can be accounted for in one case than in another. Another analytical finding is that avoiding double counting of material inputs in the input-output part of the assessment, significantly affects the results of some impact categories. A procedure to avoid double counting should therefore always be applied when performing a hybrid LCA. </p...|$|R
30|$|Salivary {{biomarkers}} {{represent a}} promising non-invasive approach for oral cancer detection, and {{an area of}} strong research interest. However, some issues/challenges have arisen {{that need to be}} resolved in order to establish this approach as a reliable, highly sensitive and specific method for clinical use. These issues include a lack of standardization for saliva sample collection, processing, and storage; wide variability in the levels of potential OSCC salivary biomarkers in both non-cancerous individuals and OSCC patients; and a need for further validation of OSCC salivary biomarkers with individuals who have either a chronic oral inflammatory disease or other types of cancers, but do not have OSCC. These issues call for convening a panel of researchers in this field to aim for <b>eventual</b> standardization, plus <b>further</b> research, especially concerning biological variance and physiological changes affecting the potential oral cancer salivary biomarkers. The experience gained in OSCC salivary biomarker research also can serve as an important reference in salivary diagnostics, including identifying, validating, and applying salivary biomarkers for other types of cancer detection and for monitoring non-cancerous disease activity.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{is divided}} into four parts: [...] "The Modern World", [...] "Resources", [...] "The Third World", and [...] "Organization and Ownership". Part I {{summarizes}} the Economic world of the early 1970s, from Schumacher's perspective. In the first chapter, [...] "The Problem of Production", Schumacher argues that the modern economy is unsustainable. Natural resources (like fossil fuels), are treated as expendable income, {{when in fact they}} should be treated as capital, since they are not renewable, and thus subject to <b>eventual</b> depletion. He <b>further</b> argues that nature's resistance to pollution is limited as well. He concludes that government effort must be concentrated on sustainable development, because relatively minor improvements, for example, technology transfer to Third World countries, will not solve the underlying problem of an unsustainable economy. Schumacher's philosophy is one of [...] "enoughness", appreciating both human needs and limitations, and appropriate use of technology. It grew out of his study of village-based economics, which he later termed Buddhist economics, which is the subject of the book's fourth chapter.|$|R
