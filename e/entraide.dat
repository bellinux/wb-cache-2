In late 1932 {{he became a}} member of the Quaker association <b>Entraide</b> européenne and went to Germany, working on the charity's behalf in Berlin from late 1932 until early 1933 when he was arrested and expelled from the country by the Nazis. In 1933, through Jack Hayland, Lesage was offered a bursary to study for a year at Woodbrooke College, the Quaker study centre in Birmingham, but the <b>Entraide</b> team recalled him to Paris in late 1933 to help reorganize the [...] "foyer" [...] for German, Jewish or political refugees in the rue de la Pierre Levée and to set up regional departments to welcome refugees and find them employment, especially by steering them to départements where there was no unemployment. Lesage worked for the French branch of the Service Civil International (SCI) from 10 January 1938 to 27 August 1939 and became its deputy secretary general. In this period he also served as a director of Pax Colony at the château de Soisy-sur-Seine, where accommodation was being provided for Spanish refugees fleeing the Spanish Civil War and Franco. Just as the Second World War was about to break out, Lesage was called up in August 1939. Following the armistice, he was demobilized on 12 July 1940 and decided to make his way to Vichy to see if he could be of service to the community under the new French government.|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous and Instigated Mutual Help in Rural China : the Communist Intervention (1943 - 1944) In 1943, Mao Zedong {{launched}} the "production movement" in the communist anti- Japanese bases in northern China. This two-year spell of "cooperativization" in the Chinese countryside foreshadowed the successive waves of collectivization {{during the following}} decade. Although the communists were trying to gain a foothold in village society by making use of ancient customs, their intervention revealed the gap between their collectivist, totalitarian design and the traditional structures of the Chinese peasantry. This divergence became patently obvious {{with the establishment of}} "instigated mutual help" organizations. The similarity of names and structure between the two sorts of groups cannot disguise the fact that the new organizations rejected a system of spontaneous mutual aid that had fostered local solidarity centered on networks of family ties.

40|$|In Northern Vietnam, labour {{exchange}} {{is the most}} common form of collective work among farmers and is often used to perform tasks that require an intense labor force in the fields and for other collective tasks related to the social life of the villagers This paper analyses all aspects of this labor exchange among individuals and families in the village of Hay. We have found that this labor exchange is not simply an economic transaction among farmers, but instead a personal choice of individuals and families in relation to other villagers. One can for example accept or refuse to work for a particular family and one can invite only a particular family to participate in labor exchange. In this paper, we argue that reciprocity is indeed the basis of this labor exchange in which individuals and families participate in order to establish and reinforce bounds with some families inside and outside the village.
