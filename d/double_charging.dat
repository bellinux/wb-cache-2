50|$|To {{maximise}} {{plasma temperature}} (and hence ionisation efficiency) and stability, the sample should be introduced through the central tube {{with as little}} liquid (solvent load) as possible, and with consistent droplet sizes. A nebuliser {{can be used for}} liquid samples, followed by a spray chamber to remove larger droplets, or a desolvating nebuliser can be used to evaporate most of the solvent before it reaches the torch. Solid samples can also be introduced using laser ablation. The sample enters the central channel of the ICP, evaporates, molecules break apart, and then the constituent atoms ionise. At the temperatures prevailing in the plasma a significant proportion of the atoms of many chemical elements are ionized, each atom losing its most loosely bound electron to form a singly charged ion. The plasma temperature is selected to maximise ionisation efficiency for elements with a high first ionisation energy, while minimising second ionisation (<b>double</b> <b>charging)</b> for elements that have a low second ionisation energy.|$|E

In the littlest Higgs model of little Higgs models there exists a new heavy scalar triplet. The physical states of this triplet contains a <b>double</b> <b>charged</b> scalar, a single charged scalar, as well as a neutral scalar and a neutral pseudo scalar. In little Higgs models a Majorana type mass term can also be implemented in Yukawa Lagrangian, resulting lepton flavor violation. In this talk the pair productions of <b>double</b> <b>charged</b> scalars in the context of littlest Higgs model in $e^+e^-$ colliders are presented.

Our data indicate that water and counterions ultimately dominate the DNA reduction and oxidation free energies, which are also strongly influenced by the base position along the strand. In fact, we estimated that reduction free energies are large and negative, particularly for the bases close to the 50 and 3 ' positions, whereas the electron detachment is thermodynamically unfavoured all along the strand, but with a higher free energy cost in the central region of the molecule.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of glycosylation from native biological sources is often {{frustrated by the}} low abundances of available material. Here, ion mobility combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry {{have been used to}} extract the spectra of N-glycans released with PNGase F from a serial titration of recombinantly expressed envelope glycoprotein, gp 120, from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Analysis was also performed on gp 120 expressed in the a- mannosidase inhibitor, and in a matched mammalian cell line deficient in GlcNAc transferase I. Without ion mobility separation, ESI spectra frequently contained no observable ions from the glycans whereas ions from other compounds such as detergents and residual buffer salts were abundant. After ion mobility separation on a Waters T-wave ion mobility mass spectrometer, the N-glycans fell into a unique region of the ion mobility/m/z plot allowing their profiles to be extracted with good signal:noise ratios. This method allowed N-glycan profiles to be extracted from crude incubation mixtures with no clean-up even in the presence of surfactants such as NP 40. Furthermore, this technique allowed clear profiles to be obtained from sub-microgram amounts of glycoprotein. Glycan profiles were similar to those generated by MALDI-TOF MS although they were more susceptible to <b>double</b> <b>charging</b> and fragmentation. Structural analysis could be accomplished by MS/MS experiments in either positive or negative ion mode but negative ion mode gave the most informative spectra and provided a reliable approach to the {{analysis of}} glycans from small amounts of glycoprotein. © American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2011. </p...|$|E
