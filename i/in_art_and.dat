5|$|Born on February 2, 1963 at the Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., Cassidy {{grew up in}} Oxon Hill, Maryland {{and later}} Bowie, Maryland. She was the third of four children. Her father, Hugh Cassidy, is a teacher, sculptor, musician, former army medic, and world {{champion}} powerlifter of Irish and Scottish descent, while her mother, Barbara (née Kratzer), is a German horticulturist from Bad Kreuznach. From an early age, Cassidy displayed interest <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> music. When she was nine, her father began teaching her to play the guitar, {{and she began to}} play and sing at family gatherings.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} centuries, rolls of arms {{included}} invented arms for kings of foreign lands (Neubecker, 30). Around 1310, Jacques de Longuyon wrote the Voeux de Paon ("Vows of the Peacock"), {{which included a}} list of nine famous leaders. This list, divided into three groups of three, became known <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> literature as the Nine Worthies (Loomis 1938, 37). Each of the Nine Worthies were given a coat of arms. King David, for instance, was assigned a gold harp as a device (Neubecker, 172).|$|E
5|$|It is {{now known}} that at least some, and {{probably}} all, dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers, including large, vaned, wing and tail feathers. This development, first hypothesized in the mid-late 1980s and confirmed by fossil discoveries in 1999, represents {{a significant change in}} the way dromaeosaurids have historically been depicted <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> film.|$|E

5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins Ptyonoprogne, and Saw-wings Psalidoprocne. Coincidentally, {{although most of the}} depictions of the nightingale and its song <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.|$|E
5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. An abnormal fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.|$|E
5|$|With an {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> drawing, Wiesenthal chose to study architecture. His first choice was {{to attend the}} Lwów Polytechnic (Polish: Politechnika Lwowska), but he was turned away because the school's Jewish quota had already been filled. He instead enrolled at the Czech Technical University in Prague, where he studied from 1928 until 1932. He was apprenticed as a building engineer through 1934 and 1935, spending most of that period in Odessa. He married Cyla in 1936 {{when he returned to}} Galicia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Mercury and {{his family}} fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, in which {{thousands}} of Arabs and Indians were killed. The family moved into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, England. Mercury enrolled at Isleworth Polytechnic (now West Thames College) in West London where he studied art. He ultimately earned a diploma <b>in</b> <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> Graphic Design at Ealing Art College (now the Ealing campus of University of West London), later using these skills to design the Queen heraldic arms. A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of Expression® is a {{book written}} by Kembrew McLeod about freedom of speech issues {{involving}} concepts of intellectual property.

The paperback edition includes a foreword by Lawrence Lessig. The author recounts a history of the use of counter-cultural artistry, illegal art, and the use of copyrighted works in art as a form of fair use and creative expression. The book encourages the reader to continue such uses <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> other forms of creative expression.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Bean left Brook Comprehensive School with O Levels <b>in</b> <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> English. After {{a job at}} a {{supermarket}} and another for the local council, he started working for his father's firm with a day release at Rotherham College of Arts and Technology to take a welding course. While there, he stumbled into an art class and decided to pursue his interest in art. After attending courses at two other colleges, one for half a day and the other for less than a week, he returned to Rotherham College, where he subsequently enrolled in a drama course. After some college plays and one at Rotherham Civic Theatre, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), starting a seven-term course in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-twentieth century, {{there were}} {{divisions}} in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex cultural politics of the Cold War era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against modernism <b>in</b> <b>art,</b> <b>and</b> tonalism came into favour. Partly {{as a reaction to}} this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after World War II was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria's painting school. Influenced by Bell, Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists. Other members of the group included Russell Drysdale and Sali Herman.|$|E

5|$|Nearby Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was {{established}} in 1966. It is known, academically, for the physical sciences, mathematics, architecture, management and technology. Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005. It has schools <b>in</b> <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences.

Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{was born}} in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police {{department}} clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the Petite École, a school specializing <b>in</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.|$|E
5|$|Sixth-graders Calder Pillay, {{who enjoys}} puzzles and pentominoes, and Petra Andalee, who aspires to be a writer, are classmates at the Middle School in Hyde Park, Chicago.

Through her pressing questions, they discover the artist Johannes Vermeer and his paintings, especially A Lady Writing and The Geographer. Petra also finds a used book called Lo!, written by Charles Fort, at the local Powell's Books, owned {{by a man named}} Mr. Watch. They also meet an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Sharpe, who is also a fan of Vermeer and Fort. Calder receives letters from his best friend Tommy Segovia, who is currently living in New York City with a new stepfather.|$|E
