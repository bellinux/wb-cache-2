5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage.

5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} cut into the food plant; saliva <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells.

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E

5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> into the airflow and ignited, raising {{the pressure and}} temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E

5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|E

5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used.

This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast <b>is</b> <b>injected</b> to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E

If antigen <b>was</b> <b>injected</b> first and antibody <b>was</b> <b>injected</b> subsequently, a similar increase in permeability was observed in animals having a complete complement system (MuB 1 -positive) and in animals which have a deficient complement system (MuB 1 -negative).
