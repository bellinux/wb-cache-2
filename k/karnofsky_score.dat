Various instruments, which include both generic and disease-specific instruments, are used in the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In this study, we compare two commonly used generic instruments. OBJECTIVES: The objective {{of this study was to}} compare two generic instruments, the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale and the SF- 36 Health Survey in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The study also aims to find out the association (if any) between HRQOL scores using these two scales and various clinical and biochemical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two maintenance HD patients were recruited after informed consents were obtained. Detailed sociodemographic data was obtained. They were assessed during their regular HD sessions. Serum chemistry (which included serum urea, creatinine, Na+, K+, HCO 3 -, Ca 2 +, Po 4 (2 -)), albumin, globulin, total protein and hemoglobin (g/dl) were assessed in all the patients. Adequacy of HD was assessed using second-generation Daugirdais formula. HRQOL was assessed using the Karnofsky and SSF- 36 instruments and the scores collated and compared. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 10. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients completed the study (27 males and 28 females, mean age 40. 76 +/- 11. 05 years and age range of 20 - 65 years). There was a significant positive correlation between <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>scores</b> and all eight SF- 36 domains, but only physical functioning, social functioning and role limitation due to emotional problems maintained the significance on multiple regression analysis.

Ninety-six new TB patients hospitalised between 2003 and 2006 were enrolled and followed for two years. Thirty two were HIV-uninfected and 64 were HIV-infected. Among the HIV-uninfected, the commonest reasons for hospitalization were low <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> (47 %) and need for diagnostic evaluation (25 %). HIV-infected patients were commonly hospitalized due to low <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> (72 %), concurrent illness (16 %) and diagnostic evaluation (14 %). Eleven HIV uninfected patients died (mortality rate 19. 7 per 100 person-years) while 41 deaths occurred among the HIV-infected patients (mortality rate 46. 9 per 100 person years). In all patients an unsuccessful treatment outcome (treatment failure, death during the treatment period or an unknown outcome) was associated with duration of TB symptoms, with the odds of an unsuccessful outcome decreasing with increasing duration. Among HIV-infected patients, an unsuccessful treatment outcome was also associated with male sex (P = 0. 004) and age (P = 0. 034). Low <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> (aHR = 8. 93, 95 % CI 1. 88 - 42. 40, P = 0. 001) was the only factor significantly associated with mortality among the HIV-uninfected.

40|$|Abstract. CyberKnife (CK), hypofractionated {{stereotactic}} radiosurgery, is {{a preferred}} {{option for the}} treatment of advanced refractory lung cancer which is usually inoperable. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell immunotherapy has a marked radiosensitization effect which aids the elimination of residual tumor cells in distant areas. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of CK alone and combined with CIK cell therapy for advanced refractory lung cancer. In one year, 22 patients with advanced lung cancer underwent CK therapy at a CyberKnife Center. Of these patients, 11 received CIK cell therapy before or after the CK therapy course. The median prescribed dose in the combined CK and CIK group was 35 Gy (mean, 33. 8 ± 5. 0 Gy) with a median number of fractions of 5. The median dose for patients who underwent CK alone was 35 Gy (mean, 35. 2 ± 6. 0 Gy). CIK cell therapy was administered according to the condition of each patient, generally 2 continuous therapeutic sessions in 2 months. The median follow-up period was 3 months. The preliminary curative efficiency rate was 81. 82 % for patients who underwent CK/CIK and 72. 73 % for those who received CK alone, according to radiographic re-examination (P> 0. 05). The median improvement in the <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>scores</b> of the CK/CIK group was 20 (18 ± 10. 51) compared with 10 (8. 6 ± 11. 85) for those who underwent CK alone (P< 0. 05). The median expres-sion of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) before and after treatment was 40. 81 and 12. 21 ng/ml, respectively, for the CK/CIK group compared with 39. 04 and 26. 36 ng/ml for CK alone. The median percentage of phenotype expression of the CIK cells (CD 3 +/CD 8 + and CD 3 +/CD 56 +) in the patients who underwent CK/CIK was recorded as 64. 35 % (57. 08 ± 16. 94 %) and 15. 27 % (18. 80 ± 7. 00 %), respectively, prior to transfu-sion.

40|$|Background: This {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to determine whether a 15 -minute bout of moderate-intensity aerobic cycling exercise would affect symptoms (pain and fatigue) and function (Timed 25 -Foot Walk test [T 25 FW] and Timed Up and Go test [TUG]) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and to compare these results with those of a healthy control group. Methods: Eight people with MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale score 5 – 6; <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> 50 – 80), eight people with CFS (<b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> 50 – 80), and eight healthy volunteers participated in the study. Pain and fatigue levels and results of the T 25 FW and TUG were established at baseline as well as at 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours following a 15 -minute stationary cycling aerobic exercise test. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and covariance (ANCOVA) were used to analyze the findings over time. Results: At baseline there were statistically significant differences between groups in fatigue (P =. 039), T 25 FW (P =. 034), and TUG (P =. 010). A significant group/time interaction emerged for fatigue levels (P=. 005). We found no significant group/time interaction for pain levels or function.

40|$|International audienceAlthough intradialytic {{parenteral}} nutrition (IDPN) {{is a method}} used widely to combat protein-calorie malnutrition in hemodialysis patients, its effect on survival has not been thoroughly studied. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial in which 186 malnourished hemodialysis patients received oral nutritional supplements with or without 1 year of IDPN. IDPN did not improve 2 -year mortality (primary end point), hospitalization rate, <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score,</b> body mass index, or laboratory markers of nutritional status. Instead, both groups demonstrated improvement in body mass index and the nutritional parameters serum albumin and prealbumin (P 30 mg/L within 3 months, a marker of nutritional improvement, independently predicted a 54 % decrease in 2 -year mortality, as well as reduced hospitalizations and improved general well-being {{as measured by the}} <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score.</b> Therefore, although we found no definite advantage of adding IDPN to oral nutritional supplementation, this is the first prospective study demonstrating that an improvement in prealbumin during nutritional therapy is associated with a decrease in morbidity and mortality in malnourished hemodialysis patients...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the acquired benefit of antiviral therapy {{in addition to}} routine treatment regimen including hepatoprotective internal medicine in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MethodsA total of 105 end-stage HCC patients who were admitted to our hospital from January 2011 to January 2012 with an initial diagnosis of hepatitis B cirrhosis were included in this study. According to the treatment regimen, the patients were divided into routine treatment group (group A) and antiviral therapy group (group B). Patients were followed up for 96 weeks, and the benefit of antiviral therapy was evaluated by comparison of <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score,</b> Child-Push score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and survival rate between two groups. Comparison of continuous data between groups was made by t test, and comparison of categorical data was made by χ 2 test. Prognostic analysis was made by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. ResultsAt week 24 of follow-up, patients in group B had markedly improved general status and liver function, significantly increased <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> (t= 4. 785, P= 0. 031), and significantly reduced Child-Push score (t= 5. 015, P= 0. 028) compared with those in group A. At week 96, the <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score,</b> Child-Push score, and MELD score all showed significant improvements in group B compared with those in group A (t= 8. 578, P= 0. 016; t= 6. 774, P= 0. 021; t= 9. 014, P= 0. 008). The patients in group B had a significantly higher survival rate than those in group A (67. 2 % vs 45. 5 %, P= 0. 026). ConclusionEffective antiviral therapy in patients with HBV-related end-stage HCC could {{improve the quality of}} life and liver function, reduce complications, prolong the survival time, and thus bring great benefits to those patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (a) to describe the relation-ship between pain perception and ethnic identity and socio-economic status, (b) to evaluate the intercorrelations between pain measures in different ethnic groups, and (c) to determine whether ethnicity or socioeconomic status influ-ences patient’s pain control beliefs and satisfaction with the pain management provided. The sample consisted of 51 Eng-lish-, Korean-, or Spanish-speaking participants experienc-ing cancer pain who were 18 years and older and were hav-ing a <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>score</b> of no less than 30.

25|$|If it has metastasized to {{the lymph}} nodes, the 5-year {{survival}} is around 5% to 15%. For metastatic renal cell carcinoma, factors which may present a poor prognosis include a low <b>Karnofsky</b> performance-status <b>score</b> (a standard way of measuring functional impairment {{in patients with}} cancer), a low haemoglobin level, {{a high level of}} serum lactate dehydrogenase, and a high corrected level of serum calcium. For non-metastatic cases, the Leibovich scoring algorithm may be used to predict post-operative disease progression.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Karnofsky</b> Performance <b>Score</b> (KPS) ranking {{runs from}} 100 to 0, where 100 is [...] "perfect" [...] health and 0 is death. Practitioners {{occasionally}} assign performance scores in between standard intervals of 10. This scoring system {{is named after}} Dr. David A. Karnofsky, who described the scale with Dr. Walter H. Abelmann, Dr. Lloyd F. Craver, and Dr. Joseph H. Burchenal in 1948. The primary purpose of its development was to allow physicians to evaluate a patient's ability to survive chemotherapy for cancer.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of Ginkgo biloba exocarp polysaccharides (GBEP) capsule preparation in treating upper digestive tract malignant tumors of middle and late stage. Methods: Eighty-six patients {{of the upper}} digestive tract malignant tumors were treated with GBEP capsule preparation taken orally. The clinical symptoms and the qualities of life of the patients with single GBEP and combined with operation, radiotherapy or intervention chemotherapy were observed. The tumor size was measured by electronic gastroscope before and after treatment with single GBEP. Objective response rate (RR) of the tumor was calculated. The survival period of patient was observed. The changes of blood routine examination in the patients treated with radiotherapy were observed. Results: GBEP preparation could markedly improve the patients' clinical symptoms. <b>Karnofsky</b> <b>scoring</b> of the patients markedly increased after treatment. There were 2 CR (complete response, 6. 3 %), 22 PR (partial response, 68. 8 %) and 5 SD (stable disease, 15. 6 %) of 32 cases with single GBEP preparation. The survival periods of the 32 cases were markedly prolonged. The preparation could relieve the inhibited hematopietic function and the weight loss due to radiotherapy. Conclusion: GBEP capsule preparation has some definite therapeutic effects on upper digestive tract malignant tumors of middle and late stage...|$|R
