On 18 May 1941, he married Doris Isabel Parker (1920–2003), an old friend {{who worked as a}} clerk and who, like Hollamby, {{was a member of the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Their wedding took place at St Michael's Church at Tokyngton, Middlesex, after which they moved to St. Peter's Square, Hammersmith. They went on to have two daughters and a son. In August 1941, during Britain's involvement in World War II, Hollamby was called up to serve in the British armed forces. Assigned to the Royal Marine Engineers, he served most of the conflict in Trincomalee, Ceylon.|$|E

2500|$|Meades's thesis was {{not entirely}} {{complimentary}} ("its legacy is Britain's ubiquitous, banal sprawl") {{but it is a}} theme that other writers have supported. Many factors underlying British <b>housing</b> <b>design,</b> and also town planning, began in Letchworth. The popularity of Parker and Unwin's [...] "country" [...] style, plus the success of the Cheap Cottages Exhibitions of 1905 and 1907, inspired British urban architectural design for many decades – a style which, according to Meades [...] "shunned urbanism to an extent otherwise unknown on this continent".|$|E

These ballasts convert the incoming power to an output frequency in excess of [...] This increases lamp efficiency. These are used in several applications, including new generation tanning lamp systems, whereby a 100 watt lamp (e.g., F71T12BP) can be lit using 90 watts of actual power while obtaining the same luminous flux (measured in lumens) as magnetic ballasts. [...] These ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts, requiring some consideration in <b>housing</b> <b>design,</b> and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the wire leads from the ballast to the lamp ends.|$|E

Nevertheless, but by the late 1920s and early 1930s there was already a significant move towards Functionalism, inspired most significantly by French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier, but also from examples closer to hand, again Sweden, such as the Stockholm Exhibition (1930) by Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz. However, at the time, there were certainly architects who attempted to articulate their dissatisfaction with static styles, just as Sigurd Frosterus and Gustaf Strengel had criticised the National Romanticism. Pauli E. Blomstedt, who had certainly designed significant buildings in the Nordic Classicism style, then became a vehement critic, writing sarcastically in a 1928 essay [...] "Architectural Anemia" [...] about Nordic Classicism's sense of [...] "good taste", {{at a time when}} he had already endorsed the white Functionalism: ...|$|E
