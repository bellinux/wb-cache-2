Instead, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) between several stationary nodes (anchor nodes) and a mobile node to predict the position of the mobile node. The main goals of the thesis are to find the optimal localization algorithm and to identify the optimal number of anchor nodes that would provide the desired localization precision. We will show that the proposed technique is affordable and can be successfully used in <b>electronically</b> <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> (e. g., indoors). The technology used is a 434 MHz RF localization system that should provide less interference than the typical 2. 4 GHz systems that commonly experience interference from other domestic technologies. The results reveal the feasibility and shortcomings of these systems for creating a more accurate real-time positioning system...|$|R
40|$|The {{first use}} of a long optical fiber for {{transmitting}} megahertz frequencies in a laser velocimeter (LV) receiver system is reported. The fiber comprises a 600 -micron diameter fused silica core, a silicon polymer cladding and a plastic jacket. The fiber numerical aperture is 0. 22, corresponding to a maximum entrance half-angle of 0. 22 rad. The 10 -m length used results in a 5. 6 % attenuation loss. The fiber is found to transmit an 80 -MHz signal with excellent resolution. It is established that an LV receiver using fiber optics sends a clean signal in <b>electronically</b> <b>noisy</b> and high-pressure <b>environments</b> and allows velocity measurements in places too small for a photomultiplier tube...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{adaption}} to {{a changing}} environment {{is critical for}} an animal’s survival. How well the brain can modify its functional properties based on experience essentially defines the limits of behavioral adaptation. In adult animals {{the extent to which}} experience shapes brain function has not been fully explored. Moreover, the perceptual consequences of experience-induced changes in the brains of adults remain unknown. Here we show that the tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex of adult rats living with low-level ambient noise underwent a dramatic reorganization. Behaviorally, chronic noise-exposure impaired fine, but not coarse pitch discrimination. When tested in a <b>noisy</b> <b>environment,</b> the noise-exposed rats performed as well as in a quiet environment whereas the control rats performed poorly. This suggests that noise-exposed animals had adapted to living in a <b>noisy</b> <b>environment.</b> Behavioral pattern analyses revealed that stress or distraction engendered by the noisy background could not account for the poor performance of the control rats in a <b>noisy</b> <b>environment.</b> A reorganized auditory map may therefore have served as the neural substrate for the consistent performance of the noise-exposed rats in a <b>noisy</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} dynamics is {{investigated for}} various bi-partitions of a composite system {{consisting of two}} qubits, and two independent and non-identical <b>noisy</b> <b>environments.</b> The two qubits have no direct interaction {{with each other and}} locally interact with their environments. Classical and quantum correlations including entanglement are initially prepared only between the two qubits. We find that, contrary to the identical <b>noisy</b> <b>environment</b> case, the entanglement and quantum correlation transfer directions can be controlled by combining different <b>noisy</b> <b>environments.</b> The amplitude damping environment determines whether there exists entanglement transfer among the bi-partitions of a composite system. When one qubit is coupled to an amplitude damping environment but another one to a bit-flip one, we find a very interesting result that all the quantum and classical correlations, and even the entanglement, originally existing between the qubits, can be completely transferred without any loss to the qubit coupled to the bit-flip environment and the amplitude-damping environment. We also notice {{that it is possible to}} distinguish the quantum correlation from the classical correlation and entanglement by combining different <b>noisy</b> <b>environments.</b> Comment: 22 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{environmental}} noise classification using {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) for robust speech recognition. Once the type of noise is identified, speech recognition performance can be enhanced by selecting the identified noise specific acoustic model. The proposed model applies PCA {{to a set of}} noise features, and results from PCA are used by a pattern classifier for noise classification. Instead of including both clean and <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> in a single classifier, two-step classification is introduced by separating the clean from <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> and then identifying the type of <b>noisy</b> <b>environments.</b> The proposed model is evaluated with four types of noise: white, pink, babble, and car from NOISEX- 92 and shows a promising result regardless of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveMany {{tinnitus}} patients {{complain about}} difficulties regarding speech comprehension. In {{spite of the}} high clinical relevance {{little is known about}} underlying mechanisms and predisposing factors. Here, we performed an exploratory investigation in a large sample of tinnitus patients to (1) estimate the prevalence of speech comprehension difficulties among tinnitus patients, to (2) compare subjective reports of speech comprehension difficulties with objective measurements in a standardized speech comprehension test and to (3) explore underlying mechanisms by analyzing the relationship between speech comprehension difficulties and peripheral hearing function (pure tone audiogram), as well as with co-morbid hyperacusis as a central auditory processing disorder. Subjects and MethodsSpeech comprehension was assessed in 361 tinnitus patients presenting between 07 / 2012 and 08 / 2014 at the Interdisciplinary Tinnitus Clinic at the University of Regensburg. The assessment included standard audiological assessment (pure tone audiometry, tinnitus pitch and loudness matching), the Goettingen sentence test (in quiet) for speech audiometric evaluation, two questions about hyperacusis, and two questions about speech comprehension in quiet and <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> (How would you rate your ability to understand speech?; How would you rate your ability to follow a conversation when multiple people are speaking simultaneously?). Results Subjectively reported speech comprehension deficits are frequent among tinnitus patients, especially in <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> (cocktail party situation). 74. 2 % of all investigated patients showed disturbed speech comprehension (indicated by values above 21. 5 dB SPL in the Goettingen sentence test). Subjective speech comprehension complaints (both in general and in <b>noisy</b> <b>environment)</b> were correlated with hearing level and with audiologically-assessed speech comprehension ability. In contrast, co-morbid hyperacusis was only correlated with speech comprehension difficulties in <b>noisy</b> <b>environments,</b> but not with speech comprehension difficulties in general. ConclusionSpeech comprehension deficits are frequent among tinnitus patients. Whereas speech comprehension deficits in quiet environments are primarily due to peripheral hearing loss, speech comprehension deficits in <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> are related to both peripheral hearing loss and dysfunctional central auditory processing. Disturbed speech comprehension in <b>noisy</b> <b>environments</b> might be modulated by central inhibitory deficit. In addition, attentional and cognitive aspects may play a role...|$|R
