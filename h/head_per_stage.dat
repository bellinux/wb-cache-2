40|$|CO 2 {{captured}} from fossil-fueled {{power generation}} plants {{is said to}} be economically transported via pipelines over long distances. The CO 2 must be compressed to pipeline specifications using compressors and pumps that are driven by gas turbine (GT) or other prime movers. This paper presents the evaluation of actual work transfer or required prime power by modeling the governing equations of compression using the Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR-EOS). A computer code was developed to carry out the modeling and subsequent simulation of the compression power requirement. The simulation of prime mover power was carried out for different technology (<b>head</b> <b>per</b> <b>stage)</b> of the compressor ranging from 10 -staged compression to double stage compression. The results show that the current technology of the centrifugal compressor could require as much as 23 MW of prime mover power to compress 1. 5 million tonnes per year of CO 2 —a projected equivalent CO 2 released from a 530 MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power generation plant...|$|E

5000|$|Negdels, which {{concentrated}} on livestock production, were organized into brigad (brigades) {{and then into}} suuri (bases), composed of several households. Each suuri had its own equipment and production tasks. Negdels adopted the Soviet system of herding, in which arad households lived in permanent settlements rather than traveling with their herds, as in the pastoral tradition. In 1985 the average negdel had 61,500 head of livestock, 438,500 hectares of land, of which 1,200 hectares was plowable land, 43 tractors, 2 grain harvesters, and 18 motor vehicles; it harvested 500 tons of grain. [...] Individual negdel members were permitted to own livestock. In mountain steppe pasture areas, ten <b>head</b> of livestock <b>per</b> person, up to fifty <b>head</b> <b>per</b> household, were allowed.

Materials and Methods: We prospectively studied 34 <b>PER</b> <b>stage</b> IV ankle fractures between September 2001 and September 2008. Twenty (59 %) patients show syndesmotic injury on initial anteroposterior radiographs. We performed an intraoperative external rotation stress test in other 14 patients with suspicious <b>PER</b> <b>stage</b> IV ankle fractures, which showed no defined syndesmotic injury on anteroposterior radiographs inspite of a medial malleolar fracture, an oblique fibular fracture above the syndesmosis and fracture of the posterior tubercle of the tibia. Results: All 14 fractures showed different degrees of tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) and tibiofibular overlapping (TFO) on the external rotation stress test radiograph compared to the initial plain anteroposterior radiograph.

40|$|Power {{dissipation}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly important issue {{in the design of}} analog to digi-tal converters as signal processing systems move into applications requiring either portability, or {{as in the case of}} some telecommunications applications, a high degree of parallelism. This research focuses on minimizing power dissipation in high resolution pipelined analog to digital converters, which are needed in applications requiring both high data rates and high resolution, such as medi-cal imaging, high data rate digital radio receivers, and in some telecommunications systems. Power dissipation was minimized in this research through the appropriate choice of the <b>per</b> <b>stage</b> resolution, optimizing the distribution of the thermal noise budget among the various stages of the pipeline, the appropriate choice of opamp architecture, and through optimal sizing of opamps. This thesis concludes that the optimum <b>per</b> <b>stage</b> resolution increases as the resolution specifi-cation increases. <b>Per</b> <b>stage</b> resolutions of less than one bit <b>per</b> <b>stage</b> are ideal for low resolution pipelines, but higher <b>per</b> <b>stage</b> resolutions are optimal for pipelines that have tighter noise con-straints. This thesis also concludes that power is saved by scaling down the sizes of the sampling capacitors in later stages of the pipeline. The trade-off between speed and power dissipation for opamps in switched capacitor circuits was also studied. It was found that for low gain high speed switched capacitor circuits, the single stage, telescopic cascode, and preamplifier driving a single stage opamp met the speed require-i ments with the least power dissipation. For lower speeds, the preamplifier driving a single stage opamp had the least power...|$|R
