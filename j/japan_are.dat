50|$|The most {{significant}} Latino diaspora in <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> Peruvian, {{followed by the}} Bolivian diaspora. Migration of South Americans to <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> significant after the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the success}} of certain exports, <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> often viewed as a heavily export-dependent nation. As an example, just under half of all {{automobiles}} produced in <b>Japan</b> <b>were</b> exported.|$|R
50|$|The {{regime of}} Imperial <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> {{different}} from other Axis countries. Internally, <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> oppressive {{but not in the}} extent of Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy. It did not become a dictatorship.|$|R

5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, {{and seems to}} refer to intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> resident. It is similar to peregrinus, but the young are even darker than those of anatum.|$|E

5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the {{container}} terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> unclear, but redbacks {{are thought to have}} spread by walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E
5|$|The MTV Video Music Awards <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> the Japanese {{version of}} the MTV Video Music Awards. Initially Japan {{was part of the}} MTV Asia Awards, which were part all Asian countries, but because of the musical variety {{existent}} in Japan, a factor that neighboring countries have not, and in May 2002 began to hold their own awards independently. Mars has received three awards from nine nominations.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{research}} indicates that <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> inhabited {{as early as the}} Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history. From the 12th century until 1868, <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled {{in the name of the}} Emperor.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} competition in Japan and its link to postwar economic prosperity. While Japan's industrial structure and competition policy {{seem to indicate}} that competition in <b>Japan</b> has <b>been</b> less intense, the empirical evidence does not support this conclusion. The sectors in which competition was restricted prove to <b>be</b> those where <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> not internationally successful. In the internationally successful sectors, internal competition in <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> invariably fierce. While the level of competition in <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> currently rising, economic recovery is still hindered by distortions in the competition in many industries. ...|$|R
2500|$|Lee also {{believes}} that <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "motherland of Taiwan", and that Taiwan and <b>Japan</b> <b>were</b> [...] "one country". This belief has sparked much criticism from his political opponents, namely the Pan-Blue Coalition and mainland China.|$|R
5|$|The highest-selling {{albums and}} mini-albums in <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> {{ranked in the}} Oricon Weekly Chart, {{published}} by Oricon Style magazine. American pop singer Madonna is the only Western act to reach number one during 2008 with her eleventh studio album, Hard Candy. It became the singer's first album in 18 years to debut at {{number one on the}} Oricon chart. With the release of their second album, Game, girl group Perfume became the second technopop group (after Yellow Magic Orchestra) to have a number-one album on the charts.|$|E
5|$|These sources {{ensure that}} Chile and <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> the largest {{producers}} of iodine today. Alternatively, the brine may {{be treated with}} silver nitrate to precipitate out iodine as silver iodide, which is then decomposed by reaction with iron to form metallic silver and a solution of iron(II) iodide. The iodine may then be liberated by displacement with chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's timbre and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E
40|$|Climate and Ecosystem Dynamics Division Graduate {{school of}} Bioresources Mie UniversityNegative Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Western Pacific (WP) pattern indices persisted from October through December 2012. For {{the first time}} both the monthly AO and WP were {{negative}} for three consecutive months. Although negative AOs and WPs make Siberia, Eastern Asia, and Japan abnormally cold, <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> warm in October 2012. The temperature of the Sea of <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> a record-breaking high in October 2012. Heating by these very warm waters overwhelmed the cooling effect of the negative AO and WP in October, even though the Sea of <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> small. Linear regression analyses showed that <b>Japan</b> tends to <b>be</b> warm in years when the Sea of <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> warm. Consequently, the temperature over <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> controlled by interannual variations of small-scale oceanic phenomena {{as well as by}} large-scale atmospheric patterns. Previous studies have ignored such small-scale oceanic influences on island temperatures...|$|R
50|$|The key {{development}} for the bombing of <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> the B-29, which had an operational range of 1500 mi; almost 90% of the bombs dropped on the home islands of <b>Japan</b> <b>were</b> delivered by this type of bomber.|$|R
50|$|<b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> ranked sixteenth in {{the world}} by the IFCPF in 2016. The team is also ranked third {{regionally}} in Asia-Oceania. <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> ranked thirteenth in July 2011, September 2012 and November 2014. In August 2013,Japan was ranked fourteenth.|$|R
5|$|The fungus has {{probably}} been introduced elsewhere, often because {{of the use of}} imported mulch used in gardening and landscaping. It may have extended its range northwards into the British Isles or been introduced in the nineteenth century. It now has a mainly southerly distribution in England and has been recorded from Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, the Isle of Wight, Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, and Middlesex. In Scotland, it has been recorded from Argyll. It is also known from Wales, the Channel Islands, and Ireland. The fungus also occurs in the United States (California, Florida, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, and New York), Canada, Mexico, and Australasia. The species was also reported from South America (Argentina). In China, it has been collected from Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Tibet. Records from <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> referable to Clathrus kusanoi; records from the Caribbean are probably of C.crispus.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} <b>Japan</b> <b>are</b> {{located in a}} {{volcanic}} zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over {{hundreds of millions of}} years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene {{as a result of the}} subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{somewhat}} confusing as Mainland <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> defined {{to consist}} of several major islands (Hokkaidō, Honshū, Kyūshū, Shikoku) and many minor ones. The term mainland <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes used to translate Honshū, the largest island, though naichi not.|$|R
50|$|<b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> {{an island}} nation in East Asia {{comprising}} a stratovolcanic archipelago extending along the continent's Pacific coast. It lies between 24° to 46° north latitude and from 123° to 146° east longitude. <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> {{southeast of the}} Russian Far East, separated by the Sea of Okhotsk; slightly east of Korea, separated by the Sea of Japan; and east-northeast of China and Taiwan, separated by the East China Sea. The closest neighboring country to <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> the Russian Federation.|$|R
50|$|The {{period of}} {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century, as far as the game of go in <b>Japan</b> <b>is</b> concerned, is lacking in {{distinguishing}} features. It is short on both technical innovation and outstanding individuals. Some authors, for example John Fairbairn, have suggested that in this era the levels in China and in <b>Japan</b> <b>were</b> quite close, though since <b>Japan</b> <b>was</b> strictly closed this can only be argued on comparison of existing game records in very different styles.|$|R
