500|$|Loughnan's [...] "Crazy Boys" [...] {{highlighted}} the band's larrikin side, with working-class men talking at a hamburger shop; each used local slang or {{spoke in a}} [...] stereotypical ethnic accent, poking fun at Australians {{from a variety of}} backgrounds. At one point [...] "Hey, listen mate, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> 'Gudinskiburger', please, hold the bacon, please" [...] is heard; Michael Gudinski, whose parents are Jewish immigrants, does not eat pork and went along with the joke. Another voice mentions [...] "Dr. Hopontopovus, the Greek gynaecologist". More slang is heard later in the track, including [...] "Who yer sayin’ that to, yer drongo?" ...|$|E
500|$|Hershiser {{had ended}} Padres catcher Benito Santiago's 34-game hitting streak {{the year before}} and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to Tony Gwynn, [...] "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too hard. You {{have to give the}} man credit. He didn't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> decent pitch to hit all night. He put {{everything}} right where he wanted it to go." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> other nod, {{compressed}} the post-office exceedingly, <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> last nod, {{and went}} on with his breakfast.|$|R
60|$|This time he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of his searching looks, {{and it was}} not unmixed with astonishment.|$|R
60|$|Poirot <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> look, which {{conveyed}} a wondering pity, and {{his full}} {{sense of the}} utter absurdity of such an idea.|$|R
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
500|$|Carmella's exit storyline was devised {{months prior}} to Blair's departure. Producers had planned to reunite Carmella and Oliver and have them leave together, however Hoflin decided to go travelling, meaning he was {{unavailable}} for filming. Prior to Hoflin's departure, he and Balir filmed scenes showing their reunion. Scripts were quickly rewritten to portray Oliver in Portugal, where Hoflin was in real life, instead of New York where Oliver left for upon his exit. Describing her reaction to Carmella's scripts towards the end, Blair commented: [...] "After a while I'd open my script and say, 'Please <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> scene where I'm smiling'. And then I'd read the script and think, 'Damn - no smiling scenes again'." [...] Blair had originally hoped that Carmella would be killed on-screen, as she felt a dramatic send off would have been fitting. After the [...] "tragic" [...] final year Carmella underwent, Blair decided she was happy with the exit because [...] "something finally goes right for her". Blair also opined: [...] "It's a really lovely story and I think the fans will be happy with it." [...] Carmella's [...] "happy exit storyline" [...] saw her leaving in a taxi surrounded by all of her friends waving her off, after they convinced her {{to start a new}} life with Oliver.|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was {{performing}} at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing [...] "Basket Case", {{because he believed}} the group's time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen {{in the rear of}} the audience was labeled [...] "1 Minutes Left", saying [...] "You're not gonna <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a [...] "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that [...] "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas" [...] also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't," [...] Hawtrey answered. [...] "She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one,</b> {{but somehow}} it got mislaid on house-cleaning. That's rather an admission, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{raised her}} face all {{streaming}} with tears, all disordered with emotion, and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> appealing look--"False to you!--they {{told me you}} were dead!" ...|$|R
60|$|LORD LOAM. Certainly, certainly. Still, you know, as a peer of the realm--(with dignity)--I think, Ernest, {{you might}} have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of your adventures.|$|R

2500|$|Carpenter cast James Woods as Jack Crow {{because he}} wanted [...] "the vampire slayer to be as savage as the prey he’s after. James Woods {{is the kind of}} guy you'd believe could and would chew off the leg of a vampire." [...] Woods was {{interested}} in doing the film because it was something different for him. Contrary to his reputation, Carpenter didn't find the actor difficult to work with because [...] "we had a deal. He would <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> take as it's written and I would let him improvise...Many of his improvisations were brilliant. When I needed him to be more focused and disciplined, I had the take from the script that was straighter." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I want a kiss," [...] he protested. [...] "You'd have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{the other}} night. You'd have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> {{as many as}} I'd liked. You almost clung to me--that night under the cedar tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of his stern glances; {{you will}} say, perhaps, I {{deserved}} it; but I think the deuce prompts me with teasing questions on some occasions.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{distance}} you have walked to gather lilies, Monica!" [...] I said, approaching her. [...] "Will you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of your stalks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} myself," [...] was the quick response. [...] "I thought Dad {{would be so}} mad that he would <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{everlasting}} licking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one comes}} from Than Kosis without {{carrying}} an order or the password. You must <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{or the other}} before you may pass." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{remember}} how {{soon it was}} I spoke to Geoffrey Dawling; his sittings were irregular, but it was certainly the very next time he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The Countess <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of her serious looks. [...] "Come," [...] she said, [...] "what was it--this famous {{situation}} of yours? I have heard {{you mention it}} before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{replied the}} baker; 'a long {{time has passed}} since I first began to scour this oven with my own flesh. YOU never cared to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a brush; but he has <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>one,</b> and he shall go in peace.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But Lennan's fingers trembled so that {{he could}} hardly light that cigarette. And, {{watching}} them, she said: [...] "Please <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one.</b> Dad doesn't like my smoking." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was here," [...] said Topsy, {{wiping the}} tears from her eyes. [...] "O, Miss Eva, I've been a bad girl; but won't you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one,</b> too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the dearest place I ever saw," [...] said Anne delightedly. [...] "It <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of my old, {{delightful}} funny aches. It's dearer and quainter {{than even}} Miss Lavendar's stone house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he decided, [...] "there's a crack {{some way}} up that should <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a hold, {{and a bit}} of a {{projection}} you could rest a foot on yonder. Then if you <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> hand, I could lower you down." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{have only}} one other {{incident}} to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> more strong card which I can play in due time.|$|R
5000|$|This {{classification}} is {{the most}} severe level of celebrity worship. Often, it is expressed by statements like “If someone <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> thousand dollars, I would consider spending it on a sanitary napkin used by my favorite celebrity.” ...|$|R
