40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that humans need and prefer an optimal level of complexity in the urban environment. Information-theory formulations have been proposed {{as a means of}} evaluating environmental complexity. This paper considers the use of information theory as the basis <b>for</b> treating <b>environmental</b> complexity. Six information-theory concepts are evaluated: unexpectedness, structural complexity, metrical information, redundancy, message, and noise. Their implications and limitations <b>for</b> studying <b>environmental</b> complexity are specified. It is concluded that information theory does not provide a sound basis <b>for</b> studying <b>environmental</b> complexity. ...|$|R

The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand <b>for</b> <b>environmental</b> resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.|$|E
