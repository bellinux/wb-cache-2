40|$|Abstract- The {{reliability}} of mass storage systems, such as optical data recording and Non-Volatile Memory (Flash), is seriously hampered by {{uncertainty of the}} actual value of the offset (drift) or gain (amplitude) of the retrieved signal. The recently introduced minimum Pearson distance detection is immune to unknown offset or gain, but this virtue comes {{at the cost of}} a lessened noise margin at nominal channel conditions. We will present a novel hybrid detection method, where we combine the outputs of the minimum Euclidean distance and Pearson distance detectors so that we may trade detection robustness versus noise margin. We will compute the error performance of hybrid detection in the presence of unknown channel mismatch and additive noise.

40|$|The hard-square model, {{also known}} as the {{two-dimensional}} # 1; 1 #-RLL constraint, consists of all binary arrays in which the 1 's are isolated both horizontally and vertically. Based on a certain probability measure de#ned on those arrays, an e#cient variableto -#xed encoder scheme is presented that maps unconstrained binary words into arrays that satisfy the hard-square model. For su#ciently large arrays, the average rate of the encoder approaches a value which is only 0 : 1 # below the capacity of the constraint. A second, #xed-rate encoder is presented whose rate for large arrays is within 1 : 2 # of the capacityvalue.

40|$|In <b>digital</b> and <b>optical</b> data <b>recording</b> and transmission, {{there will}} be some {{constraints}} on the channel memory. Much researches into the properties (such as channel capacity) of constrained binary channel memories have been done for various particular restrictions on the memory. In this thesis, we will study the capacities of two particular classes of restrictions. They are generalization of the Read/Write Isolated Memory and the two-dimensional run-length constrained system. Our approach for both of these problems will be to first develop the recursive formulas for the transfer matrix corresponding to classes of different restrictions. We will then get the lower and upper bounds on the capacities of the constrained matrices from the recursive formulas. Although recursive structures had been demonstrated for individual constrainted system, they had not been seen as useful for developing bounds on capacities. We will show how, for classes of constraints, the recursive structures can be useful for deriving bounds on the capacities in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{the demand}} for {{high-speed}} data communication and mobile communication has exploded. Thus, {{there is a growing}} need for optical communication systems that convert large volumes of data to optical signals and that accommodate and transmit the signals across long distances. <b>Digital</b> <b>optical</b> communication with these characteristics consists of a master unit (MU) and a slave unit (SU).
