5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been <b>irrevocable.</b> The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E
5|$|During {{the offseason}} that followed, the new Red Sox {{ownership}} (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his {{high level of}} production to date. Believed to be necessary {{in pursuit of a}} trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on <b>irrevocable</b> waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.|$|E
5|$|Reddy served thrice as President of the Indian National Congress at its Bangalore, Bhavnagar and Patna {{sessions}} during 1960 to 1962. At the Congress {{session at}} Goa in 1962, Reddy's speech stating India's determination {{to end the}} Chinese occupation of Indian territory and the <b>irrevocable</b> nature of the liberation of Goa was enthusiastically received by attendees. He was thrice member of the Rajya Sabha. From June 1964, Reddy was Union Minister of Steel and Mines in the Lal Bahadur Shastri government. He also served as Union Minister of Transport, Civil Aviation, Shipping and Tourism from January 1966 to March 1967 in Indira Gandhi's Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost <b>irrevocable.</b> After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 <b>irrevocable</b> losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost <b>irrevocable.</b> After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her <b>irrevocable</b> consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent. Seeking to renew his government's mandate to pass emergency measures, he called an early election {{in which his}} United Party won an increased majority. Huggins rearranged his Cabinet on a war footing, making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well. The territory proposed forces not only for internal security {{but also for the}} defence of British interests overseas. Self-contained Rhodesian formations were planned, including a mechanised reconnaissance unit, but Tredgold opposed this. Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I, he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have <b>irrevocable</b> effects on the country as a whole. He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units, and to disperse the colony's men across the forces in small groups. These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Irrevocable</b> trust: In {{contrast}} to a revocable trust, an <b>irrevocable</b> trust {{is one in which}} the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed. Although in rare cases, a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer, under normal circumstances an <b>irrevocable</b> trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, an {{exception}} is the merchant firm offer rule set out in Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and <b>irrevocable</b> if it is an offer {{to buy or sell}} goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror. Such an offer is <b>irrevocable</b> {{even in the absence of}} consideration. If no time is stated, it is <b>irrevocable</b> for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.|$|E

25|$|Minimize regret of <b>irrevocable</b> choices: At a hippodrome, bettors {{have more}} {{confidence}} after betting on horses they chose {{just before the}} post-time, because that disallows a change of heart; the bettors felt post-decision cognitive dissonance.|$|E

25|$|The Russo-Iranian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 {{resulted}} in large <b>irrevocable</b> territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus, comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which made {{part of the}} very concept of Iran for centuries, and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|A {{joint will}} differs substantively from a mutual will {{in that the}} former is not {{intended}} to be <b>irrevocable</b> or to express a mutual intention; it is merely an administrative convenience. A will may be both joint (on one document) and mutual (see below).|$|E
25|$|The city's decline was not <b>irrevocable,</b> however.

25|$|A {{firm offer}} is an offer that will remain {{open for a}} certain period or until a certain time or {{happening}} of a certain event, during which it is incapable of being revoked.

25|$|La Magicienne has {{not quite}} {{fulfilled}} general expectation. We are stating a fact, not pronouncing a judgment, {{for it is}} impossible to utter a downright and <b>irrevocable</b> opinion at one hearing. Nevertheless, when a grand opera contains beauties of a high order, it rarely happens that some few are not perceptible at once, and for such we sought in vain.|$|E
25|$|When {{hostilities}} {{started with}} El Salvador in June of 1844, Rivera Paz closed the borders {{to prevent an}} invasion using inmates of the state border for these the watch over.

In December 1844, Rivera Paz presented his <b>irrevocable</b> resignation to the Assembly due to the pressure and demands from Rafael Carrera.|$|E
25|$|India {{holds that}} the Instrument of Accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India, signed by Maharaja Hari Singh (erstwhile ruler of the State) on 25 October 1947 and {{executed}} on 27 October 1947 between the ruler of Kashmir and the Governor General of India was a legal act and completely valid {{in terms of the}} Government of India Act (1935), Indian Independence Act (1947) as well as under international law and as such was total and <b>irrevocable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Instrument of Accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India {{was signed}} by Maharaja Hari Singh, {{erstwhile}} ruler, on 25 October 1947 and executed on 27 October 1947 between the ruler of Kashmir and the Governor-General of India.

25|$|At its 2007 convention, the PPD {{approved}} a new philosophy and set of ideals for the party. The new philosophy commits {{the party to}} defending a political status for the island that is based in the <b>irrevocable</b> {{right of the people}} of Puerto Rico to form a sovereign country. This shift in philosophy caused a stir among party detractors, since the PPD was not known for being that liberal before. Its conservative stance had been represented by its unshakable defense of the commonwealth status quo.|$|E
25|$|If Smackout {{proved the}} Jordan-Quinn union's viability, their next {{creation}} proved their most enduring. Amplifying Luke Grey's tall talesmanship to Midwestern braggadocio, Quinn developed Fibber McGee and Molly with Jim as the foible-prone Fibber and Marian playing his patient, common sense, honey-natured wife. The show premiered on NBC April 16, 1935, {{and though it}} took three seasons to become an <b>irrevocable</b> hit, it became the country's top-rated radio series. In 1935, Jim Jordan won the Burlington Liars' Club championship with a story about catching an elusive rat.|$|E
25|$|This {{concerns}} {{itself with}} fiery religious fanaticism stoked {{up by the}} sudden death of a loved one. The idea behind the song is that even the most ardent supporter of peace can be drawn into violent conflict if their faith is shattered beyond repair. The title reflects the onset of spiritual darkness that pervades and eventually clouds the mind through <b>irrevocable</b> grief and irretrievable loss. Without sounding too political, one can draw a parallel with the current clime of terrorism, where normally peaceful religious groups are being incensed to hatred.|$|E
25|$|Hell is {{generally}} {{defined as the}} eternal fate of unrepentant sinners after this life. Hell's character is inferred from biblical teaching, which has often been understood literally. Souls are said to pass into Hell by God's <b>irrevocable</b> judgment, either immediately after death (particular judgment) or in the general judgment. Modern theologians generally describe Hell as the logical consequence of the soul using its free will to reject the will of God. It is considered compatible with God's justice and mercy because God will {{not interfere with the}} soul's free choice.|$|E
25|$|In 1813, {{following}} the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813, Qajar Iran {{was forced to}} sign the Treaty of Gulistan with Russia, which provided for the <b>irrevocable</b> cession of Baku and most of Iran's territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828, Baku was briefly recaptured by the Iranians. However, militarily superior, the Russians ended this war in a victory as well, and the resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay made its inclusion into the Russian Empire definite.|$|E
