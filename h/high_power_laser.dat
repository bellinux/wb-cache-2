25|$|Almost any laser active {{gain medium}} can be pumped to produce gain for {{light at the}} {{wavelength}} of a laser made with the same material as its gain medium.

The effects of heat sink geometry, ceramics size on the junction temperature of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> diode <b>laser</b> packages have been analyzed. Based on the simulations, heat dissipation capability of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> diode <b>laser</b> packages is improved and compact conduction-cooled diode laser array packages with 3 bars and 5 bars are fabricated. The power ∼ current and spectrum of the optimized <b>high</b> <b>power</b> diode <b>laser</b> array packages at different operation parameters are characterized at different pulse widths, repetition frequencies and TEC temperatures. The effects of temperature on the output power and spectrum are discussed. The lifetime test of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> diode <b>laser</b> array packages is also performed.

25|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} is an additive rapid manufacturing technique {{that uses a}} <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>laser</b> to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part {{on the surface of}} a powder bed. Selective {{laser sintering}} was invented and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Filamentation also {{refers to}} the self-focusing of a <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>laser</b> pulse. At high powers, the {{nonlinear}} part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction {{in the center of}} the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be micrometers to kilometers in length. One interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to defocusing effects of the ionised electrons. (See also Filament propagation) ...|$|E
