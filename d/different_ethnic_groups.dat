5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of <b>different</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E

5|$|An English {{cultural}} identity first {{emerged from the}} interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano-British inhabitants. Although early medieval chroniclers described the immigrants as Angles and Saxons, they came from a much wider area across Northern Europe, and represented a range of <b>different</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> Over the 6th century, however, these different groups began to coalesce into stratified societies across England, roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century. By the 9th century, the term the Angelcynn was being officially used to refer to a single English people, and promoted for propaganda purposes by chroniclers and kings to inspire resistance to the Danish invasions.|$|E
5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from <b>different</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, {{with a high}} level of investment, has led the country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between <b>different</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the development of <b>ethnic</b> identity among <b>different</b> Black <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> in the United States. The three <b>different</b> Black <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> that will be investigated are: 1) African immigrants, 2) African-Americans, and 3) Diasporic African immigrants (Caribbean, Afro-Brazilian, etc.). These groups were selected because they broadly encompass {{the bulk of the}} range of people of African ancestry in the United States amalgamated under the term “Black. ” Through thematic analysis of in-depth interviews, this project explores the impacts of immigration status, discrimination and inter-group relations (between <b>different</b> Black <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups)</b> on the ways that members of <b>different</b> Black <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> form their <b>ethnic</b> identities. This analysis reveals that place, ethnic pride, and inter-and intra-racial relationships all affect the ethnic identity development process differently across Black <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ethiopia is a polyethnic nation {{consisting}} of 80 <b>different</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> and 84 indigenous languages. Due to the diverse population {{and rural areas}} throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution. Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue {{had come to the}} forefront of political debate. Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates. The Derg military government took control with a Marxist–Leninist ideology, urging self-determination and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues. In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the USSR broke apart, they lost their aid from the Soviet Union and the Derg government collapsed. Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a federal parliamentary republic. It was still impossible to create a central government holding all power, so the government was torn. The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish their own government and democracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} sides began {{bringing in}} reinforcements to the Kupres Plateau on 5 March to strengthen positions held around individual settlements populated by <b>different</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> communications between those positions, and roads leading {{away from the}} plateau {{to the north and}} south. Different parts of the town of Kupres were controlled by the opposing forces, while the adjacent territory surrounding the town was controlled by the Bosnian Croat TO. In turn, that territory was surrounded by Bosnian Serb TO-held territory. By the end of the month, the bulk of the civilians living in the area were evacuated. On 2 April, negotiations to defuse the situation failed while the reinforcements continued to arrive. The battle commenced the next day. In Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO achieved minor territorial gains on 4–5 April, before the JNA managed to advance to the outskirts of the town the next day. The JNA entered Kupres in the afternoon of 7 April and in the next few days, it successfully drove the Croatian forces from the plateau. The breakthrough came about after the infantry originally deployed to the battle was reinforced by an armoured battalion deployed from Knin.|$|E
