5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare {{and published by}} Microsoft Studios exclusively for the Xbox. It was first released in North America in October 2003, and in Europe in November 2003. It was re-released worldwide on the Xbox 360 as a downloadable Xbox Live Originals title in February 2009, before being removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> in June 2015. However, it was later released {{as part of the}} compilation Rare Replay for Xbox One. The game follows a young boy, Cooper Chance, who sets out to rescue his girlfriend from a mansion haunted by supernatural creatures.|$|E
5|$|Maloin {{calls to}} the butcher's and drags Henriette <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> against her will and over the protestations of the butcher's wife (Kati Lázár). He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, {{revealing}} that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home {{to the consternation of}} Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{revealed}} at E3 2003, with a playable demo being a mostly complete {{version of the}} game, albeit with a few levels missing. Grabbed by the Ghoulies was released in North America on 21 October 2003, in Europe on 21 November 2003 and in Japan on 29 April 2004, becoming Rare's first game to be released under Microsoft. It was later re-released as an Xbox Originals game for the Xbox 360 on 16 February 2009, later being removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> on 16 June 2015. At Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference, the compilation title Rare Replay was unveiled. Rare Replay has a selection of thirty games from Rare's lifetime game library, including Grabbed by the Ghoulies. The game was remastered to run natively on the Xbox One, increasing its resolution and framerate relative to the original Xbox release.|$|E

25|$|Downloaded songs {{come with}} song {{information}} (name, artist, album) already filled out, though iTunes provides a free service by Gracenote {{to do this}} for songs not purchased <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> although they must be imported with iTunes. Songs that have an entry in iTunes Store also come with album artwork (Artwork is embedded in the metadata). Artwork can be obtained for songs not purchased <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> for free if the user has an iTunes Store account. Purchased songs do not come with lyrics, nor does iTunes provide a service for acquiring the missing lyrics. However, several third-party applications exist to locate and automatically add lyrics to the user's music.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 2011, the North Fork Creek, part {{of which}} runs beneath the Lehman's store, overflowed its banks, flash {{flooding}} the store. The 50-year flood was caused by thawing temperatures, an ice and snow pack that clogged a five-foot culvert that drained water away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> site, and a storm that brought 1/2 inch of rain in less than 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Early campaigns {{were focused}} on Disney, Starbucks, Walmart, chain stores, and sweatshops. In one early action, Talen and his {{associates}} pretended to be shopping at the store and talking on non-functional cell phones, carrying on increasingly loud conversations about the evils of Disney and its products. Once the ruse was discovered, Reverend Billy began preaching to the actual consumers until the police removed him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, Richards {{established}} the Spade Ranch's cattle shipping point in Ellsworth, southwest of the Spade Ranch. In 1898, Richards and Cairnes, Inc., built a store, hotel, and stockyards in the small community. The store served as office headquarters for the Spade Ranch and included a general store and post office. The hotel built across the street <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> provided free accommodations for the Spade Ranch cowboys.|$|E
25|$|The {{programming}} language {{to be employed}} by users was akin to modern day assembly languages. Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been Turing-complete as later defined by Alan Turing. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for {{the three types of}} cards.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, {{there is a chance}} that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the cash register which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> owner.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Very low density lipoproteins were {{isolated}} from fresh and from 6 -month old eggs laid by hens fed a diet containing crude cottonseed oil. There {{were no differences}} between the very low density lipoproteins isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fresh and those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> eggs in <b>the</b> percentage of lipid extracted by ether after the action of unfolding agents, detergents, reducing agents, trypsin, Pronase, or phospholipase D. Phospholipase C released less lipid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> very low density lipoproteins of <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> eggs than <b>from</b> those of <b>the</b> fresh unless they were extracted with ether before digestion, when equal amounts were extracted. Very low density lipoproteins isolated from fresh eggs and those isolated from stored eggs contained similar percentages of lipid. The very low density lipoproteins <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> eggs had lower isoelectric points than those from fresh eggs, {{but there were no}} differences in average size when determined by electron microscopy. Egg yolk very low density lipoproteins are normally quite stable in water solution, but those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> eggs showed evidence of some decomposition during prolonged ultracentrifugation in water solution in contrast to those from fresh eggs...|$|R

25|$|Meier {{was born}} in Portland to German {{immigrants}} of Jewish ancestry: Aaron, a merchant and founder of Oregon's largest department store, Meier & Frank, and Jeannette (Hirsch) Meier. He had three siblings, and {{was the father of}} Jean Ellen Meier Ehrman Reichert, Elsa Frances Meier Ganz, and Julius L. (Jack) Meier, Jr. He married Grace Mayer on Christmas Day, 1901, saying afterwards that it was the only day that he was allowed off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some Waitrose stores {{incorporate}} {{an in-house}} restaurant selling {{hot and cold}} food sourced in the main <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> The myWaitrose card, which customers can obtain online, offers one free medium-size cup of tea or coffee to the cardholder per day. It is apparent that some visitors to the restaurant {{use it as a}} convenient place for a social or business meeting without necessarily purchasing at the store. Other Waitrose outlets have a Costa facility operated as a franchise from the parent company Whitbread.|$|E
25|$|Five Nights at Freddy's {{was first}} {{released}} via Desura on August 8, 2014.

A port for Android was released on August 27, 2014, via Google Play Store. On September 11, 2014, an iOS port was released. A Windows Phone version was published on December 5, 2014, though it was quickly removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> on December 10 due to the port's down-scaled graphical appearance.|$|E

25|$|Video content {{available}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> {{used to be}} encoded as 540kbit/s Protected MPEG-4 video (H.264) with an approximately 128kbit/s AAC audio track. Many {{videos and}} video podcasts require {{the latest version of}} QuickTime, QuickTime 7, which is incompatible with older versions of Mac OS (only v10.3.9 and later are supported). On September 12, 2006, the resolution of video content sold on the iTunes Store was increased from 320×240 (QVGA) to 640×480 (VGA). The higher resolution video content is encoded as 1.5 Mbit/s (minimum) Protected MPEG-4 video (H.264) with a minimum 128kbit/s AAC audio track.|$|E
25|$|One of Bligh's first actions {{was to use}} the colony's {{stores and}} herds to provide relief to farmers who had been {{severely}} affected by flooding on the Hawkesbury River, a situation that had disrupted the barter economy in the colony. Supplies were divided up according to those most in need and provisions were made for loans to be drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> based on capacity to repay. This earned Bligh the gratitude of the farmers but the enmity of traders in the Corps who had been profiting greatly from the situation.|$|E
25|$|Refusing {{to listen}} to Drayton, Norton heads outside {{with a small group}} to seek help, only to be {{attacked}} and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on and attach themselves to the windows. Moments later, pterodactyl-like animals ram their beaks into the glass, eventually breaking through the windows and allowing the creatures to enter the supermarket. They begin to attack the terrified people inside and kill Sally, a cashier <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching even more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors.|$|E
