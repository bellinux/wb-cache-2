25|$|The {{process whereby}} {{the human body}} {{responds}} to extended stress is known as <b>general</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (GAS). After the initial fight-or-flight response, the body becomes more resistant to stress {{in an attempt to}} dampen the sympathetic nervous response and return to homeostasis. During this period of resistance, physical and mental symptoms of CSR may be drastically reduced as the body attempts to cope with the stress. Long combat involvement, however, may keep the body from homeostasis and thereby deplete its resources and render it unable to normally function, sending it into the third stage of GAS: exhaustion. Sympathetic nervous activation remains in the exhaustion phase and reactions to stress are markedly sensitized as fight-or-flight symptoms return. If the body remains in a state of stress, then such more severe symptoms of CSR as cardiovascular and digestive involvement may present themselves. Extended exhaustion can permanently damage the body.|$|E

It is shown that at the initial period of stress and before spawning the protective functions in fish are enhanced which relates to the <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome.</b> However, during the initial period of stress the damaging effects prevail over the adaptive processes resulting in the decrease {{in the level of}} resistance (“alarm reaction” according to Selye). In contrary, during pre-spawning period protective systems dominate along with enhancement of <b>general</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndromes.</b> This facilitates the increase in the level of resistance in the parental fish (“resistance stage” according to Selye). Before the spawning the alarm stage is not manifested. The state comparable to strong stress occurs in the parental fish only during the spawning. This state is accompanied by decrease in the resistance of organism in spawner evidencing exhaustion of protective functions (“exhaustion stage” according to Selye). With time, both at stress and after spawning, within two to three weeks period, the physiological-biochemical parameters recover and stabilize with the normal limits...|$|R

50|$|Physiologists define stress as how {{the body}} reacts to a stressor, real or imagined, a {{stimulus}} that causes stress. Acute stressors affect an organism {{in the short}} term; chronic stressors over the longer term. The <b>general</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (GAS), developed by Hans Selye, is a profile of how organisms respond to stress; GAS is characterized by three phases: a nonspecific mobilization phase, which promotes sympathetic nervous system activity; a resistance phase, during which the organism makes efforts {{to cope with the}} threat; and an exhaustion phase, which occurs if the organism fails to overcome the threat and depletes its physiological resources.|$|E
5000|$|These {{organs and}} their {{interactions}} constitute the HPA axis, a major neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress and regulates many body processes, including digestion, the immune system, mood and emotions, sexuality, and energy storage and expenditure.

5000|$|His last {{inspiration}} for <b>general</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (GAS, {{a theory of}} stress) came from an endocrinological experiment in which he injected mice with extracts of various organs.

This, paired with his observation that people with different diseases exhibit similar symptoms, led to {{his description of the}} effects of [...] "noxious agents" [...] as he at first called it.

5000|$|Interest in the {{relationship}} between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.Claude Bernard, a French physiologist of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, formulated the concept of the milieu interieur in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state: [...] "... there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism" [...] (Bernard, 1865). Walter Cannon, a professor of physiology at Harvard University coined the commonly used term, homeostasis, in his book The Wisdom of the Body, 1932, from the Greek word homoios, meaning similar, and stasis, meaning position. In his work with animals, Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as anxiety, distress, or rage, was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage, 1915). These studies looked into {{the relationship}} between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system, namely the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses that initiated the recognition of the freeze, fight or flight response. His findings were published {{from time to time in}} professional journals, then summed up in book form in The Mechanical Factors of Digestion, published in 1911.Hans Selye, a student of Johns Hopkins University and McGill University, and a researcher at Université de Montréal, experimented with animals by putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these difficult conditions the body consistently adapted to heal and recover.

Results: it is stated that swimming and epinephrine administration causes increasing of crystallogenic activity of rats’ blood serum. This trend is more pronounced for the first impact. In addition, both factors increase the degree of destruction of elements of the sample. Maximal elevation of facia destruction degree was fixed for the administration of epinephrine.
