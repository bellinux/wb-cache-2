5000|$|One of Dorothy's {{specialties}} {{during her}} performance was the <b>outside</b> <b>loop,</b> which she learned from Tex Rankin. She {{became the first}} woman to perform this maneuver on June 30, 1930. [...] Later that year at the Omaha Air Show, she set a world record for flying 56 inverted snap rolls as well as 69 consecutive <b>outside</b> <b>loops,</b> 62 of which were deemed perfectly rounded by observers from the National Aeronautic Association (NAA). Her record of 62 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> remained unbroken until July 13, 1989, when it was broken at the North Bend (Ore.) Air Show by stunt pilot Joann Osterud. Stenzel had encouraged Osterud to break the record.|$|R

The procedure for solving the nonlinear equations for coal quality applies the inner loop iteration of dry ash-free basis of S (Sdaf) and <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> iteration of dry ash-free basis of N (Ndaf) within a limited range, and dry ash-free basis of C (Cdaf) is searched from the entire range during <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> iteration. The upper and lower limits of Ndaf are defined according to the NOX content in the exhaust gas, thereby solving the iterative initial value selection problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via several simulations and comparisons, the results show that this method is credible and effective and it can be used in power plant for control system optimization...|$|R

40|$|Reducing {{memory accesses}} is {{particularly}} important for DSP applications since they are widely used in embedded systems {{and need to be}} executed with high performance and low power consumption. In this paper, we focus on optimizing loops which are the most critical sections for DSP applications. We propose a machine-independent intermediate-code-level loop memory access optimization technique, REALM (REdundAnt Load Exploration & Migration), to explore hidden redundant loads and migrate them <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> based on loop-carried data dependence analysis. In REALM, we first build up a data-flow graph to describe the inter-iteration data dependencies among memory operations. Then we perform code transformation by exploiting these de-pendencies with registers to hold the values of unnecessary loads and migrating these loads <b>outside</b> <b>loops.</b> Dif-ferent from the previous work based on data-flow-analysis, our data-flow-graph-based approach is easy to be implemented and more suitable for optimizing loop kernels of DSP applications that have simple control-flow structure. We implement our technique into the IMPACT compiler [24] and conduct experiments using a set of benchmarks from DSPstone [28] on the cycle-accurate VLIW simulator of Trimaran [1]. The experimental results show that our technique significantly reduces the number of memory accesses. ...|$|R

For correct implementation, this technique must be used with loop inversion, because not all code is safe to be hoisted <b>outside</b> the <b>loop.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It {{was at an}} airshow on July 13, 1989 in North Bend, Oregon, that Joann did set {{her first}} world flight record, flying 208 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> in her Sorrell Biplane Supernova. The plane was 21 feet long with a 23 foot wingspan, and topped out at 170 MPH. It had a 230 {{horsepower}} engine and a nitrous oxide injection system for an extra boost. Osterud modified it with straps to hold her feet to the pedals, and she trained for the time upside down with a special harness that allowed her to hang upside down {{for long periods of}} time. Previous record holder Dorothy Stenzel set the record of 62 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> in 1931 and, after seeing Joann perform at an airshow, encouraged her to break her record. Stenzel commented to Sports Illustrated “I believed it was well past time the record was broken… She’s a smooth flyer and I didn’t think she’d tear her wings off.” [...] The 208 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> took her 2 hours, 4 minutes, 38 seconds, and not only broke Stenzel’s record of 62 <b>outside</b> <b>loops,</b> but also the unofficial men’s record of 180 <b>outside</b> <b>loops,</b> which was set by Hal McClain in the 1980s. Osterud also used the record breaking stunt to raise money for United Way of Southeastern Oregon, allowing people to sponsor individual loops. She raised $1364.67, and would have quit at 200 loops, but one of her favorite Eagles songs was playing, so she kept going. Osterud next set two records at once on July 24, 1991, for both the longest flight upside down and the longest flight upside down in one stretch, flying for 4 hours and 38 minutes over 658 miles in her Ultimate 10-300S biplane between Vancouver BC and Vanderhoof BC. [...] She was scheduled to perform in the 1990 Vanderhoof Air Show, so decided to try her hand at breaking ’s 1933 record. She had previously attempted the flight in 1990, but had to end the flight early due to an engine oil leak. Burcham flew 4 hours, 5 minutes, 22 seconds flying upside down from Long Beach to San Diego and back in a Boeing 100 where he had inverted the engine. [...] The records were part publicity stunt for the Vanderhoof Air Show, partly to fundraise for the Canadian Air Cadets, and also to prove that she could do it. [...] Osterud upgraded her biplane with six fuel tanks, specialized oil and electrical systems, special seat belts and also drinking tubes, the last two for making the long flight more comfortable for her. She had the same problems she always did with her body on her inverted flights: painful leg cramps, facial swelling, eyes swelling, and head congestion. During the record-setting flight, she was accompanied by five other planes, including an official observer from the Canadian Federation Aeronautique Internationale and another to navigate for her. [...] "The world looks real weird upside down," [...] she said. [...] "The normal points of reference just aren't there." [...] As of 1991, she was flying 20-25 airshows a year as well as flying for United Airlines, and compared {{the difference between the two}} types of planes as [...] "the difference between driving a Cadillac and riding a dirt bike." ...|$|R
