Usually this act {{takes the form of a}} full <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and therefore a full substitution of the delegatee for the delegator. There is thus a new contract with a new debtor.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the role}} of credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) during the 2010 – 11 EU sovereign debt crisis is assessed. It is concluded that rating agencies lag behind markets, that their business model is flawed, and {{that the lack of}} competition renders the big three CRAs with too strong a market position. The reliance on CRAs should be reduced by attaching less importance to them in prudential regulation and accounting standards. At the same time, more competition and transparency is needed to increase the quality of ratings. Finally, several policy options to change the ratings industry are discussed, including the creation of a network <b>of</b> small CRAs, <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> ratings to the European Central Bank or the creation of a European rating agency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} monetary regimes and public debt management. The analysis shows that <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> monetary policy to an independent central bank is more effective in containing inflationary expectations than the use of foreign currency or price-indexed <b>debt.</b> If <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> monetary policy is viable, the optimal policy is to issue conventional debt so as {{to reduce the cost}} of supply shocks and thus the need for policy accommodation. The role <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> management changes in a fixed exchange regime, since foreign currency debt may enhance the credibility of the peg. However, if a crisis nevertheless materialises, it would be worse than had foreign debt not been issued. Empirical evidence on the EMS appears to support this result. Probit estimates show that the decision to issue foreign currency debt significantly reduced the likelihood of an official realignment within the ERM. However, conditional on a crisis taking place, those countries that increased the share <b>of</b> foreign currency <b>debt</b> experienced larger devaluation sizes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe main aim {{of access}} control models {{is to provide}} means to simplify the {{management}} of the security policy, which is a fastidious and error-prone task. Supporting delegation is considered as an important mean to decentralize the administration and therefore to allow security policy to be more flexible and easier to manipulate. Our main contribution is the proposition of a unified model to the administration and <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> obligations. Managing such delegations implies more requirements than managing traditional privileges delegation. In fact, the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> obligations may include two interpretations: the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> the obligation and the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> the responsibility related to this obligation. Moreover, since delegating an obligation involves the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> sanctions, then the consent of the user who receives this delegation may be required in some cases.
