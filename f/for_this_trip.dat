While this exhibit was progressing, the Altoona Works were busy again building a replica; {{this time the}} replica was an operable copy of the locomotive. The replica was then operated in 1940 at the New York World's Fair, while the original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned to the Smithsonian.|$|E

Chosen from 9,000 applicants, eight adventurers flew to Baffin Island, Canada, where {{they made an}} attempt to track polar bears across the pack ice, riding on husky sleds.

25|$|In 1928, {{after leaving}} Dunedin, Anscombe {{embarked}} on a longer world trip accompanied by his two daughters now aged 29 and 17 years. They left <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> in early March 1928 and travelled to the Middle East (Egypt, Greece, Palestine, and Turkey), Britain (England, and Ireland), and Europe (Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland) concluding the journey in America before returning to New Zealand via Honolulu and Suva. The Dominion reports the group's recent return in April 1929. On this trip, Anscombe seemed particularly interested in architecture, city and street planning, {{and the use of}} lighting at night time. While they were abroad Anscombe's father died on 8 August 1928 at Ashburton at the Tuarangi Home for old men.|$|E
25|$|As the 1920s unfurled, Coates faced {{competition}} at home from an emerging generation of British tenors led by Walter Widdop and Heddle Nash. He toured overseas energetically and in 1925 {{he made his}} only extended tour of North America, including Canada {{as well as the}} United States on his itinerary. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> his usual partner on the piano, Berkeley Mason, was not available. Instead, he found Gerald Moore, then a young accompanist {{at the beginning of his}} career. Moore had often heard Coates' recitals at Chelsea Town Hall, but it was through the Australian baritone Peter Dawson (with whom Moore had toured) that the contact came. Once the contact was made, Moore became Coates' sole accompanist for four or five years. Moore devotes a chapter of his memoirs to Coates. He found the tenor a hard taskmaster, but one who transformed him from a mediocre accompanist to an artist with a full realisation of the duties and possibilities of the accompanist's role, aware of the necessity of being a full participant in every living nuance and accent of the music at hand. Moore considered that Coates had laid the groundwork of whatever was truly excellent in his work. Indeed, Coates had told him that the American tour would 'kill or cure' him, and considered the result a 'cure'. The Coates-Moore partnership eventually dissolved over a rehearsal-fees' disagreement, though any cracks in the friendship were repaired by 1929.|$|E

As Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar explain in their history of Himalayan mountaineering, the Workmans despised the local porters but were forced to recruit them; [...] "their otherwise invaluable books read like one long, anguished harangue against the lazy, lying, thieving, mutinous cheats on whom they unhappily depended for local support".

The BSA began expanding the Negro Scouting program: by 1927 thirty-two communities in the south had [...] "colored troops", with twenty-six troops in Louisville, Kentucky. The junior assistant Scoutmaster position was created in 1926 and Eagle Palms were added in 1927. [...] Boys' Life promoted a photo safari to Africa for three Scouts in 1928. [...] The three Scouts, Robert Douglas, David Martin, and Douglas Oliver, wrote the book Three Boy Scouts in Africa upon their return as part of their requirement of being selected <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> with Martin and Osa Johnson, American photographers known for their African safari movies and photographs. Later in 1928, a trip to the Antarctic with Commander Byrd was promoted and Eagle Scout Paul Siple was selected for the expedition. [...] Hillcourt wrote the first Patrol Leader Handbook, published in 1929. [...] The Silver Wolf was presented to Beard and Mortimer L. Schiff.

2500|$|With the {{situation}} still unresolved, Mugabe {{embarked on a}} trip to the United Nations on 19 September; the MDC complained that he did not swear in Tsvangirai before leaving <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> which was expected to last at least a week. Vice-President Joseph Msika was responsible for handling Mugabe's duties while {{he was out of the}} country. Chamisa said that Mugabe was unwilling to leave the country in Tsvangirai's hands during his absence. A column in The Herald on 20 September belittled the agreement, saying that Mugabe remained free to appoint a Cabinet of his choosing and was only required to consult with the Prime Minister; it also said that the agreement could [...] "collapse any day". Aside from this, Tsvangirai expressed concern regarding the stark and bitter language in the column (which was generally believed to have been written by Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba, under the pen name Nathaniel Manheru), describing it as hateful. One passage in the column seemed to suggest violence, saying that an audit of land reform, as provided by the agreement, would [...] "draw blood redder than the setting sun." [...] Although Tsvangirai emphasised that he did not think the column's writer was expressing Mugabe's views, he said that if the column reflected ZANU-PF's attitude, the agreement was already doomed.|$|E

DeNovo, the mission revealed a strong belief in the free market for the regulation of international trade, analyzed obstacles to U.S. business in the Middle East, and revealed a vision of expanded U.S. involvement in Middle-East affairs. DeNovo also claims that the Culbertson reports were [...] "taken seriously by those charting American economic policies." ...|$|R
