However, he had {{effective}} political control over the government {{even though he was}} not himself the monarch, the first time this had happened in English history. Montfort successfully held a parliament in London in June 1264 to confirm new constitutional arrangements for England; four knights were summoned from each county, chosen by the county court, and were allowed to comment on <b>general</b> <b>matters</b> of state – the first time this had occurred. Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory at Lewes, however, and widespread disorder persisted across the country. In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis.|$|E

25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other <b>general</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|E

We here extend the monopole / vortex matching analysis, to theories with <b>general</b> <b>matter</b> electric charges. We verify, for <b>general</b> <b>matter</b> content, that the spin and other quantum {{numbers of the}} chiral monopole operators match those of corresponding BPS vortex states, {{at the top and}} bottom of the tower associated with quantizing the vortices’ Fermion zero modes. There are associated subtleties from non-normalizable Fermi zero modes, which contribute non-trivially to the BPS vortex spectrum and monopole operator matching; a proposed interpretation is further discussed here...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that market access issues {{associated}} {{with the question of}} the optimal mandate of the World Trade Organization should be separated from nonmarket access issues. We identify race-to-the-bottom and regulatory-chill concerns as market access issues and suggest that the WTO should address these concerns. We then describe ways that WTO principles and procedures might be augmented to do so. As for nonmarket access issues, {{we argue that}} as a <b>general</b> <b>matter</b> these are best handled outside the WTO, and that, while implicit links might be encouraged, explicit links between the WTO and other labor and environmental organizations should not as a <b>general</b> <b>matter</b> be forged. We view this as a measured approach to labor and the environment within the WTO...|$|R

2500|$|In <b>general</b> <b>matters,</b> however, section 74 did {{not prevent}} the Privy Council from {{granting}} leave to appeal against the High Court's wishes and the Council did so often. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles (for example, in Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren (1967), or in Viro v The Queen (1978)), by using a legal fiction that stated that different common law can apply to different circumstances. However, in other cases, the Privy Council enforced English decisions, over-ruling decisions by the High Court. In Parker v The Queen (1963), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment that rejected a precedent of the House of Lords in DPP v Smith saying, [...] "I shall not depart from the law on this matter as we have long since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith's case {{should not be used}} in Australia as authority at all"; the following year the Privy Council upheld an appeal, applying the House of Lords precedent.|$|E
