5|$|It was {{initially}} thought that Tillingbourne would {{be sold to}} another operator, with four companies reported to be interested. However, by early April 2001, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this would not take place, as the offers submitted were lower than {{the value of the}} vehicles owned by the company.|$|E

5|$|The Stokes Mortar {{was rapidly}} {{developed}} when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{some type of}} weapon was needed to provide artillery-like fire support to the infantry. The weapon was fully man-transportable yet also capable of firing reasonably powerful shells at targets beyond the range of rifle grenades.|$|E

5|$|The {{speculation}} of {{the existence}} of life on Venus decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying Venus and <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the conditions on Venus are extreme compared to those on Earth.|$|E
5|$|When <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Xangsane would {{approach}} the Capital, PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on September 28. All the storm signals were discontinued later that day.|$|E
5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any of the}} other homicides, and only became interested in this one when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{announced}} {{they would be}} working to preserve the railways and ferries, and in 2008 <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the directorate was working with an application for the Rjukan Line, the Tinnoset Line and the ferries {{to be included in}} a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the closed plants in Rjukan and Odda.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Auschwitz was not {{a normal}} {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews {{was not a}}ctually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this had included the transport of prisoners who had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|Orders for {{the bodies}} of the previously-deceased members of the {{household}} to be exhumed were issued when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> arsenic was the mechanism of Thomas Higgins's death. The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration – a quality associated with arsenic poisoning – and traces of arsenic were found in the remains of all three.|$|E

5|$|The entire theatre {{staff was}} laid off in December 1996 once <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Brars were seriously {{considering}} purchasing the theatre, and the theatre’s projectionists began {{what would be a}} six-month strike when it became clear the Brars would not respect a recently signed two-year contract with the Old Strathcona Foundation.|$|E
5|$|To {{members of}} the WFM, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{government}} favored the companies, and only direct action by organized workers could secure the eight-hour day for themselves. When miners in Idaho Springs and Telluride decided to strike for the eight-hour day, they were rounded up at gunpoint by vigilante groups and expelled from their communities. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the law-breaking vigilantes, {{but they were not}} acted upon.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{attempted}} {{to defuse the}} discussion when he announced on December 15 {{that he would be}} returning for his fourth year with the team. But in late December, Vick wavered on that decision when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> if he left the team, he would be selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. Heading into the Gator Bowl, his decision was still up in the air.|$|E

5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} to be no {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Ulysses S. Grant would be the Republican candidate, this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the public {{was interested in the}} animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E

5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's Air Intake Control Units (AICUs) {{made use}} of a digital {{processor}} to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control. It was the world's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft. It {{was developed by the}} Electronics and Space Systems (ESS) division of the British Aircraft Corporation after <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the analogue AICUs fitted to the prototype aircraft and developed by Ultra Electronics were found to be insufficiently accurate for the tasks in hand.|$|E
5|$|Gill {{played in}} almost every game after the League Cup Final until Francis left the club the {{following}} October, but lost his place soon afterwards through injury. Though he did then receive a League Cup runners-up medal: club secretary Alan Jones had kept a spare one back, which he presented to Gill after Francis left. Under new manager Steve Bruce he played only one game, a 3–0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup-tied, and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
