5|$|On {{their way}} home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for {{the night at the}} country estate of the Palmers, who live five and a half miles away from Willoughby's estate. Marianne cannot resist <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> estate; she becomes gravely ill {{trekking}} up a hill in a torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she was no longer convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy.|$|E
25|$|Eugenia {{is talking}} and flirting with Robert Acton; {{she says she}} will divorce her husband. She visits Mrs Acton and says a white lie – that her son {{has been talking about}} her a lot – which comes across as a terrible faux-pas. Later, Mr Wentworth tells Felix that Clifford got {{suspended}} from Harvard owing to his drinking problem, and that he is improperly in love with Lizzie Acton – Felix suggests fixing him up with Eugenia instead. Later still, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry Mr Brand, though she doesn't love him. Mr Brand then criticises Felix. Gertrude emotionally blackmails Charlotte into keeping him from talking to her, lest she tell him Charlotte likes him. Clifford then visits Eugenia. Robert Acton goes to the Wentworths' but Eugenia is not in their house; he goes into hers and asks her about the divorce note and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Niagara Falls with him. Clifford comes out of his hiding place; the two men get back together.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to subdue}} the Ottomans militarily, Njegoš {{concentrated}} on eliminating {{those who had}} betrayed him and his clan. Several weeks after the insurrection was crushed, he informed Božović that he had forgiven him and gave him his word {{that he and his}} two brothers would not be harmed if they returned to Cetinje. The two sides arranged to meet in a small village just outside the town. Instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> brothers, Njegoš sent several henchmen to meet them on his behalf. The Božovićes were arrested and executed by firing squad; their bodies were put on public display as a warning against further insubordination. In early November, Plamenac was shot to death by a fellow Montenegrin in Ottoman-held territory. The assassin was arrested by the Ottomans, and hanged in Scutari. Njegoš posthumously awarded him an Obilić Medal. Osman Pasha soon incited a second revolt; it was also suppressed and Njegoš had all the rebels shot. He then sent an assassin to Scutari in a failed attempt to have Osman Pasha killed. Osman Pasha subsequently sent a number of his own assassins to kill Njegoš, who survived several attempted poisonings and an attempted bombing of his headquarters. By 1848, the situation on Montenegro's southern border had stabilized.|$|E

25|$|Gentle {{makes it}} to the top of the palace where he {{encounters}} the Autarch, who reveals that Gentle is the Maestro Sartori, who led the failed effort to reconcile the dominions 200 years before. <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Pivot, Gentle is told that he has to make another attempt at reconciliation. Through explanation by the Autarch and a vision he witnesses, the true events of what happened 200 years before are finally revealed. As Sartori, he was in love with Judith, the lover of Joshua Godolphin, and was able to convince Joshua to let him create a replica of her through magic. During the long process of replicating her however, he got drunk and went into the circle that she was being replicated in, and made love to her. This resulted in a replica of himself being created as well. Once the reconciliation failed, the replica of Sartori left to the dominions and eventually became the ruler of them as the Autarch. The original Judith became his queen, Quaisoir, while the replica, the Judith we've come to know throughout the book, remained on Earth, bound to the Godolphin family. Sartori convinced Pie to cast a feit on him that caused him to continuously lose his memory of the event. The Autarch wants Gentle to join him as he goes to conquer the Fifth Dominion but Gentle refuses. While fleeing, Pie comes across the Autarch, and attacks Gentle when he arrives. Although Gentle is able to convince Pie that it's the real him, the Autarch (referred to from this point on through the rest of the book as 'Sartori') attacks Pie, mortally wounding him, then escapes.|$|E

500|$|April 15, 2008, was the 61st {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Over 330 team members wore number 42, {{more than the}} over 240 last year.

All players wore number 42 at games including the Washington Nationals' game at the New York Mets, Pittsburgh's game at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Angels' game at the Texas Rangers. The Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays also wore number 42, increasing the total to nine teams.

500|$|The bitter {{divisions}} within the Cabinet continued, with Diefenbaker deliberating whether to call an election {{on the issue of}} American interference in Canadian politics. At least six Cabinet ministers favoured Diefenbaker's ouster. Finally, at a dramatic Cabinet meeting on Sunday, February 3, Harkness told Diefenbaker that the Prime Minister no longer had the confidence of the Canadian people, and resigned. Diefenbaker asked ministers supporting him to stand, and when only about half did, stated that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Governor General to resign, and that Fleming would be the next Prime Minister. Green called his Cabinet colleagues a [...] "nest of traitors", but eventually cooler heads prevailed, and the Prime Minister was urged to return and to fight the motion of non-confidence scheduled for the following day. Harkness, however, persisted in his resignation. Negotiations with the Social Credit Party, which had enough votes to save the government, failed, and the government fell, 142–111.|$|E

500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> film when completed.

The track [...] "Follow Us" [...] features Vonnegutt, an act from Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label. He originally proposed a rock-influenced track for Yelawolf, but was persuaded by him to send the instrumental for [...] "You Ain't No DJ". According to Yelawolf, he [...] "wrote like 64 bars and turned in the huge verse", which was edited down to 16 and eight-bar parts of his original verse for the finished song. Big Boi also attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate with singer-songwriter Kate Bush, and managed to work with funk music pioneer George Clinton on [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", an experience he related to [...] "Dorothy <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Wizard of Oz.

It was initially written by Calvin Broadus, Cameron Thomaz, The Smeezingtons and Christopher Brown.

2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill {{arrived at}} the [...] "Siege of Sidney Street" [...] in London. He gave his own account of the {{incident}} in his book Thoughts and Adventures. There is some uncertainty as to whether Churchill attempted to give operational commands. Biographer Roy Jenkins comments that the reason he went was because [...] "he could not resist <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> fun himself" [...] {{and that he did}} not issue commands. A famous photograph from the time shows Churchill at the scene, peering around a corner to view the gun battle between cornered anarchists and Scots Guards. His role and presence attracted much criticism. The building under siege caught fire, and Churchill supported the decision to deny the fire brigade access, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "He [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing but what was the Right Honourable gentleman doing?" [...] The significance was that the whole highly publicised affair increased Churchill's already incipient reputation for being a frenetic and far-from-calm Home Secretary.|$|E
2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip walk up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told in front of the class was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E
