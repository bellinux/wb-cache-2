5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E

5|$|Soay has a {{primitive}} hut known as Taigh Dugan (Dugan's house). This <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from Lewis {{who came to}} St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The Nineteenth Dynasty saw {{a further}} {{standardisation}} of tomb layout and decoration. The {{tomb of the}} first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010s {{there has}} been a {{significant}} expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25%. Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3billion ($540million) in the city each year. The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or {{as a part of a}} round trip in Denmark. The average stay <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three days on average.|$|E
5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens {{and some of the other}} Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{a pad of}} grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
