40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the status of electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> and/or functions in the public schools of Indiana. To provide additional insight to the organizational structure of a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center, four existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers serving a group of school districts in adjoining states through a centrally located computer facility were examined. The procedures used in collecting and analyzing the data for the study included the following: (1) appropriate data gathering instruments were designed, (2) a questionnaire accompanied by a cover letter explaining the {{purpose of the}} study was mailed to each superintendent of all school corporations in Indiana, (3) a personal interview was conducted with the administrative personnel directly responsible for the operation of each of the four selected regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers, (3) <b>data</b> obtained from the questionnaire and the personal interview were compiled, tabulated, analyzed, and presented, and (4) the findings, conclusions and recommendations for further study were presented. The superintendents were asked to respond to the question, "Do you presently utilize <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> (computer and punch card) equipment in any part of the operation and/or administration of your school district?" Those school administrators responding "YES" were then asked to indicate those services and functions which were accomplished in their school corporation, to indicate the method of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> and to indicate methods. All of the superintendents were asked to indicate their future plans for the use of <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> in their local school corporation(s). The systematic analysis of the procedures necessary for implementing educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> to a group of school districts in adjoining states included the following elements: (1) background information, (2) objectives, (3) historical development, (4) equipment, (5) personnel, (6) services and/or functions, (7) orientation procedures, (8) advantages of a central computer facility, (9) disadvantages of a central computer facility, and (10) future plans. The findings indicated the following major general conclusions to be appropriate the level of their satisfaction with both services. There has been only limited development toward the organization of educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> systems throughout the state of Indiana. This situation lends itself to collective exploration by interested school administrators toward cooperative arrangements of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services,</b> regardless of the size of the school district. Qualified and competent personnel must be responsible for the operation of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center. The director of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center should be totally familiar with all facets of school administration so that he may use electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> to facilitate the instructional program. A central computer facility organized to provide electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> to a group of school districts is capable of supporting the more sophisticated computer equipment at a reduction in cost, provided the equipment is operating at a near capacity work load. It is possible for a group of school districts to benefit from the developmental experience of existing <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. The amount of time once considered necessary to progress from feasibility of operation to full-scale implementation has been greatly reduced by administrators' capitalizing on the systematic developments of existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. School districts involved in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> can benefit from the efforts of an administrative officer whose function is to systematically analyze administrative operations. This individual is referred to as a systems analyst or operations analyst. Teleprocessing has great potential for providing electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> to school districts regardless of size. Teleprocessing provides school administrators with direct access to sophisticated electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> equipment and computer programs which have been successfully developed and implemented in other school districts. The Indiana Department of Education should assume the leadership in establishing regional service centers throughout Indiana to provide comprehensive educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> to local school districts. Colleges and universities should serve as a catalyst of ideas for the intelligent use of electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> to perform administrative and instructional functions.

40|$|The {{final stages}} of this work saw changes to the {{original}} framework, {{as well as the}} completion and integration of several <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services.</b> Initially, it was thought that a peer-to-peer architecture was necessary to make this work possible. The peer-to-peer architecture provided many benefits including the dynamic discovery of new services that would be continually added. A prototype example was built and while it showed promise, a major disadvantage was seen in that it was not easily integrated into the existing data environment. While the peer-to-peer system worked well for finding and accessing distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services,</b> it was found that its use was limited by the difficulty in calling it from existing tools and services. After collaborations with members of the data community, it was determined that our <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> system was of high value and that a new interface should be pursued in order for the community {{to take full advantage of}} it. As such; the framework was modified from a peer-to-peer architecture to a more traditional web service approach. Following this change multiple <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> were added. These services include such things as coordinate transformations and sub setting of data. Observatory (VHO), assisted with integrating the new architecture into the VHO. This allows anyone using the VHO to search for data, to then pass that <b>data</b> through our <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> prior to downloading it. As a second attempt at demonstrating the new system, a collaboration was established with the Collaborative Sun Earth Connector (CoSEC) group at Lockheed Martin. This group is working on a graphical user interface to the Virtual Observatories and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> software. The intent is to provide a high-level easy-to-use graphical interface that will allow access to the existing Virtual Observatories and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services</b> from one convenient application. Working with the CoSEC group we provided access to our <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> tools from within their software.

40|$|The {{amount of}} data {{generated}} everyday in IT environments keeps increasing. In {{order to be able}} to make use of the large quantities of data generated in actual practical applications, complex computational requirements are needed to process and understand the data. It is expected that the {{amount of data}} created in the future will increase exponentially. As a result, the <b>processing</b> of <b>data,</b> which includes the extraction, transformation, and analysis of it, will also become more complex over time. For this Masters thesis, a framework for service-based <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> was developed by improving upon the application FlexMash developed at the University of Stuttgart for data integration. The improvements were done by using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), and creating a <b>Service</b> Platform for <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services,</b> in {{order to be able to}} decouple the services offered from the application itself. Furthermore, the improvements provide a simple way to integrate new services to the application in a generic manner, and enable an ad-hoc approach for <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services.</b> As a result, more flexibility for <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> is added to the application with a generic and robust execution and management environment for the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>services.</b> This is not limited to the services provided by FlexMash but is extended to third party services.
