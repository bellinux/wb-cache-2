5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended her, and {{to tell her that}} they should be friends. It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with Cristina dating other men.|$|E
5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from {{him and told him}} that they would not continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E

500|$|The cricket writer A. A. Thompson relates a {{different}} story told to him fifty years later by Hirst, who played in the match. According to this account, Hirst was having breakfast when Peel came in drunk. Anxious that Peel would be seen, and worried about bringing the team into disrepute, Hirst forced Peel to return to bed {{and went to the}} ground, where he told Lord Hawke that Peel had been taken ill in the night and {{would not be able to}} play. Hawke promised to see Peel that evening and took the twelfth man onto the field. According to Thompson, when Hirst went onto the field, he saw [...] "with dawning dismay that there were not eleven fieldsmen present but twelve. There, his face red, his cap awry, the ball in his hand, stood Peel". Peel was even more drunk than at breakfast, and Hawke ordered him from the field. Peel replied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> and according to Hirst bowled a ball to demonstrate his fitness, but in his confusion did so in the wrong direction. Peel was then led from the field. After falling asleep in the hotel, he was advised by Hirst to apologise to Lord Hawke, but refused, claiming that he was indispensable to the team and would be recalled.|$|E

500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the game ended, Appalachian State {{students}} began celebrating on the two main streets in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore {{down one of the}} goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with this, saying [...] "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can't wait to get there and see it." [...] Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was [...] "flooded" [...] with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.|$|E
500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold your head down, so your view is only about {{a foot and a half}} in front of you, which still makes it a little bit hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E
500|$|... "Fresh Blood" [...] {{featured}} the final guest appearance by Sterling K. Brown as the vampire hunter Gordon Walker. The character's story arc {{for the season}} {{was intended to be}} longer, but Brown's commitments to the Lifetime Television series Army Wives limited his return to only two appearances. The episode was [...] "really hard" [...] for the actor; though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with the character dying, the idea of Gordon turning an innocent girl into a vampire was [...] "horrific" [...] to him. Although Gordon's actions in previous episodes were questionable, Brown had always believed the character to be [...] "ultimately good". On this change, Brown commented, [...] "His endgame is to kill Sam, and anyone else who has to experience detrimental effects because of that is not a concern of his. That was tough for me to process and get on board with." [...] However, series creator Eric Kripke reasoned that the character was now a monster and should follow his instincts instead of logic. The writer of [...] "Fresh Blood", Sera Gamble, also penned Gordon's initial episode and helped Kripke conceptualize the character. She felt that she [...] "lucked out" [...] in being able to write the character's final appearance, and found there to be [...] "something so satisfying about turning him into a vampire and chopping his head off with a razor wire".|$|E

500|$|Molk {{attended}} the University of Michigan, {{where he played}} for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 2007 to 2011. Entering the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Molk was a serious contender to start in the season opener due to injuries for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team. Upon the arrival of new head coach Rich Rodriguez in the spring prior to the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Molk {{was expected to be}} a starter for the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team after redshirtting the prior year. [...] He spent the summer after his redshirt season perfecting the shotgun formation snap. [...] However, he endured a serious undisclosed illness that caused him to lose [...] and found himself in a battle with redshirt junior David Moosman to be the starting center. [...] As his struggles continued, it was revealed that he had mononucleosis. [...] Despite his struggles, he was awarded the Iron Wolverine Award at the spring football awards in recognition of his superior conditioning based on a series of physical tests. As a result of injuries, both Moosman and Molk were in the starting lineup for the 2008 opener. Offensive line injuries continued to affect the lineup through {{the early part of the}} season with Molk (center), Moosman (right offensive guard) and Stephen Schilling (right offensive tackle) being the only players to start each of the first four games. [...] Molk injured his toe at the end of the November 8, 2008 Battle for the Little Brown Jug against Minnesota, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> the following week. [...] As the young offense finished the season with a 3–9 record, it expected its entire starting offensive line to return the following season. In fact, considering injuries, the team returned a total of seven offensive linemen who started games.|$|E

Bob Pease wrote more precisely: [...] "Apparently he had been jogging on a sidewalk, in a steep hilly section of Puerta Vallarta. Bob was, in recent years, pretty much into fitness, and he worked hard at his running ... I'm no doctor. But he did not die drunk, which may have amazed a number of his colleagues". Jack Gifford concurred: [...] "He didn't die as a derelict. He wasn't, I mean <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> He was coherent. Probably leading the most, he was down in Mexico, living in Mexico, but he was sober and leading a reasonable life for him at that point when he died".|$|E

Norton asked Universal Pictures if he could be replaced, and a deal was struck between the studio and the Endeavor Talent Agency (which represents Norton and Affleck) to enable Norton to leave the production amicably. Crowe had partly been attracted to the project because of Norton's involvement, but he and Affleck had [...] "so many touchstones in common" [...] <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> with the recasting.
