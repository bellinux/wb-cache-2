5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{internal}} assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> and {{is marked by a}} teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for <b>each</b> <b>subject,</b> and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E

25|$|The SSC and HSC {{examinations}} {{are conducted}} by the Board of Secondary and Intermediate Education under the Ministry of Education. SSC is the diploma awarded for the completion of grades one to ten, which {{is equivalent to the}} O Levels in the UK. HSC is the high school diploma which is equivalent to the high school diploma in the United States that is given after the completion of Grade 12, and the A Levels in the UK. The SSC examination consists of eleven subjects totaling 1,100 marks, with <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> given 100 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. A minimum of 33 marks are required to pass <b>each</b> <b>subject.</b> Subjects will depend on which major program a student has elected to study. These major programs are Sciences; Arts and Humanities; and Commerce. Students have to elect one of these three programs just before enrollment in the 9th grade for SSC, and again in the 11th grade for HSC. The HSC examination consists of six subjects totaling 1,200 marks, with <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> providing 200 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. The minimum number of marks required to pass <b>each</b> <b>subject</b> is 66. Results of both the exams are published {{in the form of a}} GPA. The highest score is GPA-5. The Dhaka Education Board annually ranks schools and colleges from across the country in terms of GPA-5 scorers.|$|E

40|$|Propensity-score {{matching}} {{is increasingly}} {{being used to}} estimate the effects of treatments using observational data. In many-to-one (M: 1) matching on the propensity score, M untreated subjects are matched to <b>each</b> treated <b>subject</b> using the propensity score. The authors used Monte Carlo simulations to {{examine the effect of}} the choice of M on the statistical performance of matched estimators. They considered matching 1 – 5 untreated <b>subjects</b> to <b>each</b> treated <b>subject</b> using both nearest-neighbor matching and caliper matching in 96 different scenarios. Increasing the number of untreated <b>subjects</b> matched to <b>each</b> treated <b>subject</b> tended to increase the bias in the estimated treatment effect; conversely, increasing the number of untreated <b>subjects</b> matched to <b>each</b> treated <b>subject</b> decreased the sampling variability of the estimated treatment effect. Using nearest-neighbor matching, the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect was minimized in 67. 7 % of the scenarios when 1 : 1 matching was used. Using nearest-neighbor matching or caliper matching, the mean squared error was minimized in approximately 84 % of the scenarios when, at most, 2 untreated subjects were matched to <b>each</b> treated <b>subject.</b> The authors recommend that, in most settings, researchers match either 1 or 2 untreated <b>subjects</b> to <b>each</b> treated <b>subject</b> when using propensity-score matching...|$|R

25|$|In most Waldorf schools, pupils enter {{secondary}} education {{when they are}} about fourteen years old.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop the system of {{physical}} exercise prescription for training gym in our university.
