40|$|Starting from mid 2004, European clothes vendors will {{switch to}} a new {{standard}} system for designating the size of garments. This new system is defined in EN 13402 and based on body dimensions measured in centimeters. EN 13402 - 1 defines a standard list of body dimensions, namely head girth, neck girth, chest girth, bust girth, underbust girth, waist girth, hip girth, height, <b>inside</b> <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> arm length, hand girth, foot length, and body mass. For each type of garment, the EN 13402 - 2 standard specifies a primary dimension, a body measurement in centimeters (or body mass in kilograms) that shall be used in designating its size. For some types of garment, where a single size is not adequate to select the right product, a secondary dimension is added. For use on language-neutral clothes labels, EN 13402 - 1 specifies a pictogram for each body dimension. The BodyDim MetaPost package helps TEX users in the simple generation of these pictograms as Embedded PostScript files. An example pictogram generated by BodyDim i...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present anthropometric {{measurements}} on 42 premature infants nursed in the neonatal intensive care unit of Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach – Birth information, including maturity, age, gender, birth weight and present weight, were recorded. About 13 body size measurements, including stature, hand girth, armscye girth, chest girth, arm length, max girth, abdomen girth, hand length, thigh girth, shoulder width, head to nape <b>length,</b> <b>inside</b> <b>leg</b> to heel <b>length</b> and foot length, were measured for each infant. Using these data, the body size distribution, the correlation between each body size measurement, and linear regressions of present weight and stature with other body size measurement were analyzed. Findings – It was found that present weight and stature of premature infants were the most desirable and significant size parameters for the development of a measurement chart for premature infants.

40|$|<b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> {{inequality}} after hip arthroplasty is a {{major source}} of patient dissatisfaction and dysfunction. Despite numerous reported methods to intraoperatively determine <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> change, it remains a challenge. We developed a reliable and reproducible method to measure <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> change using sur-gical navigation. The method measures the change in posi-tion of the femur relative to the pelvis and the pelvic coor-dinate system without the need to establish a femoral coor-dinate system. We replaced 112 hips using the new <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> measurement algorithm. <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> change measured at sur-gery was compared with <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> change as measured on magnification-corrected pre- and postoperative radiographs.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{differences}} on early clinical outcome after {{total hip arthroplasty}} remains uncertain. We performed a prospective study on 94 patients who were evaluated preoperatively and one year after surgery for clinical <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> differences, which were then compared with radiological measurements. The effect of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> differences on walking ability, limp, pain and patient satisfaction was studied. The mean clinical <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> difference after operation was 0. 05 cm (- 1. 5 to 1. 5, SD 0. 5). Clinical and radiological measurements correlated poorly (? = 0. 36 pre- and ? = 0. 186 postoperatively). Patients with a shorter operated leg on clinical assessment were more prone to limping (p> 0. 05), and patients with a longer leg had more pain {{compared to patients with}} equal <b>leg</b> <b>lengths</b> (p> 0. 05). Walking ability, Harris Hip Score and patient satisfaction were only marginally affected by <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> differences.

40|$|Background: Symptomatic <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{inequality}} {{accounts for}} 8. 7 % of total hip replacement related claims made against the UK National Health Service Litigation authority. It {{has not been}} established whether symptomatic <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> inequality patients following total hip replacement have abnormal hip kinetics during gait. Methods: Hip kinetics in 15 unilateral total hip replacement patients with symptomatic <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> inequality during gait was determined through multibody dynamics and compared to 15 native hip healthy controls and 15 'successful' asymptomatic unilateral total hip replacement patients. Finding: More significant differences from normal were found in symptomatic <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> inequality patients than in asymptomatic total hip replacement patients. The <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> inequality patients had altered functions defined by lower gait velocity, reduced stride length, reduced ground reaction force, decreased hip range of motion, reduced hip moment and less dynamic hip force with a 24 % lower heel-strike peak, 66 % higher mid-stance trough and 37 % lower toe-off peak. Greater asymmetry in hip contact force was also observed in <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> inequality patients.

Repeated measurement of a 100 mm Perspex rod gave a mean length of 99. 993 mm and a mean SD of 0. 058. When used to measure <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> technical error of the measurement technique was 0. 31 with a mean <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> of 98. 49 mm (coefficient of variation 0. 31 %). <b>Leg</b> <b>lengths</b> measured at birth in 324 babies from 23 to 42 weeks' gestation gave an estimated in utero <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> velocity of 0. 43 mm/day (95 % confidence interval 0. 41 to 0. 45).

There was a weak but positive relationship between lower <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and weight fluctuation in children. Daily fluctuations in weight as well as lower <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> were higher in women than men; median lower <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> fluctuation: women, 0. 16 mm (P 5 - 0, P 95 - 0. 7); men, 0. 1 mm (P 5 - 0, P 95 - 0. 48) p approximately 0. 02, Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Sustained weight gain in pregnancy led to a reduction in lower <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> followed by an increase which was coincident with the appearance of dependent oedema. Lower <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> changes are likely to be positively related to changes in weight when the latter are only modest in magnitude.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionTotal hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) {{can bring}} about complications – particularly <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> differences – that are becoming increasingly litigious. Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS) can help optimize the procedure, but its ability to effectively restore <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> is controversial. As a consequence, we carried out a study to determine: (1) its contribution to meeting <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and offset objectives, (2) its reliability, by evaluating the correlation between radiological and navigation data, (3) its safety, by evaluating navigation-specific and non-specific complications. HypothesisCAOS will help to restore <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> within± 5 mm in more than 80 % of cases. Material and methodsA series of 321 continuous cases of cementless THA implanted through the posterolateral approach using CAOS was analyzed retrospectively. With a minimum 1 year follow-up, we evaluated whether the <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and offset goals were achieved, how well the navigation and radiology data were correlated and whether navigation-specific and non-specific complications occurred. Based on our hypothesis that 80 % of patients would have less than 5 mm <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> difference and the null hypothesis (PA=P 0) with an alpha of 0. 05, 200 observations were required to achieve a power of 90 %. ResultsThe <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and offset objectives were achieved in 83. 3 % and 88 % of cases, respectively. Twenty-two patients required a heel wedge to compensate for <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> differences. The correlation between the radiology and surgical navigation data was satisfactory – the Pearson coefficient was 0. 79 for length and 0. 74 for offset. Intraoperative and postoperative complications or adverse events were found in 14. 6 % of cases; these were specific to CAOS in 12. 1 % of cases and non-specific in 2. 5 % of cases. ConclusionThis study shows the relevance of CAOS for achieving preoperative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> objectives, with good correlation between navigation and radiology data, and without major complications.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> and {{relative}} <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{are considered to}} be reliable markers of prepubertal living conditions. Cessation of leg growth, driven by estrogen, occurs earlier in puberty in girls than boys. We hypothesized that <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> {{and relative}} <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> as sitting height to leg ratio, might have sex-specific associations with age of puberty. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression in 10, 046 older (≥ 50 years) Chinese from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (Phase 3) to examine the associations of recalled age of puberty (women: age of menarche, and men: mean age of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking, and first pubic hair) with subischeal <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> sitting height to leg ratio, and sitting height. Results: <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> and sitting height to leg ratio had different associations with age of puberty in men and women (P-values for interaction < 0. 001), but sitting height did not. Per year earlier puberty, legs were longer among men by 0. 09 cm (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 - 0. 18) and shorter among women by 20. 16 cm (95 % CI 20. 20 to 20. 12). Further adjustment for age, hip size (as a marker of buttock fat), and several markers of childhood conditions did not obviate the difference in association by sex. Conclusions: Adult <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and relative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (sitting height to leg ratio) may be biomarkers of different exposures in men and women, with corresponding implications for their interpretation as a biomarker of early life exposures. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Evidence for the {{simplification}} {{of motor}} {{control of the}} limbs through {{a reduction in the}} number of degrees of freedom exists in areas of research such as neuroscience, robotics, and biomechanics. Human hopping in place can be modeled well with spring-mass dynamics and provides a tractable model by which to study how the locomotor system compensates through inter-joint coordination to achieve stability of performance variables, <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation. This study provides the first evidence for how the redundancy of human leg joints may be simply coor-dinated to stabilize spring-mass dynamics throughout the hopping cycle using an uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis. We use a UCM analysis to quantify the structure of joint variance that stabilizes the hypothesized perfor-mance variables, <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and <b>leg</b> orientation. For one-legged human hopping in place, we hypothesized that <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation would each be stabilized throughout the entire hopping cycle. We also hypothesized that hop-ping at non-preferred frequencies would be more difficult for subjects and stabilization of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation would increase. Kinematic data from eleven subjects hopping at three frequencies (2. 2, 2. 8, and 3. 2 Hz) were collected and analyzed within the framework of the UCM. Maximum <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> stabilization was observed at mid-stance when <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> was most susceptible to small changes in joint angles. Overall stabilization of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> increased as subjects hopped at higher frequencies, reflecting the increased demands on the control system. The stabilization of leg orientation during aerial phase acted to position the foot at initial contact to determine velocity and trajectory of the center of mass during the stance phase. Because hopping in place does not require a change in forward velocity, the control strategy for leg orientation remained the same across frequencies. We conclude that stabilization of <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and orientation may signify a reduction in degrees of freedom in the control system...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Background: We analyse the NHANES III sample {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} of measured stature and sitting height to estimate <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (tibia + femur) and predict fatness. High rates of overweight in the United States population may lead to greater gluteo-femoral fat mass which will increase sitting height and artificially decrease estimates of both absolute and relative <b>leg</b> <b>length.</b> Methods: The analyses include 3076 women and 3233 men, 20. 0 - 49. 9 years of age of White, Black or Mexican-American ethnicity. The poverty index ratio, measured stature, sitting height, upper <b>leg</b> <b>length,</b> weight, four skinfolds, buttocks circumference and elbow, biacromial and biiliac breadths were extracted from the database. The sitting height ratio, % body fatness, % upper <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (ULL/stature), and other indices were estimated. Correlation and principle component analysis {{were used to assess}} the relationship between measures of body fatness, relative <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and the other variables. Results: For adults in the NHANES III %body fat is more strongly correlated with buttocks circumference (r = 0. 87 and 0. 78 for women and men), than with any measure of estimated <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> (r's range from - 0. 28 to - 0. 10 for both sexes). Principle components analysis separates fatness, stature and estimated <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> into uncorrelated factors for this sample. Conclusion: Reports of a negative association between <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and fatness for adults of the NHANES III are likely spurious, due to greater gluteo-femoral fat thickness increasing sitting height. Future rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat populations, should measure lower extremity length directly to better assess its relationship to health and disease risk. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Some of the {{important}} mosquito species are generally sympatric {{in terms of their}} geographical distributions, and are diffi cult to identify based solely on examination of adult females using the available morphological keys. In this study, adult mosquitoes were collected indoors in Abeokuta in south-western Nigeria between August 2005 and July 2006 using Center for Disease Control light traps. The objective was to investigate possible morphological differences in populations of Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia africana. Six morphological characters namely, wing length, antennal length, proboscis length, foreleg <b>length,</b> mid <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> were measured in the two species. A total of 868 Cx quinquefasciatus and 962 M. africana were collected during the study period. The mean length was observed to be higher in most characters during the wet season than the dry season but the variation was not statistically signifi cant (P> 0. 005). In M. africana, the antennal length, proboscis length, foreleg length and midleg length showed one peak each. The wing length exhibited three peaks while hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> showed two peaks. For Cx quinquefasciatus, the antennal length, proboscis length, foreleg <b>length,</b> mid <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> and hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> indicated one peak. The wing length however showed three peaks. Each of the peaks observed in wing <b>length</b> and hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> of M. africana and wing length of Cx quinquefasciatus was assumed to be a specifi c population. The coeffi cient of differences (CDs) for each population indicated the presence of three populations in M. africana (CD> 1. 28). However, the hind <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> showed that the two populations were the same (CD 1. 28) ...|$|R
40|$|For 30 years, using {{equations}} {{determined by}} Alexander (1976), paleontologists have estimated speeds of dinosaurs from their trackways; the fundamental assumption, based on limited observations, was that dinosaur hip height is approximately four times foot length. Thulborn (1990) subsequently {{determined that the}} <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> to foot length ratio ranges from 4. 5 - 6. 0, according to type and size of dinosaur. Given that the focus of many published footprint studies is to estimate dinosaur speed from Alexander’s equations, {{it is critical that}} the hip height of the track maker can be ascertained from the footprint measurement. If there is high variability in the ratio of hip height:foot length within a group of dinosaurs, speed estimates are going to be extremely unreliable. This study examined the relationship between foot <b>length</b> and <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> in a variety of dinosaurs. Measurements of 24 dinosaur specimens included ornithischians (bipedal and quadrupedal), theropods, dinosauriforms, birds, and sauropods. <b>Leg</b> <b>length</b> was defined as femur + tibia + metatarsal III; foot length was defined as that part of the foot preserved in footprints (digit III phalanges ± claw + metatarsal III – metatarsal IV). <b>Leg</b> and foot <b>lengths</b> were compared and it was found that in bipedal ornithischians the foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio is ~ 5. 4 - 5. 9, and in theropods, 2. 8 - 4. 2. Contrary to previous studies, we found that (1) there is no correlation between dinosaur size and foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio, (2) the foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio is greater than previously estimated, and (3) the foot to <b>leg</b> <b>length</b> ratio is highly variable for each group of dinosaurs. We conclude that estimating dinosaur speed from trackways should not be undertaken lightly, and the results be interpreted with caution...|$|R
