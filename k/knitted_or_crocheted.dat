25|$|Any yarn can {{be either}} <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted,</b> {{provided}} needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties {{should be taken into}} account. For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for Amigurumi crochet.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the past}} few years, a {{practice}} called yarn bombing, {{or the use of}} <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings, emerged in the US and spread worldwide. Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification. In 2010, an entity dubbed [...] "the Midnight Knitter" [...] hit West Cape May. Residents awoke to find knit cozies hugging tree branches and sign poles. In September 2015, Grace Brett was named [...] "The World's Oldest Yarn Bomber". She is {{part of a group of}} yarn graffiti-artists called the Souter Stormers, who beautify their local town in Scotland. When she is not yarn bombing, she is utilizing her craft by making items for her children and grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} decade, a {{practice}} called knitting graffiti, guerilla knitting, or [...] yarn bombing— {{the use of}} <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> cloth to modify and beautify one's (usually outdoor) surroundings—emerged in the U.S. and spread worldwide. Magda Sayeg is credited with starting the movement in the US and Knit the City are a prominent group of graffiti knitters in the United Kingdom. [...] Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification. For instance, Dave Cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in Melbourne, Australia for the Big West Arts Festival in 2009. The work was vandalized the night of its completion. A new movie, shot by a Tasmanian filmmaker on a set made almost entirely out of yarn, was partially inspired by [...] "knitted graffiti".|$|E

50|$|Ladder yarn {{resembles a}} ladder, with two flat threads {{representing}} {{the two sides}} of the ladder held together by a strip of material at the center that represents the rungs. The material at the center of ladder yarn can be metallic, beaded, or otherwise adorned. This type of yarn is more often used to create trim or embellishments than to <b>knit</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet</b> entire garments.|$|R
50|$|Ribbon or tape yarn {{is a kind}} of novelty yarn. It is made of ribbon, but {{generally}} not the kind of ribbon used in sewing and millinery. Rather, they are ribbons made especially for <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheting,</b> with some in a tubular form, some woven flat, and some similar in appearance to Bias tape. Ribbon yarns can be composed of many materials, from synthetics to silk to plant fibers.|$|R
50|$|The dye {{lot number}} is {{important}} information for hobbyist knitters and crocheters, because {{the use of}} yarn from different dye lots can spoil the appearance of handmade textiles. These shade variations may be subtle enough to be undetectable on a store shelf, but actual differences in shade becomes apparent during <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheting</b> <b>or</b> after washing. Unmatched dye lots are a significant problem to knitters and crocheters because the problem manifests after days or weeks of labor, by which time the supplier's stock of the original dye lot may have been depleted.|$|R

50|$|In yarns for {{handcrafts}} such as <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet,</b> hanks {{are not a}} {{fixed length}} but are sold in units by weight, most commonly 50 grams. Depending on {{the thickness of the}} strand as well as the inherent density of the material, hanks can range widely in yardage per 50 gram unit; for example, 440 yards for a lace weight mohair, to 60 yards for a chunky weight cotton. Special treatments to the materials that add cost, such as mercerisation or labor-intensive hand-painting of colors, can influence a manufacturer's desired length per unit as well. Knitters and crocheters rewind the hanks into balls or centre-pull skeins prior to use, in order to prevent the yarn from becoming tangled.|$|R
50|$|Amigurumi (lit. <b>crocheted</b> <b>or</b> <b>knitted</b> stuffed toy) is the Japanese art of <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheting</b> small, stuffed yarn creatures. The word is a {{portmanteau}} of the Japanese words ami, meaning <b>crocheted</b> <b>or</b> <b>knitted,</b> and nuigurumi, meaning stuffed doll. In {{the west}} {{they are called}} amigurumi, which are the original phonetics of 編みぐるみ in Japanese language. Amigurumi vary in size {{and there are no}} restrictions about size or look. While the art of amigurumi has been known in Japan for several decades, the craft first started appealing to the masses in other countries, especially in the West, in 2003. By 2006, amigurumi were reported to be {{some of the most popular}} items on Etsy, an online craft marketplace, where they typically sold for $10 to $100. Since then, popularity has continued to increase. Even though amigurumi seem popular online due to their presence on sites such as Etsy, Pinterest and Ravelry, amigurumi is still a developing craft permeated and directly depending on emerging trends and popular culture.|$|R

50|$|Hand {{spinning}} {{can be done}} {{by using}} a spindle or the spinning wheel. Spinning turns the carded wool fibres into yarn which can then be directly woven, <b>knitted</b> (flat <b>or</b> circular), <b>crocheted,</b> <b>or</b> by other means turned into fabric or a garment.|$|R
50|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{alternatives to}} using tampons are the menstrual cup, reusable sanitary pads, menstrual sponges and reusable tampons. Menstrual cups are silicone cups that are worn inside the vagina {{to collect the}} fluid. Reusable sanitary pads are similar to disposable sanitary pads, but differ {{in the sense that}} they can be washed and used as many times as needed by the owner. For women who cannot or don't want to use a menstrual cup, but like internal products, sea sponges inserted like tampons may be a good option. These can also be washed out and reused and when they lose their absorbency can be composted. Some women have also made reusable tampons, often pieces of <b>knit</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> fabric that are rolled up and inserted into the vagina, and later washed, dried and reused. These alternatives are environmentally friendly because they are reusable, and in some cases compostable, so they contribute less waste to landfills.|$|R

50|$|Bouclé, or looped, yarns {{are created}} by loosely looping an effect yarn around a base yarn. They can be made of any type of fiber and are usually {{composed}} of three plies, or strands, wrapped around each other. The texture is created by spinning {{one of the three}} plies more loosely than the other two. Fiber artists who choose to create projects in bouclé yarn must use extra care because if not handled carefully, the loose strand may split and snag on the <b>knitting</b> needles <b>or</b> <b>crochet</b> hook.|$|R
50|$|Hand-made or machine-made net {{is used as}} the {{foundation}} fabric for many kinds of needlework, including Filet lace and tambour lace. Netting {{can be used for}} many things. This includes adding fullness to a dress. Most commonly wedding and prom dresses. It is also used for many costumes, including fairy outfits. Netting {{can also be used to}} make tutus for dancing costumes. Netting can also be referred to when considering the handmade craft. Using either the Lace-maker or the Net-maker method to tie the netting knot, you can create several types of netting. Diamond mesh netting goes back and forth, in rows. This technique is used for bags, hammocks, headbands and scarves. Another type is square mesh netting which also goes back and forth in rows but is worked in the diagonal. This type of net is used for trawling.The first row starts at one corner and the last row finishes the corner diagonal to the first corner. This is often used as a foundation for lacis or net embroidery. Spiral netting is a type of netting that goes around and around in a similar manner to <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet.</b> There’s no beginning or ending to specific rounds since the pattern is continuous and just keeps going.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), edible fruit, nuts, peel of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), lac, gums, resins, vegetable saps and extracts nes (HS- 13), rubber and articles thereof (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or tufted fabric, lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not <b>knit</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet</b> (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87). Those commodities are in line with Indonesian government export's strategy direction which mainly focuses on several sectors, including fishery, vegetable products, rubber, wood and wood products, textiles, and transportation. Therefore, Indonesian government should focus to improve those commodities in AEC.
