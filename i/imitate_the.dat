5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a {{harmless}} species has evolved to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> warning signals of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrument}} is equally famous in Turkey, especially the lower-pitched clarinet in G.

Dancers and other performers at the crop over festivals, for example, are popular and an iconic part of Barbadian culture, known for dancing in the costumes of sugarcane-cutters. The Landship movement features song and dance meant to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> passage of a British navy ship through rough seas; Landship and other occasions also feature African-derived improvised and complexly-rhythmic dances, and British hornpipes, jigs, maypole dances and Marches.|$|E
5|$|Dmowski admired Italian fascism. In {{the summer}} of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of {{articles}} admiring Mussolini and the Italian fascist model, and helped organize the Camp of Great Poland (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on Italian fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence. Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not blindly <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Italian or German models.|$|E
5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had never left the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The jackalope can <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> human voice, {{according}} to legend. During {{the days of}} the Old West, when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare Lepus antilocapra, only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.|$|E
5|$|Carter's story draws {{heavily on}} Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and {{particularly}} on James Whale's 1931 {{film version of}} the story. The script had been written specifically with singer Cher and actress Roseanne Barr in mind, but both were unavailable {{at the time of}} shooting. Talk-show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself, and Chris Owens—who appeared in later episodes as FBI agent Jeffrey Spender—played The Great Mutato. The episode was filmed in black-and-white, with a sky backdrop created to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> style of old Frankenstein films. Owens wore makeup and prosthetics that took several hours to apply.|$|E

5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E

5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen {{communities}} have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them {{as an attempt to}} <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{travelled}} to Lahore in 1943 and {{auditioned for}} the local All India Radio (AIR) station as a singer, but the station's music producer, Jivan Lal Mattoo, noticed grooves in Narayan's fingernails: sarangis are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings, which strains the nails. Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a sarangi player. Traditionally, the sarangi is supposed to play after the singer and <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> vocal performance, and play {{in the space between}} phrases. Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan, a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four ragas through singing lessons. Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began to consider a solo career.|$|E

5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and <b>imitate.</b> <b>The</b> child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' mentality to <b>imitate</b> <b>the</b> customs {{from their}} Western European homelands meant {{that there were}} very few {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E
