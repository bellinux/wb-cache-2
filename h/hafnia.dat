5|$|The {{chemical}} element hafnium {{is named after}} Copenhagen (Latin name <b>Hafnia),</b> where it was discovered. The bacterium <b>Hafnia</b> is also named after Copenhagen: Vagn Møller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen named it in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and {{is found in}} many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, {{though it was not}} identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered. Hafnium is named after <b>Hafnia,</b> the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E
500|$|Encouraged {{by these}} {{suggestions}} {{and by the}} reappearance in 1922 of Urbain's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated {{to search for the}} new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. It was ultimately found in zircon in Norway through X-ray spectroscopy analysis. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for [...] "Copenhagen", <b>Hafnia,</b> the home town of Niels Bohr. Today, the Faculty of Science of the University of Copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom.|$|E

500|$|The Bohr model {{worked well}} for hydrogen, but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was {{moving away from the}} idea that {{electrons}} orbited the nucleus and developed heuristics to describe them. The rare-earth elements posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with Wolfgang Pauli's discovery of the Pauli exclusion principle, which put Bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of zirconium. He was immediately challenged by the French chemist Georges Urbain, who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called [...] "celtium". At the Institute in [...] Copenhagen, Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named hafnium (<b>Hafnia</b> being the Latin name for Copenhagen) {{turned out to be more}} common than gold.|$|E

Previous sponsors include [...] Chang Beer (2004–17) <b>Hafnia</b> (1979–85), NEC (1985–95), Danka (1995–97), one2one (1997–2002) and Kejian (2002–04). For the 2008–09 season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo {{of its main}} sponsor Chang Beer, which followed a recommendation from the Portman Group that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children. Everton's current kit manufacturers are Umbro, who have been the club's kit manufacturer three times previously (1974–83, 1986–2000, and 2004–09). Other previous manufacturing firms are Le Coq Sportif (1983–86, 2009–12), [...] Puma (2000–04) and Nike (2012–14). The club currently has two 'megastores': one located near Goodison Park on Walton Lane named 'Everton One' and one located in the Liverpool One shopping complex named 'Everton Two', which gives the second store the address 'Everton Two, Liverpool One'.|$|E
6000|$|The {{author of}} the present work has not had the means of tracing this story to its {{original}} sources. He gives it on the authority of M. Malte-Brun, and Mr. Forster. The latter extracts it from the Saga or Chronicle of Snorro, {{who was born in}} 1179, and wrote in 1215; so that his account was formed long after the event is said to have taken place. Forster says, [...] "The facts which we report have been collected from a great number of Icelandic manuscripts, and transmitted to us by Torfreus in his two works entitled Veleris Groenlandiae Descriptio, <b>Hafnia,</b> 1706, and Historia Winlandiae Antiquae, <b>Hafnia,</b> 1705." [...] Forster appears to have no doubt of the authenticity of the facts. As far as the {{author of the}} present work has had experience in tracing these stories of early discoveries of portions of the New World, he has generally found them very confident deductions drawn from very vague and questionable facts. Learned men are too prone to give substance to mere shadows, when they assist some reconceived theory. Most of these accounts, when divested of the erudite comments of their editors, have proved little better than the traditionary fables, noticed in another part of this work, respecting the imaginary islands of St. Borondon, and of the Seven Cities.|$|E
