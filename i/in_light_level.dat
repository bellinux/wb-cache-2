50|$|All the vidicon type tubes {{except the}} vidicon itself {{were able to}} use a light biasing {{technique}} to improve the sensitivity and contrast. The photosensitive target in these tubes suffered from the limitation that the light level had to rise to a particular level before any video output resulted. Light biasing was a method whereby the photosensitive target was illuminated from a light source just enough that no appreciable output was obtained, but such that a slight increase <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> from the scene was enough to provide discernible output. The light came from either an illuminator mounted around the target, or in more professional cameras from a light source on the base of the tube and guided to the target by light piping. The technique would not work with the baseline vidicon tube because it suffered from the limitation that as the target was fundamentally an insulator, the constant low light level built up a charge which would manifest itself as a form of 'fogging'. The other types had semiconducting targets which did not have this problem.|$|E
5000|$|As an {{explanation}} {{as to why the}} illusion works, Adelson writes:The visual system needs to determine the color of objects in the world. In this case the problem is to determine the gray shade of the checks on the floor. Just measuring the light coming from a surface (the luminance) is not enough: a cast shadow will dim a surface, so that a white surface in shadow may be reflecting less light than a black surface in full light. The visual system uses several tricks to determine where the shadows are and how to compensate for them, {{in order to determine the}} shade of gray [...] "paint" [...] that belongs to the surface. The first trick is based on local contrast. In shadow or not, a check that is lighter than its neighboring checks is probably lighter than average, and vice versa. In the figure, the light check in shadow is surrounded by darker checks. Thus, even though the check is physically dark, it is light when compared to its neighbors. The dark checks outside the shadow, conversely, are surrounded by lighter checks, so they look dark by comparison. A second trick is based on the fact that shadows often have soft edges, while paint boundaries (like the checks) often have sharp edges. The visual system tends to ignore gradual changes <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>level,</b> so that it can determine the color of the surfaces without being misled by shadows. In this figure, the shadow looks like a shadow, both because it is fuzzy and because the shadow casting object is visible. The [...] "paintness" [...] of the checks is aided by the form of the [...] "X-junctions" [...] formed by 4 abutting checks. This type of junction is usually a signal that all the edges should be interpreted as changes in surface color rather than in terms of shadows or lighting. As with many so-called illusions, this effect really demonstrates the success rather than the failure of the visual system. The visual system is not very good at being a physical light meter, but that is not its purpose. The important task is to break the image information down into meaningful components, and thereby perceive the nature of the objects in view.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results are}} {{consistent}} with those of Herrera (1997), who found that Hymenopterans preferred to forage in areas with high irradiance. Low light may be associated with lower visitation rate, if the flower color of H. ventricosa is less vibrant and therefore less visible in forested patches (Chittka and Raine 2006). Light availability might also correlate with visitation rate because of temperature (Corbet et al. 1993; Totland 2001). Since light availability has a positive effect on temperature (Herrera 1995; Kilkenny and Galloway 2008), it is likely that differences in visitation rate between forested patches and open patches could be due to both variations <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> and temperature.|$|E

40|$|This report used 11 {{years of}} data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS 1987 - 1997) to {{investigate}} the sensitivity to light level in three crash scenarios in which various forms of adaptive headlighting might have safety benefits. The scenarios included fatal pedestrian crashes at intersections, on dark roads, and single-vehicle run-off-road crashes on dark, curved roads. Each scenarioâs sensitivity to light level was evaluated in two ways. In the first method, the seasonal pattern of crashes throughout the year was compared to the seasonal pattern of light level in three daily time periods (twilight, daylight, and nighttime), applying the same twilightzone logic as Owens and Sivak (1993). Both of the fatal crash scenarios that involve pedestrians tracked the seasonal fluctuation <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> during this period, showing a decline in crashes during the twilight periods {{in the spring and}} summer, and an increase in crashes during the fall and winter. The daylight and nighttime control periods, in which light level is fixed, showed no similar trend. In contrast, the single-vehicle run-off-road scenario failed to show any influence of light level, and seems to be significantly associated with alcohol use. In the second method, the number of fatal crashes was compared across the changes to and from daylight savings time, within time periods in which an abrupt change <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>level</b> occurs relative to official clock time. Once again, scenarios involving pedestrians were most sensitive to light level, while single-vehicle run-off-road crashes showed little effect of light level.
