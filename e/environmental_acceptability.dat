2500|$|Coal Pollution Mitigation is {{a process}} whereby coal is {{chemically}} washed of minerals and impurities, sometimes gasified, burned and the resulting flue gases treated with steam, {{with the purpose of}} removing sulfur dioxide, and reburned so as to make the carbon dioxide in the flue gas economically recoverable, and storable underground (the latter of which is called [...] "carbon capture and storage"). The coal industry uses the term [...] "clean coal" [...] to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the <b>environmental</b> <b>acceptability</b> of coal extraction, preparation and use, but has provided no specific quantitative limits on any emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. Whereas contaminants like sulfur or mercury can be removed from coal, carbon cannot be effectively removed while still leaving a usable fuel, and clean coal plants without carbon sequestration and storage do not significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for biofuels has encouraged the researchers {{and policy makers}} worldwide to find sustainable biofuel production systems {{in accordance with the}} regional conditions and needs. The sustainability of a biofuel production system includes energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) saving along with <b>environmental</b> and social <b>acceptability.</b> Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an internationally recognized tool for determining the sustainability of biofuels. LCA includes goal and scope, life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation as major steps. LCA results vary significantly, if there are any variations in performing these steps. For instance, biofuel producing feedstocks have different environmental values that lead to different GHG emission savings and energy balances. Similarly, land-use and land-use changes may overestimate biofuel sustainability. This study aims to examine various biofuel production systems for their GHG savings and energy balances, relative to conventional fossil fuels with an ambition to address the challenges and to offer future directions for LCA based biofuel studies. <b>Environmental</b> and social <b>acceptability</b> of biofuel production is the key factor in developing biofuel support policies. Higher GHG emission saving and energy balance of biofuel can be achieved, if biomass yield is high, and ecologically sustainable biomass or non-food biomass is converted into biofuel and used efficiently...|$|R

The study was conducted on teachers from four selected secondary schools, representing four school zones in Malaysia in April and May 2011. As a pilot study, only these schools receive the EE Kit. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews. Among 85 teachers, 15 volunteered to be interviewed. This study aimed to describe and analyze the experience of using the EE Kit for teaching environmental education components in the classroom. Four elements were discussed to represent the acceptability towards the EE Kit. This study revealed 73 % (11 / 15) of the interviewee have positive views towards using the EE Kit. Four factors were identified as barriers to adopting the EE Kit: (i) Limited time, (ii) Limited audio-visual equipment, (iii) Limited access to the EE Kit and (iv) Language problem.

5000|$|Internal energy (or self-energy) is energy {{released}} by the oil shale conversion process {{that is used to}} power that operation (e.g. obtained by combustion of conversion by-products such as oil shale gas), and therefore reducing the use of other fuels (external energy). [...] There are different views as to if the internal energy should be added to the calculation as cost or not. One opinion is that internal energy should not be counted as an energy cost because is does not have an opportunity cost, unlike external energy used in the process. Another opinion is that internal energy is used for performing useful work and therefore should be added to the calculation.

We then introduce acceptability constraints and show that the intervention under acceptability amounts to reallocate production towards inefficient farmers who benefit from the reform at the expense of efficient producers.

40|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization defines {{sustainable}} diets as nutritionally adequate, safe, healthy, culturally acceptable, economically affordable diets {{that have}} little environmental impact. This review summarizes the studies assessing, {{at the individual}} level, both the environmental impact and the nutritional quality or healthiness of self-selected diets. Reductions in meat consumption and energy intake were identified as primary factors for reducing diet-related greenhouse gas emissions. The choice of foods to replace meat, however, was crucial, with some isocaloric substitutions possibly increasing total diet greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, nutritional adequacy was rarely or only partially assessed, thereby compromising the assessment of diet sustainability. Furthermore, high nutritional quality was not necessarily associated with affordability or lower environmental impact. Hence, when identifying sustainable diets, each dimension needs to be assessed by relevant indicators. Finally, some nonvegetarian self-selected diets consumed by a substantial fraction of the population showed good compatibility with the nutritional, <b>environmental,</b> affordability, and <b>acceptability</b> dimensions. Altogether, the reviewed studies revealed the scarcity of standardized nationally representative data for food prices and environmental indicators and suggest that diet sustainability might be increased without drastic dietary changes...|$|R
40|$|Since 1986, NASA and the U.

Road infrastructure needs to be sustained for eons after its development. However, there is no consensus on the criteria upon which the operational performance of road infrastructure projects is assessed. This paper aims to identify all potential criteria for assessing road projects in operation. A desk study was conducted using relevant journal and conference papers obtained from databases including ASCE Library, Science Direct and Ebscohost. Thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes from extant literature. The themes were tabulated and ranked based on their frequency of occurrence to determine the most important criteria for measuring the performance of road projects in operation. Findings indicate that institutional productivity and effectiveness, operational efficiency, health and safety, mobility, <b>environmental</b> element, public <b>acceptability,</b> asset value, legal and technical factors can be used to assess the performance of road projects.

40|$|Basically, {{measures}} {{aimed at}} guaranteeing {{security of supply}} must address the possible causes of capacity shortages as broadly as possible. When designing such measures, besides security of supply, additional objectives such as cost-effectiveness and the <b>environmental</b> and social <b>acceptability</b> of electricity supply should also be taken into account. Capacity payments only partially meet these requirements. Moreover, once introduced they are difficult to adapt, or revise even, to suit changing framework conditions. This is particularly problematic {{in view of the}} current lack of clear evidence for future security of supply problems. Therefore introducing capacity payments {{at this point in time}} would not appear to be constructive. It would make more sense to introduce instead a mix of measures which would strengthen the electricity market, create conditions for feeding in electricity from renewable energy sources as and when required, and set incentives for the expansion of grid capacity, storage systems and demand side management. Should security of supply still appear uncertain under these changed framework conditions, the introduction of a strategic reserve, which would be held by the regulatory authority or the transmission system operator, is recommended – not, however, the creation of an entirely new, additional market segment in the form of a capacity market...|$|R

40|$|Fog is an {{environmental}} water resource of great importance. It plays an integral role in many diverse ecosystems. A very special {{part of the}} fog activities {{in the world today}} is focused on fog collection to provide water for managed use. One of the most exciting aspects of this resource is that in many regions the supply of water will be limited only by the number of collectors one chooses to install. In addition, since the source of the fog is normally the movement of marine stratocumulus deck over coastal mountains, the water quality is good and the water can be used for drinking and other domestic and agricultural purposes. Fog has the potential to provide an alternative source of freshwater in semiarid and arid regions if harvested through the use of simple and low-cost collection systems known as fog collectors. This application-in Egypt- depends on finding locations where there are high horizontal fluxes of fog water in regions with an acute water need.

40|$|Natural {{resources}} {{in general and}} land degradation in particular have a great effect on developing countries to which Ethiopia is no exception. This is owing {{to the fact that}} most developing countries depend heavily on their natural resources. In such cases a viable and sound land use policy is the fundamental basis for sustainable land management and hence sustainable agricultural development. Basically sustainable land management combines technologies, policies and activities aimed at integrating socio-economic principles with environmental concerns so as to simultaneously maintain or enhance production and services. This implies that sustainable land management calls for viable and sound land use policies wherein all land users are subject to a number of obligations to rationally utilize and preserve farming land areas of economic significance and to make good any damage to the environment. Therefore, before any development venture, be it small or large scale, is launched, particularly agricultural development, a clear and comprehensive land use policy should be developed and adopted for the Ethiopian conditions. This should be developed taking into account the dimensions of <b>environmental</b> compatibility, social <b>acceptability</b> and economical viability in land use and management. In verifying such compatibilities and viabilities, environmental impact assessment and natural resource accounting can be judiciously used to suit local situations in particular and the nation in general. This paper outlines the current land use and environmental degradation problems in Ethiopia and suggests strongly the need for formulation of sound land use policy for sustained development and future food-security Ethiopia.
