40|$|Study on {{the effect}} <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> {{management}} on <b>water</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{and the effect of}} pruning corn lower leaves on productivity of Lamuru variety grown on dry land of dry climate area has been done. The experiment was organized at Naibonat Experimental Station, East Kupang Subdistrict, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, from June to October 2011. The area used was 72 × 32 m using split plot design methods, employing two treatments. The first treatment was conducted on the main plot with <b>water</b> <b>irrigation</b> dose given 100, 80, and 60 % the dose control was according to the farmer’s customary. The second treatment was applied by pruning or not pruning the lower leaves at the generative phase on the determined submain plot. The result showed that <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>of</b> 80 and 60 % gave significant effect on corn productivity, that is 7. 3 and 5. 3 ton/ha, but not significant to the control (6. 6 ton/ha). On the other hand, the treatment with and without leaf pruning did not give significant effect on the growth component because pruning was conducted during the generative phase. The Anova test result of corn productivity was not significantly different between the treatment of with and without pruning. The treatment <b>of</b> 80 % <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>irrigation</b> could save <b>water</b> until 842 m 3 or 20 % per planting season per hectare. Meanwhile, the farmer’s customary wasted the water up to 2. 105 m 3 or 50 % per planting season per hectare. Based on the results, the optimizing <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>irrigation</b> interval is seven times more efficient in one planting period as compared to 14 irrigation times in one planting period...|$|R

40|$|The field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 2007 and 2008 to study the effects and strategies <b>of</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> with saline <b>water</b> for oleic sunflower. Five treatments <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> with average salinity levels of 1. 6, 3. 9, 6. 3, 8. 6, and 10. 9 dS/m were designed. For each treatment, 7 mm water was applied when the soil matric potential (SMP) 0. 2 m directly underneath the drip emitters was below - 20 kPa, except during the seedling stage. To ensure the seedling survival, 28 mm water was applied after sowing during the seedling stage. Results indicate that amount of applied water decreases as salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> increases. The emergence will be delayed when the salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> is higher than 6. 3 dS/m, but these differences will be alleviated if there is rainfall during emergence period. The final emergence percentage is not changed when salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> is less than 6. 3 dS/m, and the percentage decreases by 2. 0 % for every 1 dS/m increase when the salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> is above 6. 3 dS/m, but the decreasing rate will be reduced if there is rainfall.

30|$|The {{mismatch}} between the supply and demand, inequitable distribution and the over <b>irrigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> consuming crops {{are the main}} constraints that are faced {{in the implementation of}} the integrated water resources management in Egypt. With water scarcity, the problem under consideration is that the current cropping pattern is not economically efficient in the utilization of the available water resource.

Specifically, the study involves primary and secondary data collection from the study site related to production cost of rice farmers, yield of rice production, climates, soil type, crop calendar, and the rice marketing channel system of Suphan Buri province. The amount <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> applied in paddy field was used CROPWAT 8. 0 model in estimation then used this amount to calculate the value <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> using the Residual Imputation Method (RIM). Results show that the average value <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> had contributed into 2 cases. For case without government subsidy, the value <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> is 0. 017 US$/m 3 and 0. 019 US$/m 3 for dry and wet season, respectively. For case with government subsidy, the value <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> is 0. 033 US$/m 3 and 0. 045 US$/m 3 for dry and wet season, respectively. In addition, the cost <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> project was based on Sam Chuk O&M project investment. Results show that the average cost <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> service per area is 140. 95 US$/ha/year or in form the mass unit of paddy production is 13. 063 US$/ton and 13. 477 US$/ton for dry and wet season, respectively. Moreover, the added value of paddy production is considered at the primary milling process that consisted brown rice bran, husk, white rice bran and broken white rice. In addition, milling process of white rice 1 ton had used the material production or paddy 2 tons. Therefore, the added value of by-product from milling process is 138. 433 US$/ton. Moreover, the total paddy production for each season is around 50 % that is 940, 000 tons and 950, 000 tons for dry and wet season, respectively. Therefore, 90 % of white rice production in Suphan Buri province is selling to export market and another 10 % is selling to domestic market.
