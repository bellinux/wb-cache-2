Indometacin <b>farnesil</b> was first approved in Japan in 1991, and is available in Japan and Indonesia, under the trade names Infree and Dialon, respectively.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} patient, a sixty-seven-year-old woman, who had {{refractory}} accumulation of synovial fluid {{in the knee}} joints with pustulotic arthro-osteitis for more than 10 years. Fifty ml of synovial fluid from her right knee contained 6, 480 pg/ml of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and 15, 000 /mm 3 of neutorophils. At first, she was treated with 400 mg/day of indomethacin <b>farnesil</b> (a prodrug that is converted to indomethacin after intestinal absorption) for 24 weeks. Although, the volume of synovial fluid in her right knee had decreased to 35 ml at the 16 th week, it increased to 50 ml at the 24 th week again. She was treated with Kampo medicine, Keishikajutsubuto (Guizhi-shu-fu-tang). In the present case, Keishikajutsubuto showed more therapeutic effect to pustulotic arthro-osteitis to reduce volume of synovial fluid to almost 0 ml, IL- 8 concentration to 673 pg/ml and number of neutrophils to 660 /mm 3. Our data showed that Keishikajutsubuto might be suitable for this patient to regulate synovial fluid volume, reduce IL- 8 concentration in synovial fluid, and block neutrophils migration to synovial fluid compared to indomethacin therapy...|$|E

40|$|A case of drug-induced acute {{interstitial}} nephritis and acute interstitial pneumonitis {{in the course}} of acute myocarditis is reported. A 75 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on December 8, 1997 with a 2 -week history of exertional dyspnea. She was in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate. The chest X-ray film showed cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio: 61. 6 %) and severe pulmonary congestion. The electrocardiogram showed poor R progression in leads V 1 - 4 and negative T waves in leads V 5 - 6. Echocardiogram showed asynergy of the anterior wall and a large amount of pericardial effusion. Coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries, and myocar- dial biopsy showed the features of acute myocarditis. She remained in rapid atrial fibrilla- tion, so oral amiodarone hydrochloride 400 mg was started on December 14, 1997, reducing to 200 mg daily. She had both knee arthralgia, and was diagnosed as having gonarthrosis. Oral indomethacin <b>farnesil</b> was started at 400 mg daily. One day later, nausea and abdominal pain occurred. The blood urea nitrogen and the serum creatinine were elevated (36 and 3. 1 mg/dl), the chest X-ray film showed severe pulmonary congestion, and 67 Ga- citrate scintigram showed increased 67 Ga-citrate uptake in both kidneys. Therefore, acute renal failure due to drug-induced {{interstitial nephritis}} was diagnosed and hemodialysis was started. One hundred and forty days after amiodarone hydrochloride was started, severe dyspnea appeared. Chest computed tomography showed the changes of drug-induced acute interstitial pneumonia, so her amiodarone hydrochloride therapy was stopped...|$|E
40|$|Involvement of interleukin- 8 in dialysis-related arthritis. To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} interleukin (IL) - 8, a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, in dialysis-related arthritis (DRA) of patients on long-term hemodialysis, the concentration of IL- 8 was measured in the synovial fluids of DRA patients with acute arthralgia and joint swelling, and was compared with those in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis (OA). We noted a marked elevation of IL- 8 in the joint fluids of patients with DRA and RA as compared with OA. Furthermore, to determine the role of IL- 8 in synovitis, we examined the in vivo effect of intra-articular injection of human recombinant IL- 8 on leukocyte infiltration into the joint space of rabbits. A single injection of IL- 8 to the joints of rabbits induced rapid infiltration of neutrophils into the joint space and synovial tissues, which reached a maximum in four hours. The oral administration of indometacin <b>farnesil</b> (a prodrug that is converted to indomethacin after intestinal absorption) before the injection of IL- 8 alleviated the infiltration of neutrophils. When human synovial cells were incubated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, the expression of IL- 8 mRNA and IL- 8 production in the cultured synovial cells were increased. The TNF-α-stimulated expression of IL- 8 mRNA and IL- 8 production in the cultured synovial cells were markedly inhibited by dexamethasone. In conclusion, IL- 8 levels were markedly elevated in the joint fluids of patients with DRA. Interleukin- 8 released from synovial cells {{may be an important}} factor to induce acute inflammation in DRA. Dexamethasone and indomethacin may be effective for DRA by inhibiting the production and chemotactic actions of IL- 8, respectively...|$|E
40|$|As leishmanioses são um conjunto de doenças provocadas por protozoários do gênero Leishmania sp. cujo vetor é o mosquito-palha. Elas se caracterizam por lesões na pele e nas mucosas que podem deformar severamente os portadores, sem matá-los. Contudo, as leishmanioses podem evoluir para formas mais graves que atingem os órgãos internos, particularmente o baço e o fígado. Em seus últimos estágios, as leishmanioses são fatais. O tratamento das leishmanioses é feito sobretudo com antimoniais pentavalentes (notavelmente o estibogluconato de sódio e o antimoniato de meglumina) como fármacos de primeira escolha assistidos por outros antibióticos (anfotericina B, paromomicina e pentamidina) como agentes terapêuticos de segunda escolha. Estas opções de terapêutica, entretanto, sofrem com diversos problemas de efeitos colaterais severos, alto custo, resistência do parasita ou uma combinação qualquer destes fatores. Diante deste fato, nós avaliamos métodos de estimativa da variação de energia livre de interação entre ligantes e enzimas de interesse {{medicinal}} (Tripanotiona Redutase, <b>Farnesil</b> Pirofosfato Sintase e Diidroorotato Desidrogenase) para as quais não existem trabalhos teóricos desenvolvidos neste sentido, e sugerimos aqueles que possam vir a se tornarem ligantes promissores. Avaliamos ainda a possibilidade de substituir o docking molecular convencional, em estudos de triagem virtual, pelo cálculo de estimativa da energia livre feita pela metodologia MMGBSA (Molecular Dynamics, Generalized Born, Solvent Accessibility) aplicada a uma única estrutura minimizada do complexo enzima-ligante solvatado. O papel da tecnologia de cálculos em placas gráficas, considerações sobre economia de tempo, exatidão dos valores de afinidade e da capacidade geral dos métodos de apontar bons ligantes foram analisadas e discutidas. Leishmaniases are a {{group of}} diseases caused by protozoans of the Leishmania sp. genus. whose vector are the sandflies. These diseases are characterized by lesions in the skin and mucous tissues which can severely impair and deform the patient, without killing them. Leishmaniases, however, can evolve to more severe forms and attack internal organs, particularly the spleen and liver. In their final stages of progression, leishmaniases can be fatal. The treatment of leishmanioses is carried out mainly with the pentavalent antimonials (remarkably sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate) as first choice drugs, assisted by other antibiotics (anfothericin B, paromomycin and pentamidine) as second line therapeutic agents. These therapeutical options, however, suffer with a number of problems with severe side effects, high costs, the appearance of parasite resistent strains or any combination of these factors. Because of these facts, we have evaluated methods to estimate the free energy variation of interaction between ligands and medically interesting enzymes (Trypanothione Reductase, Pharnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase and Dihydro Orotate Dehydrogenase) for which there are no theoretical works in this sense. We have also suggested, based on the method that performed better in the tests, those ligands which seem promising. We have evaluated the possibility of replacing the conventional molecular docking, in studies of virtual screening, with free energy estimation calculations done with the MMGBSA (Molecular Dynamics, Generalized Born, Solvent Accessibility) methodology applied to a single minimzed geometry of the solvated ligand-enzyme complex. The role of computation in graphics boards processors, time economy, accuracy of afinity values and the overall capacity of the methods to point out the good ligands were analysed and discussed...|$|E
