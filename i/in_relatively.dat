5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage <b>in</b> <b>relatively</b> open {{habitats and}} reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E

The population grew in eight years from 5,000 to 150,000, sustained by public services provided on a competitive basis by private enterprise, and court systems, schools and a university founded by the local community.|$|E
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins <b>in</b> <b>relatively</b> large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E

For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story.

5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, the 24th Division played an {{important}} part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy firepower with its large number of armored vehicles, including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos that followed the rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and on the desert sand. The 24th remained <b>in</b> <b>relatively</b> stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants <b>in</b> <b>relatively</b> low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} {{has been}} shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or <b>in</b> <b>relatively</b> featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E
