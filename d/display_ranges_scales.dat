40|$|Abstract: Deformation within shear zones {{can be both}} {{temporally}} and spatially variable, {{resulting in}} multiple generations of folds which <b>display</b> a <b>range</b> of <b>scales</b> and overprinting relationships in mylonitic rocks associated with high strain zones. Despite such complexi-ties, two main fold associations are broadly recognized in many shear zone settings: early tight to isoclinal sheath folds, often with mylonitic limbs that are post-dated {{by one or more}} local generations of synshearing folds which are preserved within, or root downwards into mylonitic high strain zones. These latter structures locally fold the mylonitic foliation and lineation whilst displaying eometric characteristics that are kinematically compatible with the movement regime of the major shear zone. Using examples related to ductile thrusting in Moine metasediments of north Scotland, we show that both types of fold display pre-dictable geometric patterns on fabric topology plots. Fold axes and axial surfaces display consistent changes in asymmetry and sense of obliquity relative to local, transport-parallel mineral ineations {{that can be used to}} map out a series of culminations and depression zones. The sheath folds preserve more acute, but almost identical geometric patterns com-pared to the later synshearing folds, with culmination and depression zones often coincid...|$|R

A quasi-experimental study using student participants (N = 434) was employed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with spatial filtering. What is its utility in tone reproduction? Does it exist in vision, and if so, what constraints does it impose on the nervous system? Tone reproduction is just the art and science of taking a picture and then displaying it. The sensors available to capture an image have a greater dynamic range than the media {{that may be used}} to display it. Conventionally, spatial filtering is used to boost contrast; it ameliorates the loss of contrast that results when the sensor signal <b>range</b> is <b>scaled</b> down to fit the <b>display</b> <b>range.</b> In this thesis, a type of nonlinear spatial filtering is discussed that results in direct range reduction without <b>range</b> <b>scaling.</b> This filtering process is instantiated in a real-time image processor built using analog CMOS VLSI. Spatial filtering must be applied with care in both artificial and natural vision systems. It is argued that the nervous system does not simply filter linearly across an image. Rather, the way that we see things implies that the nervous system filters nonlinearly. Further, many models for color vision include a high-pass filtering step in which the DC information is lost. A real-time study of filtering in color space leads {{to the conclusion that the}} nervous system is not that simple, and that it maintains DC information by referencing to white. </p...|$|R
