5|$|Takanohana won {{his first}} tournament in over two years in January 2001, winning his first {{fourteen}} bouts and then defeating fellow yokozuna Musashimaru <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> on the final day. He won his final championship in May 2001, again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> against Musashimaru, but it came at a great cost. He had suffered serious knee ligament damage in a loss to Musōyama on the 14th day but he insisted on fighting on {{to the end of}} the tournament. As a result, he then missed an unprecedented seven consecutive tournaments, undergoing surgery in Paris in July 2001 and having a lengthy recuperation after that.|$|E
5|$|Hershey won {{the first}} game 5–2 on April 26, with Crabb opening scoring with a power play goal, and the Bears taking a 4–0 lead by the second period, {{resulting}} in Providence goaltender Niklas Svedberg being pulled from the game. The victory marked Hershey's first game one win <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> series since defeating Manchester in the 2009–10 Eastern Conference finals. The Bears also won their second game 5–4 on April 28, with Grubauer making 54 saves, eight short of matching the team's playoff record. The Bruins allowed 64 shots, which were six short of Hershey's highest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> game. Hershey was losing 4–3 in the third, their first time trailing in the series, but Grubauer was pulled for an extra attacker and Crabb tied the game with 91 seconds in regulation, allowing DiSalvatore to score the game-winner in overtime on a power play. Hershey's 5-for-10 power play record ranked {{the highest in the}} Calder Cup playoffs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Argentine {{football}} finally inscribed {{their name}} on the winner's list in 1964 when Independiente became the champions after disposing of reigning champions Santos and Uruguayan side Nacional in the finals. Independiente successfully defended the title in 1965; Peñarol would defeat River Plate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> to win their third title, and Racing {{would go on to}} claim the spoils in 1967. One of the most important moments in the tournament's early history occurred in 1968 which saw Estudiantes participate for the first time.|$|E

5|$|By 1986 the Flames landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games—the only time that the Flames defeated the Oilers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E
5|$|Each Asia League Ice Hockey {{regulation}} game is an {{ice hockey}} game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game comprises three 20-minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions. While some teams have television broadcast contracts, {{they do not}} take television time-outs like the NHL. At {{the end of the}} 60 minute game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes, the teams play an overtime period. Overtime is five minutes, with four skaters on each team. If the game remains tied after five minutes, then the teams partake in a three player shoot-out, until one team comes out ahead. Prior to the 2008–09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot-out. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> game the league doesn't use the shoot-out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores.|$|E

5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, {{shortly after}} his time with the Breeze, Clinkscales joined the Halifax Rainmen of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) for the {{remainder}} of the 2013–14 season. In his first game for the Rainmen on February 11, he had six points, four rebounds, and nine assists against the Island Storm. Clinkscales scored a season-high 22 points along with 11 assists <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> win over the Saint John Mill Rats on March 7. In the following game vs. the Mill Rats on March 9, he set the NBL Canada postseason record with 18 assists in a single game. He finished the series with a total of 52 assists—the most in a four-game playoff series in league history. In the following round against the Storm, Clinkscales accumulated 68 assists, an NBL Canada record for a six-game series. He finished the season averaging 11 points, 9.8 assists, and 3.3 rebounds.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, the Nordiques {{announced}} that the team had been sold and were relocating from Quebec. Before {{the start of the}} 1995–96 season, the franchise moved to Denver, Colorado, and was renamed the Colorado Avalanche. Sakic led the team to its first Stanley Cup championship, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. He was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the Cup, Sakic again proved himself to be an effective team leader. Although his Nordiques had missed the playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. He was one goal off from the record for goals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.|$|E

5|$|Jordan's {{second season}} {{was cut short}} when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at {{the time it was}} fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan {{recovered}} in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> game with 63 in Game 2. The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2008, Jones {{signed a}} {{contract}} with his hometown team, the Miami Heat. He earned $4 million in his first year of a potential five-year contract, worth up to $23.2 million. The first two years were guaranteed, while the final three were options held by both the Heat and Jones. He played in forty games, starting one, for the Heat during the 2008–09 season, averaging 4.2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 15.8 minutes per game. Jones missed 36 games due to right wrist injures and was a DNP-CD six games. He started all seven of the team's playoff games that season.

5|$|The Sounds {{were one}} game shy {{of winning the}} first-half pennant in 1984. Winning the first-half title is {{something}} that eluded the team during its entire seven-year span in the Southern League. One important highlight {{of the first half}} of 1984 took place on May 4, when Jim Deshaies pitched the club's first no-hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader. The 5–1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter being hit by a pitch, advancing the runner home for the only Astros run of the game. Nashville went on to capture the second-half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but the Blue Jays emerged the victor, eliminating the Sounds from the playoffs. Skipper Jim Marshall led his Sounds to a 74–73 record.|$|E

5|$|Their most {{successful}} moment came in 1998, when, {{against all the}} odds they defeated Wigan in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone Rovers. Sheffield also put {{in a bid to}} be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} first game of their Adams Division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques in {{overtime}}, the Canadiens won ten overtime games en route to the title, setting an NHL record for most consecutive overtime victories <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>playoff</b> year. As with the 1986 championship, the team was led by Roy, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy. The defining moment of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals occurred in the second game, with less than two minutes to play and Montreal trailing the series 1–0 and the game 2–1. Attempting to gain an advantage for his team, head coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement of Los Angeles Kings forward Marty McSorley's stick. Referee Kerry Fraser determined that the blade had an illegal curve, and assessed a penalty against McSorley. Montreal scored on the power play to tie the game, and then won in overtime 3–2, to tie the series. Montreal also won Games 3 and 4 in overtime before eliminating the Kings in Game 5, 4–1. The celebration was marred by one of the worst riots in Montreal history, as fans rioted through downtown Montreal causing over $2.5million in property damage and 168 injuries.|$|E

At the end of his sophomore season, Arcidiacono travelled with his AAU team, the PA Playaz, to North Carolina for the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions. In {{the first game of the}} tournament, he crashed into the floor face-first, an injury that required eight stitches. Despite the advice of doctors, he decided to play in the following game, and responded with 35 points. He continued to score at the same pace for the remainder of the tournament, and major college programs took notice. Arcidiacono received recruiting offers from Syracuse, Florida, Texas, and Villanova, among others.
