5000|$|Castro {{was born}} in Montevideo. When he was 13, he accidentally amputated his right forearm while using an <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> which gave origin to his nickname, El manco (meaning [...] "the one-armed", or [...] "the maimed").|$|R
50|$|The sawmill {{is driven}} by a belt and pulley system. All saws, except for one small <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> are powered by the steam engine. A small {{pyramidal}} silo stands {{to the rear of}} the main sawmill structure which is used to store the sawdust for the boiler.|$|R
5000|$|Chainsaws {{have almost}} entirely {{replaced}} simple man-powered saws in forestry. They come in many sizes, from small <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> intended for home and garden use, to large [...] "lumberjack" [...] saws. Members of military engineer units {{are trained to}} use chainsaws as are firefighters to fight forest fires and to ventilate structure fires.|$|R
25|$|The Premier <b>Electric</b> <b>saw</b> {{its first}} {{changes in the}} early Thirties. It was bought by the River Park company and its name {{shortened}} to the Premier. In 1932 Turnpike Lane Tube Station opened nearby. Three years later {{as part of the}} development around the new station, competition arrived {{with the opening of the}} sleek new Ritz cinema.|$|R
50|$|Large {{hardware}} {{stores such as}} Home Depot often sell larger tools, such as drills or <b>electric</b> <b>saws,</b> for cost or below. They do this expecting customers to buy accessories such as blades, drill bits, stands, or cases, along with the new tool. These items {{tend to have a}} much higher profit margin, and are often impulse buys.|$|R
50|$|Police {{located a}} pick-up truck branded with a Grama Sintética (Synthetic Turf) logo {{found at the}} rented property. Bolt cutters, a blow torch, an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> and other tools used to {{penetrate}} the concrete barrier were found both inside the vault and within the empty property. The property was covered in burnt lime to avoid fingerprints.|$|R
5000|$|A settler group named Tazpit Unit stated to have {{documented}} Palestinians destroying trees {{with the intention}} of blaming settlers for the destruction. Photos taken by the group allegedly show Palestinians and left-wing activists cutting down Palestinian olive trees using an <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> The settlers stated that many of the reported [...] "price tag" [...] operations by settlers were actually carried out by Palestinians with the aim of tarnishing the settlers' image.|$|R
5000|$|In 1943 {{he created}} his most {{important}} invention, an oscillating <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> [...] "such that the cutter is actuated with a relatively short oscillating stroke {{of the order of}} one-eighth of an inch", that cuts and removes casts but would not cut skin. [...] He received a patent in 1947 and the principle is used today in the [...] "Stryker Saw", the standard surgical tool for bone and plaster casts.|$|R
25|$|Gradually, the parodies {{grew more}} complex {{over time as}} they were altered to {{resemble}} movie posters, and statues. Examples of parodies include pictures of Lee holding an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> before the Chinese, driving a crane towards Li, and Lee in Goku's costume in his Super Saiyan form. As of June 2006, the number of parodies have exceeded 200. Less frequently, the Chinese athlete (Yang Chen) in the background {{has been the subject}} of photoshopping.|$|R
40|$|The Schismostat is {{the result}} of {{experiments}} to remove plaster casts quickly and without fear of injury to the patient, with the emphasis on safety. Cutting equipment, particularly the blade of an <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> frequently causes damage. The Schismostat can be used on plasters as soon as they are applied, and it does not matter whether they are padded or not. The technique does require, however, that the plaster be applied in a particular manner...|$|R

Olivia says she recognizes the victim as Raul Lugo from their time in the Marines together. Peter and Walter go to a local {{hardware}} store and buy an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> to cut the man out of the wall.|$|R
50|$|The Former Workshop, Drying Shed, Moulding Shed, Sawmill site, Office, Veneer Mill, Former Plywood Sheds, Switching Shed, Butter Box Factory and {{remnants}} of the internal tramway demonstrate a rare combination of all elements of a saw milling operation including the steam and <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> mill equipment which formed at least two generations of milling. A rare set of butter box making machinery remains intact and demonstrates a dedicated technology which links the dairy and timber industries, two significant industries on the Atherton Tablelands.|$|R
5000|$|Kehoe-era M.I.R.V. shows often {{featured}} songs {{punctuated by}} interludes of lunacy, usually featuring a verbal interchange between Haggard and Kehoe. Often Haggard would announce a contest {{for the women}} in the audience, after which the winner would be cajoled into grabbing Kehoe's groin, causing him to sing in a high-pitched operatic voice. Kehoe would often sing the Neapolitan standard [...] "'O Sole Mio" [...] following the antics. M.I.R.V. shows would regularly feature Haggard playing an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> during portions of the concerts.|$|R

A new cementitious material, 2 ̆ 7 concrete lumber 2 ̆ 7 products (SubstiwoodTM) developed by Substiwood Inc. is structurally strong, durable, nailable with conventional screws and nails, and sawable using hand or <b>electric</b> <b>saws.</b> Unlike other construction alternatives to wood framing, the SubstiwoodTM products essentially maintain the existing wood frame construction methods, processes, equipment, and skilled labor...|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} cut into 20-centimeter pieces using an <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> and the muscle was {{carefully}} cut away. After this, {{the body was}} carefully washed and drained of all its blood; this would require the skills of a highly trained medical doctor. The body was not battered {{and there were no}} traces of drugs, so the cause of death could not be determined. There were slight traces of internal bleeding in the muscle, indicating that the man may have been cut while still alive.|$|R
50|$|Sanford {{was born}} and raised in Winnetka, Illinois, an upscale suburb of Chicago. She is the second of five {{children}} born to an Irish Catholic family. Sanford's family was prominent in the area. Her great-grandfather, Joseph W. Sullivan, co-founded Skil Corporation, which manufactured the first portable <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> Her uncle and another grandfather, both lawyers, headed the Winston and Strawn law firm. Sanford also is the niece of Anne Reynolds Skakel, who was the wife Rushton Skakel, who in turn is the brother of Ethel Kennedy.|$|R
50|$|House {{brings the}} <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> and a scalpel to the scene, and {{explains}} that he cannot give her anesthesia, since it is too risky, forcing him to amputate the leg with her awake, followed by her screams. She is immediately taken to an ambulance, which then departs for Princeton-Plainsboro. On the ride back, House continues the differential on the crane operator through the phone and deduces {{that he has a}} spinal cyst. Hanna suddenly has trouble breathing. House realizes she has a fat embolism, caused by the amputation.|$|R
50|$|The {{workshop}} {{was located}} at Artistic Spaces located in South Bermondsey, London however, relocated to Shoreditch, London in late 2014. The company produces innovative handmade acoustic guitars {{created by the}} company’s founder Luke Joseph Sharples. The production of each instrument is done using hand tools and traditional methods {{without the use of}} electric tools or machines. CNC, side bending machines nor <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> or drills are used {{in the construction of the}} instruments. The company’s instrument production is structured to allow their luthiers to create an instrument from beginning to completion without the use of a factory line structure.|$|R
50|$|Andreas Stihl {{designed}} and hand {{built the first}} chain saw in 1926. The <b>saw</b> was <b>electric</b> powered, and weighed in at about 64 kg. The Stihl name soon became popular, and also became synonymous with professional grade chain saws and would soon become the number one selling chain saw company in the world, a title that the company retains to this day. Stihl growth was slow initially, as the chainsaws hit the market {{about the same time}} as the Great Depression; with manpower cheap, and old two-man saws proven, there was no need for power saws. The early saws were very heavy, and often needed two men to operate them. Some outfits had a wheeled generator which had a power cord to run to the <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> Stihl saws were used by the Wehrmacht, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia, where timber was cut for defensive positions.|$|R

30|$|This {{experimental}} osteotomy {{model in}} rabbits {{was reported by}} Matos et al. [9]. Under aseptic technique conditions, the fibula of each animal was accessed by approximately 5 -mm lateral incision on the right pelvic limb. After division of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, the fascia of fibular muscles and periosteum were opened and dissected from the cranial portion of the fibula. Shaft osteotomy {{was performed on the}} cranial portion of the exposed fibula, using an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> with a standardized blade (10.0  mm wide, 0.5  mm thick). The incision was closed in layers, using absorbable 5 - 0 polyvicryl sutures for the fascia and 5 - 0 mononylon sutures for the skin.|$|R

50|$|Michel {{then tried}} again, using {{a piece of}} wood with a notch carved into it. In the notch, he mounted the same {{mechanism}} as the mechanical reaper, but with a 6 inch blade. This was the first <b>electric</b> circular <b>saw.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kickback is {{primarily}} caused by cutting with the chain in the [...] "kickback zone" [...] on the bar, the upper {{quarter of the}} nose. Some <b>saws,</b> usually <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> intended for domestic garden use, shield this whole area from contact with a [...] "tip protector". All cutting produces a reaction force on the saw: normally this should be the lower edge of the bar, where the chain is travelling towards the saw and the reaction tends to pull the saw safely towards the log, against the spur dogs. Where the chain is moving downwards, as {{at the tip of}} the bar, the same reaction force now acts upwards and will cause a kickback upwards.|$|R

40|$|Aims: To compare several {{different}} instruments used {{to open the}} chest wall during necropsy and to assess whether any one type reduced the production of sharp rib ends and thus the potential for receiving an injury. Methods: During the necropsy the pathologist opened the chest wall using two randomly assigned instruments from a selection of hand <b>saw,</b> <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> rib shears, and bread knife. The age, weight, sex, and height of the deceased were recorded, {{in addition to the}} textures of the resultant exposed rib ends. During the procedure, the speed, length, production of spray, and site of incision were also noted. The thoracic cavity was inspected and any details of tumours, adhesions, fluid, or organ damage were noted. Results: Twenty four necropsies were carried out on a...|$|R
50|$|In June 2006, Réal Vallée, a local {{fisherman}} {{engaged in}} snow crab and whelk fishing aboard the catamaran Realice, had strung {{a series of}} cages on the river bottom, secured at both ends by small anchors attached to buoys. One of these anchors got snagged onto the cable. The anchor with the cable attached was hauled out of the water, and Vallée freed it by cutting the cable with an <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> Several days later, {{the same thing happened}} and he cut the cable again. He had done so, believing that the cable had been abandoned (according to a handwritten note on a map he had seen at a local museum). Remote monitoring controls operated by Telus indicated that the Sunoque I parted about 8.9 km off Baie-Comeau.|$|R
5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a hydro-electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of <b>electric</b> <b>saws</b> and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of silicosis. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for coal miners.|$|R
50|$|When {{they arrive}} in Detroit, however, {{they find that}} life {{is in many ways}} worse for them. The wartime housing project {{apartment}} is small and the neighborhood industrial. The schools are bad, and the winter is hard, the food poor. Money is short and the family must often borrow to buy necessities. There is not always enough food to feed the family. She begins to waiver in her Christian faith. Clovis's work can be unsteady. Gertie develops some new friends among the other women in the housing project, and she finds that she is able to sell her carvings which helps them get by. Later Gertie reluctantly lets Clovis convince her to use an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> to make the dolls to increase her sales, even though these machine-made dolls are ugly compared to her beautiful hand-carved dolls.|$|R
40|$|Dismemberment {{of human}} remains usually catches the {{attention}} of the media and the public. Marks left on the bones can provide clues about the methods and tools used that contribute {{to an understanding of the}} circumstances surrounding a death. The purpose of my study is to validate the use of minimum kerf width to identify saw type used on nonhuman bones, and show that it is similar to those marks made on human bone. Using nonhuman bones and three different types of saws several cuts were made and then measured. The results of this study, when compared to the other two studies (Symes 1992, Love 2010) show that mine match the Love’s study to the thousands decimal place. Symes’ study is rounded to the hundredth place. The range between all the studies is from 0. 04 inches to 0. 032 inches. The differences between both Love’s (2010) study and mine when compared to Symes’ (1992) study are shown in the standard deviation. My study was one thousandth smaller than Love’s study for the Hacksaws results, and one thousandth higher when measuring the width of the <b>electric</b> <b>saw.</b> The results that I got differed from Symes’ results for the hacksaw with 18 teeth per inch, and the <b>electric</b> <b>saw,</b> possibly because he rounded to the hundredth place and, in accordance with Love’s study (2010) I rounded to the thousandth. The number of cuts used in the test could also contribute to the differences in the results. Using a box and whiskers plot the end results for the minimum kerf width of each test are displayed separately, demonstrating the similarities and differences. These results support previous studies that demonstrate minimum kerf width can be used to distinguish between hacksaws and reciprocating saws. In addition they show that cow bone can be used as a proxy for human bone in experimental studies of this type...|$|R
50|$|Grief's {{assistant}} Mrs. Stellenbosch, {{arrives at}} the Friend's house by helicopter. Smithers meets with Alex undercover as a farmer and provides him with some equipment and gadgets (including an <b>electric</b> <b>saw</b> disguised into a Sony Discman, an explosive ear stud, a bulletproof ski suit, infrared ski goggles, and a Harry Potter book with a tranquilizer dart concealed in the spine). Alex is forced to sacrifice his only weapon by tranquilizing Fiona with his book when she threatens to expose him to Stellenbosch out of spite. Alex is taken to a hotel in Paris, where his dinner drink is drugged. His bed is then transported where Mrs. Stellenbosch has Alex stripped completely naked, photographed, examined, and measured. After the examination, Alex's clothes are put back on and he is returned to his hotel room; Alex awakens knowing only {{that he has been}} drugged for some unknown purpose.|$|R
