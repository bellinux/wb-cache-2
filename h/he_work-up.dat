40|$|This is a {{case report}} of an aggressive, diffusely disseminated Stage IV rectal {{gastrointestinal}} stromal tumor (GIST) in a 57 -year-old male that presented for symptoms of malaise, constipation, and twenty pound weight loss in 2 months. Upon rectal examination, a hard 4  centimeter submucosal mass was found at the 9 – 12 o’clock position. Liver and lung metastases were visualized on computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on metastatic <b>work-up.</b> <b>He</b> was deemed a poor surgical candidate due to diffuse metastatic disease and referred for palliative chemotherapy.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} common glial tumor of adulthood. Nevertheless, a primary spinal {{intramedullary}} location is very rare. An early diagnosis is important because there is rapid clinical deterioration and a mean survival of approximately one year. We discuss the clinical and radiological findings and course of a primary spinal GBM with diffuse involvement of the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. A 39 year-old-man presented with numbness in the hands and feet. After a laboratory <b>work-up,</b> <b>he</b> was diagnosed with type-II diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy and myelitis were considered in the differential diagnosis. However, the clinical findings progressed rapidly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical and thoracic spine showed an intramedullary lesion diffusely involving the cervical and upper thoracic level with peripheral edema. After fine needle aspiration biopsy, GBM was diagnosed. The lesion was removed subtotally at surgery. Radiotherapy was planned, but his clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and he died. He survived for about 8 months after diagnosis. The early radiological and clinical findings of primary spinal GBM can be confused with other spinal cord intramedulllary pathologies. The frequency of reported primary spinal GBM cases is increasing...|$|R

Portal Vein thrombosis (PVT) increases {{the difficulty of}} liver transplant; however, {{it is not an}} absolute contraindication. Cavoportal hemitransposition (CPH) is an option for patients with complete PVT and no alternative collateral vein. Our center often performs the piggyback technique for the hepatic vein reconstruction, which allows for great access to the recipient vena cava in patients with known complete PVT that may need a CPH preformed to successfully restore flow to the portal system of the donor liver. We describe the use of the piggy-back technique to prepare the vena cava for possible CPH in patients with known complete PVT. 1. Clinical Case A 40 -year-old male with primary sclerosing cholangitis and a previous history of colectomy with j-pouch for ulcerative colitis was listed for cadaveric liver transplant with a MELD of 33.

30|$|A 76 -year old {{man with}} a history of {{bilateral}} lacrimal gland masses and an otherwise unremarkable ocular examination underwent left orbital biopsy at another institution. Clinical suspicion was high for possible lymphoma due to the additional presence of cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. The histologic diagnosis at that time was reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry, kappa/lambda in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry were negative for lymphoma. The patient was lost to follow-up without any further <b>work-up.</b> <b>He</b> presented a year later due to recurrence of orbital inflammation, at which point the surgeon requested histologic work-up for IgG 4 -related disease. The slides from the prior orbital biopsy were requested and reviewed, showing lymphoid follicles with intervening bands of fibrosis and mixed chronic inflammatory cells. The tissue block was also received, and additional sections were cut for CD 138 and IgG 4 immunostaining. There were at least 150 – 180 IgG 4 -positive plasma cells per high-power field, comprising over 40  % of the total plasma cell population (as assessed by CD 138). (Serum IgG 4 was not obtained.) This was considered consistent with IgG 4 -associated orbital inflammatory pseudotumor with sclerosing features. The patient was initially treated with prednisone and then transitioned to intravenous rituximab as first-line therapy and had an excellent response with no recurrence at 2  years following therapy.|$|R
40|$|In 1984, a 56 -year-old {{house painter}} {{developed}} intractable {{pain in his}} back and other joints. After several unrevealing medical <b>work-ups,</b> <b>he</b> {{was found to have}} a high blood lead level (122 µg/dL); he has a history of scraping and sanding lead paint without adequate protective measures. The patient was hospitalized and chelated with EDTA four times over the next 5 years; each time he felt better {{at the end of his}} treatment, but he returned to largely the same working conditions. He developed hypertension in April 1989, underwent a final chelation, and retired. He was subsequently followed on a regular basis with repeated measurement of lead levels in blood and bone (using a K-x-ray fluorescence instrument) as well as clinical parameters. In 1995 his blood pressure became difficult to control despite a sequential increase in his antihypertensive medication dosages and the addition of new medications. In 1997 he began calcium supplementation and a high-calcium diet; his blood pressure declined markedly, allowing him to taper off of two of his four antihypertensive medications. This case demonstrates an occupational activity (construction) that has now become the dominant source of lead exposure for U. S. adults, the importance of a good occupational history to suspecting and making a diagnosis, the possible outcomes of chronic lead toxicity, and the importance of preventing further exposure and using proper methods t...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous reossification of the sellar floor after transsphenoidal surgery {{has been}} rarely reported. Strontium ranelate, a divalent {{strontium}} salt, {{has been shown}} to increase bone formation, increasing osteoblast activity. We describe an unusual case of a young patient with Cushing’s disease who was treated with strontium ranelate for low bone mass who experienced spontaneous sellar reossification after transsphenoidal surgery. A 21 -year-old male presented with Cushing’s features. His past medical history included delayed puberty diagnosed at 16  years, treated with testosterone for 3  years without further <b>work-up.</b> <b>He</b> was diagnosed with Cushing’s disease initially treated with transsphenoidal surgery, which was not curative. The patient did not come to follow-up visits for more than 1  year. He was prescribed strontium ranelate 2 g orally once daily for low bone mass by an outside endocrinologist, which he received for more than 1  year. Two years after first surgery he was reevaluated and persisted with active Cushing’s disease. Magnetic resonance image revealed a left 4 mm hypointense mass, with sphenoid sinus occupation by a hyperintense material. At repeated transsphenoidal surgery, sellar bone had a very hard consistency; surgery was complicated and the patient died. Sellar reossification negatively impacted surgery outcomes in this patient. While this entity is possible after transsphenoidal surgery, it remains unclear whether strontium ranelate could have affected sellar ossification...|$|R
40|$|A 71 -year-old gentleman with {{background}} hypertension, dyslipidemia, ex-smoker, permanent atrial fibrillation, {{and chronic}} obstructive lung disease presents to our institu-tion with exertional dyspnea (New York Heart Association class III–IV) for aortic valve replacement assessment. Cardiovascular history includes mechanical mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical 25 mm) alongside {{coronary artery bypass}} (venous grafts to right coronary artery and obtuse marginal) in 2004, cerebrovascular accident in 2008 with multiple transient ischemic attacks since (latest 2012), and subacute subdural hematoma requiring evacuation (2013). As part of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation <b>work-up,</b> <b>he</b> underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed a calcific, degenerative severe aortic stenosis (mean gradient, 45 mm Hg; max aortic valve velocity, 4. 3 m/s; and aortic valve area, 0. 8 cm 2) with associated moderate regur-gitation. There was preserved left ventricular function with concentric hypertrophy. The mechanical mitral valve was functioning well with a mean transvalvular gradient of 5 mm Hg and no paravalvular leaks. There were no prominent mechanical mitral valve pivot guards protruding in the left ventricular outflow tract (Figure 1 A– 1 C). Multislice com-puted tomography scan revealed a tricuspid aortic valve with extensive fibrocalcific degeneration of the cusps. Annulus perimeter was 68 mm and annulus area was calculated at 3. 46 cm 2. Minimum ilio-femoral diameter was 5. 8 cm (both sides). Cardiac computed tomography revealed patent grafts and moderate stenoses at the mid and distal segments of the left anterior descending artery. After discussion with the hear...|$|R
40|$|Renal mucinous tubular and {{spindle cell}} {{carcinoma}} (MTSCC) was recently {{described as a}} distinct subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the 2004 World Health Organization classification of kidney tumors. MTSCC is a rare low grade malignancy with < 100 cases reported in the literature. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are 5 case reports with a total of 6 patients describing its diagnosis by fine needle aspiration (FNA). All of these cases were diagnosed as conventional RCC on FNA. Subsequent excisions proved them to be MTSCC. We herein report a case in a 67 -year-old male. He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a new colon adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver and lungs. The extent of disease made the patient ineligible for surgical excision, and <b>he</b> received chemotherapy. <b>Work-up</b> also revealed a kidney mass which was later biopsied by FNA and core biopsy. The tumor was composed of epithelial and spindled cell components embedded in a myxoid background. It was positive for CK 7, AMCAR, vimentin, and epithelial membrane antigen. The tumor was diagnosed as MTSCC. One year later the kidney mass remained stable. However, the patient developed new metastasis to the liver from colonic primary. The kidney mass was not resected. Although rarely encountered in FNA cytology of the kidney, we believe the cytologic features of this tumor are distinctive and are different from conventional and other subtypes of RCC. Therefore, its accurate diagnosis on FNA is possible once pathologists are aware that MTSCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of kidney tumors...|$|R
40|$|Presented at American College Physicians {{national}} meeting, 04 / 11 / 2014, Orlando, FL. Winner of resident competition. American College of Physicians New Mexico Chapter Scientific Meeting, 10 / 18 / 2013, Albuquerque, NM. Pulmonary emboli {{are potentially}} life threatening events frequently considered {{in patients with}} pulmonary complaints. The diagnosis {{is more likely to}} be missed when another obvious pulmonary pathology can explain the same complaints. A 54 year old male without any significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with 1 week of malaise, nonproductive cough and 2 days of dyspnea. At presentation he endorsed pleuritic chest pain and headaches. He had smoked half a pack per day until the week prior. He was afebrile, slightly tachycardic and profoundly hypoxic requiring 15 liters on a nonrebreather. His physical exam was unremarkable and chest xray showed a left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with a bronchial pneumonia vs aspiration. Labs showed a mild leukocytosis and transaminitis. He was admitted and started on community acquired pneumonia treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin with the addition of tamiflu since he had not received a flu shot that year. On hospital day 4 he had not had significant improvement and infectious labs including a flu PCR were negative so he underwent a noncontrasted CT scan that showed extensive inflammatory bronchiolitis that favored a viral or atypical pneumonia. On hospital day 7 because of persistent hypoxia and other negative <b>work-up</b> <b>he</b> underwent CT-chest angiogram which revealed multiple segmental pulmonary emboli in his right lower lobe. He had been onprophylactic anticoagulation per protocol since hospital admission. Several days later his mycoplasma IgG and IgM both came back positive. He was already being treated with azithromycin and a high dose prednisone taper was added per Pulmonary recommendations. He required a total of 16 days in the hospital primarily because of his high oxygen requirement and when discharged he was still requiring 4 L of oxygen. He was discharged on coumadin, a lovenox bridge and prednisone. This case is particularly important because we frequently use the risk stratification model to determine whether a patient should undergo work-up for pulmonary emboli and one question in that model is whether another diagnosis can better explain the patient’s symptoms. In this case the patient did not have any risk factors for pulmonary emboli and had evidence of infection that could explain his symptoms. Another important point this case illustrates is that mycoplasma bronchiolitis in particular, and any inflammatory process in general, may cause a hypercoagulable state raising the possibility of pulmonary emboli. While risk stratification is an important clinical tool, clinical judgment must be used to recognize when a patient is not responding as expected to clinical treatments thus prompting reconsideration of the initial diagnosis...|$|R
