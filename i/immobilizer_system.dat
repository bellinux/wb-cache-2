50|$|The Texas Instruments digital {{signature}} transponder (DST) is a cryptographically enabled radio-frequency identification (RFID) device {{used in a}} variety of wireless authentication applications. The largest deployments of the DST include the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass payment system (approximately 7 million transponders), as well as a variety of vehicle <b>immobilizer</b> <b>systems</b> used in many late model Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Toyota, and Nissan vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{vulnerabilities}} {{were found}} in the immobilisers designed to protect modern cars from theft. Many vehicle immobilisers use the Megamos-chip which is proven to be crackable. Megamos transponder is one of many different transponders found in today's <b>immobilizer</b> <b>systems</b> and also comes in many different iterations. Hacking of an immobiliser in the real world would happen on the vehicle not on the key. It would be faster to program a new key to the vehicle than to try and clone the existing key, especially on modern vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{vulnerability}} {{exposed by}} the Hopkins team indicates potential security threats {{to millions of}} vehicles which are protected using DST-based <b>immobilizer</b> <b>systems,</b> and to the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass system. The ideal {{solution to this problem}} is to replace the DST transponder in these systems with a device provisioned with a more robust cryptographic circuit utilizing a longer key length. However, the cost of recalling these security systems is prohibitively high, and-- as of October 2005-- neither Texas Instruments, Exxon-Mobil or any vehicle manufacturer has announced such a recall. Currently the most effective protections against this attack rely on user vigilance, e.g., protecting transponder keys, auditing Speedpass invoices for fraud, and optionally using a metallic shield (such as aluminum foil) to prevent unauthorized scanning of DST tags. This vulnerability has also spawned the creation of the RSA Blocker Tag and RFID Blocking Wallets.|$|R

50|$|In {{automotive}} electronics, {{body control}} module or 'body computer' is a generic term for an electronic control unit responsible for monitoring and controlling various electronic accessories in a vehicle's body.Typically in a car the BCM controls the power windows, power mirrors, air conditioning, <b>immobilizer</b> <b>system,</b> central locking, etc.The BCM communicates with other on-board computers via the car's vehicle bus, and its main application is controlling load drivers - actuating relays that in turn perform actions in the vehicle such as locking the doors or dimming the salon overhead lamp.|$|E
50|$|At 8:30 p.m., the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Portage la Prairie {{received}} {{a report of}} a stabbing on a Greyhound bus west of the city. They arrived to find the suspect still on board the bus, being prevented from escaping by another passenger, the bus driver, and a truck driver who had provided a crowbar and a hammer as weapons. The other passengers were huddled at the roadside, some of them crying and vomiting. As the suspect had earlier attempted to escape by driving the bus away, the driver had engaged the emergency <b>immobilizer</b> <b>system,</b> rendering the vehicle inoperable. Witnesses had observed the suspect stabbing and cutting McLean's body, and carrying McLean's severed head.|$|E

30|$|The {{rapid pace}} {{at which the}} {{technological}} innovations are being introduced in the world poses a potential challenge to the retailer, supplier, and enterprises. In the field of Information Technology (IT) there is a rapid growth in the last 30 Â years (Want 2006; Landt 2005). One {{of the most promising}} technological innovations in IT is radio frequency identification (RFID) (Dutta et al. 2007; Whitaker et al. 2007; Bottani et al. 2009). The RFID technology was evolved in 1945 as an espionage tool invented by Leon Theremin for the Soviet Government (Nikitin et al. 2013, Tedjini et al. 2012). At that time it was mainly used by the military. The progress in microchip design, antenna technology and radio spread spectrum pushed it into various applications like supply chain management, retail, automatic toll collection by tunnel companies, animal tracking, ski lift access, tracking library books, theft prevention, vehicle <b>immobilizer</b> <b>systems,</b> railway rolling stock identification, movement tracking, security, healthcare, printing, textiles and clothing (Weinstein 2005; Liu and Miao 2006; Rao et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2009; Tan 2008). RFID can make the companies more competitive by changing the related processes in supply chain, manufacturing and retailing.|$|R

50|$|The SmartKey's {{electronics}} {{are embedded}} in a hollow, triangular piece of plastic, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, squared-off at the tip with a half-inch-long insert piece. The side of the SmartKey also hides a traditional Mercedes-Benz key that can be pulled out from a release at top. The metal key is used for valet purposes such as locking the glovebox and/or trunk before the SmartKey is turned over to a parking attendant. Once locked manually, the trunk cannot be opened with the SmartKey or interior buttons. The key fob utilizes a radio-frequency transponder {{to communicate with the}} door locks, but it uses infrared to communicate with the engine <b>immobilizer</b> <b>system.</b> Original SmartKeys had a limited frequency and could have only been used in line-of-sight for safety purposes. The driver can also point the smart key at the front driver side door while pushing and holding the unlock button on the SmartKey and the windows and the sunroof will open in order to ventilate the cabin. Similarly, if the same procedure is completed while holding the lock button, the windows and sunroof will close. In cars equipped with the Active Ventilated Seats, the summer opening feature will activate the seat ventilation in addition to opening the windows and sunroof.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Honda {{introduced}} the NSX's biggest performance upgrades {{for all its}} worldwide markets. Engine displacement increased from 3.0 L to 3.2 L using a thinner fiber-reinforced metal (FRM) cylinder liner. The exhaust manifold was reconfigured and made of stainless steel header pipes rather than a cast-iron manifold for improved performance and lighter weight. The increased flow from this new configuration was a key contributor to the 20 additional horsepower drawn from the new engine. This revised 3.2 L C32B engine gave it slightly more rated power: from [...] to [...] while torque increased from 285 Nm to 305 Nm (manual transmission only). The net result increased the horsepower to weight ratio of the NSX by 7%. The 4-speed automatic model retained its 3.0 L engine and 252 hp power output. Another big change was {{the adoption of a}} 6-speed manual transmission with closer gear ratios and the addition of 3rd to 4th gear dual cone synchronizers. To handle the new engine's added torque and power the small diameter twin-disc clutch system of the 5-speed was replaced by a dual-mass low-inertia single disc clutch system. To offset the weight increase of the new 6-speed transmission and larger brake rotors, which were upped from 11.1 in to 11.732 in, key body parts were made with a new aluminum alloy that was up to 50% stronger allowing thinner lighter material {{to be used in the}} doors, fenders, and front and rear deck lids without any sacrifice of strength. Using this hi-strength alloy the net curb weight increase, despite adding many improvements, was only 22 lbs. Other notable changes included a keyless entry system and vehicle <b>immobilizer</b> <b>system.</b> The combination of slightly increased power and torque and a 6-speed gearbox, with ratios optimized to improve straight-line acceleration, produced better performance numbers over previous models than the modest increases would suggest. Motor Trend and Road and Track (Feb 97) tests of 3.2L 6-speed equipped NSX-T (Targa) roofed cars produced 0-60 mph times of 4.8 and 5.0 seconds and quarter-mile times of 13.3s and 13.5s respectively. 0-60 mph times dropped to as low as 4.5 seconds using a 3.2L hard top coupe model as recorded by Car and Driver in their August 1998 0-150-0 issue. That NSX proved to be the fastest ever tested in North America. When Car and Driver tested the 1999 Zanardi special edition coupe a year later it produced a 4.8s 0-60 and a 13.2s quarter-mile. Although magazine tests for the 02+ models were rare Honda apparently kept improving the engine as Sports and Exotic Car magazine did a farewell article on a 2005 NSX-T and recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7s and a 13.1s quarter-mile.|$|E

40|$|AbstractâNowadays, {{keyless entry}} systems are widely adopted for vehicle {{immobilizer}} systems due to both advantages {{of security and}} convenience. Keyless entry systems could overcome brute-force key guessing attack, statistics attack and masquerade attack, however, they can't prevent from thieves stealing behavior. In this paper, we proposed a new architecture try to improve the existent flaws. The integration of the keyless entry system and the fingerprint identification technology is more suitable to implement on the portable transponder to achieve higher security needs. We also adopt and modify AES security protocol for life expectancy and security of the portable transponder. In addition, the identification of a driver's fingerprint makes the service of automatic reinstatement of a driver's preferences become possible. Our design can satisfy not only the three kinds of previous illegal attacks, but also the stealing situation. Furthermore, many practical factors, such as costs, life expectancy and performance, have been well considered {{in the design of}} portable transponder.
