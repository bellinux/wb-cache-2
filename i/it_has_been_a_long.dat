25|$|North Korea {{possesses}} {{a vast array}} of long range artillery in shelters just north of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> standing cause for concern that a preemptive strike or retaliatory strike on Seoul using this arsenal of artillery north of the Demilitarized Zone would lead to a massive loss of life in Seoul. Estimates on how many people would die in an attack on Seoul vary. When the Clinton administration mobilized forces over the reactor at Yongbyon in 1994, planners concluded that retaliation by North Korea against Seoul could kill 40,000 people. Other estimates projects hundreds of thousands or possibly millions of fatalities if North Korea uses chemical munitions.|$|E

Following this appearance, Coulson said: [...] "I really enjoyed that chance and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time coming". His second Barnsley goal came with the winner in an FA Cup third round 2–1 victory over Blackpool on 5 January 2008, which was his first goal at Oakwell. He made an appearance as an 80th-minute substitute for match winner Kayode Odejayi in the 1–0 home victory over Premier League team Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final on 8 March 2008. He suffered a knee injury in training on 21 April 2008, rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament, which was expected to keep him sidelined for seven to nine months. Manager Simon Davey commented: [...] "It's a complete disaster for him. He'd been coming on really well. He was the first name I looked {{to put on the}} bench". Some consolation came after being named as Barnsley's Young Player of the Year for 2007–08. He finished the season with 16 appearances and one goal for Barnsley.|$|E
