5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} as Speaker of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> the governorship, to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> the governorship. This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. Because he never resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and the governorship concurrently.|$|E

Refusing to accept this, he bolts past security and argues with the judges to let him audition. When they refuse, he throws a crying tantrum. Later, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets his former office workers. All together, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS's Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Calls by the {{legislature}} for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign {{on the condition that}} he be allowed to choose his successor. Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, and Robinson assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.|$|E

5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the {{resumption}} of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{government}} {{found it}} bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, {{which had already}} been self-governing for four decades and {{which was one of}} the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the basis for this apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be first <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black nationalist leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> the game.|$|E
