5|$|Once elected, {{the council}} plays a largely passive {{role in the}} city government; it meets only once a month. The current council is divided between a {{coalition}} of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> from smaller parties.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} bred {{for use on}} farms, <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of {{the breed}} are used for agricultural purposes today, and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas. However, the Carlsberg brewery has used the Jutland to pull its drays since 1928. The brewery owned 210Jutlands at their peak, and today still uses about 20 for transporting beer around Copenhagen. The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations at many shows, promoting the brewery and the breed.|$|E

5|$|Her {{childhood}} was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea. Her {{father was a}} younger brother of Alexander II, and her mother {{was considered one of}} the most intelligent and elegant women of the court. Olga was particularly close to her older brother, Nicholas, and was one of the <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to Tashkent.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{warned the}} Pennsylvania {{congress}} members {{that he would}} attack the bill as unconstitutional in the House, and followed up on his threat. Madison argued his case of where {{the power of a}} bank could be established within the Constitution, but he failed to sway members of the House, and his authority on the constitution was questioned by a <b>few</b> <b>members.</b> The bill eventually passed in an overwhelming fashion 39 to 20, on February 8, 1791.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on {{the margin}} of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E

5|$|Under US and UN pressure, Pakistan {{arrested a}} <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, {{but he was}} found to be free a few days later. A year after the attacks, Mumbai police {{continued}} to complain that Pakistani authorities were not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Pakistani authorities had not shared any information about American suspects Headley and Rana, but that the FBI had been more forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
5|$|Although rodents {{have been}} {{regarded}} traditionally as herbivores, {{a number of}} species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Pacific War the {{strategic}} port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by 'Lark Force', which comprised the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron. While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military, {{it was not possible to}} reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942. The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle. <b>Few</b> <b>members</b> of Lark Force survived the war, as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan (Montevideo Maru) was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|During Fineshriber's {{early years}} the {{congregation}} continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, <b>few</b> <b>members</b> had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
5|$|On social issues, Gillibrand is {{generally}} liberal, supporting abortion rights, legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2017, {{she came out}} in favor of single-payer healthcare, and cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which would gradually expand the existing Medicare program to cover all Americans. She is a strong advocate for government transparency, being one of a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information. She is also a strong supporter of female equality and involvement, having begun the website offthesidelines.org in 2011. Although a supporter of gun rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction of gun control.|$|E

5|$|Only 160 {{men out of}} the 600 {{members of}} the 9th Battalion tasked with {{eliminating}} the enemy battery at Merville arrived at the rendezvous point. Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, {{in charge of the}} operation, decided to proceed regardless, as the emplacement had to be destroyed by 06:00 to prevent it firing on the invasion fleet and the troops arriving on Sword Beach. In the Battle of Merville Gun Battery, Allied forces disabled the guns with plastic explosives at a cost of 75 casualties. The emplacement was found to contain 75mm guns rather than the expected 150mm heavy coastal artillery. Otway's remaining force withdrew with the assistance of a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{founding}} of Freemasonry, many Bishops of the Church of England have been Freemasons, such as Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher. In the past, <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practising Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons {{inside and outside the}} Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{emerged in}} the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar {{immigrant}} who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976 and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} UN {{headquarters}} has extraterritoriality status. This affects some {{law enforcement}} where UN rules override the laws of New York City, {{but it does not}} give immunity to those who commit crimes there. In addition, the United Nations Headquarters remains under the jurisdiction and laws of the United States, although a <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the UN staff have diplomatic immunity and so cannot be prosecuted by local courts unless the diplomatic immunity is waived by the Secretary-General. In 2005, Secretary-General Kofi Annan waived the immunity of Benon Sevan, Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladimir Kuznetsov in relation to the Oil-for-Food Programme, and all were charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Benon Sevan later fled the United States to Cyprus, while Aleksandr Yakovlev and Vladimir Kuznetsov decided to stand trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} may appoint anyone a Privy Counsellor, but {{in practice}} appointments are made only {{on the advice of}} Her Majesty's Government. The majority of appointees are senior politicians, including Ministers of the Crown, the few most senior figures of Loyal Opposition, the Parliamentary leader of the third-largest party, a couple of the most senior figures in the devolved British governments and senior politicians from Commonwealth countries. Besides these, the Council includes a very <b>few</b> <b>members</b> of the Royal Family (usually the consort and heir apparent only), a few dozen judges from British and Commonwealth countries, a few clergy and a small number of senior civil servants.|$|E
