40|$|A single-channel {{color image}} {{encryption}} is proposed based on iterative fractional Fourier transform. The color image to be encrypted is first separated into three independent channels: red, green and blue. Then, {{the red and}} green components are encrypted into a single one based on iterative fractional Fourier transform. Similarly, the <b>interim</b> <b>image</b> and blue component are encrypted into the final gray scale ciphertext with stationary white noise distribution, which has camouflage property to some extent. In the process of encryption and decryption, three different groups of fractional orders, five private phase functions and one common phase function are used as keys to enhance {{the security of the}} proposed system. Additionally, the proposed iterative fractional Fourier transform algorithm has faster convergent speed. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness o...|$|R

5000|$|In 1989 Day had {{her first}} meeting with Phil Bicker, the art {{director}} of The Face. Through Bicker, Day met stylists Anna Cockburn and Melanie Ward, with whom she was to create some of her most iconic <b>images.</b> <b>Day's</b> photographs came to public attention through her fashion editorial for The Face titled, [...] "The Third Summer of Love" [...] published in July 1990. Commissioned by Bicker and styled by Ward, the story used Kate Moss as the model in an eight-page fashion story, showcasing garments by Romeo Gigli, Joseph Tricot, Ralph Lauren, and a feather head-dress from the now-defunct Covent Garden boutique World. Taken during a day trip to Camber Sands, {{a number of the}} photographs depicted the teenage Moss semi-nude and laughing on the beach. The photograph of Moss wearing the feather head-dress featured on the front cover of the magazine is now one of <b>Day's</b> most recognised <b>images.</b> <b>Day</b> had previously worked with Moss on the Levi's 'Levis for Girls' campaign with The Design Corporation.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first 3 D tomographic reconstructions of the coronal {{electron}} density from an extended, high-cadence sequence {{of images of}} the corona's polarized brightness (pB). While the standard LASCO synoptic sequence is only 1 pB <b>image</b> per <b>day,</b> during the 14 day period covering 2006 June 9 - 22, the C 2 coronagraph took about 6. 5 pB <b>images</b> per <b>day.</b> We show that the high cadence dramatically improves {{the quality of the}} tomographic reconstructions when compared to a reconstruction that only uses one <b>image</b> per <b>day.</b> In particular, the reconstruction that uses only one <b>image</b> per <b>day</b> misses important features and has lower spatial resolution. We find that the spatial resolution of the tomographic inversion is ultimately limited by smearing due to coronal dynamics that take place during the 14 days required for data acquisition. We show that when only C 2 images are available, about 4 pB <b>images</b> per <b>day</b> are enough for nearly optimal tomographic reconstruction, but more will be required when STEREO observations are included in the tomographic analysis.

40|$|Abstract:- With the {{improvement}} of Synthetic Aperture Radar, the satellite imagery process becomes easier, because of the characteristic of SAR, which can take <b>images</b> <b>day</b> and night, and back from the clouds. With the help of these characteristics, Automatic Target Detection/Recognition becomes more important. Bridge detection {{is one of the}} subjects of ATD/R. The information gathered by finding bridge locations, can be used in both civil and military applications. In this paper we studied a new algorithm that finds the bridge positions in SAR image. The algorithm consists of some image processing applications, such as; filtering, segmentation, morphology, connectivity and edge detection. After using these algorithms we applied a “distance finding ” algorithm to find the locations of bridges...|$|R
