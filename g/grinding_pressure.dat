In his view je m'en foutism has a hold of the French army. Strange if it had not! Clear, quick brains cannot stand Fate's making ninepins of mankind year after year like this. Fortunately for France, {{the love of her}} sons has never been forced; it has grown like grass and simple wild herbs in the heart, alongside the liberty to criticise and blame. The poilu cares for nothing, no, not he! But he is himself a little, unconscious bit of France, and, for oneself, one always cares. State-forced patriotism made this war--a fever-germ which swells the head and causes blindness. A State which teaches patriotism in its schools is going mad! Let no such State be trusted! They who, after the war, would have England and France copy the example of the State-drilled country which opened these flood-gates of death, and teach mad provincialism under the nickname of patriotism to their children, are driving nails into the coffins of their countries. Je m'en foutism is a natural product of three years of war, and better by far than the docile despair to which so many German soldiers have been reduced. We were in Lyon when the Russian Revolution and the German retreat from Bapaume were reported. The town and railway station were full of soldiers. No enthusiasm, no stir of any kind, only the usual tired stoicism. And one thought of what the poilu can be like; of our Christmas dinner-table at the hospital under the green hanging wreaths and the rosy Chinese lanterns, the hum, the chatter, the laughter of free and easy souls in their red hospital jackets. The French are so easily, so incorrigibly gay; the dreary <b>grinding</b> <b>pressure</b> of this war seems horribly cruel applied to such a people, and the heroism with which they have borne its untold miseries is sublime. In our little remote town out there--a town which had been Roman in its time, and still had bits of Roman walls and Roman arches--every family had its fathers, brothers, sons, dead, fighting, in prison, or in hospital. The mothers were wonderful. One old couple, in a ferblanterie shop, who had lost their eldest son and whose other son was at the front, used to try hard not to talk about the war, but sure enough they would come to it at last, each time we saw them, and in a minute the mother would be crying and a silent tear would roll down the old father's face. Then he would point to the map and say: [...] "But look where they are, the Boches! Can we stop? It's impossible. We must go on till we've thrown them out. It is dreadful, but what would you have? Ah! Our son--he was so promising!" [...] And the mother, weeping over the tin-tacks, would make the neatest little parcel of them, murmuring out of her tears: [...] "Il faut que ça finisse; mais la France--il ne faut pas que la France--Nos chers fils auraient été tués pour rien!" [...] Poor souls! I remember another couple up on the hillside. The old wife, dignified as a duchess--if duchesses are dignified--wanting us so badly to come in and sit down that she might the better talk to us of her sons: one dead, and one wounded, and two still at the front, and the youngest not yet old enough. And while we stood there up came the father, an old farmer, with that youngest son. He had not quite the spirit of the old lady, nor her serenity; he thought that men in these days were no better than des bêtes féroces. And in truth his philosophy--of an old tiller of the soil--was as superior to that of emperors and diplomats as his life is superior to theirs. Not very far from that little farm is the spot of all others in that mountain country which most stirs the æsthetic and the speculative strains within one. Lovely and remote, all by itself {{at the foot of a}} mountain, in a circle of the hills, an old monastery stands, now used as a farm, with one rose window, like a spider's web, spun delicate in stone tracery. There the old monks had gone to get away from the struggles of the main valley and the surges of the fighting men. There even now were traces of their peaceful life; the fish-ponds and the tillage still kept in cultivation. If they had lived in these days they would have been at the war, fighting or bearing stretchers, like the priests of France, of whom eleven thousand, I am told--untruthfully, I hope--are dead. So the world goes forward--the Kingdom of Heaven comes! ...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} industry {{interest in}} high pressure roll grinding (HPGR) technology, {{there is a}} strong incentive for improved {{understanding of the nature of}} <b>grinding</b> <b>pressure</b> that exists in the interior of a compressed particle bed. This corresponds to the crushing region of the HPGR. The relationship between applied pressure (stress) to the particle bed and induced pressure (stress) within particles and at contact points between particles is of particular interest. A detailed parametric investigation is beyond the scope of this exploratory paper. However, this exploratory investigation does suggest some interesting behaviour. The compressed particle bed within an 80 turn diameter piston has been modelled using Particle Flow Code for three dimensions. PFC 3 D is a discrete element code. The total number of simulated particles was 1225 and 2450 for two beds of different thickness. Particle diameters were uniformly distributed between 4 and 4. 5 mm. The results of the simulations show that stress intensity within the simulated particle beds and within the observed particles increased with increase of the applied stress. The intensity of the average vertical stress in the selected particles tended to be comparable with the intensity of the pressure applied to the surface of particle bed and was only occasionally higher. However, the stress at contact points between particles could be several times higher. In a real crusher, such high stress amplification at contacts will quickly decrease due to local crushing and a resultant increase the size of the contact area. Therefore, its significance is likely to be relatively small in an industrial context. The modelling results also suggest that failure within the particle bed will progress from the crushing surface towards the depth of the bed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Spiral {{jet milling}} is a size {{reduction}} process used in various industries, ranging from paints to food and pharmaceuticals. It has great benefit in {{the pharmaceutical industry}} due to its ability to reduce particulate solids to micron sizes and narrow size distributions. Despite its heavy usage, the underlying size reduction mechanism of the mill is not well understood. However it is generally known that the milling behaviour {{is dependent on the}} grinding conditions of the mill, as well as the materials physical and mechanical properties. The system is also very energy inefficient. In this work the milling behaviour of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients in the spiral jet mill has been analysed based on their mechanical properties, as established from the Ghadiri and Zhang semi-brittle breakage model. Using the Single Particle Impact Test Rig, the breakability index (αH/KC 2) of three pharmaceutical materials (paracetamol, aspirin, and α-lactose monohydrate) is determined. It is shown that the order of breakability is paracetamol > aspirin > α-lactose monohydrate. For milling studies the Hosokawa Alpine Aeroplex Spiral Jet Mill 50 AS is used. The change in specific surface area (ΔSSA) due to milling is quantified by size analysis and related to the breakability indices. The order of ΔSSA is α-lactose monohydrate > paracetamol > aspirin at high <b>grinding</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. The loading of particles in the grinding chamber of the mill is found to be an important characteristic for the classification of milled materials in addition to the effects of centrifugal and drag forces. Numerical simulations have been carried out and used to analyse the behaviour of the spiral jet mill. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics, the mechanics of internal particle classification by size of the 50 AS has been analysed. Particles of 2 µm and less are shown to be classified. The Discrete Element Method is coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics to investigate the effect of grinding conditions and particle properties on the particle motion and fluid-particle energy transfer, including gas pressure, the number of particles and the particle size distribution. A very small amount of energy is transferred to the particles from the fluid, highlighting the energy inefficiency of the system. Interparticle interactions are found to have a greater amount of dissipated energy compared to particle-wall interactions, which suggests interparticle collisions are the primary source of particle breakage. The majority of the stress exerted on the particles is close to the wall of the mill, with the normal stress being greater than the shear stress. A very low proportion of particles are found to be in contact at a given time, indicating particle breakage occurs from instantaneous collisions rather than particles shearing against each other. Finally the potential for scale-up of the spiral jet mill is investigated based on the fluid power input to the system. There is a good comparison of the ΔSSA of α-lactose monohydrate milled in four different mills at similar fluid power input conditions. Two of the mills are the 50 AS and the Hosokawa Alpine Piconizer (33 AS), and the other two are of different design but with internal diameters of 2 inches and 4 inches, i. e. roughly similar size to the Hosokawa mills. The latter two mills had a greater fluid power as the grinding nozzle diameters are larger than the Hosokawa mills...|$|E

The BST microparticles were successfully prepared for DPIs by spray drying from feeding solution concentrations of 1 %, 3 %, and 5 % (w/v) and by jet milling at <b>grinding</b> <b>pressures</b> of 2, 3, and 4  MPa. The physicochemical properties of the spray-dried (SD) and jet-milled (JM) microparticles were determined via scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering particle size analysis, Karl Fischer titration, surface analysis, pycnometry, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The in vitro aerosol dispersion performance and drug dissolution behavior were evaluated using an Anderson cascade impactor and a Franz diffusion cell, respectively. The JM microparticles exhibited an irregular corrugated surface and a crystalline solid state, while the SD microparticles were spherical with a smooth surface and an amorphous solid state. Thus, the in vitro aerosol dispersion performance and dissolution behavior as DPIs were considerably different due to the differences in the physicochemical properties of the SD and JM microparticles. In particular, the highest <b>grinding</b> <b>pressures</b> under jet milling exhibited excellent aerosol dispersion performance with statistically higher values of 56. 8 %± 2. 0 % of respirable fraction and 33. 8 %± 2. 3 % of fine particle fraction and lower mass median aerodynamic diameter of 5. 0 ± 0. 3  µm than the others (P< 0. 05, analysis of variance/Tukey).

40|$|Automobiles {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our daily life as more and more mopeds, motor cycles, cars, trucks, busses and trains are being used for transport. The main parts of an automotive engine are cylinder, piston assembly, connecting rod and crank shaft. The piston assembly consists of Piston, Piston rings and Piston Pin. Piston rings are important parts of a piston assembly. Any non-conformance in any quality characteristic of the piston ring leads to deterioration of engine performance. M/S Goetze (India) Limited a medium scale industry and a sister concern of engineering giant M/S Escorts Limited is manufacturing "GOETZE PISTON RINGS" and is producing about 800 varieties of piston rings ranging from 35. 00 mm to 228. 5 mm nominal diameter. The management was facing serious problem due to high scrap rate in certain types of their manufactured piston rings. Hence instead of trying to handle all of them at the same time, it seemed reasonable to tackle and find a suitable approach to solve the quality problem by taking the most notorious ring first, so that once the methodology is understood, documented and applied to the quality problem of this ring, the same can also be invoked for other rings to improve upon their quality, and thus reducing the scrap rate. One particular ring of 83. 0 mm diameter which is delicate and costly, having an average scrap rate of 36. 2 % in past three years is selected for the study. No systematic effort was made in the past to identify the quality characteristics and the processes which were responsible for this high scrap rate and thus no immediate measure could be recommended. As a matter of fact at the beginning of the study it was not even clear which quality characteristics were mainly responsible for such high rejection. So in July' 1999 a pareto analysis was done for the first time to identify the culpability of each quality characteristic for the rejection of the ring. From the Pareto analysis it was observed that maximum proportion of rejection was due to nonconformity in axial thickness. The scrap rate due to nonconformity in axial thickness were collected for each month from Jul’ 999 to Jan' 2000 which averaged at 8. 7 %. Since in every month the major malefactor for rejection was the nonconformity of axial thickness it was decided to first try to improve the quality of axial thickness, before trying to tackle other quality issues associated with this particular piston ring under study. Once the most problematic quality characteristic namely the axial thickness was identified, as a first step towards the goal of improving the quality of axial thickness, it was necessary to pay attention and isolate the manufacturing processes or operations affecting the axial thickness and study them in detail. So first, the entire manufacturing process flow diagram of the piston ring was studied. From the process flow diagram it appeared that there are 4 operations affecting axial thickness viz. Rough Grinding,Medium Grinding, First Lapping and Finish Lapping. So each of these processes was critically observed to assess whether they were under statistical control or not. Studies were conducted at each of these 4 operations by collecting samples using the rational subgroup method and control charts were plotted. From the control charts, it was observed that the Rough Grinding and Medium Grinding operations were in statistical control with acceptable Cp, Cpk values. But First Lapping and Finish Lapping operations were not in statistical control. Thus we finally identified the two critical processes namely the First Lapping and Finish Lapping operations which were not in statistical control but were crucially affecting the quality of axial thickness. Since the First and Finish Lapping operations were identified as the major source of the quality problem, an in-depth study was undertaken to analyze these two processes. A brain storming session was conducted with all concerned personnel from production, maintenance, design, quality assurance and tool room to get all possible causes which might be affecting the axial thickness variation at these two processes. During the brain storming session the team suggested that the First Lapping process can be processed in medium grinding machine (DFS machine) instead of Lapping machine. The reasons behind this were two fold. First since the aim of the First Lapping is just to remove excess material which was deposited during chrome plating, the same operation can be performed in DFS machine. Since the required surface finish on axial surface was any way being aimed at the Finish Lapping operation, a similar precursory First Lapping'operation in a Lapping machine was really felt not necessary. Secondly since the performance of the DFS machine was found to be under control, albeit for the grinding operation, it was hoped that the Lapping operation in the same machine would also exhibit a similar performance. For this purpose a study was conducted on the First Lapping operation with the DFS machine. It was found that the process was well within the control limit with decent Cp and Cpk values. Thus this procedure of performing the First Lapping operation in a DFS machine took care of the first one of the two problematic processes affecting the quality of axial thickness. Next for tackling the problem with the other critical process, viz. the Finish Lapping operation, various causes were suggested by the team for axial thickness variation in the Finish Lapping operation. Based on these causes, an Ishikawa diagram (cause and effect diagram) was prepared. This Ishikawa diagram had thrown light into number of possible deficiencies in Man, Machine, Method and Material which were responsible for axial thickness variation at finish Lapping. The Ishikawa diagram was carefully analyzed. The causes were narrowed down to 6 factors. These are Grinding wheel rotating speed, Grinding Time, <b>Grinding</b> <b>pressure,</b> Holding plate, Holes (fixtures) within the holding plate and Positions within a ring. The 3 factors namely grinding wheel speed, time and pressure were identified as the control factors. Holding plate, Hole position within a plate and Checking position within a ring on the other hand were the noise factors whose different levels might exhibit a variability of axial thickness. Since there were only 3 control factors, it was decided to conduct a full factorial experiment with each control factor at 3 levels. Hence altogether there were 27 experiments at a fixed given combination of speed, time and pressure. There were 4 holding plates with each plate having 6 slotted holes leading to machining 24 rings at a time during the finish lapping operation. Next 3 measurements were taken for each one of these 24 rings. Thus altogether there were 72 observations for one of these experiments. Each experiment was replicated twice by taking measurements for 2 consecutive batches of rings. From the analysis of variance of the results of these experiments for both S/N ratio and mean it was observed that all the three main factors and their interactions were significant. The Normality assumption of standardized residuals for the S/N ratio and mean was validated by normal probability plot and Kolmonogorov-Smirnoff test. The homoscedasticity assumption was validated through Bartlett’s test and residual plots. It was found that the experiment no. 23 (Speed 84 RPM, Time 10 sees and Pressure 300 daN) yielded highest S/N ratio (η) with mean within the specification limit. That the mean and S/N ratio for the experiment no. 23 were significantly different from others was established by means of Tukey's multiple comparison test. Next control charts for experiment no. 23 were plotted and was found to be well within control with acceptable Cp and Cpk values. Hence we concluded that the non-conformance in axial thickness can be substantially reduced by using the following optimal setting of factors i. e. grinding speed with 84 RPM, <b>grinding</b> <b>pressure</b> with 300 daN and grinding time with 10 seconds. Using this optimal setting the earlier average rejection rate of 8. 7 % due to non-conformance in axial thickness was reduced to 0. 05 %. Under this optimal setting, the process capability index (Cpk) of finish Lapping operation was estimated to be 2. 5, which is well above acceptable standard. Due to this reduction in rejection rate in one quality characteristics of one particular ring out of 800 types, the net savings to the organization is approximately Rs. 10, 44, 000 per year...|$|E

Relatively high friction effects in abrasive machining cause heat generation {{which can lead to}} thermal damage in the surface layer of machined parts. Furthermore an inefficient cooling and lubrication system can result in higher tool wear and surface roughness. Therefore the application of cooling lubricants is of utmost importance in grinding. Usually the optimization of the coolant supply system including the selection of the coolant itself is based only upon empirical know-how or practical trial-and-error-tests. Systematic approaches using broader experimental investigations and thus resulting optimized grinding parameters or using fluid mechanical investigations in the coolant supply nozzle or in the grinding gap are not or only rarely applied. This Dr. -Ing. dissertation presents three methods for the investigation and optimization of cooling lubrication in grinding of the ball bearing steel 100 Cr 6 : 1) modeling and process optimization using experimental data, 2) flow visualization in fluid supply nozzles and 3) <b>grinding</b> fluid <b>pressure</b> measurements in the contact zone...|$|R
50|$|A high <b>pressure</b> <b>grinding</b> roll, often {{referred}} to as HPGRs or roller press, consists out of two rollers with the same dimensions, which are rotating against each other with the same circumferential speed. The special feeding of bulk material through a hopper leads to a material bed between the two rollers. The bearing units of one roller can move linearly and are pressed against the material bed by springs or hydraulic cylinders. The pressures in the material bed are greater than 50 MPa (7,000 PSI). In general they achieve 100 to 300 MPa. By this the material bed is compacted to a solid volume portion of more than 80%.|$|R
40|$|Particle {{breakage}} is {{an essential}} part of mineral processing. The aim is to reduce run of mine mineral ore to an optimal size for liberating target minerals and for subsequent recovery by separation processes such as flotation. This size reduction is typically accomplished in a series of stages in a grinding circuit tailored to the properties of the particular mine ore. Commonly this involves two or more classes of equipment starting with crushers, followed by SAG mills and then sometimes ball mills. Occasionally, high <b>pressure</b> <b>grinding</b> rolls or other novel devices are substituted. Broadly, energy consumption increases and energy efficiency decreases with the fineness of the material produced by each piece of equipment...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>grinding</b> rolls (HPGR) on platinum bearing ores Merensky, UG 2 and Platreef. Conventional tumbling mills such as the ball mill that are typically applied on these ore types are highly energy intensive with {{a small percentage of the}} input energy being used for actual breakage. Rapidly increasing energy costs have contributed to the rising interest of the HPGR in the platinum industry, particularly in plants processing UG 2 and Platreef ores. Therefore, this thesis seeks to determine if the HPGR can be used as an alternative to the ball mill. Key aspects of interest are throughput, energy efficiency, PGE grade and recovery and PGM liberation...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} High <b>Pressure</b> <b>Grinding</b> Rolls {{technology}} in the minerals industry has created {{an interest in the}} particle bed mode of breakage, not only because of its energy saving qualities, but also due to its apparent enhanced mineral liberating properties. Little scientific evidence exists to substantiate any enhanced liberation properties. Automated image analysis and stereological correction methods have now made it possible to measure mineral liberation quite accurately. A population balance mineral liberation model, based on QEM*SEM liberation data of confined particle bed breakage products of a binary ion oxide core, is presented. The selective breakage observed, due to the differential breakage properties of the respective phases, is described. Preferential breakage is incorporated into a liberation model for the first time...|$|R
40|$|The Cadia mine {{has shifted}} from an open pit {{operation}} to the Cadia East underground panel cave. The resulting increase in milled tonnes, more competent ore and the decrease in fines production through shifting to panel caving were predicted to require an increase of over 25 per cent in installed power. This expansion was accomplished via the installation of secondary and high <b>pressure</b> <b>grinding</b> rolls (HPGR) crushing of the ore, with the semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill receiving a combination of primary, secondary and HPGR crushed feed. This design, criteria and rationale for selection {{was presented at the}} SAG Conference 2011. This paper reports on the initial impact of secondary and HPGR crushing on the circuit performance with the new panel cave feed...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{the common}} {{analytical}} distinction between 'naturalistic' and 'personalistic' paradigms of medical knowledge has some immediate heuristic value and may indeed closely resemble the explicit schema elaborated by informants, {{interpretation of the}} semantics of bush medicine and madness in Creole Trinidad suggests that {{the two types of}} knowledge are not incompatible, normutually exclusive, nor distinct. The vices of ganja and rum use may be interpreted within the hot-cold classification of bush medicine but, like other vices and like the more 'intrapersonal' categories of <b>pressure,</b> <b>grinding,</b> studiation and tabanka, they may be understood as leading to madness.

50|$|The {{underflow}} {{from the}} hydroclone consisting of fiber, protein and starch is finely ground and screened using multiple <b>grind</b> mills and <b>pressure</b> fed screens. Screens {{are used to}} separate the fiber from the mixture. Various screen sizes are used to remove coarse and fine fibers. A wedge bar or profile bar screen is used. Starch and protein passes through the screen and collected whereas the fibers remain {{on the screen and}} it is called corn gluten feed. The principle of separation is difference in size. The corn gluten feed has approximately 21% protein, 1% fat and 10% fiber and 15% starch.Use of Gluten Feed: Since it is high in water-soluble nutrients, it is used as one of the main ingredients in animal feed. It {{can also be used to}} produce refined corn fiber to be used for human consumption.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{pilot scale}} test program was {{conducted}} to evaluate the size reduction performance of HPGR (High <b>Pressure</b> <b>Grinding</b> Rolls) operating in different circuit configurations. For this purpose a series of pilot-HPGR locked cycle tests were performed with medium and high pressures to simulate the HPGR operation in closed circuit with a screen, with partial product recycle, and with edge recycle. Logged instrumentation data such as roller speed, working gap, operating pressure, and power draw were used in combination with material test results such as particle size distributions, flake density, flake thickness, and bulk density of the feed for calculation of HPGR operational parameters. The paper reports {{the results from the}} pilot HPGR test work. The analysis reported herein includes an evaluation and comparison of different circuit configurations of the HPGR operation in terms of energy consumption, capacity and product fineness and also discusses the benefits of various circuit arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Underground {{processing}} plants have advantages {{related to a}} low environmental footprint, reduced mining costs, improved security and increased value of the product delivered to surface. This paper presents {{a case study of}} the world‟s first operational underground gravity gold plant at the former Gwynfynydd mine and innovation leading to a new „Python ‟ modular underground system. The Gwynfynydd mine is located in north Wales, United Kingdom. In response to the environmental constraints of being located within a National Park, the operator designed and built a mill underground based on physical separation. Many gold ores liberate favourably using fine-crushing techniques such as High <b>Pressure</b> <b>Grinding</b> Rolls or Vertical Shaft Impactor. Using comminution circuits for mineral liberation, rather than for final recovery process, and by utilising a relatively high-mass pull high-recovery process route, the Python pre-concentration plant was developed for underground operation with a capacity of 20 tonnes per hour. The Gekko Python is currently operating at the Central Rand gold project in South Africa...|$|R
