The author has proposed new approaches to the insurance service interpretation as a dominant, which causes the reinsurance market formation. It is shown that being traded in the reinsurance market, a <b>reinsurance</b> <b>service</b> {{is an important factor in}} the functioning and self-development of the market environment, it combines the interests of supply and demand holders and directly influences the market quality characteristics, causing trends of its further development. Supply and demand for a <b>reinsurance</b> <b>service</b> are influenced by both external and internal factors, the most important of them are: the capitalization level of insurers, the balance of their insurance portfolios, the condition of the state economy, the level of investment attractiveness, monetary and tax policy. The concepts of "reinsurance service demand" and "reinsurance service supply" have been clarified. <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>service</b> demand is a conscious and financially secured desire to buy <b>reinsurance</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>service</b> supply is all services submitted in the reinsurance market...|$|R

40|$|Insurance and {{reinsurance}} {{industry is}} famous for its traditionalism, that is uninventiveness and neglecting of marketing as business concept and function and by doing so, neglecting opportunities for optimal combination of different distribution channels. However, having in mind Drucker's thesis that only marketing and innovations produce results and that everything else are costs, that applies to all businesses including insurance and reinsurance companies, it is clear that they need to change their way of managing business. Keeping current and attracting new customers, by using optimal combination of marketing mix elements and within its scope by creating optimal mix of distribution channels, as business requirement and objective of insurance and reinsurance companies with strong marketing orientation that leads them to fulfillment of primary objective of their existence - making profit, is becoming specially emphasized with opening of domestic insurance and reinsurance market to foreign competitors with long history of gaining high level of customers' loyalty.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the existence of}} a cyclical pattern in property-liability insurance for the US over the recent period 1982 - 2001 in connection with the international price of reinsurance during the same period. The fluctuations in the price of reinsurance during the past twenty years have been documented recently in the business literature. If the price of reinsurance decreases, reinsurance becomes more affordable for insurance companies and this will be reflected in more capacity, price competition and finally an increase in the loss and combined ratio. Our study is using a price index developed recently for this period of time and based on Swiss Re's global book of business. We show that the reinsurance price index exhibits a significant cycle of almost 9 years. The beginning of our observation period starting in 1982 coincides with previously found structural breaks in the loss ratio series. We find that inclusions of the reinsurance price and/or the money market rate do not contribute much to the explanation of the loss ratio in property-liability insurance, whereas the loss ratio does help to explain the fluctuations in the reinsurance price index. This supports our hypothesis of the international diversification effects of reinsurance operation and a proliferation of cycles or large insurance shocks through international <b>reinsurance</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the high}} level of {{systemic}} risk in farming, crop insurance has failed to be provided by the market without government involvement. Currently, in addition to subsidy support the Federal government aids the crop insurance industry by providing <b>reinsurance</b> <b>services</b> to crop insurance companies. This means that the government will reimburse insurers for a large portion of their losses in years when indemnities to farmers are high. In exchange, portions of firms 2 ̆ 7 profits are paid to the government when indemnities are below premiums;This study measures the level of risk accepted by the government in its role as reinsurer for the crop insurance market. This is accomplished by means of a Monte Carlo simulation in which random correlated draws are made for county and farm yields. These are then used to calculate indemnity levels for the crop year. Government share of the industry profit or loss can then be calculated based on the government 2 ̆ 7 s contract with the industry, the Standard Reinsurance Agreement. The simulation also permits the estimation of the expected net cost for the government. This value is the average net transfer from the government to the insurers and represents the fair market value of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement;In addition to this, the risk reducing potential for the reinsurer of commodity yield and price contracts is investigated. Offsetting positions are determined by linear regression of government net cost on yields and prices. It is shown that use of market contracts reduces measures of risk by more than fifty percent...|$|R
