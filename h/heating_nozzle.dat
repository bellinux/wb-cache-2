40|$|Flow characteristic, non-buoyancy, laminar jet {{diffusion}} flames are described, based on experiments {{carried out in}} microgravity condition during 1. 5 seconds of dropping from tower. Experimental conditions were conducted in both normal and microgravity condition. Methane (CH 4), ethylene (C 2 H 4) and n-butane (C 4 H 10) fuels were burned in steady air at an ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Additionally n-butane flame tests were carried out under microgravity. Under normal gravity, the experimental study on flow characteristic in various laminar coflow diffusion flames have been conducted with a particular focus on the buoyancy force exerted from gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. Methane, ethylene and n-butane were used as fuels for the experiments. Coflow burner and Schlieren system were used to observe the fuel flow field near nozzle exit and flow characteristics in flames. The result showed that the recirculation zone was appeared near the nozzle exit with the strong negative buoyancy on the fuel stream when burning n-butane which has heavier density than air. As Reynolds number increases by the control of fuel velocity of n-butane, the vortices were increased and the vortices tips were moved up from the nozzle exit. In addition, {{it can be found}} that the <b>heated</b> <b>nozzle</b> can affect the flow fields of fuel stream near the nozzle exit. Under microgravity condition, the experimental studies on flow characteristic of n-butane flames have been conducted with a particular focus on the non-buoyancy force exerted from gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. The axial velocities of fuel stream were slow up toward the upstream. An indication of absence buoyancy and acceleration due to gravity, the axial velocity were slowly toward the downstream and the particles of fuels stream were not moved in the pockets near the nozzle exit. Therefore, the recirculation zones were disappeared near nozzle exit in n-butane flame under microgravity condition.

30|$|Recent work using rapid {{prototyping}} {{has demonstrated that}} 3 D printing offers flexibility in design at a reduced cost in comparison with traditional phantoms [10]. Commercially available printers are generally based on three main techniques: thermoplastic extrusion, powder deposition and stereolithography. Thermoplastic deposition uses a <b>heated</b> <b>nozzle</b> to extrude small beads of thermoplastic material. As the material hardens, new layers are built up to create a 3 D object. This method is employed in low-cost printers but lacks the resolution and flexibility {{of some of the}} other techniques. Powder deposition printers apply thin layers of binding material on the printer tray and then coat this with a thin layer of powder. This process is repeated to build up the powder/binder layers to create a 3 D object. This technique generally offers higher resolution than the extrusion technique. However, the final material is brittle and porous, requiring additional sealing for long-term use. Stereolithography-based printers employ a vat of light-curable resin and a laser light to build parts. The laser beam traces a cross section of the object {{on the surface of the}} liquid resin. Exposure to the laser light solidifies the pattern and joins it to the layer below, the resolution achievable is of the order of a few microns and the final build material is more durable than other 3 D printing techniques. These printers are now used for final production parts and can produce fine-resolution structures on a sufficient scale to create bespoke molecular imaging test objects.|$|R

Accurate values for all three vibrational intervals ? 1, ? 2, and ? 3 have been determined for nickel dichloride in the upper state and for the bending wave number ? 2 in the lower state. The results show that the molecule is linear in both states involved in the transition and that the lower (ground) state is 3 S-g in character. Evidence is presented from the nickel isotope shifts to show that the transition is vibronically induced through the bending vibration and that the upper state is vibronically 3 ?u in character; it probably derives from an electronic 3 ?g state.

The next step was deciding which of several different types of available material for 3 D printing would be most appropriate. (See Coon et al. [45] {{for a review of}} the costs and properties of commercially available Rapid Prototyping materials). We used two basic forms of printing: Filament, or Polymer, and power-based. Filament, or Polymer-based printers, use plastic spools of ABS, PLA, and other plastics to make 3 D parts. The plastic filament is pushed through a <b>heated</b> <b>nozzle</b> (200  ºC) and the part is printed layer by layer. The support structure needed for horizontal areas and slopes over 55 °. Polymer-based printing material was less expensive; however, they were found to be unsatisfyingly light to handle, and although this was a setting that could be adjusted, the length of time it would take to print would increase exponentially. Typically, an infill, or density, was set at 10 %. Furthermore, one could both see and feel the layers of filament, which had the effect of obscuring some of the detail and effecting a distraction. Although the filament printer can print at the same resolution as the plaster printer we settled on (see below), the vertical compression required to ensure that successive layers of filament would adhere properly to those already placed results in a rougher surface than the plaster printer. In addition, the larger pieces had a tendency toward thermal distortion (warping and deformation) during the process of printing due to the temperature distortions that occur during the printing process.|$|R

Due to the possibility of thermal shock occurring at higher temperatures, a separate <b>nozzle</b> utilizing vitiation <b>heating</b> is designed to fire the particle at equally higher temperatures to prove the lack of thermal shock. Throughout the experiment, measurements including particle velocity, exit temperature, specimen temperature, and damage of the specimen are documented in both the cold test <b>nozzle</b> and vitiated <b>heating</b> test <b>nozzle.</b> Ultimately, the design of the impact apparatus is such that it may used as a characterization tool. Although the final results focus on the characterization of the MoSi 2 specimen and the damage associated, the impact apparatus may be used to characterize materials at any temperature application and is not limited to characterizing ceramics. ...|$|R
