5|$|Trollope {{established}} himself at The Shannon Hotel, a long bow-fronted Georgian building, which was over 100 {{years old at}} that time. The hotel, which still exists, {{is located at the}} bottom of the town, a mere one hundred yards from the river. The post office where Trollope worked was at the top of the town, which <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of minutes on foot. Next to the post office was a two-roomed bungalow which was used by the Postal Surveyor and his new deputy as their working headquarters. This building is often erroneously considered to have been the residence of Trollope himself.|$|E
5|$|She is {{then taken}} to the capital. Archer and T'Pau also arrive after T'Pol's husband, Koss, {{provides}} transporter security codes. They present the Kir'Shara to the Command and reveal that the embassy bombing was merely a pretext to weaken the pacifist Syrranites prior to the Andorian strike. Visibly angered, V'Las lunges for the Kir'Shara, but is stunned by High-Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. Enterprise returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T'Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V'Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed as a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons {{it is a matter of}} first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

25|$|Gastón is Amaranta Úrsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe {{and returns}} to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gastón is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want {{to move back to}} Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he {{arranges}} for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buendía. Gastón takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his velocipede.|$|E
500|$|By this time, it {{was clear}} to those on Titanic that the ship was indeed sinking and there would not be enough {{lifeboat}} places for everyone. Some still clung to the hope that the worst would not happen: Lucien Smith told his wife Eloise, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of form to have women and children first. The ship is thoroughly equipped and everyone on her will be saved." [...] Charlotte Colyer's husband Harvey called to his wife as she was put in a lifeboat, [...] "Go, Lottie! For God's sake, be brave and go! I'll get a seat in another boat!" ...|$|E
500|$|Firefight {{was praised}} as [...] "addictive", {{especially}} for showcasing the excellent artificial intelligence of enemies. Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer credited the enemies with differentiating Firefight from similar game modes in games such as Gears of War 2 or Left 4 Dead, which featured mindless zombies or cannon fodder. The staff of Official Xbox Magazine UK {{wrote that the}} gametype's depth and options made Gears of Wars comparable mode look [...] "simple" [...] in comparison, and that Firefight extended {{the life of the}} game. In contrast, Bramwell felt that in Firefight [...] "there is both a sense of futility in the knowledge that death <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time and odds, and fatigue in the realisation that many levels play out just {{as they did in the}} campaign, except a bit more so".|$|E
50|$|Taking {{the above}} into account, it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> {{of time before}} technologists {{realized}} this gap and started to look for tooling to support the ongoing design and maintenance of these processes.|$|R

500|$|Similarly, Clear also {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} in Final Destination 2. Robert Koehler of Variety said that Larter was cast little light; while Putman of TheMovieBoy.com admired that Larter accurately plays Clear as an emotionally worn-down {{young woman who}} may still be alive, but realizes that it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before fate has its way with her. Nevertheless, Putman found her performance short. David Grove of Film Threat stated that she spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting; and criticized her and A. J. Cook as [...] "dumb blonde leads" [...] as well. Despite this, Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews was favorable to Larter's performance, saying she was giving the smart-ass edge her character needs. Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Larter is again the bright spot; whereas Andrew Manning of Radio Free Entertainment positively acknowledged her, declaring that Larter rules the movie. Manning argued that while everyone else is merely a hastily assembled caricature without depth, Clear has a well-defined background and history with recognition to her appearance in the first film. He further affirmed that Final Destination fans will see Clear as the heroic franchise veteran.|$|E
500|$|Suspecting that Aleph is Satan, Lucifer summons Aleph and Hiroko to his {{castle in}} the Expanse; he is {{relieved}} {{to learn that}} Aleph is not Satan, but says that Satan's revival <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time. He tells them that Satan is an instrument of God's wrath, {{to be used to}} judge and eradicate humanity, and that he wants Aleph and Hiroko's help in fighting Satan. Leaving Lucifer's castle, Aleph and Hiroko meet Gabriel, who takes them to the garden of Eden, located on top of the Center, where they meet Zayin – revealed to be Satan – who wants to ally with Aleph and Hiroko and fight Lucifer, destroy Tokyo Millennium, and create the Thousand-Year Kingdom. If the player joins Gabriel and Zayin, the Thousand-Year Kingdom is created through Eden — revealed to be a vast spaceship carrying the chosen ones — and the destruction of all life on Earth. YHVH appears aboard Eden, and Zayin, Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill him for having committed genocide, after which Zayin declares Aleph the true savior, and Hiroko the holy mother, and then crumbles to dust. If the player instead allies with Lucifer or stays neutral, Aleph and Hiroko kill Zayin before he can activate the destruction; Aleph is dubbed a false Messiah and commits the [...] "ultimate sin" [...] by killing YHVH, freeing humanity.|$|E

2500|$|They {{save time}} in collecting, arranging, and calculating the {{different}} items {{that must be}} handled in office management: To illustrate this it is only necessary {{to refer to the}} function of those time stamps and clocks which register the time of employees on cards {{in such a way that}} the computation of the week s pay <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of a short addition and easy multiplication. If wage tables are used even this is dispensed with, as there is then no necessity for the double handling of time records, a feature of the ordinary methods of computing pay rolls. In collecting data for finding costs, the time of beginning and completing operations is usually registered on cards by the workman himself in writing. The use of time stamps in the factory effects a considerable saving of time in this respect alone.|$|E
2500|$|Talk of amalgamating the 6 {{municipal}} {{units in}} Pictou County {{has increased in}} recent years. Among the reasons for this, small towns adjacent to New Glasgow {{are having a hard}} time coping financially on their own due to the declining economy. Also, Pictou County has the most politicians per capita in Canada. With the Government of Nova Scotia having already amalgamated Halifax County, Cape Breton County, and Queens County into regional municipalities, Pictou County residents feel it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before that concept is introduced in Pictou County. The two most often suggested scenarios involve amalgamating the entire county (six municipalities) into a single regional municipality, or amalgamating the upper East River towns (New Glasgow, Stellarton, Trenton, Westville) into a single larger town. [...] After several months of public backlash a vote was held and the public spoke against amalgamation, effectively killing any possibility of a future merger.|$|E

2500|$|The couple {{continued}} to live separately after the civil marriage. In October 1956, Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire {{and fell to the}} floor, thereby breaking her left upper leg. At the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, she was diagnosed with incurable cancer, with bone metastases from breast carcinoma. It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he {{had fallen in love with}} her, realizing how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: [...] "new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or perhaps you would not?) to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us." [...] Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: [...] "One of the most painful days of my life.

2500|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Frere Hall, {{displays}} in bold, the words, [...] "Arz-o-Samawat" [...] (Earth and the Heavens) bears a historical significance, since it represents {{the last piece of}} work by Sadequain. He died before he could complete it. Before he started painting the stupendous mural on the ceiling he dedicated it to the citizens of the great city of Karachi. The mural is for the citizens to cherish and it should be treated as a national treasure. However, because of the security conditions the citizens are deprived of entry in Frere Hall and the impressive historical building along with the Mural lie in desperate need of care. The bright colours Sadequain used in the mural to depict the Earth and the Heavens are fading away because of the environmental conditions. The large mural is painted on dozens of individual panels that are put together like the pieces of a puzzle. Several of the panels are detached and hang down under their own weight. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before the panels start falling apart.|$|E
2500|$|Objectivist {{epistemology}} {{maintains that}} all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. [...] "Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident." [...] Rand considered {{the validity of}} the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the [...] "stolen concept" [...] by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose {{the validity of the}} senses. She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, optical illusions are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself. The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of adducing sensory evidence) nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected epistemological skepticism, as she holds that the skeptics' claim to knowledge [...] "distorted" [...] by the form or the means of perception is impossible.|$|E
