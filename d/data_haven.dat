40|$|Abstract- Quantum {{cryptography}} is {{an approach}} to securing communications by applying the phenomena of quantum physics. Quantum cryptography provides secure communication whose security depends only on the validity of quantum theory. Interesting characteristics of quantum mechanics includes the existence of indivisible quanta and of entangled systems, both of which lie {{at the root of}} the quantum cryptography (QC). QC is one of the few commercial applications of quantum physics at the single quantum level. Computers and Telecommunications system would become safe havens for criminal activity. Even may himself unknowns that crypto anarchy provides a means for tax evasion money laundering, espionage (with digital dead drops), contract killings, and implementation of <b>data</b> <b>havens</b> for Monitoring and marketing illegal or controversial material.

50|$|A <b>data</b> <b>haven,</b> like a {{corporate}} haven or tax haven, is {{a refuge for}} uninterrupted or unregulated data. Data havens are locations with legal environments that are friendly {{to the concept of}} a computer network freely holding data and even protecting its content and associated information. They tend to fit into three categories: a physical locality with weak information-system enforcement and extradition laws, a physical locality with intentionally strong protections of data, and virtual domains designed to secure data via technical means (such as encryption) regardless of any legal environment.|$|E

50|$|In {{the world}} of the novel the USA and the Soviet Union are still the world powers. The {{international}} political order, which is guarded by the Vienna Convention and uses censorship as a means of keeping the world order, is weak and divided, and to avoid world panic protects the terrorists from F.A.C.T. Countries that grow in power are Grenada, Singapore and Luxemburg, the so-called <b>data</b> <b>havens</b> where <b>data</b> piracy is legitimate. Organizations that feel threatened by the growing influence of havens are Rizome Industries Group, an economic democracy global corporation which suffers losses because of the data piracy and wants to negotiate with the pirates, and the Free Army of Counter-Terrorism (F.A.C.T.) which calls itself “the real world police” and plans to deal with any signs of attacks on “doctrines of national sovereignty”. This is the main reason why F.A.C.T. assassinates Winston Stubbs and bombs the ship on which Laura was sailing with Singaporean pirates.|$|R

50|$|Cryptonomicon is a 1999 {{novel by}} American author Neal Stephenson, set in two {{different}} time periods. One group of characters are World War II-era Allied codebreakers and tactical-deception operatives affiliated with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (UK), and disillusioned Axis military and intelligence figures. The second narrative {{is set in the}} late 1990s, with characters that are (in part) descendants of those of the earlier time period, who employ cryptologic, telecom and computer technology to build an underground <b>data</b> <b>haven</b> in the fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Their goal is to facilitate anonymous Internet banking using electronic money and (later) digital gold currency, with a long-term objective to distribute Holocaust Education and Avoidance Pod (HEAP) media for instructing genocide-target populations on defensive warfare.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{considers}} how Neal Stephenson’s 1999 epic novel Cryptonomicon {{engages with}} the long-standing and complex relationship between cryptology and national/transnational identity. Cryptonomicon's layered and disjointed structure {{allows it to}} explore the impact of cryptography and cryptanalysis in the Second World War (as well as {{their impact on the}} consequent rewriting of the international political stage), to reflect on the place of technology in the recent history of cryptology, and to consider how emergent (and supposedly secure) data storage technologies not only open up planetary-wide communication traffic but also unsettle the agreed protocols of national and international law. Stephenson provides a sense of technology's global effects by offering not a straightforward narrative of the demise of the nation-state but by showing how technologies are in a process of constant negotiation with the institutions of the nation-state, drawing upon the economic, material, and intellectual resources of the nation state, {{while at the same time}} challenging notions of a bordered and coherent national identity and working to disestablish nations of their regulatory authority. The essay is informed by recent work on cryptology, <b>data</b> <b>havens,</b> globalization, transnationalism, and postcoloniality, as well as Derrida's work on archives and technology...|$|R

40|$|In 2000, a {{group of}} American {{entrepreneurs}} moved to a former World War II anti-aircraft platform in the North Sea, seven miles off the British coast, and launched HavenCo, {{one of the strangest}} start-ups in Internet history. A former pirate radio broadcaster, Roy Bates, had occupied the platform in the 1960 s, moved his family aboard, and declared it to be the sovereign Principality of Sealand. HavenCo 2 ̆ 7 s founders were opposed to governmental censorship and control of the Internet; by putting computer servers on Sealand, they planned to create a 2 ̆ 2 <b>data</b> <b>haven</b> 2 ̆ 2 for unpopular speech, safely beyond the reach of any other country. This article tells the full story of Sealand and HavenCo - and examines what they have to tell us {{about the nature of the}} rule of law in the age of the Internet. The story itself is fascinating enough: it includes pirate radio, shotguns and. 50 -caliber machine guns, rampant copyright infringement, a Red Bull skateboarding special, perpetual motion machines, and the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of State. But its implications for the rule of law are even more remarkable. Previous scholars have seen HavenCo as a straightforward challenge to the rule of law: by threatening to undermine national authority, HavenCo was implacably opposed to all law. As the fuller history shows, however, this story is too simplistic. HavenCo also depended on international law to recognize and protect Sealand, and on Sealand law to protect it from Sealand itself. Where others have seen HavenCo 2 ̆ 7 s failure as the triumph of traditional regulatory authorities over HavenCo, the article argues that in a very real sense, HavenCo failed not from too much law but from too little. The 2 ̆ 2 law 2 ̆ 7 that was supposed to keep HavenCo safe was law only in a thin, formalistic sense, disconnected from the human institutions that make and enforce law. But without those institutions, law does not work, as HavenCo discovered...|$|E
