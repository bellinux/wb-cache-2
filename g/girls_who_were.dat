5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese <b>girls,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Murrell {{claimed that}} he could exorcise malevolent spirits, destroy witches, and restore lost or stolen {{property}} to its owner, {{as well as providing}} services as an astrologer, herbalist, and animal healer. He charged a halfpenny for curing warts, and two shillings and six pence for breaking a witch's spell. He was reputed to cure sick animals by passing his hands over their affected area, muttering a prayer, and then hanging an amulet about their neck, and was requested to use these powers at farms in Essex, Suffolk, and northern Kent. During his lifetime, Murrell was known {{on both sides of the}} Thames Estuary, although not apparently beyond that. He did however receive postal correspondence from a range of places, including from Essex <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> working as maids in London.|$|E

5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} provide more than 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among <b>girls,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> more likely to be allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E

This meant to him that nearly 3 out of 5 Mogadiscio inhabitants were Catholics..|$|E
25|$|Because it is a high-performing and well-regarded school, Boston Latin {{has been}} at the center of {{controversy}} concerning its admissions process. Admissions are very competitive, and it is not uncommon for fewer than 20% of applicants to be admitted. Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% quota of places in its incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits involving non-minority <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not admitted despite ranking higher than admitted minorities.|$|E

An angry Khadr wrote a letter to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, complaining that he should be compensated for the money he spent in fixing the building.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1739, Nadir Shah, the Persian invader, was {{returning}} home after plundering Delhi and Punjab. The Dal lay in wait, {{not far from the}} route he had taken. When he reached Akhnur, on the Chenab (in the present-day Jammu region), they swooped down upon the rear guard, relieving the invaders of much of their booty. On the third night they made an even fiercer attack and rescued from their hands, thousands of <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> escorted back to their families. For a long part of his return journey, the Sikhs pursued Nadir Shah in this manner.|$|E

In 1794, the French Revolutionary Wars forced the nuns to leave the Low Countries. The school reopened on its present site in 1799.|$|E

25|$|In January 2012, {{two teenage}} girls, aged 14 and 16, were {{detained}} by Upper Hutt police after police received a complaint about {{an attack on}} two other teenage girls. Police strip-searched the two <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> held in police cells for 36 hours. They were not given toilet paper; they were denied contact with their families or a lawyer and the 16-year-old was forced to express breast milk into the sink in her cell after being separated from her baby. In July, Judge Mary O'Dwyer condemned the arrest and police handling of the case, citing several breaches of protocol. Police called the actions of some staff an aberration and said an investigation was under way.|$|E

500|$|Obayashi {{incorporated}} {{themes of}} the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki into the script. Obayashi was born in Hiroshima and lost all his childhood friends from these bombings. Obayashi applied these themes with the plot element of a woman's ghost waiting for her lover's return from World War II. The woman's bitterness about the war turns her into an evil spirit that devours the <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> unaffected by the bombings. Obayashi and Katsura had worked previously on a script titled Hanagatami before being assigned to House, which made the screenwriting process easy for both of them. Obayashi titled the script House as he felt that a foreign title for a Japanese film would be [...] "taboo".|$|E
