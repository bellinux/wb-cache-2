5|$|After {{some months}} of {{lobbying}} and discussion, Harvard's ruling body, the Harvard Corporation, announced on May 8, 1933, {{that it had}} elected Conant as the next President of Harvard. Alfred North Whitehead, Harvard's eminent professor of philosophy <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> decision, declaring: Clark was very much responsible for Conant's election.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> trial judge's finding {{with regard}} to locus standi. Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, {{delivering}} the Court's judgment, opined that since according to the land register the temple was held in trust for San Jiao Sheng Tang Buddhist Association, of which the devotees were members, they had the requisite locus standi to bring the issue before the court.|$|E

5|$|The {{announcement}} to {{sell the}} building sparked a fierce public debate. The Green Party, {{at the time in}} a coalition with the SPD, strongly <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan. The Christian Democratic Union party held a meeting in October 2006. The director of the Bonn Women's Museum, Marianne Pitzen, accused the initiators of the plan of selling off public property and underestimating the value of cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|The four justices who <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} filed {{three separate}} dissenting opinions. All of the dissenting justices supported the Afroyim v. Rusk principle that retention of US citizenship was a constitutionally protected right, {{and they all}} agreed (contrary to the court's majority) that Terrazas's actions should not {{have led to the}} loss of his citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Victoria came {{to depend}} {{more and more}} on his support and guidance. He aided the {{development}} of Britain's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliament—although he actively <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston's tenure as Foreign Secretary. In 1857, he was given the formal title of Prince Consort.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{the company}} sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, {{including}} Budweiser, Bud Light, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed {{to target the}} important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|After a few skirmishes, the {{opposing}} forces met in earnest at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> battle {{strategy of the}} royalist commander Lord Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.|$|E
5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hornbostel-Sachs system and {{developed}} his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority's holding that {{fair-minded}} jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer {{held that the}} actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were {{not as important as}} what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E
5|$|Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka {{village near}} Udupi in 1238, he learnt the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} {{his vision of the}} 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E

Of the 12807 questionnaires that were sent, 10.9% were returned, with a further 100 completed at public exhibitions and online; the majority of responses were in agreement with the proposed alignment.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor Rathbone led {{the society}} as its {{secretary}} from 1897, especially in campaigning in the 1910 elections. Three campaign shops were opened around Liverpool, asking men {{to vote for}} candidates who supported votes for women, especially Alexander Gordon Cameron. In 1911, Rathbone and Stewart-Brown set up {{a branch of the}} society to educate women who would soon get the vote. When the society <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> NUWSS, it merged with the Municipal Women's Association to create the Liverpool Women's Citizens Association in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Harper became {{involved}} in politics {{as a member of}} his high school's Young Liberals Club. He later changed his political allegiance because he <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> National Energy Program (NEP) of Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government. He became chief aide to Progressive Conservative MP Jim Hawkes in 1985, but later became disillusioned with the party and the government of Brian Mulroney, especially the administration's fiscal policy and its inability to fully revoke the NEP until 1986. He left the PC Party that same year.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. However, he <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E

When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E
