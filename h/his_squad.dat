5|$|Opposing Force {{opens with}} Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with <b>his</b> <b>squad.</b> <b>His</b> <b>squad</b> discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated {{that they have}} not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{arrived at}} C Company of the regiment's 1st Battalion in early 1951, {{and at first}} was {{regarded}} with suspicion by officers and leaders in his unit. A Sergeant, he was made a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon, and quickly impressed his unit's company commander with his natural leadership ability, and soon <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> was considered a model unit. In May 1951, Charlton was made the platoon sergeant and his commander had recommended him for a battlefield commission.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, Arrow {{developed}} a reputation in the collegiate basketball circles for up-tempo, high-scoring teams. <b>His</b> <b>squads</b> led the Sun Belt Conference in scoring four of his seven seasons at South Alabama. <b>His</b> 1988-89 <b>squad</b> set a school and league record 91 points per game average and five of his seven teams tallied at least 80 points per game.|$|R

5|$|In October 2013, Marquinhos, who is of dual Portuguese and Brazilian nationality, {{stated that}} he would be open to {{representing}} the Portugal national team. However, later that month, he received his first call-up for Brazil when Luiz Felipe Scolari named <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> for friendly matches against Honduras and Chile to be played that November. He made his debut against Honduras in Miami on 17 November, replacing David Luiz for the last 20 minutes of a 5–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Wenger leads {{training}} sessions, but delegates {{responsibility to}} his coaching staff, who predominantly {{work with the}} players. He splits the squad into groups, observing and supervising the drills. A typical training session under Wenger lasts 90 minutes, which is timed and staged precisely, and includes coordination techniques, positional play and small-sided games. Wenger spends the day before a match focusing on the mental and tactical approach of <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> and varies his training style.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club {{were in the}} middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building <b>his</b> <b>squad.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bielsa's {{signature}} {{formation in}} <b>his</b> <b>squads</b> - {{which he made}} famous and brought {{to the front of}} the world's mainstream football scene during his coaching tenures in with the Argentina and Chile national teams, Athletic Bilbao and Marseille - is the 3-3-3-1 formation.|$|R
50|$|Emery {{then moved}} to UD Almería in {{division}} two, and again helped <b>his</b> <b>squads</b> overachieve: after guiding to a first ever promotion in 2007, the Andalusian side finished eighth in the following campaign. This prompted a move to Valencia CF, as he succeeded Ronald Koeman.|$|R
50|$|Michal Bílek {{announced}} <b>his</b> 24-man provisional <b>squad</b> on 14 May 2012. On 28 May 2012, {{he replaced}} Daniel Pudil with Vladimír Darida. The following day, he confirmed <b>his</b> 23-man <b>squad,</b> removing Tomáš Grigar.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2012–13 season, Nasri {{switched}} <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> number from 19 to 8. On 12 August, Nasri scored and assisted a goal in the 2012 Community Shield, a 3–2 win against FA Cup winners Chelsea. A week later, on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League, he scored and assisted again in a 3–2 win against newly promoted Southampton. He then scored against Ajax in a 3–1 loss in the UEFA Champions League group stage. In December 2012, Nasri was criticised for not blocking Robin van Persie's winning goal for Manchester United in the Manchester Derby.|$|E
5|$|Chapman was {{promoted}} to full secretary-manager, replacing Langley, the following month, and soon made an impact, signing players such as England international Clem Stephenson from Aston Villa (who became captain under Chapman) and 18-year-old unknown George Brown (who {{went on to become}} Huddersfield's all-time top scorer). In Chapman's first full season in charge (1921–22), Huddersfield Town won the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 1–0 in the final at Stamford Bridge, the club's first major trophy. In the league, however, his side had spent most of the season fighting relegation and had finished 14th, so Chapman looked to strengthen <b>his</b> <b>squad.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite City {{finishing}} {{outside the}} play-off places, they were again installed as favourites for promotion by bookmakers for the 2008–09 season. McCall released 13players from <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> and {{replaced them with}} a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign. McCall's side made a good start to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league – the first time City had led the table in seven years.|$|E
50|$|The women's {{soccer team}} began {{competing}} in 1993 and calls McAlister Soccer Field home. Karen Stanley coached {{the team for}} the first three seasons. Jim Millinder took over in 1996 and guided seven of <b>his</b> <b>squads</b> (1998-2003) into the NCAA tourney (USC won the 1998 Pac-10 title).|$|R
50|$|Etaeta named <b>his</b> 23-man <b>squad</b> on 24 May 2013.|$|R

5|$|Having {{previously}} represented Germany at U18 level, Holtby {{made his}} debut for the U19's in September 2008 and earned 12 caps overall. He scored {{the first of}} his four international goals for the German U19 team on 11 October 2008, netting in a 5–0 victory over Lithuania. The following year, Germany youth coach Horst Hrubesch named Holtby in <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> for the U20 World Cup in Egypt. Holtby scored two goals at the tournament, one of which was against eventual runners-up Brazil in the quarter-finals. In 2013, he captained Germany at the European Under-21 Championship in Israel and was named in as the nation's only representative in the Team of the Tournament.|$|E
5|$|In May 1986, George Graham was {{appointed}} as Arsenal manager. He made an instant impact, guiding {{his team to}} League Cup success, and the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division. Arsenal however slipped to sixth in the league the following season, and lost out to Luton Town in the League Cup final a year later. Graham sought to resolve inconsistencies by freshening up <b>his</b> <b>squad,</b> promoting number of academy graduates while selling ageing players. By the summer of 1988, he achieved a blend of youth and experience, but little was thought of Arsenal's chances of winning the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{performances}} in the 1968/69 cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season. They {{finished second in the}} 1968–69 Football League six points behind Leeds United. Left back, Gerry Byrne, retired after 333appearances and 12 seasons. Shankly started replacing ageing players in <b>his</b> <b>squad,</b> purchasing future captain Emlyn Hughes and goalkeeper Ray Clemence the season before. Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of £96,000 from Chelsea, but transferred after a year to Coventry City after injury and poor form. Mid-season Shankly signed Alun Evans from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a then record £100,000 fee for a teenager. After a good start, Evans' career was curtailed by injuries.|$|E

5|$|Retired Lieutenant Colonel Zeke Josepho recounts {{a strange}} {{experience}} during the Persian Gulf War {{and how he}} claims it brought him to God: as <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> was ambushed during the Battle of Al Busayyah and {{on the verge of}} defeat, four mysterious men showed up and defeated the enemy with astonishing ease. While Josepho thinks of them as guardian angels, they are revealed to be the almost-indestructible Super Soldiers. In the present, Josepho stands above the wreckage of a spacecraft in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Schmid spent 19 {{seasons as}} the head coach at UCLA, accumulating a record of 322–63–33(wins–losses–draws), and {{reaching}} 16 consecutive playoffs between 1983 and 1998. He earned a reputation for producing some of the nation's best goalkeepers when David Vanole, Brad Friedel, and Matt Reis came through the university. By 1994, he had coached 16 players at UCLA who were later selected for the U.S. national team. Schmid avoided recruiting foreign talent to bolster <b>his</b> <b>squad.</b> He relied mainly on players from California, whom he believed to be less physically aggressive but more creative and attacking.|$|E
5|$|Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta {{received}} the Medal of Honor for heroic actions as a rifle team leader in Company B, 2–503 INF (Airborne) when <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> {{was caught in}} a near-ambush the night of 25 October 2007 during Operation Rock Avalanche in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan. He was the first living Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War. On 13 May 2014, former 503rd Infantry Regiment Sergeant Kyle White {{received the}} Medal of Honor during a White House ceremony.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} the Capitols went 28–20 but were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach {{felt he had to}} rebuild <b>his</b> <b>squad.</b> However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.|$|E
5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet a month earlier, but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant the fixture was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving <b>his</b> <b>squad</b> a minibreak and created a calming atmosphere in their training sessions. He adjusted his usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E
5|$|This was Manchester United's 22nd Community Shield {{appearance}} and Arsenal's 17th. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson assessed before the match that his midfield {{was stronger than}} before, despite selling first-team players David Beckham and Juan Sebastián Verón. Arsène Wenger was optimistic of Arsenal's prospects in the upcoming season despite having only made minor changes to <b>his</b> <b>squad,</b> and Chelsea's emergence as a competitor following Roman Abramovich's takeover. Having been linked with a transfer away in the summer, Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira revealed before the game his intention {{to stay at the}} club.|$|E

50|$|McGeady {{made his}} full debut for the Republic of Ireland in July 2004 against Jamaica.
