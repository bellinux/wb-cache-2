25|$|Breathing {{low-temperature}} steam such {{as from a}} <b>hot</b> <b>shower</b> or gargling can relieve symptoms. There is tentative {{evidence for}} nasal irrigation. Decongestant nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline may provide relief, but these medications {{should not be used}} for more than the recommended period. Longer use may cause rebound sinusitis. It is unclear if nasal irrigation, antihistamines, or decongestants work in children with acute sinusitis.|$|E

Hikers are required to stay at designated shelters and campsites. The trail runs through {{the eastern edge of}} Greenbrier State Park. This can serve as a luxurious stop point for a <b>hot</b> <b>shower</b> and a visit to the camp store.

The section ends at Pen Mar Park, which sits on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy had the {{nickname}} [...] "The Hedgehog" [...] bestowed upon him by fellow porn actor Bill Margold in 1979 after a {{situation on the}} set of the porn film Olympic Fever. Jeremy flew in from New York to shoot the movie. Expecting warm California weather, he wore only a T-shirt and shorts and brought no additional clothing. During the long motorcycle ride to the set, located near Lake Arrowhead in the California mountains, the weather deteriorated to blizzard conditions, which chilled him to the point of near hypothermia. Upon arriving at the set, Jeremy was immediately whisked away to thaw out in a <b>hot</b> <b>shower.</b> When he finished, his skin had taken on a pinkish hue from the temperature extremes, and all the many hairs on his body were standing on end. Margold's comment upon seeing Jeremy at that moment was [...] "You are a hedgehog, my friend. A walking, talking hedgehog." ...|$|E

2500|$|The home's conveniences {{were rare}} {{at the time}} of its construction. These {{included}} steam and forced-air heating, modern indoor toilets and plumbing, push-button gas lights, and Mrs. Winchester's personal (and only) <b>hot</b> <b>shower</b> from indoor plumbing. There are also three elevators, including an Otis electric and one of which was powered by a rare horizontal hydraulic elevator piston. (Most elevator pistons are vertical to save space, but Winchester preferred the improved functionality of the horizontal configuration.) Mrs. Winchester never skimped on the many adornments that she believed contributed to its architectural beauty. Many of the stained glass windows were created by the Tiffany Company. Some were designed specifically for her, and others by her, including a [...] "spider web" [...] window that featured her favorite web design and the repetition of the number thirteen, another of her preoccupations. This window was never installed, but exists in the so-called [...] "$25,000 storage room" [...] - so named because its contents were originally appraised at a value of $25,000. The value today is inestimable, but $25,000 would be [...] A second window was designed by Tiffany himself, so that when sunlight strikes the prismatic crystals a rainbow is cast across the room. The window was installed in an interior wall in a room with no light exposure, preventing the effect from being seen.|$|E
2500|$|Another classic Monsoon comment {{regularly}} heard {{just after}} he would sign on for an important event was, [...] "Pandemonium is running wild! The electricity in here is {{so thick that}} you can cut it with a knife!" [...] Another was [...] "This place has gone bananas!", which was preceded by an event in which the audience had erupted in cheers or jeers, such as the entrance of a wrestler or the finish of a match. Many times, Monsoon would also substitute simple words with needlessly complex and obscure equivalents – for example, he memorably used [...] "external occipital protuberance" [...] {{as an alternative to}} [...] "back of the head." [...] Or when a wrestler suffered a knee injury, he would state, [...] "He may have temporarily dislocated the patella!" [...] Heenan mocked this, once sarcastically calling a move to the [...] "cervial dervial part of the back." [...] However, Monsoon also employed several homegrown substitutes for body part terminology – for example, describing the mouth as a [...] "kisser" [...] and the abdomen as [...] "the bread basket." [...] When a wrestler put his finishing hold/maneuver on a jobber, he would say [...] "Get the (<b>hot)</b> <b>shower</b> ready, this one is history!" [...] or [...] "Stick the fork in (losing wrestler), he's done!". While commentating a match where a title changes hands, Monsoon might declare [...] "History has been made!" [...] When discussing something he didn't believe would happen, he would say [...] "highly unlikely." [...] If a babyface wrestler was attacked from behind or by surprise, he would refer to it as a [...] "Pearl Harbor Job." [...] When a babyface wrestler used an illegal tactic on a heel wrestler that was used on the babyface earlier in the match, Monsoon would state [...] "What's good for the goose is good for the gander." [...] Also, when a wrestler or tag team (usually the face) lost a match through illegal tactics (such as being hit with [...] "The Mouth of the South" [...] Jimmy Hart's megaphone), Monsoon would often proclaim {{that there had been a}} [...] "miscarriage of justice". Monsoon generally put more emphasis on this when the heel(s) won a championship match, or retained their title(s). When referring to the heel managers/on screen personalities (Bobby Heenan, Luscious Johnny V, Jimmy Hart, Brother Love, etc.), he would refer to them as [...] "That fountain of misinformation" [...] or [...] "That piece of garbage".|$|E
2500|$|Eleanor Gower of the Daily Mail {{thought the}} slow moving number shows Rihanna at her most vulnerable. A {{reviewer}} of The Huffington Post commented, [...] "The heartfelt ballad, from her latest album Unapologetic, {{is full of}} emotion - and the video matches that, as a stripped-down Rihanna soaks in a tub." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times commented on the video saying, [...] "we kind of want to curl up in a <b>hot</b> <b>shower</b> {{and have a good}} cry ourselves." [...] They continued saying, [...] "It's kind of an echo of her famous [...] "We Found Love" [...] video, with that clip's quick-cut, drugged-up frenzy of bad romance replaced with solitary, locked-off shots that feel more intimate than exploitative. She looks amazing, but the focus isn't so much her body as the look of constant devastation on her face." [...] Brown summarised the clip as being [...] "appropriately minimalist" [...] and concluded calling it [...] "a beautiful video that broaden's Rihanna's emotional-musical palette." [...] Bené Viera of VH1 commented on the video saying, [...] "Usually the tough girl posturing is a cover up for a very sensitive soul. Rihanna cut the 'I don't give an eff' attitude for four minutes of makeup free, teary-eyed, glistening wet, raw emotion in the video for 'Stay.'" [...] Sarah Flanigan of Yahoo! thought the video shows [...] "a softer side of [...] personality audiences rarely get to see." [...] She also stated, [...] "There are no gimmicks, no flashy clothes, just a very raw and emotional performance allowing her to tell this love story in her own words." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV labelled the video as [...] "perfectly heartbreaking/emotionally vulnerable" [...] and thought the [...] "baptismal effect" [...] of the video [...] "feels like a seamless transition from Rihanna's 'Diamonds' video." [...] Tamar Anitai also of MTV compared the video to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004), writing that both videos [...] "are equal parts stunning and sobering, haunting and harrowing, and both feature impossibly famous singers reflecting upon damaged relationships while inviting us into their well-designed bathrooms as they vulnerably perform their ablutions." [...] Rihanna's [...] "Stay" [...] video was also compared to and said to be inspired by Janet Jackson's [...] "Every Time" [...] video, as well as Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] video, with one critic noting [...] "Rihanna isn't the first pop star to brood in a bathtub. Janet Jackson and Britney Spears also bared their emotion immersed in water. Janet bared all in a blue lagoon for her 'Every Time' video. A little less glam, Britney's tub scene in her 'Everytime' video proved dark foreshadowing into her troubled world." ...|$|E

60|$|Intensified yells {{all round}} told that {{chemical}} action {{had not been}} applied in vain, while the pirates who had gained the bulwarks were met with streams of boiling water in their faces. Heroes may and do face shot and shell coolly without flinching, but no hero ever faced boiling water coolly. The pirates turned simultaneously and received the streams in rear. Light cotton is but a poor defence in such circumstances. They sloped over the sides like eels, and sought refuge in the sea. Blazing with discomfiture and amazement, but not yet dismayed, these ferocious creatures tried the assault a second time. Their fury became greater, so did the numbers that gained a footing on the bulwarks, but not one reached the deck! The battery and the boiler played a part that day which it had never before entered into the brain of the wildest scientist to conceive. The hissing of the <b>hot</b> <b>shower</b> and the vigour of the cold shock were only equalled by the unearthly yelling of the foe, whose miraculous bounds and plunges formed a scene that is altogether indescribable.|$|E
60|$|The attack had {{now become}} general. The firemen swarmed {{in at the}} doors and windows the moment that it was {{possible}} for a human being to breathe the smoke and live. One of the engines attached two additional lengths of hose, dragged the branch through the first floor {{to the back of the}} house, got upon an outhouse, in at a back window, and attacked the foe in rear. On the roof, Frank and Dale were plying their hatchets, their tall figures sharply defined against the wintry sky, and looking more gigantic than usual. The enemy saved them the trouble of cutting through, however, for it suddenly burst upwards, and part of the roof fell in. It would certainly have taken Frank prisoner had not Dale caught him by the collar, and dragged him out of danger. Instantly a branch was pointed downwards, and the foe was beaten back; from above, below, before, and behind, it was now met with deluges of water, which fell on the shoulders of the men in the lower floor in a continuous <b>hot</b> <b>shower,</b> while they stood ankle-deep in hot water.|$|E
