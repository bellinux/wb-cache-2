5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E
5|$|During mid-May, {{a frontal}} {{boundary}} stalled near The Bahamas and slowly degenerated. On May25, a shortwave trough caused the northern {{portion of the}} system to move north of the Bahamas. The following day, an {{area of low pressure}} developed along the boundary about 290miles (465km) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. Tracking towards the north, the system became increasingly organized. On May27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> while it was located about 120miles (195km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. An upper-level ridge situated to the southeast of the system was steering it towards the northeast. The NHC issued their final outlook on the low around 0000UTC on May28 while the system was located about 90mi (150km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as development of the low was not expected.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish {{in the last three}} decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{current rates}} were {{introduced}} in 2007. Previously, base tuition was only ₱300 per unit (since 1989). Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007, from ₱400 (US$9) per student to ₱1,100 (US$25) and ₱2,000 (US$46), respectively. New fees, such as internet and energy fees, were introduced. The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition as the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> enrollment rate and high student loan levels, which totaled some ₱14 million (US$326,000) in 2007. Additionally, it criticizes the STFAP for allegedly being ineffective. Upon its introduction in 1989, only 16 percent of students received discounts. The number fell to 12 percent in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The first twelve stamps, the low {{values up to}} 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, did not appear until 8 September 1937. Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. Watermark and extra values were made until new designs, known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
