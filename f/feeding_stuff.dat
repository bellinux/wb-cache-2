40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of the project were to assess heavy metal flows on livestock farms {{and to develop a}} strategy to reduce heavy metal inputs into animal manures. For the experiments 20 farms with animal husbandry in various regions of Germany were selected. On the farms the inputs and outputs of the elements copper and zinc, as well as lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel were balanced at the stable level. The effect of abatement measures was evaluated using a calculation tool for stable balances. It is shown, the main input pathways for heavy metals into animal manures are, apart from copper disinfectants, <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> and <b>feed</b> supplements. Home grown feeds are the major source of heavy metal input into the stable because they are fed in large quantities. However, the heavy metal content of the home grown feeds in particular of roughages for ruminants is low. Purchased <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> (supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> and complete <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs)</b> were found to have a higher content of heavy metals (due to supplementation with trace elements) compared to home grown feeds. Thus, pig and poultry husbandry rather than ruminant husbandry is susceptible to heavy metal accumulation of manures. Heavy metals are cycling within the farm which is of importance when discussing the environmental impact. The turnover within the farm can hardly be controlled by the farmer. Thus, effective strategies have to be targeted at the inputs, e. g. the purchased <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs.</b> A main option to reduce the heavy metal input is to lower the trace element concentrations in supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> either by legislation of maximum threshold values (e. g. EG 1334 / 2003) or by volunteer agreements of the feed industry and agriculture. In addition, the absorption of copper and zinc by the animals should be improved using better absorbable trace element compounds and phytase. (orig.)

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed {{to examine the}} effect of difference fibrous feeds on feed intake and digestibility in swamps buffaloes compared to ongoles cattles. Twelve ongole and twelve buffaloes were used in in vivo digestibility. Ten feeds were used in this experiment, namely Peanut Haulm (PH), King Grass (KG), Corn stover (CS), Elephan Grass (EG), Rice Straw (RS), Soja Straw (SS), Corn Straw (CST), Glyricidea (Gli), and Caliandra (Cal). The observed variabels were intake of DM, OM, CP, NDF. The results showed that DM and OM intakes were significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> origin ranged from the lowest (Gli) of 29. 55 g DMI/kg 0. 75 to the highest (CS) of 94. 88 g/kg 0. 75. OM intake of buffaloes was higher than that of ongole cattle supported by organic matter (OM) digestibility data (61. 51 vs 59. 51). The digestibility of nutrient was significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> origin. OM digestibility of SS were lowest while the highest were CST of 54. 56 and 71. 66 % respectively. Digestibility of CP was also significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs</b> origin. The lowest Digestible Crude Protein was CST and the highest was PH of 44. 10 and 67. 99 % respectively. The digestibility of NDF and ADF were significantly influenced by <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs.</b> The lowest NDF and ADF digestibilities were Cal of 40. 84 and 33. 19 % and the highest digestibility of NDF and ADF were CST of 68. 53 and 63. 57 %.

40|$|Summary Prospects in {{introducing}} GM {{plants in the}} Italian agricultural production system (JEL: Q 18) The {{purpose of the present}} study is to evaluate the willingness of the Italian farmers and consumers respectively, to cultivate GM plants and to buy GM foods. In Italy is not allowed, at the moment, the cultivation of GM plants. Notwithstanding GM foods are normally present on the Italian market, which is strongly dependant from foreign markets especially for soy bean based foodstuffs primarily containing GMO. The study indicates that only 18 % of the Italian farmers are interested in cultivating GMO, mainly in the cereal and livestock sector where GM products are strongly utilized as <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> for animals. The consumers that declare to be favorable to GMO are 3 % while 8 % consider Italian agriculture to be somehow affected by GM presence. To the majority of the Italian consumers, particularly when buying beef filet and chicken food, it is more important the information regarding the fact that animals have been raised and fed with GMO â€“ free <b>feeding</b> <b>stuffs</b> rather than the price of the products itself. Within this framework, the opportunity and consequent choice of not cultivating GM plants seems, therefore, sustainable when considered on an overall supply chain approach aiming to offer a highly qualified product or, as in the case of animal <b>feed</b> <b>stuffs,</b> obtained without utilizing GMO...|$|R
