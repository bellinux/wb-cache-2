50|$|Dr Josephine Reynell from Oxford Hertford College says: 'Juan T. Vazquez Martin {{is among}} {{of the great}} Cuban masters of painting; he is also {{considered}} {{to be one of}} Cuba’s leading abstract painters. Through dedication to artistic freedom he has played a seminal role in keeping abstract art alive in Cuba. The so-called <b>Grey</b> <b>Period</b> or El Quinquenio Gris in Cuban culture, between 1970-1976, seriously undermined abstract art and indeed experimentation in all areas of the arts in Cuba. Art was seen as a useful propaganda tool and whilst no artist was forbidden to work in a certain way, only those artists whose work conformed to what was considered acceptable were supported. Many artists left the country. Juan T. Vazquez Martin’s refusal to leave Cuba and his steadfast commitment to his personal artistic vision exacted a heavy economic and personal cost, losing him official patronage and promotion. His courageous maintenance of his artistic vision in the face of real hardship has nevertheless enabled him to develop a unique style of painting which now has had a profound influence on the new generation of young Cuban artists.|$|E

5000|$|A Family {{belongs to}} the artist's <b>Grey</b> <b>Period</b> (1951-55). Widely {{acknowledged}} as the artist's masterpiece from this period, the painting marks a shift in palette from the comparatively colourful work of the late forties to predominant whites and greys. The art critic John Berger writes in Art News and Review: 'His style has developed and changed; his colours are pale and severe - the Family is mostly grey; his forms, in their movement both across and into the picture, are precise. This finesse implies - because le Brocquy's motive is always human - a tenderness which is not sentimental, {{and a sense of}} wonder which is exact; one thinks twice about the quite ordinary but in fact miraculous construction of any man's back, having looked at the father in the Family.' [...] According to the art critic John Russell: 'In the early 1950s, above all, he came before us as a man who was looking for the image that would compound all other images. Anyone who was around at the time and concerned with what was called [...] "post-war British art" [...] will remember the painting called [...] "A Family".' Louis le Brocquy explains: 'I have always been fascinated by the horizontal monumentality of traditional Odalisque painting, the reclining woman depicted voluptuously by one Master after another throughout the history of European art - Titians' Venus of Urbino, Velázquez' Rokeby Venus turning her back on the Spanish Court, Goya's Maja clothed and unclothed, Ingres' Reclining Odalisque in her seraglio and finally the great Olympia of Édouard Manet celebrating his favourite model, Victorine Meurent. My own painting A Family was conceived in 1950 in very different circumstances in face of the atomic threat, social upheaval and refugees of World WarII and its aftermath. The elements in its composition correspond in some ways to those of Olympia, if not to Manet's cool sensuality. The female figure in A Family may be seen to take on a very different significance. The man, replacing Manet's black servant with bouquet, sits alone. The bouquet is reduced to a mere wisp held by a child. The Olympian black cat in turn becomes white, ominously emerging from the sheets. This is how A Family appears to me today. Fifty years ago it was painted while contemplating a human condition stripped back to Palaeolithic circumstance under electric light bulbs.' ...|$|E
40|$|East Cleveland, Ohio is a {{city that}} has seen its {{prosperity}} fall into a <b>grey</b> <b>period</b> but is finally ready to forward toward a more colorful future. This once thriving 3 mi 2 industrial-metropolis has slowly degraded into a state of urban decay and widespread poverty. East Cleveland’s main arterial road, Superior Avenue, was at one point the commercial center of the city. It was the center of both the city's economy and its public space. Most importantly, it {{was the center of the}} inedible character of East Cleveland. This blue-collar, working class character has become lost amongst broken glass, plywood covered windows, and untamed landscapes. Beautiful boarded up buildings, abandoned lots, and empty storefronts line a majority of this 1. 5 mi stretch of Superior. Because of its importance to the Greater Cleveland Area and its prime location within the context of the city as a whole, East Cleveland was the perfect location for an urban regeneration project that reconsidered Superior Avenue as Cleveland's new "Garden District". East Cleveland needs to move away from its unsustainable past and toward a more productive and sustainable future. Overall, this design proposal responds to the countless voided spaces that exist on Superior Avenue. These spaces are in the form of unused parking, abandoned buildings, and empty lots. Not only are these voids unsightly, they are a waste of essential spaces that could be transformed into vital assets for the East Cleveland community. The design proposes that these spaces be re-envisioned as areas for the production of food, clean energy, and art. This network of productive spaces is bound together by an almost "greenway-like" right-of-way (street trees, a prevalent vegetated swale, separated bike line, pocket parks, and numerous living wall systems). Even the road itself acts as a productive entity as it allows water to percolate into a subsurface drainage system that is cycled throughout irrigation systems. The entire design is anchored by a new Biological Testing Center for the Cleveland Clinic that has been proposed on the site. Transforming Superior Avenue into Cleveland's new "Garden District" will attract new residents and help create a more economically stable environment. The design accommodates current residents, students (from nearby Case Western Reserve University), young professionals, doctors (from the nearby Cleveland Clinic), organic farmers, and emerging artists. All of these users will be able to access their places of work easily via transit, walking, or bicycling. The residents of the new "Garden District will be able to live comfortable lives knowing that the place they call home will be sustainable, exciting, and beautiful for a long time to come.

40|$|The paper reconstructs the {{teaching}} and research activities of scholars in statistics and related subjects at the University of Padua from the Restoration to the Second World War. The history of statistics in Padua is an interesting case study, as it allows {{to shed light on}} the evolution of the discipline at the national level as well as on its relationships with the international development of statistical methods. Some fascinating antecedents go back to the 16 th Century, with contributions by Gerolamo Cardano, student at the School of Medicine from 1524 to 1526, and later by Galileo Galilei, professor of mathematics at the University of Padua from 1592 to 1610. The 150 years from the Restoration to the 1960 s are marked by a sequence of phases of renewal and conservatism. At the beginning, the old Statistik took the place of political arithmetic. Statistics experienced telling improvements only with Angelo Messedaglia, who drew from Quetelet and outlined a new role for the discipline within the rethinking of the “science of administration”. After a <b>grey</b> <b>period</b> when statistics was considered as a social science supporting State intervention – without any peculiar methodological apparatus, a new phase of dramatic innovation followed, led by Corrado Gini, professor of Statistics in Padua from 1913 to 1925. His pupils and successors exacerbated the neo-descriptive approach of the «Italian school of Statistcs», the confrontation with modern statistical inference, and the support to the corporatist programme of the Fascism. This motivated a decline immediately after the Second World War. A new revival had to wait up to the mid 1950 s, with the appointment of Albino Uggé at the chair of Statistics, the crucial cooperation of Bernardo Colombo – who moved from the University of Venice to Padua in 1967, around whom a group of young scholars assembled. The establishment of a Faculty of Statistics, in 1968, was the prominent result of that process.

40|$|As yet, no cure {{exists for}} upper-limb {{paralysis}} {{resulting from the}} damage to motor pathways after spinal cord injury or stroke. Recently, neural activity from the motor cortex of paralyzed individuals {{has been used to}} control the movements of a robot arm but restoring function to patients’ actual limbs remains a considerable challenge. Previously we have shown that electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord in anesthetized monkeys can elicit functional upper-limb movements like reaching and grasping. Here we show that stimulation can be controlled using cortical activity in awake animals to bypass disruption of the corticospinal system, restoring their ability to perform a simple upper-limb task. Monkeys were trained to grasp and pull a spring-loaded handle. After temporary paralysis of the hand was induced by reversible inactivation of primary motor cortex using muscimol, grasp-related single-unit activity from the ventral premotor cortex was converted into stimulation patterns delivered in real-time to the cervical spinal <b>grey</b> matter. During <b>periods</b> of closed-loop stimulation, task-modulated electromyogram, movement amplitude and task success rate were improved relative to interleaved control periods without stimulation. In some sessions, single motor unit activity from weakly active muscles was also used successfully to control stimulation. These results are the first use of a neural prosthesis to improve the hand function of primates after motor cortex disruption, and demonstrate the potential for closed-loop cortical control of spinal cord stimulation to reanimate paralyzed limbs...|$|R

In Spain, the swine sector accounts for 11 % of agricultural output in economic terms and makes substantial demands on freshwater resources. In this study we estimate the WF of the Spanish pig sector at an average 19. 5 billion m 3 /yr (82 % green, 8 % blue, 10 % <b>grey)</b> over the <b>period</b> 2001 – 08.

In addition, electronic screening was made of the ?grey literature? using the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe - Open <b>Grey,</b> covering the <b>period</b> from January 2005 up to and including April 2016. A total of 728 articles were obtained from the initial screening process. Of these articles, 24 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality assessment showed sample size calculation to be reported by only one study, and follow-up did not include a large number of participants - a fact that may introduce bias and lead to misleading interpretations of the study results. The all-on-four treatment concept offers a predictable way to treat the atrophic jaw in patients that do not prefer regenerative procedures, which increase morbidity and the treatment fees. The results obtained indicate a survival rate for more than 24 months of 99. 8 %. However, current evidence is limited due the scarcity of information referred to methodological quality, a lack of adequate follow-up, and sample attrition. Biological complications (e. g., peri-implantitis) are reported in few patients after a mean follow-up of two years. Adequate definition of the success / survival criteria is thus necessary, due the high prevalence of peri-implant diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{nature and}} timing of rice {{domestication}} {{and the development of}} rice cultivation in South Asia is much debated. In northern South Asia there is presently a significant gap (c. 4200 years) between earliest evidence for the exploitation of wild rice (Lahuradewa c. 6000 BCE) and earliest dated evidence for the utilisation of fully domesticated rice (Mahagara c. 1800 BCE). The Indus Civilisation (c. 3000 – 1500 BCE) developed and declined during the intervening period, and there has been debate about whether rice was adopted and exploited by Indus populations during this ‘gap’. This paper presents new analysis of spikelet bases and weeds collected from three Indus Civilisation settlements in north-west India, which provide insight into the way that rice was exploited. This analysis suggests that starting in the period before the Indus urban phase (Early Harappan) and continuing through the urban (Mature Harappan/Harappan), post-urban (Late Harappan) and on into the post-Indus Painted <b>Grey</b> Ware (PGW) <b>period,</b> there was a progressive increase in the proportion of domesticated-type spikelet bases and a decrease in wild-types. This pattern fits with a model of the slow development of rice exploitation from wild foraging to agriculture involving full cultivation. Importantly, the accompanying weeds show no increased proportions of wetland species during this period. Instead a mix of wetland and dryland species was identified, and although these data are preliminary, they suggest that the development of an independent rice tradition may have been intertwined with the practices of the eastern most Indus peoples. These data also suggest that when fully domesticated Oryza sativa ssp. japonica was introduced around 2000 BCE, it arrived in an area that was already familiar with domesticated rice cultivation and a range of cultivation techniques...|$|R
