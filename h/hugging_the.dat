5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{ordered his}} fleet {{to prepare for}} action, and {{on the morning of}} April29 sailed for Fort Royal with the convoy ships <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> coast and the armed ships in battle line. Hood's fleet was seen bearing toward them around 08:00 but deGrasse held the weather gauge. At about 09:20, Hood was joined by Prince William, a 64-gun ship that had been at St. Lucia. The two fleets {{continued}} to push for advantageous positions. Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out and strengthen deGrasse's position. Gibraltar, as Drake's flagship, led the British rear division.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E

5|$|The valley narrows into {{a canyon}} {{as the road}} begins to climb again, closely <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> north wall. Four miles (6.4km) east of the city, just past Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where the road is closed in wintertime. Past this point {{development}} along the road abates {{as most of the}} land alongside the road is part of White River National Forest. On {{the north side of the}} road are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance moved northward, crossing Guatemala {{from the eastern}} Pacific ocean into the northwest Caribbean Sea between September 20 and September 21. It became a tropical cyclone soon after emerging into the Caribbean, and moved across the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical depression before becoming a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. It turned sharply east-northeast across the Mouth of the Mississippi river on September 24 as a minor hurricane. The storm continued east-northeast and made landfall in Florida east of Pensacola. The system evolved into an extratropical cyclone soon after passing out of the Sunshine State and continued moving east to northeast <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Seaboard to near the Virginia Capes before moving slowly through the shipping lanes between Canada and Bermuda, blocked by a high pressure system in southeast Canada.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, new {{materials}} were being developed and use in swimwear, particularly latex and nylon, and swimsuits gradually began <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> body, especially women's swimsuits.|$|E

25|$|The {{false scad}} lives both pelagically, free {{swimming}} {{high in the}} water column, as well as demersally, <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> bottom strata. It prefers sandy or muddy substrates over continental shelf environments, ranging in depths from 15 m to 200 m. Juveniles tend to inhabit shallower inshore waters including estuaries, lagoons, beaches and marshes.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{helicopters}} {{manned by}} the 15th Strike Wing of the Philippine Air Force, led by Colonel Antonio Sotelo, were ordered from Sangley Point in Cavite (South of Manila) {{to head to}} Camp Crame. Secretly, the squadron had already defected and instead of attacking Camp Crame, landed in it, with the crowds cheering and <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> pilots and crew members.|$|E
25|$|Two {{parallel}} {{mountain ranges}} cross El Salvador {{to the west}} with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85 percent of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains {{are referred to as}} the Pacific lowlands.|$|E

25|$|After {{launching}} their torpedoes, the destroyers retired {{north as}} planned, <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> coastlines of Leyte and Dinagat to avoid {{fire from the}} ships of DesRons 24 and 56 {{and those of the}} battleline. The squadron’s total score with its 47torpedoes, was five hits and three enemy ships sunk, more than earning Admiral Oldendorf’s praise of a “brilliantly conceived and well executed” torpedo attack.|$|E
25|$|Convoy routing {{was through}} the East China Sea, Formosa Strait, and South China Sea. Ships often joined or left convoys at the Formosan ports of Takao and Keelung, at the Mako naval base in the Pescadores, and at the Vietnamese ports of Cape Saint Jacques and Cam Ranh Bay. Some convoys stopped at Manila until MATA and TAMA feeder convoys between MAnila and TAkao enabled Hi convoys to avoid United States {{submarine}} wolfpacks in the Luzon Strait by <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> Asian coast between Hainan and Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|By 1943 the Allied threat towards German convoys in Norway had shifted. While {{previously}} naval {{attacks were}} the largest concern, air attacks became more prevalent. Convoys therefore increasingly operated at night, often <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> fjords during the daytime where the landscape made tactical bombing difficult. The short {{range of the}} Herdla-based aircraft was a challenge for the Luftwaffe, who in January 1944 therefore decided to again station Bf110s at Herdla. As of May 1944 the aircraft stationed at Herdla were six Bf110, three Fieseler Storch, one Focke-Wulf Fw 58 and a Junkers W 34.|$|E

25|$|On Penang Island, the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway is {{a coastal}} highway that {{runs along the}} eastern coast of the island. It runs between George Town and Batu Maung to the south, passing through the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone and the suburbs of Jelutong and Gelugor; a bypass also links the {{expressway}} with the Penang Bridge. Meanwhile, the Federal Route 6 is a winding trunk road that circles Penang Island, <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> island's coastline to connect, in clockwise direction, George Town, Bayan Lepas, Balik Pulau and Teluk Bahang.|$|E
25|$|The Ulvin Tunnel runs in {{the same}} area as the Morskogen Tunnel of said motorway. The route was {{controversial}} due to it <b>hugging</b> <b>the</b> shoreline of the lake Mjøsa. Local and environmental authorities wanted most of the railway and motorway to run in tunnels. It resulted in a compromise, where the Ulvin Tunnel allowed for a longer section of lakeshore to remain untouched. The groundwork contract was awarded to Veidekke and Hochtief, along with other works. The permanent way was laid by Infranord; Eltel installed the electrical and telecommunications systems. The tunnel is scheduled for opening on 23 November 2015.|$|E
