Diana's first amateur match is scheduled against another girl, but when her opponent pulls out she ends up fighting a man, Ray Cortez. Sandro arrives {{in the middle of}} the fight to see the match end in Ray's disqualification for illegal shoving. When Diana arrives home, Sandro berates her for looking like a loser.

When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Raj's girlfriend Lucy {{breaks up}} with him. The {{subsequent}} trauma apparently cures his mutism, and he finds <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to Penny, Amy, and Bernadette while completely sober. However, he talks so much that the women become bored and irritated and start drinking in order to put up with him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the UK rock group The Sweet {{recorded}} {{a tribute to}} Bell and the telephone, suitably titled [...] "Alexander Graham Bell". The song gives a fictional account of the invention, in which Bell devises the telephone so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> to his girlfriend who lives {{on the other side}} of the United States. The song reached the top 40 in the UK and went on to sell over one million recordings worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|On January 27, 2007, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Huckabee planned to file papers {{to form a}} presidential exploratory committee. [...] He announced his run for the White House on Meet the Press on January 28, 2007. Huckabee told reporters [...] "I {{think this is an}} opportunity to show the American dream is still alive and there's hope and optimism that can be awakened in a lot of people's lives if they think that a person like me can run and actually become president."James Carville, Clinton's former political consultant, said the following about Huckabee: [...] "He likes people, he knows how to relate to people. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> the talk. I'm impressed with this guy's political skills." ...|$|E

50|$|Most {{of these}} papers and lectures were {{indirectly}} or directly directed towards one end: {{a history of}} the figure of Jesus in popular and high culture in England and Germany since 1750. Frei seems to have found a new theological confidence bubbling up with this historical project, however: now, more than ever, the two sides of his work (which had been the source of his ambivalence in the 1970s) become inextricably linked. One moment <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>talking</b> about the rise of the professions in Germany and the impact that had on theology in the Universities. The next moment <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>talking</b> about the sensus literalis of scripture and theology as Christian self-description. The next moment (although this is not immediately evident from his published work) <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>talking</b> about providence and pilgrimage. It is hard now to gauge exactly what shape the final project would have taken in which all this rich material would have been combined, {{but it is clear that}} Frei wished to pursue theological reflection through the medium of detailed historical work, and wished to hone a full-blown Christology of his own - a Christology which would have had a significant political dimension - by paying detailed attention to the ways in which Jesus had been described and redescribed in Western Protestant culture since the Enlightenment.|$|R

2500|$|She {{brought her}} Diamond Lil character, now renamed [...] "Lady Lou", {{to the screen}} in She Done Him Wrong (1933). The film is also notable as one of Cary Grant's first major roles, which boosted his career. West claimed she spotted Grant at the studio and insisted that he be cast as the male lead. She claimed to have told a Paramount {{director}} [...] "If <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk,</b> I'll take him!" [...] The film was a box-office hit and earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The success of the film saved Paramount from bankruptcy, grossing over $2 million, the equivalent of $140 million in today's dollars. Paramount recognizes that debt of gratitude today, with a building on the lot named after her.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1974 taped {{interview}} with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the interviewer asked Clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person, and what life would be like around the year 2001. Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding {{to a question about}} how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: [...] "He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, , but at least, a console through which <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk,</b> through his local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian is a white-furred {{anthropomorphic}} dog. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk,</b> generally {{walks on}} {{his hind legs}} (using his front legs as arms), has opposable thumbs, drives a Toyota Prius, and often acts more rationally than the other characters in the series. He is the pet dog and close friend of the Griffin family, and, although anthropomorphic animals are not a regular element of the show, Brian's human attributes receive little acknowledgment and no explanation; he is largely treated as a human character. Brian has a particularly close friendship with Stewie, {{and many of the}} show's sub-plots center around them. They are occasionally {{at the center of the}} plot, for instance in the [...] "Road to..." [...] episodes. Brian and Stewie have shown affection to each other several times, and in the episode Brian and Stewie, they admitted that they loved each other, not as lovers, but as close friends, though Stewie has shown signs of romantic and sexual interest in Brian in other episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Leon is {{described}} as sexy, effortlessly cool, with a short fuse {{and a lack of}} respect for those in authority. His mother died {{when he was a child}} and he was left in charge of his alcoholic father. In an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy, Attwater said the character is strong-minded, going on to say: [...] "He's a boxer, he wins in the ring and he has a way with the ladies. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> most into bed! That's his strong attribute! Leon's mum died when he was young, and that was a big thing for him. His relationship with his father's quite rocky, so I think that's where his weakness lies, in his family life. He tries to push that away as much as possible." [...] He said that during EastEnders: E20, [...] "ou see his strengths and weaknesses and by the end of it, he becomes quite a rounded character, which is taken on into the main series." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first known}} {{instances}} of [...] "hillbilly" [...] in print were in The Railroad Trainmen's Journal (vol. ix, July 1892), an 1899 photograph {{of men and}} women in West Virginia labeled [...] "Camp Hillbilly", and a 1900 New York Journal article containing the definition: [...] "a Hill-Billie is a free and untrammeled white citizen of Tennessee, who lives in the hills, has no means to speak of, dresses as <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> <b>talks</b> as <b>he</b> pleases, drinks whiskey when he gets it, and fires off his revolver as the fancy takes him". The stereotype is twofold in that it incorporates both positive and negative traits: [...] "Hillbillies" [...] are often considered independent and self-reliant individuals who resist the modernization of society, but at the same time they are also defined as backward and violent. Scholars argue this duality is reflective of the split ethnic identities in white America.|$|R

His spirit resides in that puppet ever since Rino's mother was still alive and probably can move because of the power she put in the doll. However, Rino is also not aware of this fact. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> only <b>talk</b> when somebody's hand is put inside his puppet body, that includes anybody even Rino.|$|R
