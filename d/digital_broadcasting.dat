5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of <b>digital</b> <b>broadcasting</b> as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E

It included representatives from free-to-air broadcasters, manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers and was intended to provide information about commencement dates, coverage, and the functionality and availability of equipment.|$|E

During the 11th ASEAN <b>Digital</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> Meeting members updated the status on DTV implementation and agreed to inform ASEAN members on the Guidelines for ASEAN Digital Switchover. An issue was raised around the availability and affordability of set-top boxes (STB), thus ASEAN members were asked to make policies to determine funding for STBs, methods of allocation, subsidies and rebates, and other methods for the allocation of STBs. It was also agreed in the meeting to form a task force to develop STB specifications for DVB-T2 to ensure efficiency.|$|E

40|$|<b>Digital</b> {{multimedia}} <b>broadcasting</b> {{is available}} {{in more and more}} countries with various forms. One of the most successful forms is <b>Digital</b> Video <b>Broadcasting</b> for Terrestrial (DVB-T), which has been deployed in most countries of the world for years. In order to bring the <b>digital</b> multimedia <b>broadcasting</b> services to battery-powered handheld receivers in a mobile environment, <b>Digital</b> Video <b>Broadcasting</b> for Handheld (DVB-H) has been formally adopted by ETSI. More advanced and complex <b>digital</b> multimedia <b>broadcasting</b> systems are under development, for example, the next generation of DVB-T, a. k. a. DVB-T 2. Current commercial DVB-T/H receivers are usually built upon dedicated application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). However, ASICs are not flexible for incoming evolved standards and less overall-area efficient since they cannot be efficiently reused and shared among different radio standards, when we integrate a DVB-T/H receiver into a mobile phone. This paper presents an example implementation of a DVB-T/H receiver on the prototype of Infineon Technologies' Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platform called MuSIC (Multiple SIMD Cores), which is a DSP-centered and accelerator-assisted architecture and aims at battery-powered mass-market handheld terminals...|$|R
