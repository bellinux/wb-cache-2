Here, using a murine model of -thalassemia, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that selective enrichment in vivo of transplanted, drug-resistant HSCs can be used therapeutically and may there-fore be a useful approach to overcome limiting gene transfer. We used an on-coretroviral vector to transfer a methyl-guanine methyltransferase (MGMT) drug-resistance gene into normal bone marrow cells. These cells were transplanted into -thalassemic mice given nonmyeloabla-tive pretransplantation conditioning with temozolomide (TMZ) and O 6 -benzylgua-nine (BG).

40|$|Monogenic {{disorders}} (MGDs), {{which are}} caused by single gene mutations, have a serious effect on human health. Among these, β-thalassemia (β-thal) {{represents one of the}} most common hereditary hematological diseases caused by mutations in the human hemoglobin β (HBB) gene. The technologies of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genetic correction provide insights into the treatments for MGDs, including β-thal. However, traditional approaches for correcting mutations have a low efficiency and leave a residual footprint, which leads to some safety concerns in clinical applications. As a proof of concept, we utilized single-strand oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs), high-fidelity CRISPR/Cas 9 nuclease, and small molecules to achieve a seamless correction of the β- 41 / 42 (TCTT) deletion mutation in β thalassemia patient-specific iPSCs with remarkable efficiency. Additionally, off-target analysis and whole-exome sequencing results revealed that <b>corrected</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a minimal mutational load and no off-target mutagenesis. When differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and then further to erythroblasts, the <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> <b>cells</b> expressed normal β-globin transcripts. Our studies provide the most efficient and safe approach for the genetic correction of the β- 41 / 42 (TCTT) deletion in iPSCs for further potential cell therapy of β-thal, which represents a potential therapeutic avenue for the gene correction of MGD-associated mutants in patient-specific iPSCs...|$|R

Similar protocols, however, failed to engraft Fanconi anemia (FA) patients with <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> <b>cells.</b> In this study, we first aimed to correlate the hematological status of 27 FA patients with CD 34 + cell values determined in their bone marrow (BM). Strikingly, no correlation between these parameters was observed, although good correlations were obtained when numbers of colony-forming cells (CFCs) were considered. Based on these results, and because purified FA CD 34 + cells might have suboptimal repopulating properties, we investigated the possibility of <b>genetically</b> <b>correcting</b> unselected BM samples from FA patients. Our data show that the lentiviral transduction of unselected FA BM cells mediates an efficient phenotypic correction of hematopoietic progenitor cells and also of CD 34 − mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), with a reported role in hematopoietic engraftment.

Using sc-ddPCR, we analyzed the engraftment of vector-transduced cells in two patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) who were treated with SCGT. Sufficient engraftment of the transduced cells was limited to the T cell lineage in peripheral blood (PB), and a small percentage of CD 34 + cells exhibited vector integration in bone marrow, indicating that the transgene-positive cells in PB might have differentiated from a small population of stem cells or lineage-restricted precursor cells. sc-ddPCR is a simplified and powerful tool for the detailed assessment of transgene-positive cell distribution in patients treated with SCGT...|$|R

Current ex vivo transduction protocols require manipulation of HSC by culture in cytokines for various lengths of time depending upon the retroviral vector that may force HSC to enter pathways of proliferation, and possibly differentiation, that could limit their engraftment potential, pluripotentiality and long-term repopulating capacity. We have compared the ability of normal CD 34 + cells cultured in a standard cytokine cocktail for 18 hours or 4. 5 days to reconstitute XSCID dogs following bone marrow transplantation {{in the absence of any}} pre-transplant conditioning with that of freshly isolated CD 34 + cells.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} agreement from patient and professional organisations alike that the safety of stem cell therapeutics is of paramount importance, particularly for ex vivo autologous gene therapy. Yet current technology {{makes it difficult to}} thoroughly evaluate the behaviour of <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> stem <b>cells</b> before they are transplanted. To address this, we have developed a strategy that permits transplantation of a clonal population of <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> autologous stem <b>cells</b> that meet stringent selection criteria and the principle of precaution. As a proof of concept, we have stably transduced epidermal stem cells (holoclones) obtained from a patient suffering from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Holoclones were infected with self-inactivating retroviruses bearing a COL 7 A 1 cDNA and cloned before the progeny of individual stem cells were characterised using a number of criteria. Clonal analysis revealed a great deal of heterogeneity among transduced stem cells in their capacity to produce functional type VII collagen (COLVII). Selected transduced stem cells transplanted onto immunodeficient mice regenerated a non-blistering epidermis for months and produced a functional COLVII. Safety was assessed by determining the sites of proviral integration, rearrangements and hit genes and by whole-genome sequencing. The progeny of the selected stem cells also had a diploid karyotype, was not tumorigenic and did not disseminate after long-term transplantation onto immunodeficient mice. In conclusion, a clonal strategy is a powerful and efficient means of by-passing the heterogeneity of a transduced stem cell population. It guarantees a safe and homogenous medicinal product, fulfilling the principle of precaution and the requirements of regulatory affairs. Furthermore, a clonal strategy makes it possible to envision exciting gene-editing technologies like zinc finger nucleases, TALENs and homologous recombination for next-generation gene therapy...|$|R

Here, we show that patients with a related disease, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2 D (LGMD 2 D), which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding α-sarcoglycan, have reduced numbers of this pericyte subset and thus produce too few mesoangioblasts for use in autologous cell therapy. Hence, we reprogrammed fibroblasts and myoblasts from LGMD 2 D patients to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and developed a protocol for the derivation of mesoangioblast-like cells from these iPSCs. The iPSC-derived mesoangioblasts were expanded and <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> in vitro with a lentiviral vector carrying the gene encoding human α-sarcoglycan and a promoter that would ensure expression only in striated muscle.

We have developed a treatment in which we combined the effects of nitric oxide with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory activity by using HCT 1026, a nitric oxide-releasing derivative of flurbiprofen. Here, we report the results of long-term (1 -year) oral treatment with HCT 1026 of two murine models for limb girdle and Duchenne muscular dystrophies (α-sarcoglycan-null and mdx mice). In both models, HCT 1026 significantly ameliorated the morphological, biochemical, and functional phenotype {{in the absence of}} secondary effects, efficiently slowing down disease progression. HCT 1026 acted by reducing inflammation, preventing muscle damage, and preserving the number and function of satellite cells.

As an additional beneficial effect, HCT 1026 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of arterially delivered donor stem cells, by increasing 4 -fold their ability to migrate and reconstitute muscle fibers.

30|$|Recently, {{generation}} of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) {{has shown a}} great therapeutic potential to obtain disease <b>corrected</b> patient specific <b>cells</b> (Raya et al. 2009). This observation has wider applications in cell and gene therapy and can help in overcoming the limitation of gene therapy, insertional oncogenesis and lack of hematopoietic stem cells. Like embryonic stem (ES) cells, human iPS cells can differentiate to any cell lineage in the body; and <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> iPS <b>cells</b> specifically target safe integration sites of the therapeutic transgenes. Raya et al in 2009 showed that on the introduction of wild-type transgene, reprogramming efficiency is restored but endogenous FA mutation carrying iPS cells may be generated and subsequent knockdown of the correcting transgene led to rapid loss of self-renewal. This suggests that an intact FA pathway is required for induction and maintenance of pluripotency (Raya et al. 2009). However, {{it may be possible}} that disruption of the DNA repair machinery in FA cells precludes resolution of the DNA breaks that occurs due to the reprogramming protocol with retroviral/lentiviral integration. Thus using nonintegrating transgenes for reprogramming may permit the {{generation of}} genetic lesion free FA iPS cells and can also be propagated continuously. Further studies will be required to elucidate the precise role of the FA pathway in induction and maintenance of pluripotency (MacMillan et al. 2011).

Extensive characterization of BM-derived CD 34 (+) cells before and following gene transfer shows the achievement of high frequency of transduction, restoration of haemoglobin A synthesis, rescue from apoptosis and correction of ineffective erythropoiesis.

Children with SCA {{are at high risk}} for ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks, secondary to intracranial arteriopathy involving carotid and cerebral arteries. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for SCA. We report our experience with transplantation in a group of patients with the Black African variant of SCA. Patients and Methods: This study included 31 consecutive SCA patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -identical sibling donors between 2010 and 2014 following a myeloablative-conditioning regimen. Results: The median patient age was 10 years (range 2 - 17 years). Before transplantation, 14 patients had recurrent, painful, vaso-occlusive crisis; ten patients had recurrent painful crisis in association with acute chest syndrome; three patients experienced ischaemic stroke and recurrent vaso-occlusive crisis; two patients experienced ischaemic stroke; one patient exhibited leukocytosis; and one patient exhibited priapism. Of the 31 patients, 28 survived without sickle cell disease, with Lansky/Karnofsky scores of 100. All surviving patients remained free of any SCA-related events after transplantation. Conclusion: The protocols used for the preparation to the transplant in thalassaemia are very effective also in the other severe haemoglobinopathy as in the sickle cell anaemia with 90 % disease free survival. Today, if a SCA patient has a HLA identical family member, the cellular gene therapy through the transplantation of the allogeneic haemopoietic cell should be performed.

Recent developments in gene correction using nec-mRNA encoding proteins such as ZFNs, TALENS, and CRISPR-Cas 9 have shown high potential to effectively correct genes while mitigating the danger of internal mutagenesis. It has been reported that using CRISPR-Cas 9 (with modified mRNA) to cleave the HBB gene and piggyBac for homologous recombination selection can correct two different β-thalassemia mutations and thus reduce the genetic status to a heterozygous state, where patients are only mildly anemic and capable of leading normal lives [31].|$|R

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the dystrophin gene {{that cause the}} absence of the dystrophin protein at the muscle fiber membrane of the affected patients. This leads to myofiber degeneration and progressive muscle wasting, ultimately resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no treatment that prevents or reverses the disease progression. <b>Genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> stem/progenitor <b>cells</b> could potentially provide an effective treatment. However, due to its large size, commonly used viral vector technologies preclude efficient gene transfer of the full-length dystrophin coding DNA sequence (CDS; size: 11. 1 Kb). In this study we validated a novel stem cell-based non-viral gene therapy approach for DMD with the use of piggyBac (PB) transposons. These plasmidbased non-viral vectors are able to stably integrate the gene of interest into the genome of the target cells leading to its sustained expression. Moreover, the large cargo capacity of these vectors could overcome one of the main bottlenecks in the field enabling gene therapy with full-length instead of truncated dystrophin. We have therefore generated PB transposons coding for either fulllength or truncated versions of the human dystrophin CDS. We demonstrated that this system enables stable non-viral gene delivery, with sustained expression of both full-length and truncated versions of dystrophin into murine myoblasts. We subsequently transferred PB transposons containing the fulllength human dystrophin CDS into dystrophic mesoangioblasts (MABs). These myogenic vessel associated stem/progenitor cells are capable of crossing the vessels and contribute to the regeneration of the dystrophic muscles upon intraarterial transplantation. The use of MABs has resulted to be relatively safe in a recently completed phase I/II clinical trial based on intra-arterial infusions at escalating doses of HLA-matched donor-derived MABs in DMD patients under immunosuppressive regimen (EudraCTno. 2011 - 000176 - 33). In our study, MABs were isolated from the muscles of a large animal model for DMD, the Golden Retriever {{muscular dystrophy}} (GRMD) dog. The <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> GRMD MABs showed stable transposition and expression of the full-length human 12 dystrophin. Since MABs have a limited proliferative capacity, we have also investigated the possible use of MABs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients suffering from DMD, as an alternative (designated as human iPSC-derived mesoangioblast-like cells or HIDEMs). These cells can be expanded in culture to obtain a potentially unlimited supply of myogenic progenitors. HIDEMs derived from patients affected by DMD were then <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> with PB transposons resulting in stable expression of the full-length human dystrophin CDS. These cells successfully engrafted into the muscles of immunodeficient/dystrophic mice (scid/mdx) leading to the in vivo expression of the PB-mediated full-length human dystrophin in the myofiber membrane. Taken together, these results showed {{for the first time the}} validity of a non-viral gene transfer approach based on PB transposons that allows for the sustained expression of the full-length human dystrophin in dystrophic MABs and DMD patient-specific iPSC-derived MABs.

Targeted transgene integration overcomes the issue of random insertional mutagenesis associated with retroviral vectors, and may thus provides a safer gene transfer alternative. We developed a gene-targeting platform based {{on the use of}} zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) to insert a transgene by homologous recombination (HR) into the AAVS 1 locus on chromosome 19. We evaluated the targeting efficiency in a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by IDLV-mediated delivery of an AAVS 1 -specific ZFN pair together with an HR construct driving the insertion of a GFP expression cassette into the site of cleavage. We achieved up to 25 % of targeted insertion of single copies or concatamers of the GFP cassette into the AAVS 1 locus, as analyzed by PCR, Southern blotting and sequencing on individual HaCaT cell clones. Evidence of HR-mediated targeted integration was also obtained at a lower but significant frequency in human primary keratinocyte cultures, by using ZFNs-expressing Adeno vector together with IDLV carrying the GFP expression cassette flanked by AAVS 1 homology arms. We observed up to 9 % disruption of the ZFN target site, repaired by non-homologous end joining, as evaluated by Cel- 1 assay and pyrosequencing. These data suggest that the major limitation of ZFN-mediated targeted integration is represented by poor induction of the HR-dependent DNA repair pathway. To study gene targeting in repopulating keratinocyte stem cells, human skin equivalents derived from keratinocytes co-infected with IDLV donor and AdZFNs vectors were grafted onto immunodeficient (nu/nu) mice. GFP-positive spots were observed for at least 10 weeks in the grafted tissue, confirming that stable integration occurred in transplantable keratinocyte stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation of autologous, <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> {{epidermal}} stem <b>cells</b> (EpSC) {{was successfully}} {{used to treat}} junctional epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a genetic skin adhesion disorder. The dystrophic forms of EB is caused by mutations in the type-VII collagen gene (COL 7 A 1) Delivering the > 9 kb COL 7 A 1 cDNA by a retroviral vector is problematic, due to the large size and highly repeated nature of its sequence, which induce genetic rearrangements during reverse transcription and integration. We tested the feasibility of using a non-viral vector system based on Sleeping Beauty (SB) -derived transposons, taking advantages of the recently developed, high-capacity “sandwich” version of the SB transposon and the “hyperactive” SB 100 X transposase, which showed high transposition efficiency in human stem cells. We tested the system in HeLa cells and in a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), which were co-transfected with the SB 100 X transposase and either the normal or the sandwich version of the SB transposon containing a small-size reporter gene (Venus or GFP) expression cassette. In both cell lines, transposition was obtained in up to 80 % of the transfected cells with the sandwich transposon, compared to ~ 50 % obtained with the older version. Transposed HaCaT cells were cloned and analysed for integration events. Individual clones carried several copies of the integrated transposon of the predicted size. High-throughput sequencing is under way to analyze the sandwich SB transposon integration characteristics. We then tested a transposon carrying an 8. 8 -kb cassette, which again showed up to 80 % transposition efficiency in transfected cells. Finally, we generated sandwich transposons containing an expression cassette for the COL 7 A 1 cDNA {{under the control of}} a constitutive (PGK) or a keratinocyte-specific (K 14) promoter, which are currently being tested for integration in HaCaT cells. The SB-based gene delivery system will finally be tested in human primary keratinocyte cultures...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a severe hereditary disorder {{caused by a}} loss of dystrophin, an essential musculoskeletal protein. Decades of promising research have yielded only modest gains in survival {{and quality of life}} for these patients and there have been no approved gene therapies for DMD to date. There are two significant hurdles to creating effective gene therapies for DMD; it is difficult to deliver a replacement dystrophin gene due to its large size and current strategies to restore the native dystrophin gene likely require life-long administration of a gene-modifying drug. This thesis presents a novel method to address these challenges through restoring dystrophin expression by <b>genetically</b> <b>correcting</b> the native dystrophin gene using engineered nucleases that target one or more exons in a mutational hotspot in exons 45 - 55 of the dystrophin gene. Importantly, this hotspot mutational region collectively represents approximately 62 % of all DMD mutations. In this work, we utilize various engineered nuclease platforms to create genetic modifications that can correct a variety of DMD patient mutations. Initially, we demonstrate that genome editing can efficiently correct the dystrophin reading frame and restore protein expression by introducing micro-frameshifts in exon 51, which is adjacent to a hotspot mutational region in the dystrophin gene. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to mediate highly efficient gene editing after introducing a single TALEN pair targeted to exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. This led to restoration of dystrophin protein expression in cells from DMD patients, including skeletal myoblasts and dermal fibroblasts that were reprogrammed to the myogenic lineage by MyoD. We show that our engineered TALENs have minimal cytotoxicity and exome sequencing of cells with targeted modifications of the dystrophin locus showed no TALEN-mediated off-target changes to the protein coding regions of the genome, as predicted by in silico target site analysis. In an alternative approach, we capitalized on the recent advances in genome editing to generate permanent exclusion of exons by using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) to selectively remove sequences important in specific exon recognition. This strategy has the advantage of creating predictable frame restoration and protein expression, although it relies on simultaneous nuclease activity to generate genomic deletions. ZFNs were designed to remove essential splicing sequences in exon 51 of the dystrophin gene and thereby exclude exon 51 from the resulting dystrophin transcript, a method that can potentially restore the dystrophin reading frame in up to 13 % of DMD patients. Nucleases were assembled by extended modular assembly and context-dependent assembly methods and screened for activity in human cells. Selected ZFNs had moderate observable cytotoxicity and one ZFN showed off-target activity at two chromosomal loci. Two active ZFN pairs flanking the exon 51 splice acceptor site were transfected into DMD patient cells and a clonal population was isolated with this region deleted from the genome. Deletion of the genomic sequence containing the splice acceptor resulted in the loss of exon 51 from the dystrophin mRNA transcript and restoration of dystrophin expression in vitro. Furthermore, transplantation of <b>corrected</b> <b>cells</b> into the hind limb of immunodeficient mice resulted in efficient human dystrophin expression localized to the sarcolemma. Finally, we exploited the increased versatility, efficiency, and multiplexing capabilities of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to enable a variety of otherwise challenging gene correction strategies for DMD. Single or multiplexed sgRNAs were designed to restore the dystrophin reading frame by targeting the mutational hotspot at exons 45 - 55 and introducing either intraexonic small insertions and deletions, or large deletions of one or more exons. Significantly, we generated a large deletion of 336 kb across the entire exon 45 - 55 region that is applicable to correction of approximately 62 % of DMD patient mutations. We show that, for selected sgRNAs, CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing displays minimal cytotoxicity and limited aberrant mutagenesis at off-target chromosomal loci. Following treatment with Cas 9 nuclease and one or more sgRNAs, dystrophin expression was restored in Duchenne patient muscle cells in vitro. Human dystrophin was detected in vivo following transplantation of <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> patient <b>cells</b> into immunodeficient mice. In summary, the objective of this work was to develop methods to <b>genetically</b> <b>correct</b> the native dystrophin as a potential therapy for DMD. These studies integrate the rapid advances in gene editing technologies to create targeted frameshifts that restore the dystrophin gene around patient mutations in non-essential coding regions. Collectively, this thesis presents several gene editing methods that can correct patient mutations by modification of specific exons or by deletion of one or more exons that results in restoration of the dystrophin reading frame. Importantly, the gene correction methods described here are compatible with leading cell-based therapies and in vivo gene delivery strategies for DMD, providing an avenue towards a cure for this devastating disease.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) –associated cardiac diseases are {{emerging as a}} major cause of morbidity and mortality in DMD patients, and many therapies for treatment of skeletal muscle failed to improve cardiac function. The reprogramming of patients' somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, combined with technologies for correcting the genetic defect, possesses great potential for the development of new treatments for genetic diseases. In this study, we obtained human cardiomyocytes from DMD patient–derived, induced pluripotent stem <b>cells</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> with a human artificial chromosome carrying the whole dystrophin genomic sequence. Stimulation by cytokines was combined with cell culturing on hydrogel with physiological stiffness, allowing an adhesion-dependent maturation and a proper dystrophin expression.

We demonstrated that the human artificial chromosome carrying the whole dystrophin genomic sequence is stably maintained throughout the cardiac differentiation process and that multiple promoters of the dystrophin gene are properly activated, driving expression of different isoforms. These dystrophic cardiomyocytes can be a valuable source for in vitro modeling of DMD-associated cardiac disease.

40|$|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {{testing is}} a widely {{accepted}} screening method for prostate cancer, but with low specificity at thresholds giving good sensitivity. Previous research identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) principally associated with circulating PSA levels rather than with prostate cancer risk (TERT rs 2736098, FGFR 2 rs 10788160, TBX 3 rs 11067228, KLK 3 rs 17632542). Removing the genetic contribution to PSA levels may improve {{the ability of the}} remaining biologically-determined variation in PSA to discriminate between high and low risk of progression within men with identified prostate cancer. We investigate whether incorporating information on the PSA-SNPs improves the discrimination achieved by a single PSA threshold in men with raised PSA levels. Men with PSA between 3 - 10 ng/mL and histologically-confirmed prostate cancer were categorised as high or low risk of progression (Low risk: Gleason score≤ 6 and stage T 1 -T 2 a; High risk: Gleason score 7 - 10 or stage T 2 C). We used the combined genetic effect of the four PSA-SNPs to calculate a <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> PSA risk score. We calculated the Area under the Curve (AUC) to determine how well <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> PSA risk scores distinguished men at high risk of progression from low risk men. The analysis includes 868 men with prostate cancer (Low risk: 684 (78. 8 %); High risk: 184 (21. 2 %)). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that including the 4 PSA-SNPs does not improve the performance of measured PSA as a screening tool for high/low risk prostate cancer (measured PSA level AUC = 59. 5 % (95 % CI: 54. 7, 64. 2) vs additionally including information from the 4 PSA-SNPs AUC = 59. 8 % (95 % CI: 55. 2, 64. 5) (p-value = 0. 40)). We demonstrate that <b>genetically</b> <b>correcting</b> PSA for the combined genetic effect of four PSA-SNPs, did not improve discrimination between high and low risk prostate cancer in men with raised PSA levels (3 - 10 ng/mL).

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. Ph. D. Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics. Advisor: DR. R. Scott McIvor. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 203 pages. Artemis is an endonuclease {{characterized as a}} key factor involved in both nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and variable (diversity) joining (V(D) J) recombination. Mutations in the gene encoding Artemis result in a radiationsensitive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) found at a high incidence in Athabascan-speaking Native Americans (SCID-A) and characterized {{by the absence of}} mature B and T lymphocytes. Early treatment is critical since otherwise the disease results in severe infections that ultimately lead to fatality at a young age. The current therapy for SCID-A is allogeneic hematopoeitic cell transplantation (HCT); however, HCT often results in incomplete reconstitution of B lymphocytes and may lead to complications such as graft versus host disease. Transplantation with <b>genetically</b> <b>corrected</b> autologous <b>cells</b> is an alternative approach that may provide improved treatment of SCID-A. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with VSV-G are compelling candidate vectors for gene transfer considering their high transduction efficiency and capability to mediate gene transfer in non-dividing cells populations, such as quiescent hematopoietic stem cells. Accordingly, I developed several lentiviral vectors for the transduction of human Artemis cDNA into hematopoeitic cells for the correction of a murine model of SCID-A. Upon characterization of these vectors I found that Artemis over-expression results in a decrease in cell survival due to genomic DNA fragmentation, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately apoptosis. These data emphasize the importance of transgene regulation and demonstrate the necessity of establishing conditions that provide Artemis expression at a level iv that is non-toxic yet sufficient to complement Artemis deficiency. To this end, I subsequently recovered and characterized the endogenous human Artemis promoter (APro) as a one-kilobase region located directly upstream of the human Artemis translational start site. APro conferred a moderate level of reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo, including secondary mouse transplant recipients, thus demonstrating reliable expression after lentiviral gene transfer into hematopoeitic stem cells. Subsequently, I compared innate regulation of the human Artemis cDNA using its own endogenous promoter sequence to that of the strong EF 1 α and more moderate PGK promoter for the capacity to mediate correction of a murine model of Artemis deficiency presenting a B- T- phenotype and exhibiting no leakiness (mArt -/-). Transplantation with both APro-hArtemis and PGK-hArtemis transduced mArt -/- marrow led to complete reconstitution of the immune compartment in the recipient animals. Beginning at 8 weeks posttransplant, the recipient animals had wild-type levels of CD 3 +CD 4 + and CD 3 +CD 8 + T lymphocytes and B 220 +NK 1. 1 - B lymphocytes, cell populations that are absent in mArt -/- immunodeficient mice. However, transplantation with EF 1 α-hArtemis transduced marrow did not support immune reconstitution, suggestive of cytotoxic effects caused by Artemis over-expression. AProhArtemis treated mice exhibited restored IgM and IgG responses against 4 - hydroxyl- 3 -nitrophenylacetyl hapten conjugated-keyhole limpet hemocyanin as well as restored cellular immune function, as assessed by in vitro stimulation of isolated splenocytes with anti-CD 3 or concanavalin A. These results demonstrate that the naturally regulated Artemis lentiviral vector effectively complemented murine SCID-A, contributing to the development and advancement of gene transfer as a clinically relevant and feasible approach for treatment of SCID-A in humans...|$|R
