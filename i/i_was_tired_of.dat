25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm {{going to do}} things rightâ€”I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
500|$|I {{told him}} to mind his own business, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> having the Cause {{constantly}} thrown in my face. I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it.

500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna go make a record, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2016, Keys {{initiated}} a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on Lenny [...] "Before I started my new album, I wrote {{a list of}} all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years after}} the release of her debut, Velasquez {{represented}} the Philippines in the 1989 Asia Pacific Singing Contest. She had initially felt apprehensive to compete and was skeptical about the idea of participating in another competition at that stage in her career. Velasquez said, [...] "I was scared at first of going there to compete. I felt I wasn't that good. Besides, I've gotten tired of competing. All my life that was what I did. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the pressure." [...] She eventually obliged at the urging of Henares and later won the contest in Hong Kong, performing the songs [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone" [...] from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] from the musical Dreamgirls ...|$|E

Don Bucci, a 10-year veteran who had managed a number of wrestlers in the National Wrestling Alliance during the 1990s, was the primary promoter for PCW and ran the day-to-day operations up until its close. He had originally decided to form PCW, according to a later interview, after [...] "watching all the other bad indies out there, especially in this area. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> seeing the people get ripped off." [...] He was especially supportive of allowing more creative control by wrestlers, providing fair pay and a safe working environment.

2500|$|Eventually, Schultzberg {{did indeed}} leave the band in September 1996, on a United States tour. Before going on stage {{for their first}} show {{in the state of}} New York, Olsdal {{informed}} Schultzberg that he wasn't going on the tour in Germany that was following the US one. At the manager's request, Schultzberg did two more shows with the band in Paris after the US tour, the last of which was a performance on the French TV series Nulle part ailleurs. According to Schultzberg [...] "Molko said that he was 'tired of being the focus of Robert's rages against the world', and quite frankly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being his". While Schultzberg was with the band, several early works were recorded, including their first 7" [...] single [...] "Bruise Pristine", the [...] "Come Home" [...] EP, the single version of [...] "Nancy Boy" [...] (with B-sides [...] "Slackerbitch", [...] "Miss Moneypenny" [...] and the Smiths cover [...] "Bigmouth Strikes Again") and their eponymous debut album. On the track [...] "I Know", Schultzberg played didgeridoo as well as drums. Hewitt eventually joined Placebo as a full-time member at Molko's request.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 1998, a {{few days}} after the band {{accumulated}} [...] " [...] total [...] more than $25,000" [...] in backstage and hotel room damages during the Poughkeepsie, New York stop of their Mechanical Animals Tour, SPIN editor Craig Marks filed a $24million lawsuit against Manson and his bodyguards for allegedly assaulting his person and threatening to kill his family. According to Marks' interview with the New York Post, the issue stemmed from Manson's displeasure with the magazine's decision to renege on a promised cover story of the band for their January 1999 cover. According to Marks, the last-minute change was made because Manson's record wasn't [...] "performing." [...] The Post described the editor as [...] "bruised and battered." [...] Manson for his part issued a statement saying, [...] "I had a conversation with Craig Marks expressing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> Spins immature business behavior and the series of deals they had broken with me. I told him that I didn't care what he prints or whether or not I'm on the cover. I simply no longer wanted to work with him or his magazine that obviously has a lack of respect for musicians and their fans." ...|$|E

[...] "We've become a sheep-like consumer race that depends on other communities for our culture, language, feeding, and clothing. We've become economic slaves in Western society." [...] The argument that Blacks must become economically self-reliant and foster collective partnering relationships is not new. It has been voiced by such notable figures as Booker T. Washington, W.
