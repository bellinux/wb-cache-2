40|$|The {{international}} fusion experiment ITER {{is being}} built in Cadarache/France. An important parameter to be measured is the plasma radiation, which can {{be determined by the}} bolometer diagnostic. The most important R&D tasks to be completed for the realisation of this diagnostic are the detector development, the manufacture and test of prototypes and the development of the diagnostic integration into the ITER vessel. Within a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) prototype detectors have been developed in close collaboration with the Institut für Mikromechanik in Mainz (now Fraunhofer ICT-IMM). They show a high sensitivity and could be applied successfully for measurements on existing fusion devices. However, for the high operating temperatures in ITER their mechanical stability is still insufficient. Two concepts for improving this have been identified. Furthermore, all relevant components of a bolometer diagnostic have been developed and prototypes manufactured. Test facilities have been designed, built and brought into operation as part of this project to test and improve the prototype components for the use in ITER. The development of the diagnostic components has been accompanied by intensive finite-element-analyses. The combination of analyses and tests was essential to achieve the required results. This BMBF-funded project allowed IPP and its partners to evolve its competences in the field of bolometer development and enhance their visibility within the fusion community. Because of their competences, the ITERBolo consortium lead by IPP has been awarded the <b>framework</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>contract</b> for the further development of the ITER bolometer diagnostic by Fusion for Energy, the European domestic agency responsible for the European ITER contributions. Thus, IPP can continue the bolometer development and further scientifically exploit these tasks...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 124 - 128. This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} a framework within which to analyse and discuss the "e-tailing partnership" - a "horizontal" partnership model in which e-taiIers promote, sell and even bundle one another’s goods in a mutually beneﬁcial partnership. At {{the core of the}} framework is the concept of "value". The research draws on marketing theory to structure value into a "value block" which enables ﬁrms to quantify gains or losses in e-tailing projects. The paper discusses e-tailing partnerships within the value block <b>framework.</b> The <b>partnership</b> <b>contract</b> and the distribution of value between partners are both analysed. Design requirements for theoretical partnering systems are deduced and reported. Risks and implications for related systems are considered. Finally, three commercial software candidates are empirically evaluated in terms of the partnership models presented. From this research it is apparent that the e-tailing partnership is worth serious contemplation and may prove to be a signiﬁcant business model for ﬁrms in the New Internet Economy...|$|R

40|$|In Sharia, {{charging}} interest (riba) and all transactions involving {{risk and}} gambling (maysir) or uncertainty (gharar) are absolutely prohibited. Consequently, the Islamic financial solution, regularly referred to <b>partnership</b> <b>contracts,</b> proposes an equitable sharing of risks and profits between the involving parties {{in a financial}} transaction. The <b>partnership</b> <b>contract</b> in the discussion on Islamic banking and finance {{is closely related to}} the principles of al-mudaraba and al-musharaka. In contrast, there are also <b>partnership</b> <b>contracts</b> which are classified to be used in agricultural land development, namely al-muzara'a and al-musaqa. In general, the contracts of al-muzara'a and al-musaqa have a resemblance to the contracts of al-mudaraba and almusharaka. However, the similarity of al-muzara'a and al-musaqa to al-mudaraba and almusharaka is not in substance but is in concept of the contract. This is because the al-muzara'a and al-musharaka contracts focus in agriculture, while al-mudaraba and al-musharaka are more suited to trade and commercial contracts. Therefore, al-muzara'a can be identified as "agricultural product and loss sharing" (aPLS) and al-mudaraba and al-musharaka as "profit and loss sharing" (PLS). As a result, an Islamic <b>partnership</b> <b>contract</b> by the financial institutions for agricultural land development ought to implement aPLS which is based on the principles of almuzara'a and al-musaqa...|$|R
