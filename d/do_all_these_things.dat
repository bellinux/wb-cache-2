500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving. All of these things {{operating}} in synchronicity: like ringtones, flat-screens, theater, cuisine, fashion, sushi. I don't {{want to call it}} [...] "virtual reality," [...] so I call it Far Side Virtual. If you really want to understand Far Side, first off, listen to [...] Debussy, and secondly, go into a frozen yogurt shop. Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E
2500|$|On April 24, Christie denied {{creating}} a [...] "culture of divisiveness" [...] or that perceptions about his attitude {{may have led}} others to plan and allow the lane closures to occur as retaliation. [...] "If in fact I created a culture where people were going after each other, then how did we <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> together with Republicans and Democrats?" [...] Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting. [...] The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been [...] "vindictive and aggressive"; and concluded that Christie [...] "created the culture that inspired" [...] the lane closures.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} Deputies Committee meeting on {{terrorism}} held in April 2001, Clarke strongly {{suggested that the}} U.S. put pressure on both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by arming the Northern Alliance and other groups in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, that they target bin Laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the MQ-1 Predators. To which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz responded, [...] "Well, I just don't understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin Laden." [...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} bin Laden and his network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz turned to him and said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor. Just because FBI and CIA have failed to find the linkages does not mean they don't exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nina {{was very}} much {{involved}} in {{the whole process of}} producing the album that she had to give up several television appearances, which included dropping out of her ASAP group and segment entitled the Sessionistas. She explained [...] "Umalis po ako sa ASAP dahil nagprepare po talaga ako sa album. At nasasabay sa mga out of town and out of the country na shows. [...] " [...] She kept a close watch from the album's conceptualization to its songs and arrangement, and even the paper dolls inside the album was her own idea. To be able to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> she had to temporarily disappear in the scene for a while. Production for the album took nearly two years to finish, making people wonder if she had gone out of the music industry for good. In choosing a title for the album, Nina personally decided to call it Stay Alivecoming from the album's second track, [...] "Staying Alive"to remind the people that she is still very much around, in spite of the hiatus on TV, and the long break from the recording scene. She further explained the origin of the title: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Marcion {{composed}} a work (now lost) entitled Antithesis. In the Antithesis, Marcion {{set out in}} detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament. The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was [...] "an eye for an eye", but [...] Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 [...] "I make peace and create evil, I the Lord <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that [...] "a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit" [...] and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, Elisha had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, [...] "Let the little children come to me". Joshua had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. Paul quoted Jesus as commanding [...] "Let not the sun go down on your wrath"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, divorce was permitted and so was polygamy; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. Moses enforced the Jewish Sabbath and Jewish Law; Jesus has de-institutionalised both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example, [...] God commanded that no work should {{be done on the}} Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the ark around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a bronze serpent. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 8 of tractate Yoma in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud and chapter 4 of tractate Kippurim (Yoma) in the Tosefta {{interpreted}} {{the laws of}} self-denial in [...] and [...] The Mishnah taught that on Yom Kippur, one must not eat, drink, wash, anoint oneself, put on sandals, or have sexual intercourse. Rabbi Eliezer (whom the halachah follows) taught that a king or bride may wash the face, and a woman after childbirth may put on sandals. But the sages forbad doing so. The Tosefta taught that one must not put on even felt shoes. But the Tosefta taught that minors can <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> except put on sandals, for appearance's sake. The Mishnah held a person culpable to punishment for eating an amount of food equal to a large date (with its pit included), or for drinking a mouthful of liquid. For the purpose of calculating the amount consumed, one combines all amounts of food together, and all amounts liquids together, but not amounts of foods together with amounts of liquids. The Mishnah obliged one who unknowingly or forgetfully ate and drank to bring only one sin-offering. But one who unknowingly or forgetfully ate and performed labor had to bring two sin-offerings. The Mishnah did not hold one culpable who ate foods unfit to eat, or drank liquids unfit to drink (like fish-brine). The Mishnah taught that one should not afflict children at all on Yom Kippur. In the two years before they become Bar or Bat Mitzvah, one should train children to become used to religious observances (for example by fasting for several hours). The Mishnah taught that one should give food to a pregnant woman who smelled food and requested it. One should feed to a sick person {{at the direction of}} experts, and if no experts are present, one feeds a sick person who requests food. The Mishnah taught that one may even give unclean food to one seized by a ravenous hunger, until the person's eyes are opened. Rabbi Matthia ben Heresh said that one who has a sore throat may drink medicine even on the Sabbath, because it presented the possibility of danger to human life, and every danger to human life suspends the laws of the Sabbath.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God {{made clear that}} it was because the land's former {{inhabitants}} <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that God dispossessed them.
