As an effort to investigate more <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> potential for the school building, several other <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> <b>measures</b> and renewable <b>energy</b> measures were applied to the target building. Those measures include: increased glazing U-value, VFD application for the HVAC system, cold deck reset, variable speed for pumps, high-efficiency boiler, skylights, and the application of solar thermal and PV systems. The final simulation results show that the estimated Energy Use Index (EUI) of the school by applying all the measures but the solar thermal and PV systems would be 29. 9 kBtu/sqft (i. e., 38. 6 % <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> against the baseline school). In addition, solar thermal and PV systems were designed to provide half of the electricity demand and all the SWH demand of the school building, respectively. The final EUI for the school with the solar thermal and PV systems was estimated to be 15 kBtu/sqft...|$|R

The hybrid also employs stop-start technology and other <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>measures</b> to help improve efficiency.

5000|$|The Green Deal was a UK {{government}} policy. It {{was given}} a 'soft' launch by the Department of Energy and Climate Change on 1 October 2012 to permit loans for <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>measures</b> for properties in Great Britain and was officially launched in January 2013. These measures were designed to enable consumers to benefit from energy efficient improvements to their home. The loans are repaid through energy bills and transfer with the property rather than those who took out the loan. This means new tenants or owners become liable for a debt they did not enter into, a novel concept in English law. Homeowners (or businesses) will be liable to repay the Green Deal charge, even if the promised saving on their energy bills does not materialize. The intention is that savings on energy bills will outweigh the cost of repayments. This is referred to by DECC as the golden rule. However, the so-called [...] "Golden Rule" [...] isn’t so much a rule as an aspiration. There are 45 different improvements covered by the Green Deal and Government estimates say that a typical three bedroom semi-detached house could save £270 a year from solid wall insulation. The loans became available on 28 January 2013.|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{household}} {{energy use}} generally focus {{on social and}} psychological factors influencing the acceptability of energy-saving measures. However, the influence of physical characteristics of energy-saving measures on their acceptability is largely ignored. In this study, preferences for different types of energy-saving measures were examined, by using an additive part-worth function conjoint analysis. Energy-saving measures differed {{in the domain of}} <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> (<b>measures</b> aimed at home <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> versus <b>measures</b> aimed at transport <b>energy</b> <b>savings),</b> energy-saving strategy (technical improvements, different use of products, and shifts in consumption), and the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> (small versus large <b>energy</b> <b>savings).</b> Energy-saving strategy appeared {{to be the most important}} characteristic influencing the acceptability of energy-saving measures. In general, technical improvements were preferred over behavioral measures and especially shifts in consumption. Further, home energy-saving measures were more acceptable than transport energy-saving measures. The amount of <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> was the least important characteristic: there was hardly any difference in the acceptability of measures with small and large <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> Except for respondents differing in environmental concern, there were no differences in average acceptability of the energy-saving measures between respondent groups. However, some interesting differences in relative preferences for different types of energy-saving measures were found between respondent groups. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Legislation {{targeting}} business {{carbon emissions}} typically excludes the {{significant portion of}} the economy comprised of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As an alternative many governments have developed voluntary programs to assist SMEs to reduce emissions and increase their energy efficiency. To maximise benefits associated with such programs, this paper seeks to provide insights into key factors contributing to the design of successful voluntary energy efficiency programs for SMEs. This is achieved by comprehensively analysing the factors that impacted the uptake of <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> <b>measures</b> by 202 SMEs which participated in the ClimateSmart Business Cluster Program (commencing in 2009). Expanding on previous research that has mostly focus on identifying inhibiting factors (barriers) to the uptake of <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> <b>measures,</b> this paper offers a comprehensive assessment of barriers and motivating factors (motivators). A unique finding of this research is that SMEs experienced many different barriers and motivators while participating in the program, inferring great complexity to achieving the critical aim of reducing carbon emissions. Based on these findings, this paper argues that voluntary government energy efficiency programs should be flexibly designed and implemented to accommodate the many and various barriers. Motivating factors should be emphasised and barriers identified upfront so that the program can be tailored to the often idiosyncratic needs of SMEs...|$|R
