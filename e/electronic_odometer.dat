5000|$|The {{dashboard}} {{of the bus}} is made in {{the form}} of semicircles, which provide the driver with quick access to all necessary controls. In the middle of the instrument panel is a block of exemplary devices. In the middle panel is a large round speedometer (German, VDO) with <b>electronic</b> <b>odometer.</b> Left and right of the speedometer are the gauges and indicator voltage on-board network. In some trolleybuses these devices are replaced by an electronic display.|$|E

Although the newer <b>electronic</b> <b>odometers</b> are difficult to roll back, they can still be defeated by disconnecting the odometer wires and reconnecting them later. However, as the Cents Per Mile Now website points out:As a practical matter, resetting odometers requires equipment plus expertise that makes stealing insurance risky and uneconomical. For example, to steal 20000 mi of continuous protection while paying for only the 2000 in the 35000 to 37000 range on the odometer, the resetting would have to be done at least nine times, to keep the odometer reading within the narrow 2000 mi covered range. There are also powerful legal deterrents to this way of stealing insurance protection. Odometers have always served as the measuring device for resale value, rental and leasing charges, warranty limits, mechanical breakdown insurance, and cents-per-mile tax deductions or reimbursements for business or government travel. Odometer tampering, detected during claim processing, voids the insurance and, under decades-old state and federal law, is punishable by heavy fines and jail.|$|R
