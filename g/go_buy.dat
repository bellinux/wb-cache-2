25|$|The 1981 festival {{village was}} {{designed}} around a central rotunda with a maypole, where spontaneously, poets, buskers and ravers alike featured. Nambassa vigorously promoted handcrafts, {{not only because}} of their therapeutic qualities, but because they had {{the potential to be a}} source of revenue to lifestyle proponents looking towards self-sufficiency and economic independence. From the festival village one could attend any number of craft workshops, pick up a copy of the daily Nambassa Waves newspaper, <b>go</b> <b>buy</b> fresh bread cooked in the wood-fired oven bakery constructed in a converted hay shed, go do some shopping, check out Radio Nambassaland, pick up some information from the mother centre, or just simply chill out and absorb the atmosphere.|$|E

On GameRankings, {{the game has}} an overall score of 81.92% based on reviews from 53critics. The staff of Official Xbox Magazine praised the developers for preserving the original gameplay, avoiding [...] "revisionist horrors" [...] and Star Wars rerelease moments.

500|$|In {{the opening}} lines, Kuti {{comments}} on his social reality: [...] "When we talk say confusion / Everything out of control". His lyrics decry what he {{viewed as the}} colonial mindset of some Africans and employ pidgin English, which was the lingua franca of most people in English-speaking West Africa; he sings the phrase [...] "pafuka", which means [...] "all over" [...] or [...] "finished", and the interjection [...] "o" [...] to add emphasis. Kuti makes reference to three dialects and currencies that make trading in urban Nigeria difficult: [...] "Dem be three men wey sell for roadside-o / Dem three speak different language-o / Dem speak Lagos, Accra, and Conakry / One white man come pay them money-o / He pay them for pounds, dollars and French money-o / For the thing wey he <b>go</b> <b>buy</b> from them / He remain for them to share am-o / Me I say, na confusion be that-o / He go say he pafuka o." [...] African Arts journalist E.J. Collins interpreted the latter verse as {{a reference to the}} protracted nature of transactions in Lagos.|$|E

500|$|Johnson was a devout, {{conservative}} Anglican and {{a compassionate}} man who supported {{a number of}} poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, [...] "no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him". However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as Donald Greene points out, [...] "a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings. Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the [...] "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own two cats, Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, [...] "I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself {{used to go out}} and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature." [...] It is a common error to think that these oysters were expensive, since they are so in modern Britain. However, in Johnson's time they were very cheap and eaten by the poor. [...] He thought that his servant, Frank, might resent Hodge if he had to <b>go</b> <b>buy</b> the oysters for him.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} young white {{men and women were}} {{drinking}} and partying {{in the small town of}} Puckett, in largely white Rankin County, Mississippi. According to a lawyer representing one (or more) of the perpetrators, they decided to <b>go</b> <b>buy</b> more beer in a location where stores were open later at night. According to law enforcement officials, Deryl Dedmon, an 18-year-old white man from the county seat of Brandon, led the group in planning to attack blacks in Jackson. They talked about collecting bottles to throw at people. Dedmon said to friends, [...] "Let's go fuck with some niggers." [...] The group split up between Dedmon's green 1998 Ford F-250 truck and a white Jeep Cherokee. They each drove [...] west on Interstate 20 to a predominantly black area on the western edge of Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|The book is {{not simply}} a cut and paste of the Lexicon website. The entries on the website provide much more {{detailed}} and complete information than the entries in the book. We took the information on the site and did a lot of editing, condensing, and in some cases complete rewriting.

2500|$|Declarations {{of present}} state of mind: Much like a present-sense {{impression}} describes the outside world, declarant's statement {{to the effect of}} [...] "I am angry!" [...] or [...] "I am Napoleon!" [...] will be admissible to prove that the declarant was indeed angry, or did indeed believe himself to be Napoleon at that time. Used in cases where the declarant's mental state is at issue. Present-state-of-mind statements are also used as circumstantial evidence of subsequent acts committed by the declarant, like his saying, [...] "I'm gonna <b>go</b> <b>buy</b> some groceries and get the oil changed in my car on my way home from work." [...] Another exception is statements made in the course of medical treatment, i.e., statements made by a patient to a medical professional to help in diagnosis and treatment. Any statements contained therein that attribute fault or causation to an individual will generally not be admissible under this exception.|$|E

60|$|In {{this strong}} box, also, was a canvas bag, {{jingling}} with rusty old bell-buttons, gangrened copper bolts, and sheathing nails; damp, greenish Carolus dollars (true coin all), besides divers iron screws, and battered, chisels, and belaying-pins. Sounded {{on the chest}} lid, the dollars rang clear as convent bells. These were put aside by Jarl the sight of substantial dollars doing away, for the nonce, with his superstitious Misgivings. True to his kingship, he loved true coin; though abroad on the sea, and no land but dollarless dominions ground, all this silver was worthless as charcoal or diamonds.
