40|$|The {{effect of}} raw and anaerobically <b>digested</b> sludge on heat {{inactivation}} of poliovirus was investigated. Raw sludge {{was found to}} be very protective of poliovirus plaque-forming ability at all temperatures studied, but <b>digested</b> sludge had variable effects that were highly dependent upon the experimental conditions. In low concentrations and at relatively low inactivation temperatures, <b>digested</b> sludge is nearly as protective of poliovirus as raw sludge. However, at higher tempeatures and concentrations, <b>digested</b> sludge caused a significant acceleration of poliovirus inactivation. The difference between the protective capability of raw and <b>digested</b> sludge is not due to loss of protective material, because this component is present in the solids of <b>digested</b> sludge as well as in those of raw sludge. Instead, the difference is due to a virucidal agent acquired during digestion. Addition of this agent to the solids of either raw or <b>digested</b> sludge reverses the protective potential of these solids during heat treatment of poliovirus...|$|R

5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a <b>digest.</b> Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular <b>digest</b> size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard <b>digest</b> format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine.

40|$|Predicting {{the flow}} behaviour, most notably, the {{apparent}} viscosity and yield stress of sludge mixtures inside the anaerobic digester is essential {{because it helps}} optimize the mixing system in digesters. This paper investigates the rheology of sludge mixtures {{as a function of}} <b>digested</b> sludge volume fraction. Sludge mixtures exhibited non-Newtonian, shear thinning, yield stress behaviour. The apparent viscosity and yield stress of sludge mixtures prepared at the same total solids concentration was influenced by the interactions within the <b>digested</b> sludge and increased with the volume fraction of <b>digested</b> sludge - highlighted using shear compliance and shear modulus of sludge mixtures. However, when a thickened primary - secondary sludge mixture was mixed with dilute <b>digested</b> sludge, the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased with increasing the volume fraction of <b>digested</b> sludge. This was caused by the dilution effect leading to a reduction in the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic interactions when dilute <b>digested</b> sludge was added. Correlations were developed to predict the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixtures {{as a function of the}} <b>digested</b> sludge volume fraction and total solids concentration of the mixtures. The parameters of correlations can be estimated using pH of sludge. The shear and complex modulus were also modelled and they followed an exponential relationship with increasing <b>digested</b> sludge volume fraction...|$|R

In this study, we <b>digested</b> fresh and oxidised cod liver oils in vitro, monitored the levels of lipid peroxidation products and evaluated oxidative, proteomic and inflammatory responses to {{the two types of}} <b>digests</b> in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. RESULTS <b>Digests</b> of cod liver oil with 22 – 53 [*]µmol[*]L− 1 malondialdehyde and 0. 26 – 3. 7 [*]µmol[*]L− 1 4 -hydroxy- 2 -hexenal increased intracellular oxidation and cell energy metabolic activity compared to a <b>digested</b> blank in yeast cells and the influence of <b>digests</b> on mitochondrial protein expression was more pronounced for oxidised cod liver oil than fresh cod liver oil. The four differentially expressed and identified proteins were related to energy metabolism and oxidative stress response. Maturation of dendritic cells was affected in the presence of <b>digested</b> fresh cod liver oil compared to the <b>digested</b> blank, measured as lower CD 86 expression. The ratio of secreted cytokines, IL- 12 p 40 /IL- 10, suggested a pro-inflammatory effect of the <b>digested</b> oils in relation to the blank (1. 47 – 1. 67 vs. 1. 07). CONCLUSION Gastro-intestinal digestion of cod liver oil increases the amount of oxidation products and resulting <b>digests</b> affect oxidation in yeast and immunomodulation of dendritic cells...|$|R

5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} <b>digest</b> it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths.

In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and <b>digest</b> food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to <b>digest</b> the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc.
