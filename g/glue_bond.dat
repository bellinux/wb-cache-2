40|$|Tenon joints {{are widely}} used in constructions of {{skeletal}} furniture and numerous laboratory experiments were conducted {{with the aim of}} determining the rigidity and strength of such joints. In industrial practice, the sloppily applied glue often covers only flat, rectangular planes of the tenon. In this situation, it can be intuitively predicted that such joints are characterised by low strength but the precise assessment of this difference, requires carrying out appropriate experiments and numerical calculations. Therefore, the aim of the performed investigations was: to define the strength of a tenon joint in the construction of a chair with a connecting piece, to determine the distribution of shear and normal stresses in the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> and to ascertain the infl uence of the glueline on this strength. The finite element mesh for the tenon joint was developed by using orthotropic, 20 -node block elements, whereas the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> was modelled using isotropic elements 0. 1 mm thick. The performed investigations showed that the shape of the glueline exerts a strong influence on the strength of the tenon joint. The pressure of the tenon on the mortise via the layer of the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> changes the form of deformations. Non-dilatational deformations, which generate shear stresses of values exceeding the ultimate strength, develop in rectangular bonds, whereas in superellipse bonds non-dilatational deformations clearly restrict the pressure of the tenon on the mortise and, by doing so, decrease considerably the level of dangerous shear stresses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: New {{technologies}} for wood building construction continue to employ various profile-adhesive joints, with {{mortise and tenon}} joints being the most popular. Their strength depends both on the wood species and type of the applied glue, {{as well as the}} execution accuracy of individual elements. The aim of the performed experiments was to determine the size of normal stresses in places of mutual pressures of the tenon and mortise and the impact of the change of wood species and the type of glue (or lack of glue) applied to the joint on the value of those stresses. It was established, on the basis of numerical calculations, that the phenomena of the tenon and mortise contact are caused both by the bending of the tenon {{as well as by the}} torsion of the <b>glue</b> <b>bond.</b> Stresses in the direction perpendicular to the fibre course generating pressures exceeding wood compression strength turned out to be the most dangerous for the tenon and mortise joint.

40|$|Fast growing sengon (Paraserianthes moluccana) {{is largely}} rotary-cut to produce veneer for core plywood production. In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 In plywood manufacture, the {{interaction}} of wood with resin during hot pressing {{is responsible for the}} development of <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> strength and hence panel quality. In this study, temperature and vapor pressure distributions and compaction of laminates were measured during pressing. Analysis of these factors emphasized boards formed under conventional (standard) conditions. However, some laminates were also studied with modified veneer moisture contents and platen pressures. By analysing data generated from laminates during pressing in the laboratory, the nature of interdepencence between heat transfer, vapor pressure accumulation and board compaction and how they are affected by veneer moisture content and platen pressure were considered. Complementary to the above work, the rate of strength development of phenol-formaldehyde resin forming a bond between wood wafers was determined. Bonds were formed under a range of steady-state temperatures and immediately tested in shear mode. Curves of bond strength versus pressing time were derived for each of the eight temperatures used. The relationship between rate of bond strength development, temperature and pressing time was quantified. At elevated temperatures very rapid resin curing was observed compared to that at lower temperatures. Open assembly time, resin pot life and wood wafer characteristics did not have a significant effects on the rate of curing of the resin under the range of conditions used in this project. The data generated from both experiments were combined to derive a model for predicting <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> strength development at various locations in the laminate during hot pressing. The principle for the construction of the model is described as well as factors which should be accounted for in future refinements. Quantitive analysis of {{the interaction}} of these variables will aid in optimising the manufacture of plywood.

40|$|In a {{previous}} research project, carried {{out during the}} years 2006 - 2008, the possibility to manufacture wet glued laminated beams using ungraded laminations of Norway spruce side boards was investigated with very promising results. In the project presented in this report, {{the performance of the}} wet glued beams has been further investigated and developed as regards grading of side board laminations, bond line properties and lamination finger jointing. The possibility to use scanning equipment for measurement of fibre angles and prediction of strength and stiffness of boards and beams has been studied and the procedures for technical approval and CE marking have been probed into. Studies concerning market and economy for the beams and layouts for a pilot plant and a full capacity plant, respectively, for production of such beams have also been carried out. The possibility to grade side boards in the wet state using axial dynamic excitation was investigated with a positive result. From such excitation, a board’s stiffness (modulus of elasticity) could be determined. Accordingly, grading criteria regarding axial stiffness, and knot size, was applied to grade side board laminations into two classes; outer and inner laminations. Strength and stiffness tests of beams manufactured from such graded laminations showed that the beams actually could challenge first rate glulam and LVL products available on the market. Regarding beam shape and shape stability, cross section cupping may need further attention. Even if this deformation was small, it was still visible to the naked eye. The problem could probably be overcome if the beams are dried to a moisture content of 12 - 14 % before planing. Results of shear tests show that green <b>glued</b> <b>bond</b> lines can fulfil strength requirements for glulam. However, delamination requirements for service class 3 (outdoors) were not fully met. From small scale tensile testing of <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> it was concluded that green <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> with high density wood have the same tensile strength and fracture energy as dry <b>glued</b> <b>bonds.</b> For bonds with low density wood and/or small amount of adhesive, the tensile strength could be lower than for dry <b>glued</b> <b>bonds,</b> whereas the fracture energy was on a similar level. Strength testing of wet and dry glued finger joints demonstrated that joints glued from high density wood was significantly stronger than low density joints {{and that there was no}} significant difference between the strength of green glued joints and joints glued after drying. From X-ray measurement it was shown that the glue penetration into the wood fibres is much deeper in a green glued joint than in a joint that is glued in the dried state. From scanning algorithms developed within the scope of this project it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of grain-angle distributions on board surfaces as well as rather accurate descriptions of knot locations and of fibre-angle disturbances around knots. From scanning of board ends, cross section characteristics with respect to radial and tangential directions and of annual ring widths could also be determined. Finally, both board and beam stiffness were predicted from this data, with an accuracy that is comparable with the one obtained from well-reputed commercial grading systems...|$|R

The bomboo culm were cut into strips and treated with those selected chemicals. The bamboo strips were then glued {{edge to edge}} to form a bamboo veneers before fabrication of the three ply perpendicular bamboo laminates. In this research the properties studied include wettability, buffering capacity, shear strength and wood failure. Untreated strips and bamboo strips which were boiled in water (100 °C) were also tested for comparison purposes. Those strips treated with LOSP had higher contact angle (3 °- 9 °) which reflects that {{the surface of the}} treated strips is less readily wetted. Whereas, borax-treated strips had the highest wetting rate where the value is 1 °. In buffering capacity study shows that treated bamboo was more stable towards alkali. This is suggested that a buffering agent (Calcium carbonate) is required in the adhesive formulation to ensure sufficient curing of the resin. Preservative treatments on bamboo strips significantly affect shear strength and wood failure of the laminates. Shear and wood failure of the laminated bamboo were significantly reduced especially in the wet condition where, the range is 0 N mm - 2 (WBP treated) to 0. 65 N mm - 2 (boiled-treated) when compared to untreated bamboo laminates (0. 79 N mm - 2).

However, after water soaking of the specimens, the failure happens at the interface between the fiber and the adhesive. Li studied the tensile properties of bamboo using the digital speckle correlation method (DSCM), and discovered that the mechanical properties of bamboo were lower than that of bamboo fibers because of the slips between the fibers [14]. In two previous papers [6, 15], the tensile properties of four types of individual natural fibers (bamboo, kenaf, Chinese fir and ramie) isolated by different methods were measured by a custom-designed micro-tensile tester. It was found from the load–displacement curves during the tension testing that most single fibers presented linear until failure.|$|E

Its purpose was to not only to initiate a protocol for manufacture but to also determine the properties of the panel, establishing any advantageous aspects and highlighting any shortcomings and deficiencies when assessed against current Australian standard specifications. It is our intention that this exploratory study will form the groundwork to allow us to determine which areas need further research to be able to manufacture a panel that could complement the current products available to the construction and furniture manufacturing industries. The manufacturing process and resulting panels highlighted the following: 1. Most of the properties of the panel were below standard specifications. This result could be directly attributed to the technical characteristics of the equipment used for the resination process. It is believed that the loss of both resin and fibre during this step resulted in a lower than expected outcomes for panel density, <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> quality, MoE and MoR. Addressing this issue will give tighter control of the amount of resin applied with minimal fibre loss and better determination of the mechanical properties of the panel. 2. Fibre pre-treatment as required when using current formaldehyde based adhesives is not necessary with an eMDI adhesive. This adhesive doesn’t have the major inconvenient to release toxic emission of formaldehyde. 3. The waxy nature of sorghum results in a panel that meets Australian standard requirements for fibre swelling with minimal fibre processing.

The bleaching was carried out by cold soaking. The colour changes (ΔE) and whitish value (W) of the strips before and after bleaching process were examined using colour meter and Munsel soil colour chart. The unbleached and bleached strips were glued parallel to each other using phenol formaldehyde adhesive to produce three-ply laminates. The gluing properties were evaluated based on their shear strength and wood failure percentage. The tests were carried out in dry and cyclic boiling conditions (CBR) in accordance with BS 6566 : Part 8 : 1986. Regardless of species, strips that were soaked in NaOH followed by in H 2 O 2 solution had better colour properties than soaking in NaOH + ((COOH) 2. 2 H 2 O).

30|$|The {{optical and}} {{electrical}} {{measurements of the}} transferred LEDs have revealed that the electrical degradation in thin-film LEDs can be avoided by utilizing the wafer bonding process proposed here. This considerable improvement should be mainly attributed to the effective suppression of residual stress at bonding interface using the low temperature and pressure-free <b>glue</b> <b>bonding.</b> It {{is well known that}} the LED epilayers and bonding metal always have a high thermal mismatch because of their difference in thermal expansion coefficient. As a result, the high temperature and pressure procedures during mental bonding would lead to a large residual stress at the bonding interface. After the sapphire removal, the thin LED epilayers are very brittle and favorable to generation of defects, thereby, increasing reverse leakage current. Moreover, the thickness of p-GaN cladding top layer is considerably thin, only about 0.4 [*]μm. The requisite treatment for mental bonding would result in damage to the MQWs active region and the consequent electrical deterioration. Therefore, the <b>glue</b> <b>bonding</b> with low temperature and pressure-free processes is highly beneficial to avoid these negative influences. In addition, the relative lower temperature and pressure during Sn fusion bonding, the thick n-GaN and u-GaN layers, and the bottom mental reflector could effectively prevent damage of the MQWs active region during the second wafer bonding after LLO, which also play important roles in eliminating the electrical degradation of thin-film LEDs.|$|R

The present study evaluates green <b>glued</b> adhesive <b>bonds</b> in flatwise <b>glued</b> beams and finger joints. The main part of this work deals with green gluing using a moisture curing polyurethane adhesive (PUR). Standardised test methods and specially designed, small scale, specimens were used for the determination of the strength, fracture energy and the ductility of both dry- and green <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> in tension and in shear. Using the small scale specimens it was possible to capture the complete stress versus deformation curves, including also their unloading part. An optical system for deformation measurement was used for the analysis of bond behaviour. The influence of moisture content during curing and temperature after curing on the adhesive chemical composition and on the mechanical properties was investigated. Furthermore, the moisture transport through the adhesive bond during curing was tested. Finally, microscopy studies were performed for analysis of bond morphology and fracture. The results show that two significant factors influence the shear strength of green glued bonds: wood density and adhesive spread rate. Bonds which fulfil the requirements according to EN  386 could be obtained within a wide range of process parameters. The small specimen tests showed that green <b>glued</b> PUR <b>bonds</b> can reach the same strength and fracture energy, both in shear and in tension, as dry <b>glued</b> <b>bonds</b> with the same adhesive amount. The local material properties of the bonds could be determined, thanks to the failure in the tests taking place within the adhesive bond itself and not in the wood. Following process factors were shown to cause lower bond strength: a) a low adhesive spread rate, b) high pressure and c) short pressing time in combination with low wood density and high moisture content.

The {{final moisture content}} profiles and quality of two dried veneer thicknesses A and B (3 and 1. 5 mm in thickness respectively) are determined. Veneer gluability of the two veneer thicknesses, dried by two different methods, are examined. The dimensional stability of veneer and plywood samples made from these dried veneers are also examined. Green {{weight per unit area}} was used as an indicator of moisture content during drying. A wide variation in final moisture content of dried veneer was found to be due to the presence of earlywood and latewood in veneer sample A and juvenile wood in veneer sample B. Green veneer sorting, based on water content per area or volume, green weight per area and percent saturation, can be used to improve drying performance. Statistical analysis indicates that the final veneer moisture content profiles estimated from green weight per unit area for two dried veneer thicknesses A and B dried by microwave, are not significantly different from those under conventional drying. However, the result indicates that microwave drying resulted in a higher degree of moisture content uniformity for both veneer thicknesses, whereas excessive drying occurred on the outer sections for both veneer thicknesses under conventional drying. A dark color was found in the dried veneer of both thicknesses under microwave drying compared to those of conventionally dried veneers. Statistically, both drying methods resulted in similar veneer quality, except microwave drying resulted in better veneer quality with respect to flatness, and has a low flatness ratio. Microwave dried veneer also had low percent shrinkage for both veneer thicknesses compared to conventionally dried veneer samples. Veneer gluability for veneer A is better than for veneer B, higher in the percentage of wood failures and greater glueline shear strength. Microwave drying resulted in better veneer gluability. Although microwave-dried plywood samples had a higher percentage of water absorption for both veneer thicknesses compared to conventional samples, they had lower percentage thickness swelling. In addition, the percent failure did not represent the <b>glue</b> <b>bond</b> quality of plywood samples. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary This project, {{titled the}} {{potential}} to recover higher value veneer products from fibre managed plantation eucalypts and broaden market opportunities for this resource, has two parts: • Part A investigates the genetics and wood quality of obtained from E. nitens and E. globulus grown in Tasmania and the genetic parameters that affect quality of rotarypeeled veneer, plywood and LVL. • Part B investigates marketing rotary-peeled veneer recovered from native pulp woodin Tasmania. It looks at {{the potential to}} develop niche markets for the resultant products. The objectives of this Part A {{of the study were}} to: 1. Provide baseline data on veneer quality and plywood properties of fibre-managed plantation E. nitens grown in Tasmania. 2. Identify the genetic parameters that affect quality of rotary-peeled veneer and plywood to guide selection of families for future breeding programs and to examine the compatibility of breeding for potentially conflicting objectives. 3. Assess the effectiveness of an acoustic sorting strategy and potential gain from segregation of logs for veneer and plywood production The key outcomes, industry benefits and indication to future work included: 1. This project presents Australia’s first large scale peeling trial for plantation E. nitensproviding significant baseline data on plywood properties and veneer quality and the genetic parameters that underpin them. Results will help guide future breeding programs and direct research towards key processing parameters most likely to improve veneer quality and recovery and therefore commercial opportunities for peeled products from this resource. 2. <b>Glue</b> <b>bond</b> tests (for exterior use) were generally promising. Further work is required to improve and understand bond quality issues in younger (16 yr) E. nitens resource. 3. Shear properties were poor for all resources tested at UTAS and EWPAA facilities,limiting F-Grade classification to F 8 and below. Assuming shear strength could be increased beyond the observed limiting levels through process optimisation the resources tested would classify with F-Grades of F 34 (E. glob), F 17 (E. ni 26), F 17 (TasOak / E. ni 16), F 17 (TasOak / P. rad) and F 11 (E. ni 16). 4. Significant gains in veneer quality (and resultant product properties) may be achieved through appropriate drying of the plantation veneer. 5. Log steaming prior to peeling also needs to be evaluated to establish veneer quality (and end product) implications. 6. Plywood panels with optimised veneer sheet layup increased resultant panel stiffness by 18...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Present {{methods of}} {{determining}} proper glueline cure are inadequate in either production or laboratory situations {{because they are}} time consuming and "after the fact". Monitoring the glueline while the wood composite {{is still in the}} press would provide many advantages over existing methods. Such a system would provide greater control over the degree of cure, helping eliminate variable quality in the <b>glue</b> <b>bond.</b> Dielectric spectroscopy has been proposed as a method capable of continuously monitoring adhesive cure and a specific machine, the Audrey II dielectrometer, has been advertised as being capable of detecting cure of resin systems common to the forest products industry. The objectives of this research were to determine if the Audrey II dielectrometer could measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic plywood adhesive and a resorcinol-formaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines under conditions analogous to mill production. The dielectric spectrometer used in this study produced frequencies of 100 - 1000 Hz and measured voltage, capacitance, phase angle, and dissipation of the glued assembly placed between its electrodes. Capacitance was found to be the property that was most sensitive to changes in the wood-adhesive composite during the cure process. The dielectric spectrometer was able to accurately and consistently measure the capacitance of oven dried wood. Dielectric measurements were very sensitive to the presence of water, and the increase in capacitance with an increase in moisture content was reproducible. Problems were encountered when using the dielectric spectrometer to monitor cure of a resin in wood composites. The lack of repeatability in capacitance measurements led {{to the conclusion that the}} Audrey II dielectric spectrometer could not measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic adhesive or a resorcinolformaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines. Components of a phenol-formaldehyde resin were examined to determine what caused the lack of reproducibility. The capacitance was reproducible with either water or aqueous caustic on the veneers. However, the presence of either phenol or formalin on the veneers resulted in a total lack of repeatability in capacitance. Both phenol and formalin are excellent swelling agents for wood and as wood swells, its microstructure is opened and plasticized. This would increase the capacitance. Other factors that would influence variation in swelling and capacitance would include depth of lathe checks, wood damage, porosity, density, and natural anatomical variation that influences the rate of penetration of chemicals into wood. Even considering the swelling effects and natural variation of wood, the variability in capacitance of the wood-adhesive composite is not readily understood...|$|E
50|$|The wooden {{wings of}} Ansons flying in Australia {{were found to}} fail at a high rate. The {{phenolic}} <b>glue</b> <b>bonds</b> would part, and it was speculated that the problem {{was due to the}} high humidity. In 1962, the Commonwealth Government decided to ground the majority of wooden-winged aircraft then in operation; amongst those aircraft affected, the Anson and De Havilland Mosquito were included. Of the Ansons, no such aircraft were re-registered as the government had mandated a test that essentially destroyed the wings, thus requiring the fitting of new wings. Most owners decided to voluntarily scrap their aircraft well before this time.|$|R
5000|$|Geofoam shares {{principles}} with geocombs (previously called ultralight cellular structures) {{which has}} been defined as [...] "any manufactured material created by an extrusion process that results in a final product that consists of numerous open-ended tubes that are <b>glued,</b> <b>bonded,</b> fused or otherwise bundled together." [...] The cross-sectional geometry of an individual tube typically has a simple geometric shape (circle, ellipse, hexagon, octagon, etc.) and is on the order of 25 mm across. The overall cross-section of the assemblage of bundled tubes resembles a honeycomb that gives it its name. Presently, only rigid polymers (polypropylene and PVC) have been used as geocomb material.|$|R
