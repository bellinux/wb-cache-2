I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E

[...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then I think maybe I should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on the incident, while also adding that since August 2016, PewDiePie has included anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery in nine separate videos. The publication reported he removed three of the videos, including the January 2017 Fiverr one. In a 12 February Tumblr post, PewDiePie expressed: [...] "I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes, [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary," [...] and conceded, [...] "though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive." [...] In his post, he also reiterated he does not support anti-Semitic groups. PewDiePie's motivation for his Tumblr post was partially driven {{by the fact that}} neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups and publications, such as The Daily Stormer, were referencing and praising PewDiePie for his jokes.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks to be you right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I {{think it would be a}} lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E

2500|$|Synthesizers also figured {{prominently}} on the 1984 follow-up, Das Buch, which courted {{trouble with}} the censors on the song [...] "Ich will nicht vergessen" [...] (I Don't Want To Forget), and its references to [...] "Deutschland," [...] a taboo in the GDR, which the band explained as a reference to Heinrich Heine, although the more immediate referent was divided Germany (Denk' ich an die Leute, drüben und hier, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people over there and here). The title track, essentially a monologue set to music about a book on another planet describing a post-nuclear-war Earth, featured a Free German Youth choir.

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} were {{composed}} over several years, both {{in the studio and}} on the road. Parker saved ideas using a voice recorder on his phone, and wrote many songs on a drum machine. Guitars are present in every song on Currents, but are used to accompany and answer other instruments. This was partially due to his gear being inaccessible: [...] "We'd finish one tour in say, Europe, go home for two weeks, and all our gear, including my guitars and pedals, would be on their way to South America." [...] He had a larger array of synthesizers at his home studio, which allowed them to become the prominent instrument. He said, [...] "It's really just whatever is sitting around when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song." [...] The album incorporates Parker's falsetto, as well as a vocoder.|$|E

2500|$|Shostakovich's {{plan was}} for a single-movement symphony, {{including}} a chorus and a requiem-like passage for a vocal soloist, with a text taken from the Psalms of David. With {{the help of his}} best friend, critic Ivan Sollertinsky, who was knowledgeable about the Bible, he selected excerpts from the Ninth Psalm. The idea of individual suffering became interwoven in Shostakovich's mind with the Lord God's vengeance for the taking of innocent blood (Verse 12, New King James Version). The theme not only conveyed his outrage over Stalin's oppression, but also may have inspired him to write the Seventh Symphony in the first place. [...] "I began writing it having been deeply moved by the Psalms of David; the symphony deals with more than that, but the Psalms were the impetus," [...] the composer said. [...] "David has some marvelous words on blood, that God takes revenge for blood, He doesn't forget the cries of victims, and so on.

On October 3, 2013, he released another second trailer for the mixtape, also revealing 1,000 hard copies of the mixtape would be sold for $100 each. He explained his decision to RapRadar saying, [...] "It’s 2013. Whether we accept it or not, buying music is a choice, not a requisite. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychology behind what makes me purchase an artists album, it’s always a form of reciprocation. Almost like a token of appreciation after I experience the product. The reason I chose to charge $100 dollars each copy and only start with 1000 units is because I tailor making my music {{for those who are}} listening. it's not about stepping outside of what I’m known for in hopes of new discovery. What that means less is fans that are better served. I'm more or less focused on fully serving the ones that have connected all ready. That being said its a value over volume thing. if I'm goin to offer a product made with no compromise or concession to the platforms (radio, A opinion, label bias) ect...ect..then the way we sale it has to change." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect.
