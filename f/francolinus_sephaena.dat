40|$|Ticks were {{collected}} at approximately bi-monthly intervals between June 1996 and June 1997 from crested francolins, <b>Francolinus</b> <b>sephaena,</b> {{and from the}} vegetation on a mixed cattle and wildlife farm in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The birds were infested with the immature stages of 13 tick species, of which Amblyomma hebraeum, Amblyomma marmoreum and Hyalomma marginatumrufipes were the most numerous and prevalent. Ten ixodid tick species {{were collected}} from the vegetation, of which the immature stages of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi were the most numerous. No adult ticks were collected from the birds and only two from the vegetation. The restricted home range of crested francolins implies that they {{could serve as a}} source of tick infestation only for other animals within the same habitat as the birds. </span...|$|E
40|$|Birds are {{hosts of}} the {{immature}} stages of several ixodid tick species (Theiler 1962) and consequent-ly {{could serve as}} a source of subsequent adult tick infestation for other hosts. This is particularly so for migrating birds (Hoogstraal, Kaiser, Traylor, Gaber & Guindy 1961), or species such as helmeted guinea-fowls, Numida meleagris, that on occasion can har-bour large numbers of immature ticks (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak, Spickett, Braack & Williams 1991). Two species of guineafowls and several spe-cies of francolins occur in South Africa and of these the ixodid tick burdens of helmeted guineafowls, Cape francolins, Francolinus capensis, and grey-wing francolins, Francolinus africanus, have been determined (Horak & Williams 1986; Horak et al. 1991; Horak & Boomker 1998). Similar data for crested francolins, <b>Francolinus</b> <b>sephaena,</b> or crest-ed guineafowls, Guttera pucherani, both of which occur in the northern and north-eastern regions of South Africa, have not been collected. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether crested francolins, which prefer thick cover and matted vegetation, play the same role as hel-meted guineafowls, which prefer thorny scrub and savanna veld, as hosts for the immature stages of ticks of veterinary importance.

40|$|The {{avifauna}} of lowland Ethiopia {{consisting of}} grassland and bushland was investigated {{during the dry}} season from November 1981 to February 1982 in Omo National Park. One hundred and thirty-eight species of 48 families were observed in the whole area of the Park. One hundred and seven of these species were observed in the bushland around a small river and 45 species in the grassland and a small swamp. In the bushland area, dominant species were Turtur chalcospilos, Lamprotornis purpuropterus, Pycnonotus barbatus, Streptoperia decipiens, S. capicola, Tockus jacksoni, Corythaixoides leucogaster, Dicrurus adsimilis, and <b>Francolinus</b> <b>sephaena.</b> In the vicinity of the river, Burhinus senegalensis, Butorides striatus, Megaceryle maxima and Ceryle rudis were commonly found. In the grassland area, Struthio camelus, Ardeotis kori, some species of Bustards, Oenanthe sp. and Cisticola sp. were commonly found. At the swamp in the grassland, Hoplopterus spinosus and Himantopus himantopus dominated. Comparing the savanna bushland with the grassland, the number of species and the density of birds in the former were three to five times and about thirty times respectively as many as those in the latter. In the savanna bushland, frugivores (19. 5 % of total number of species) accounted for 43. 4 % of total observed individuals and graminivores were next. In the grassland, number and density of species of insectivores were considerably higher than species with other food habits...|$|E
