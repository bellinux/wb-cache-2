50|$|Customers {{with lower}} water demand may draw {{insignificant}} amounts without becoming a formal member. In cases of water shortage {{they have to}} renounce the supply {{for the benefit of}} the regular members. The need of service water varies very much - for example annually for a public pool 500 m³/year up to 15 Mio. m³/year for a thermal power station. All together the withdrawal is on the average 60 Mio. m³/year (with downward drift). The technically possible maximum of 400 Mio. m³/year has never been used. The discharge of canal water via the Stever into Halterner Stausee and Talsperre Hullern depends on the annual rainfall, for example the discharge in 1976 was 11.5 Mio. m³ but in “wet years” nothing is discharged.The withdrawal of service water that is used and has to be treated separately and discharged as waste water is invoiced with 0,0353 €/m³ (waste water is invoiced separately by the operator of the wastewater treatment facility). For water that has been removed, warmed-up and discharged again into the canal the <b>invoice</b> <b>value</b> is 3.3% of that amount. The fees cover the costs that appear from operation and maintenance of the pumping stations and other costs related to the water services.|$|E

50|$|Whereas the {{difference}} between the <b>invoice</b> face <b>value</b> and the advance serves as a reserve for a specific invoice, many factors also hold an ongoing reserve account which serves to further reduce the risk for the factoring company. This reserve account is typically 10-15% of the seller's credit line, but not all factoring companies hold reserve accounts.|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{methodology}} of supply chain optimisation {{is a fairly}} new concept {{in the field of}} logistics management and is also referred to as value chain optimisation. This short dissertation explores and describes the effects of a national improvement in supply chain processes on the sales and profitability of RS Components SA. The study contains discussions from various theoretical disciplines and includes topics such as customer service, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, logistics management and supply chain methodology. The link between the performance of the logistics processes and perceived customer service levels is also discussed in detail. Finally the study will show how improved logistical performance can lead to improved levels of customer satisfaction, which in turn leads to customer loyalty and increased profitability. In order to improve the organisation's national supply chain, RS Components SA decided to open a new Trade Counter in the Cape Town sales region. Before the opening of this Trade Counter however, improvements were made to the national logistical network to ensure seamless integration of the new sales branch as a fully operational warehouse. Various financial indicators were measured for the year after the opening of the new Trade Counter in Cape Town, in order to compare such figures to the year prior to the opening of said Trade Counter. The primary results were as follows: Sales for the Cape Town sales region have increased by a greater margin than originally budgeted for. The sales growth target was exceeded by 30. 21 %. The number of invoices generated for the year after the opening of the Trade Counter in Cape Town has increased steadily while the average <b>invoice</b> <b>value</b> has shown no mentionable growth. This indicates that the Trade Counter in Cape Town has spurned a greater percentage of repeat purchases and that sales have not merely increased due to bigger sales orders. Growth in the number of individual purchasing customers for the Cape Town region also reached a staggering growth of 71. 71 % compared to the growth target of 45 %. Substantial growth was also achieved throughout the year for the number of Trade Counter visits to the Cape Town Trade Counter. Whilst staggering growth rates were achieved in all of the above-mentioned categories, overhead expenses came in lower than was originally budgeted for the Cape Town sales region. A saving of 3. 65 % was achieved against a sales growth of 75. 21 %. In conclusion, this study indicated an increase in sales and profitability in the Cape Town sales region. Based on the success achieved through supply chain optimisation, both in terms of increased revenue as well as perceived levels of customer satisfaction, a recommendation is made for further expansion of the supply chain network of RS Components SA through the opening of a new Trade Counter in Durban...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} sector in Spain is {{a branch of}} economic activity which is already of great importanceaccording to its own <b>invoicing,</b> <b>value</b> added and occupation figures, in addition to its indirect economic effects. It has an additional strategic value for economic policy, since it constitutes a fundamental part ofthe cost of placing products on increasing markets in a competitive manner. The mobility and trans-portation of passengers in cities in turn plays an essential role in the economic and social activity. All of these reasons, in addition to the recent significant problems of ustainability which this priority sector is currently confronting in all aspects, justify an interest in a study which attempts to obtaina profile of this public service by using a strategic analysis through the application of the traditional Porter Five Forces Model. The application of this model will allow us to obtain a general strategic vision which, when combined with a maturity analysis, ill provide a more in-depth knowledge of the object under study, that will serve as a basis for subsequent analyses of the collective urban public transport service...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years, new {{financing}} opportunities (known as “Supply Chain Finance” or SCF) arose, exploiting {{the strength of}} new ICTs and supply chain links to optimise the working capital and create value for the organisations involved. One of the solutions within the SCF landscape, called Dynamic Discounting (DD), utilises trade process visibility granted by an ICT platform to allow the dynamic settlement of invoices in a buyer-supplier relation: for every day of payment in advance {{with respect to a}} pre- defined baseline, the supplier grants to the buyer a discount on the <b>invoice</b> nominal <b>value.</b> DD is a supply management tool for which a cash-rich anchor buyer can let suppliers (especially SMEs) fast-access cash, while gaining a relatively high rate of return. This paper aims to estimate, through the development of an analytical model, the potential benefit sof using a DD model in a buyer-supplier relation. After a brief review of relevant literature, the paper presents amodel that compares, for the supplier, the cost of granting a discount to the buyer with the benefit of an early payment, whereas for the buyer, the benefit of receiving a discount with the financial cost of an early settlement. This paper fills the gap in literature related to the definition of the processes underlying the adoption of DD, and more broadly the need for models to assess the benefits of the most innovative SCF schemas...|$|R
40|$|D. Com. (Accounting) The income {{potential}} and operational {{advantages of a}} broad-based sales tax justify the reliance there upon to produce a material part of the tax revenue of {{a country with a}} large third-world element in its economy. Since the introduction of sales tax in 1978 it has developed from a relatively inferior tax into an important element of the South African tax structure presently yielding in excess of 25 % of total tax revenue. The relevant statute, namely the Sales Tax Act 103 of 1978, has subsequently been amended to ensure certain structural and operational changes to the sales tax system and the rate has been increased from 4 % to 12 %. The question may therefore well be asked whether the present sales tax system upholds the criteria for an acceptable tax system, namely equity and efficiency, and still meets with the demands of the advancement that has taken place in the south African economy. This issue is fuelled by the common concern expressed about the apparent unacceptable levels of sales tax avoidance and evasion. In order to answer this question a framework for a sales tax system that would ideally suit the economic structure and social conditions of South Africa was devised. This framework shortly requires the sales tax system to be fair, simple, certain and neutral. The existing sales tax system was tested against this framework and apart from certain breaches, such as the taxation of capital and certain intermediate goods and the insufficient official divulgence of information, it was found to be generally efficient. Furthermore, {{due to the fact that}} the consumption of exempt foodstuffs decline much faster, as a proportion of income, than the consumption of taxed goods and services as income increases, the sales tax burden was found to be distributed proportionally over the income range. The recent widespread adoption of value added taxes has lead the study to examine and evaluate the additive-, subtractive- and <b>invoice</b> methods of <b>value</b> added taxation [...] ...|$|R
