The act led to further related {{developments}} {{in the creation of}} the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, [...] "you did it... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking." [...] He has also taken legality into the situation. Biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that, [...] "No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> yes at first and you changed your mind. No means no." ...|$|E

Before 2013, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> the NSA was making records of everybody's phonecalls and the GCHQ was {{monitoring}} lawyers and journalists, people raised eyebrows and called you a conspiracy theorist. Those days are over." ...|$|E

However, Virgin cancelled the challenge early because they didn't {{like some of the}} images being created, including Richard Branson urinating on Rob Manuel, dressed in baby clothes.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2014, August was videotaped {{beating a}} man, and he posted the video on his {{personal}} Instagram account. Although he deleted the video from his profile, the video was later posted to YouTube, and shared by thousands. In the video, a shirtless August walks over {{to a man who}} is kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned. After the incident had spread, he went to his Twitter account to shed light on the situation, explaining: [...] "I'm just a lil one out here on my own, no mom because she stay taking from me & no father because he wasn't around until all this happened. You guys would only know half of my story, only what's on screen & definitely not behind scenes. But sorry for my misbehavior guys I reacted so fast because the fact I gave him a past [...] many times and every single time there was excuses. Sometimes it sucks waiting on somebody else time to get what they promised you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> a specific day & time for my money than I want my stuff." ...|$|E

On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> the patient might live a year and he died in a week the family said you did not know your business. They thought of all the affection they would have lavished on the defunct if they had known the end was so near. Dr. Wigram made the gesture of washing his hands.|$|E
