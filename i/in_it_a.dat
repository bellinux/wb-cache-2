5|$|Though not {{the first}} of its kind, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six started a popular trend of {{tactical}} first-person shooters in 1998. It featured a team-based, realistic design and themes based around counter-terrorism, requiring missions to be planned before execution and <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> single hit was sometimes enough to kill a character. Medal of Honor, released in 1999, started a long running proliferation of first-person shooters set during World War II.|$|E

5|$|After much {{negotiating}} and brinkmanship on {{both sides}} Everton vacated Anfield, leaving Houlding with an empty stadium and no one to play <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, Houlding formed his own football club, Liverpool, {{to take up residence}} at the stadium.|$|R
5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} that Charlie {{has not been}} taking her medication, Serena and Vanessa reluctantly team up to find her. Chuck, Nate, Vanessa, and Serena soon encircle Dan, exclaiming that they need something from him. Chuck asks him where Blair is while Serena and Vanessa ask for Charlie's whereabouts. One of Blair's old friends reveals that Blair left the party. While accompanying Chuck to their apartment to look for Blair, Nate confesses that he told Raina (Tika Sumpter) everything behind her mother's death. Chuck reprimands Nate until Raina interrupts them to apologize. Blair is held hostage by Russell in Chuck's hotel. Pretending to escape, she calls Chuck on her phone, revealing her location. Russell explains his reason for kidnapping Blair: to burn down the hotel with her <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> drunk Charlie is seen dancing wildly until Dan confronts her, but she escapes. Serena greets Headmistress Queller (Jan Maxwell), who expresses her concern with Serena's choice of staying in New York City, having hoped that Serena would find her place outside of the Upper East Side. Georgina offers her aid in their scheme but Dan, Vanessa, and Serena reject her help, going their separate ways to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Emir Sanjar al-Jawli {{acquired}} the governorship of Gaza and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed {{it into a}} flourishing city, having built <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges of Gaza, such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|Member states remain optimistic of {{the union}} and key {{partners}} in the region, namely China, Iran, Turkey remain interested <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|Since Nintendo did {{not have}} many products, it made only a few {{commercials}} a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US $5 million, easily {{four or five times}} more than most companies spent. One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received {{a great deal of attention}} in the ad industry. <b>In</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.|$|E

Venus claims her own beauty has faded through tending her ailing son, and she needs this remedy in order to attend the theatre of the gods (theatrum deorum).|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the name are {{controversial}} and are attributed by some authors to ancient Celtic tribes. According to a local legend, King Afonso I (Afonso Henriques) exclaimed to incite his troops storming the stronghold: Coragem! Já estamos com o pé nela! (Courage! We have already set a foot <b>in</b> <b>it!).</b> <b>A</b> more plausible hypothesis is, however, that penela is a diminutive of penha, a place selected to build a fortress on.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} proposed is {{that some}} imprinted genes act coadaptively to improve both fetal development and maternal provisioning for nutrition and care. <b>In</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> subset of paternally expressed genes are co-expressed in both the placenta and the mother's hypothalamus. This would come about through selective pressure from parent-infant coadaptation to improve infant survival. Paternally expressed 3 (Peg3) is a gene for which this hypothesis may apply.|$|E
