5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't <b>go</b> <b>together</b> — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa {{that nothing}} can go wrong at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph <b>go</b> <b>together.</b> On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating {{a member of the}} same sex. Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would <b>go</b> <b>together</b> to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|Quinn and Finn <b>go</b> <b>together</b> for her {{ultrasound}} appointment, {{and they}} learn that she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own baby on the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Although Bart {{initially}} {{intends to}} drop out of the group as soon as possible, he decides to attend a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. Bart dislikes the first meeting, but when he finds out that he gets to have a pocket knife, he decides to keep attending. After a while, Bart starts to enjoy being a member of the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to <b>go</b> <b>together</b> but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with Ned and his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea. They stay stranded with no food or water for several days, as no rescue is forthcoming; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because the Coast Guard boat they were using is out of refreshments. After several other failed attempts at being rescued or finding food, the raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but then Homer smells his way to a Krusty Burger on an off-shore oil rig. They are saved, and Bart is proud of his father.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{especially}} REM sleep, {{people tend}} to have dreams: elusive first-person experiences, which, despite their frequently bizarre qualities, seem realistic while in progress. Dreams can seamlessly incorporate elements within a person's mind that would not normally <b>go</b> <b>together.</b> They can include apparent sensations of all types, especially vision and movement.|$|E

25|$|A {{deal was}} worked out where all four schools would <b>go</b> <b>together</b> to the Big 12.

Baylor and Texas Tech would join the Aggies in coming with UT into the {{new version of the}} Big Eight.|$|E

On May 8, Alrababah, Hanjour, Hazmi, Moqed and Ghamdi traveled to Fairfield to look for housing. While there, they also called several local flight schools. They then travelled briefly to Paterson {{to look at that}} area as well. Rababah has contended that, after this trip, he never saw any of the men again.|$|E

25|$|Children whose {{families}} receive welfare, {{children whose parents}} dropped out of school, children of teenage parents, children raised by a lone parent, children raised in crime-ridden inner-city neighbourhoods, children who have multiple young siblings, and children who live in overcrowded substandard apartments {{are at risk of}} poor educational achievement in Germany. Often these factors <b>go</b> <b>together,</b> making it very hard for children to overcome the odds. A number of measures have been assessed to help those children reach their full potential.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} high {{rank and}} high status always <b>go</b> <b>together</b> because no high ranking woman would ever marry a commoner, and no chief would ever marry a low ranking woman. In fact when prince Alaivahamamao eloped with {{the daughter of}} a low chiefess Tuimala, he was stripped from his royal status and had to flee to Hawaii. Children from that marriage, grandchildren of the king, would have obtained no significant rank. Albeit later, after a divorce, Alai was reconciled with his father and married princess Alaileula from Sāmoa. He did not however become prince again and died in 2004 with only the noble title Māatu.|$|E
25|$|A learner's permit can {{be issued}} at age 16. The student {{may choose to}} learn by going to a driving school or in private with up to four {{different}} instructors. Usually a mix of the two is used. These instructors must be 24 or older and must have held a valid driver's licence for five years (it must not have been cancelled temporarily for drunk driving and other serious traffic violations, but a single speeding conviction is now acceptable). The instructors and student must go through a traffic safety course before permission is granted; it takes about three hours to complete and is usually given at all driving schools on certain dates. From 2010 it is enough for every student and every instructor to go on this course once; before that each instructor and student pair had to <b>go</b> <b>together,</b> e.g. father/elder child, mother/elder child, father/younger child, mother/younger child.|$|E

25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, in his {{discussion}} of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always <b>go</b> <b>together,</b> implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E
25|$|When {{a problem}} shows optimal {{substructures}} – meaning the optimal {{solution to a}} problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and memoization <b>go</b> <b>together.</b> The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.|$|E
500|$|The text defines [...] "knowledge", {{translates}} Aiyar – a Sanskrit scholar, as [...] "through {{which one}} cognizes in himself the real nature of kaivalya (moksha) {{as the supreme}} seat, the stainless, the partless, and {{of the nature of}} Sacchidananda" [...] (truth-consciousness-bliss). This knowledge is of the Brahman and its non-differentiated nature with that of the Atman, of Jiva and Paramatman. Yoga and knowledge (jnana) both <b>go</b> <b>together</b> to realise Brahman and attain salvation, according to the Upanishad.|$|E

I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually <b>go</b> <b>together,</b> the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
