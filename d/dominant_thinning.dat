In this analysis, long-term data from the Commercial Thinning Research Network was used to project spruce-fir (Picea spp. —Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) stand growth on six different sites across Maine following six alternative thinning treatments (33 % and 50 % relative density removal paired with low, crown, and <b>dominant</b> <b>thinning</b> methods). Results showed that the low-thinning treatment performed best in terms of maximum net present value, stand age at time of maximum net present value, and average merchantable stem size. Although the low-thinning resulted in a 10 % mean reduction in maximum net present value when compared to the control, the average merchantable stem size more than doubled. Overall, results of this analysis indicate that it may be financially responsible to commercially thin these stands using a low-thinning method and a light removal intensity, as the average merchantable stems size was increased and a mid-rotation financial return provided...|$|E

40|$|Most Galaxy-sized systems (M_host ~ 10 ^ 12 M_sun) in the LCDM {{cosmology}} {{are expected}} to have accreted at least one satellite with a total mass M_sat ~ 10 ^ 11 M_sun = 3 M_disk in the past 8 Gyr. Analytic and numerical investigations suggest that this is the most precarious type of merger for the survival of thin galactic disks because more massive accretion events are relatively rare and less massive ones preserve thin disk components. We use high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations to study the response of an initially-thin, fully-formed Milky-Way type stellar disk to these cosmologically common events and show that the thin disk does not survive. Regardless of orbital configuration, the impacts transform the disks into structures that are roughly three times as thick and more than twice as kinematically hot as the observed <b>dominant</b> <b>thin</b> disk component of the Milky Way. We conclude that if the Galactic thin disk is a representative case, then the presence of a stabilizing gas component is the only recourse for explaining the preponderance of disk galaxies in an LCDM universe; otherwise, the disk of the Milky Way must be uncommonly cold and thin for its luminosity, perhaps as a consequence of an unusually quiescent accretion history.

40|$|Scrap {{aluminum}} cans recycle processing through {{metal casting}} {{is a way}} to improve the economic value. Yet, this process could not instantly be carried out to produce parts without knowing the chararacteristics of mechanical and microstructure. This study investigates those characteristics in three different pour temperatures, 650 °C, 700 °C, and 750 °C respectively and three die temperatures, 100 °C, 200 °C, and 300 °C. The result showed that the hardness number of aluminum cast was decreased as well as increasing of pours and die temperatures. The highest hardness number was 67. 615 VHN at 650 °C pour temperature, but the lowest one was 58. 327 VHN at 750 °C pour temperature. The highest hardness number was 77. 871 VHN at 100 °C die temperature, but the lowest was 61. 479 VHN at 300 °C die temperature. Tensile strength values were increased at a pour temperature of 650 °C to 700 °C and decreased at pour temperature of 750 °C. The highest tensile strength was 174. 183 MPa at 700 °C pour temperature and the lowest tensile strength was 110. 900 MPa at 750 °C pour temperature. The tensile strength was decreased as well as increasing of die temperature. The highest tensile strength was 177. 473 MPa at 100 °C die temperature and the lowest tensile strength was 108. 317 MPa at 300 °C die temperature.

The simulation results show that increasing the multiplication width may not necessarily increase the breakdown probability relative to the breakdown voltage, as the effect of dead space becomes more <b>dominant</b> in <b>thinner</b> multiplication regions at realistic ionization threshold energies for GaAs. On the other hand, reducing the multiplication width results in smaller breakdown time and jitter, despite the increased dead space. The effect of dead space in degrading breakdown time and jitter is relatively weak and further compensated by the stronger influence of large feedback ionization at high fields. Thus, SPAD designs that can minimize the dark count rate may potentially benefit from enhanced breakdown probability, breakdown time, and jitter by reducing {{the thickness of the}} multiplication region.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the proton-exchange {{membrane}} is perhaps the most critical component of a polymer-electrolyte fuel cell. Typical membranes, such as Nafion(R), require hydration to conduct efficiently and are instrumental in cell water management. Recently, evidence has been shown that these membranes might have different interfacial morphology and transport properties than in the bulk. In this paper, experimental data combined with theoretical simulations will be presented that explore the existence and impact of interfacial resistance on water transport for Nafion(R) 21 x membranes. A mass-transfer coefficient for the interfacial resistance is calculated from experimental data using different permeation cells. This coefficient is shown to depend exponentially on relative humidity or water activity. The interfacial resistance does not seem to exist for liquid/membrane or membrane/membrane interfaces. The effect of the interfacial resistance is to flatten the water-content profiles within the membrane during operation. Under typical operating conditions, the resistance is on par with the water-transport resistance of the bulk membrane. Thus, the interfacial resistance can be <b>dominant</b> especially in <b>thin,</b> dry membranes and can affect overall fuel-cell performance...|$|R

This paper aims {{to describe the}} changes in the structure and dynamics of these stands with age. It then assesses the impact of selective thinning in the upper storey on both structural and dynamic parameters. The experiment consisted of 34 Permanent Plots in stands from establishment to more mature stages (ca. 50 years old). Thirteen plots (17 [...] 45 years old) were thinned. More than 80 % of the removal came from supernumerary dominant A. klaineana. A. klaineana represented 60 % of the total density in stands ca. 15 years old but > 90 % of the dominant trees in older stands. The changes with age in the floristic composition of the unthinned stands showed three successional stages during which pioneer species associated with A. klaineana (from establishment to ca. 15 years) were progressively replaced by mature forest species. Basal area increased and density decreased with age before reaching stable values at ca. 40 [...] 45 years. Mortality was very high in young stands but decreased in the older ones. Mortality generally affected small diameter individuals in the dominated storey. Diameter and basal area increments showed that the stand growth resulted from the growth of dominant A. klaineana. Diameter increments of A. klaineana were elevated during the first years of colonisation (1. 9 cm/year) and were still ca. 0. 7 cm/year for 50 -year-old <b>dominant</b> trees. <b>Thinning</b> did not increase the mortality of the dominant population. It favoured the individual growth of A. klaineana. The gain was substantial for dominated trees and small dominant trees (from 60 to 100 %) but was lower for large dominant trees (ca. 25 [...] 30 %). Therefore, stimulation of individual growth did not compensate for the loss of basal area at the stand level...|$|R

40|$|Water {{permeation}} through Nafion® membranes and catalyst-coated membranes are measured. Three {{types of}} water permeability measurements are conducted {{in order to}} systematically study {{the effect of the}} phase of water in contact with the membrane: vapour permeation (termed vapour-vapour permeation), pervaporation (termed liquid-vapour permeation) and hydraulic permeation (termed liquid-liquid permeation). Measurements are taken at 70 oC. The largest water permeation flux was observed when the membrane was exposed to liquid water on one side and water vapour at the other, i. e., liquid-vapour permeation. Water permeabilities were found to increase: with increasing differential chemical potential developed across the membrane; with progressive hydration of the membrane; and when the membrane is in contact with liquid water. Water permeability measurements obtained ex-situ are correlated to in-situ fuel cell water balance measurements at 70 oC. The back permeation (i. e., water transport from cathode to anode), is largely driven by liquid-vapour permeation, and is sufficient to offset the electro-osmotic drag flux (i. e., proton-driven water transport towards cathode). Ex-situ and in-situ water transport measurements were extended to membranes with thicknesses ranging 6 to 201 μm. Under liquid-liquid permeation condition, water permeation fluxes increased with reduction in membrane thickness; under liquid-vapour and vapour-vapour permeation conditions, water permeation fluxes increased with reduction in membrane thickness but changed little for thickness below 56 μm. Estimation of internal and interfacial water transport resistances revealed that interfacial water transport resistance is <b>dominant</b> for <b>thin</b> membranes – explaining why further increases in liquid-vapour and vapour-vapour permeation fluxes are not observed with decreasing membrane thicknesses below 56 μm. Water permeabilities of catalyst-coated membranes and pristine membranes are found to be similar under all three modes of water permeation. The effect of catalyst layer on membrane water permeation is negligible. In summary, the formation of a membrane/liquid interface is found to enhance the permeability of water through Nafion® membranes. In contrast, presence of a membrane/vapour interface diminishes the rate of water permeation. Under fuel cell operating conditions, when the membrane/liquid interface is formed at the cathode, it is found that a sufficient rate of back permeation effectively regulates the water balance within the fuel cell...|$|R

Iron pyrite (FeS 2) is a promising, earth-abundant material that has a suitable band gap of 0. 95 eV, a large optical absorption coefficient, and adequate carrier diffusion lengths for use in PV. Unfortunately pyrite solar cells have suffered from low open circuit voltages that hinder overall device performance. Developing high quality, phase pure pyrite thin films may be the key to overcoming these performance drawbacks. A solution-based process using elemental precursors dissolved in hydrazine has been previously developed at IBM for fabricating solar absorbers such as copper zinc tin selenide/sulfide (CZTS) and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide (CIGS). Devices using these films have achieved 12. 6 % and 15. 2 % efficiencies respectively. In this dissertation, a hydrazine-free molecular ink that uses common organic solvents to dissolve elemental iron and sulfur is described for making pyrite thin films. To form pyrite thin films, the molecular ink is deposited onto molybdenum-coated glass and then annealed at temperatures between 350 - 500 °C in both hydrogen sulfide and sulfur vapor atmospheres. Phase purity is confirmed using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Film morphology is examined with scanning electron microscopy. Elemental composition is analyzed using secondary ion mass spectrometry and FT-IR spectroscopy. Optical properties are measured using an integrating sphere attachment on a UV-VIS spectrometer. The electrical properties of the films are characterized by temperature-dependent resistivity and qualitative thermopower to verify the carrier type. The resulting films are measured to be pure phase pyrite that consist of well-connected grains between 50 - 200 nm in size and are free of pinholes. Optical and electrical properties agree with those commonly cited in literature. Elemental analysis reveals low amounts of oxygen and carbon impurities, compared to other fabrication methods of pyrite used in the same laboratory. The initial results of using these films in p-n heterojunctions will be presented along with on-going strategies being researched to overcome new challenges...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Thin films {{represent}} a critical sector of modern engineering that strives to produce functional coatings at the smallest possible length scales. They appear most commonly in semiconductors where they form {{the foundation of}} all electronic circuits, but exist in many other areas to provide mechanical, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. The mechanical characterization of thin films has been a continued challenge due foremost to the length scales involved. However, emerging thin films focusing on materials with significant porosity, complex morphologies, and nanostructured surfaces produce additional difficulties towards mechanical analysis. Nanoindentation has been the <b>dominant</b> <b>thin</b> film mechanical characterization technique {{for the last decade}} because of the quick results, wide range of sample applicability, and ease of sample preparation. However, the traditional nanoindentation technique encounters difficulties for thin porous films. For such materials, alternative means of analysis are desirable and the lesser known laser-induced surface acoustic wave technique (LiSAW) shows great potential in this area. This dissertation focuses on studying thin, porous, and nanostructured films by nanoindentation and LiSAW techniques in an effort to directly correlate the two methodologies and to test the limits and applicabilities of each technique on challenging media. The LiSAW technique is particularly useful for thin porous films because unlike indentation, the substrate is properly accounted for in the wave motion analysis and no plastic deformation is necessary. Additionally, the use of lasers for surface acoustic wave generation and detection allows the technique to be fully non-contact. This is desirable in the measurement of thin, delicate, and porous films where physical sample probing may not be feasible. The LiSAW technique is also valuable in overcoming nanoscale roughness, particularly for films that cannot be mechanically polished, since typical SAW wavelengths are micrometers in scale whereas indentation depths are usually confined to the nanometer scale. This dissertation demonstrates the effectiveness of LiSAW on both thin porous layers and rough surfaces and shows the challenges faced by nanoindentation on the same films. Zeolite thin films are studied extensively in this work as a model system because of their porous crystalline framework and enormous economic market. Many types of zeolite exist and their widely varying structures and levels of porosity present a unique opportunity for mechanical characterization. For a fully dense ZSM- 5 type zeolite with wear and corrosion resistance properties, nanoindentation was used to compare its mechanical properties to industrial chromium and cadmium films. Through tribological and indentation tests, it was shown that the zeolite film possesses exceptional resilience and hardness therefore demonstrating superior wear resistance to chromium and cadmium. This also highlighted the quality of nanoindentation measurements on thick dense layers where traditional nanoindentation excels. Nanoindentation was then performed on porous and non-porous MFI zeolite films with low-k (low dielectric constant) properties. These films were softer and much thinner than the ZSM- 5 coatings resulting in significant substrate effects, evidenced by inflation of the measurements from the hard silicon substrate, during indentation. Such effects were avoided with the LiSAW technique on the same films where properties were readily extracted without complications. An alternative indentation analysis method was demonstrated to produce accurate mechanical measurements in line with the LiSAW results, but the non-traditional technique requires substantial computational intensity. Thus LiSAW was proven to be an accurate and efficient means of mechanical characterization for thin porous layers. The case for LiSAW was further supported by utilizing the technique on a porous nanostructured V 2 O 5 electrode film. The surface roughness, on the same scale as indentation depths, created difficulty in obtaining consistent nanoindentation results. Since the film was too delicate for mechanical polishing, the nanoindentation results possessed a high level of uncertainty. It was demonstrated that the LiSAW technique could extract the mechanical properties from such layers without substrate effects and with higher accuracy than nanoindentation. The research in this dissertation directly demonstrates the areas where nanoindentation excels and the areas where it encounters difficulty. It is shown how the LiSAW technique can be an efficient alternative in the challenging areas through its dependence on bulk dispersive wave motion rather than localized deformation. Thus, LiSAW opens up many avenues towards the mechanical characterization of thin, porous, soft, or rough films. Nanoindentation remains an extremely useful technique for thin film characterization, especially with the alternative analysis adaptation. However, as films continue trending towards smaller length scales, more complex porous morphologies, and engineered nanoscale surfaces, LiSAW may well become an equally valuable and indispensable technique...|$|R

The lack of a significant population of X-ray bright, but optically dull AGN among less dynamically evolved groups is in stark contrast to the large fraction of such objects in rich clusters of galaxies (Martini et al. 2006). We suggest this result can be explained by a physical scenario for AGN accretion evolution: AGN activity is initially triggered by galaxy merging, leading to a high accretion rate and an optically <b>dominant</b> phase (via <b>thin</b> disk accretion). As the accretion rate drops in time, the AGN gradually enters an X-ray dominant low-accretion phase (via a radiative inefficient accretion flow). In this picture, optical- and X-ray-selected AGN are the same population of supermassive black holes observed at different epochs. Within the context of this scenario, the majority of AGN in poor groups are in the highaccretion optically dominant phase, while the AGN population in rich clusters is mostly in the low-accretion X-ray dominant phase...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACt: The {{inner shelf}} of the Canadian Beaufort Sea is {{characterized}} by a succession of near-surface fine-grained facies changes. Seaward of shoreface sands and silts, these facies are: (1) thin-bedded silt and clay couplets (< 1 cm thick); (2) massive to graded medium to thick-bedded silt beds (up to 20 cm thick); (3) thin silt beds (< 2 cm thick) with thick interbeds of bioturbated silty clay; and (4) bioturbated silty clay with no silt beds. These facies are related to wave action at the seabed. The massive to graded medium to thick-bedded facies occurs between water depths of 4. 2 m and 5. 5 m and is interpreted to result from resuspension events by waves daring storms. A nearbed region of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), observed near the 5 m isobath, increased in concentration during moderate storms. Time series of nearbed SSC and wave heights in 5. 9 m of water recorded rapid resuspension resulting in SSC values of 4, 000 mg/L during a severe storm. The thin-bedded silt and clay facies found shoreward of this resuspension zone is interpreted to result from attenuation of wave energy in the resuspension zone. The amount ofresuspension decreases shoreward, resulting in thinner edeposited beds. Seaward of the resuspension zone, the frequency of bottom resuspension decreases with increasing water depth, reflecting the lower frequency of very large storm waves. This is reflected in the deeper water facies where bioturbated clay becomes the <b>dominant</b> facies, with <b>thin</b> silt beds representing infrequent bottom resuspension during the largest storms...|$|R
40|$|The biaxial {{strained}} silicon has attracted {{much interest in}} manufacturing industry due to the potential enhancement in carrier-transport property. The biaxial strain lifts the degeneracy of silicon valence and conduction bands, leading {{to a reduction in}} intervalley scattering and lower effective mass of conduction and valence band states, and hence delivers better mobility and velocity performance in comparison with bulk silicon. In this research, a development of the lightly doped and heavily doped ultrathin {{strained silicon}} ultimate drift velocity model with the inclusion of quantum confinement effect is conducted. For nondegenerate regime, the study shows that the ultimate drift velocity is its thermal velocity which is only dependent on temperature. However, in the degenerate regime the ultimate drift velocity is its Fermi velocity which only depends on the carrier concentration. At room temperature, result shows that the ultimate drift velocity of strained silicon is always higher than unstrained silicon as much as 0. 5 x 10 m/s. The single channel and dual channel biaxial strained silicon gate capacitance are also developed. These gate capacitances take into account the quantum capacitance. Result shows that for the single channel device, the relative capacitance is lower by as much as 0. 07 compared to dual channel device when the oxide thickness is 2. 5 nm and transverse electric field is 60 MV 'm. This means that the quantum capacitance is more dominant in the single channel compared to the dual channel biaxial strained silicon MOSFET. This is due to the dual channel biaxial strained silicon having a thicker dielectric which causes the lower effect of quantum capacitance. The quantum capacitance is more <b>dominant</b> in <b>thinner</b> gate oxide and lower strain. Lastly, an analytical threshold voltage modeling has been reported. This model takes into account the effect of quantum confinement effect on the flatband voltage, built-in voltage and strained silicon work function. Other than that, this model also includes the quantum mechanical effect on the oxide thickness. Other important parameters such as different lateral doping profile in the depletion region, germanium mole fraction of the silicon germanium (SiGe) layer, thickness of strained silicon and silicon germanium, channel length, source, drain and substrate bias are also included. Comparison of this model with the thick strained silicon threshold voltage simulation results was also carried out. Results show that the threshold voltage for ultrathin strained silicon channel is always higher by as much as 0. 04 V compared to the thick strained silicon MOSFET. This is because the ultrathin strained silicon has the higher faltband voltage, wider bandgap, lower Fermi energy, and higher barrier between the source and the drain compared to thick strained silicon...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This paper {{describes}} {{methods that}} can be used to evaluate stand and tree growth response to a single application of fertilization and/or thinning with data collected from multiple installations. Two kinds of methods were proposed: (1) structure analysis which applies covariance analysis in a blocked design with and without sampling units, and (2) multi-step analysis which first fits a control model to control data and then uses it to evaluate treatment response. Ideally, the former method is preferred to the latter method for evaluating the treatment response. However, when the experimental data are large in sampling size and/or complex in their designed structure, structure analysis often can not be performed on most statistical packages, and, therefore, the multi-step analysis is a viable alternative. The methods were applied in modeling fertilization and thinning effects on Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] dominant height growth and diameter growth of single trees. Both responses due to improved nutrition from a single application of nitrogen fertilizer were significant (a=O. 05) in the first 5 -year growth period, and not significant after two 5 -year cycles. The response in diameter growth was stronger than that in <b>dominant</b> height growth. <b>Thinning</b> neither increased nor decreased the dominant height growth. It accelerated diameter growth, but the interaction of fertilization with thinning was not significant. As a comparison, both structure analysis and two-step analysis were used to model the direct effect of fertilization on the gross basal area growth of plots. The results showed that the appropriate variance estimates to test the significance of the parameters in fertilizer response equation were larger when using two-step analysis than when using structure analysis...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{main focus}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) model that could act as a virtual organic solar cell, which would then be used to analyse and predict OPV performance. The photoconversion process in organic solar cells {{consists}} of several molecular processes: light absorption, exciton transport, exciton dissociation, charge transport and extraction. The optical field and thus exciton generation profile is determined using transfer matrix techniques. Exciton transport is modelled using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) theory. Charge transport is described using Marcus theory and charge injection is known to follow Miller-Abrahams expressions. The DMC approach provides a platform where these various theories can be combined to model the entire photoconversion process. Exciton transport can be modelled using a simple random walk or using a more rigorous and computationally more intensive theory such as FRET theory. The DMC model was used to investigate the consequence of either theories on exciton dissociation and charge transfer state separation. A random walk is computationally more efficient than FRET and is the preferred approach when modelling single component systems as found in photoluminescence experiments. However, neglecting energy relaxation and non-nearest neighbour hops leads to an underestimation of geminate recombination and an overestimation of photocurrent up to 2 % in organic solar cells. Experimental validation of the DMC model was provided by modelling and experimentally measuring external quantum efficiency and short-circuit current as a function of active layer thickness. Excellent agreement was found and the model was further used to analyse charge selectivity at the electrodes, interface recombination and bulk recombination. It was found that interface recombination is <b>dominant</b> for <b>thin</b> active layers and that a substantial gain in performance is expected by improving charge selectivity at the electrodes, in particular the anode. Full I-V curves can be calculated using the DMC model. This capability was used to investigate s-shaped I-V curves. Electron traps were only found to induce s-shaped I-V behaviour when the traps are located at the electrode interfaces. Injected charge carriers do not induce s-shaped I-V curves; photogenerated charge carriers are necessary to observe this behaviour. Simulations suggest that OPV material systems that exhibit less charge recombination are more likely to exhibit s-shaped I-V curves. The open-circuit voltage does not always coincide with the centre of the 's' and could be changed by tuning charge recombination. DMC modelling was further used to investigate why thermal annealing removes s-shaped behaviour. Results suggest that vertical phase composition at the electrodes is not the cause of inflected I-V curves, rather charge traps is the cause of this anomalous behaviour. Energy traps were also found to affect exciton transport as they reduce the exciton diffusion length. DMC models take into consideration the three dimensional nanostructure of the photoactive layer. This capability was used to investigate core-shell nanoparticle morphologies. Annealing was found to improve the efficiency of nanoparticle devices and modelling suggests that different annealing conditions to what is commonly used for BHJ devices are needed the increase the efficiency further. In addition, simulations indicate that annealing conditions should be re-optimised when changing the nanoparticle size. The performance of core-shell nanoparticles approaches that of the BHJ morphology, when optimised for both feature size and nanoparticle size. Hence, the core-shell morphology does not necessarily severely limit charge extraction and, in theory, optimised nanoparticle devices should yield similar efficiencies as optimised BHJ devices. A high resolution light beam induced current (LBIC) setup was developed and used to investigate lateral non-uniformities that are the result of imperfect fabrication techniques or degradation. The primary degradation mechanism in standard organic solar cells is water diffusion limited oxidation of the aluminium cathode. A diffusion model was applied, which allowed for the determination of the diffusion rate and also the diffusivity of water in PEDOT:PSS. Diffusion through pinholes is quantified to be significantly slower than diffusion at the cathode edge. Lateral device design was shown to substantially influence the degradation rate and pattern...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 In 1957 three Douglas-fir stands (15 -, 25 -, and 40 -year-old age classes) were {{selected}} {{on a tree}} farm in the Cascade foothills of northwestern Oregon to study factors affecting site productivity. Soil-moisture, soil-temperature and seasonal radial- growth pattern measurements were made with a Colman moisture meter and a dial gauge dendrometer on thinned and unthinned subareas. Soil temperatures were significantly increased by thinning in each stand. This effect decreased with soil depth and increased with increasing intensity of thinning. Root distribution studies eight years after thinning showed that a heavily thinned stand had relatively few roots in the lower profile between the remaining trees, {{in contrast to the}} complete distribution throughout the profile in the unthinned subareas. This would indicate less overall soil-moisture depletion with thinning since the available soil-moisture levels measured within the fully rooted zone were not significantly different for the various thinning treatments. As expected radial growth increased significantly with increasing intensity of thinning. The amount and proportion of late season growth tended to increase with increasing thinning intensity although the observed differences were not statistically significant. Late season growth, however, was significantly increased by increasing crown position (intermediate to <b>dominant)</b> regardless of <b>thinning</b> treatment. Irrigation of selected trees at a ridgetop area extended the spring maximum radial growth rate throughout most of the summer. On comparable non-irrigated trees growth retardation was detectable in the range of one-half to one atmospheres of soil-moisture tension. Growth cessation occurred when soil-moisture-tension values reached the two to five atmosphere range. Irrigation of trees in a young hillside bench stand slightly increased radial growth rate during the first two years, but decreased growth in relation to non-irrigated trees during the next two years apparently as a result of excess irrigation. Fertilization with high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers increased the late season radial growth of irrigated and non-irrigated trees in both stands. The late season response is attributed to a dwindling supply of mineralized soil nitrogen in the late summer and early fall. Irrigation and fertilization combined gave approximately additive increases in radial growth which ranged from 35 to 60 percent. It is hypothesized that potential radial growth (except for short periods at the start and end of the growing season) is equivalent to the maximum spring rate. Departures from this maximum result from deficiencies in moisture, mineral nutrient elements, or heat. Thus the maximum growth rate is proposed as an important characteristic, reflecting the potential carbohydrate productive capacity of the crown when raw material levels exceed rate limiting supplies. The fertility status of each research area was assessed by various means including soil chemical and physical analyses, sampling and chemical analyses of forest floor and litter fall material and pot fertility tests. The relative ranking of these areas in terms of fertility was consistent with their site index or productivity rating. Monterey pine and Douglas-fir seedling test plants grown on the potted soils from the different horizons in each profile responded to nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur additions. In field tests nitrogen fertilization stimulated radial growth of Douglas-fir whereas phosphorus fertilizer at high application rates resulted in a growth depression...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim was {{to analyse}} the {{possibilities}} for operational forestry of using Pinus sylvestris (L.) orchard seeds (0 s) for direct seeding in the boreal forest. The use of 0 s instead of stand seeds (SS) increased seedling establishment by 41 % two years after mechanical direct seeding at four sites in northern Sweden. 0 s was advantageous to use in combination with microsite preparation to achieve desired spacing and different regeneration strategies, at low cost, and on an operational scale. On average, 0 s had 16 % and 12 % higher seedling emergence than SS in a northern (Lat 64 "N) and southern (Lat 60 "N) field experimental series where six orchard seed lots and six stand seed lots of adequate geographical origins were analysed with up to six seeding years. The survival rate from year 1 to year 4 was 77 % and 72 % in the northern series and 58 % and 49 % in the southern series for orchard and stand seedlings respectively. On average, 0 s were 26 % and 13 % taller than SS after {{four years in the}} northern and southern series, respectively. Effects on early seedling growth of seeding 0 s and SS in different mixtures (100, 75, 50, 25, and 0 % of 0 s) at 4 -cm target spacing were quantified in a nursery (optimal) and a field (harsh) experiment. SS in high competition vs. low competition (mixture 75 % vs. 25 %) were 11 % taller, had 15 % greater slender value, and 25 % less root biomass after two years in the nursery. 0 s had 9 % greater slender value in mixture 100 % compared to mixture 25 %. In the field experiment the influence of mixture was not significant after five years. The tallest 0 s in each plot compared with the tallest SS were 22 % taller and had 103 % larger stem volume. After thinning, leaving the tallest seedling in each plot, 79 % of the seedlings in 50 % mixtures would be 0 s. Seedlings sown in 12 -cm spacing were 79 % taller and had 527 % larger stem volume than seedlings in 4 -cm spacing. An increase of seed weight from 3 to 7 mg increased height growth by 1845 % and 10 - 27 % in the field and nursery experiment, respectively. Seed weight explained approximately 3 1 - 56 % and 7546 % of the increased growth of using 0 s compared to SS in the field and nursery experiment. Two-year-old 0 s seedlings allocated 10 % more to needles and had 113 % longer total needle length than SS in the field experiment. In the nursery experiment 0 s did not allocate more to needles than SS did. The high cost of 0 s makes a mixture of 0 s and SS as a suitable alternative in several regeneration strategies. SS can be used complementary to OS, i. e., to increase stand density, reduce the cost of seeds, as insurance if seedling establishment is low, and to increase the total wood production and timber quality.

40|$|Western Australian Archaean komatiites {{which are}} {{associated}} with nickel sulphide mineralization can be separated into two groups - Mineralized or Barren, based on komatiite lithogeochemistry. Mineralized komatiites may host nickel sulphide deposits whereas Barren komatiites do not. Chemical relationships were determined from a data base of approximately 3300 samples of fresh komatiite ult. r. amafic from four nickel pro¥inces and other greenstone belts not known to contain nickel sulphides. Mean chemical values for each group of komatiites were: Category Mineralized (J) NiP - (2) 1027 Ni CuP Cu Al Ca 2220 36 42 1. 6 2. 2 !i 9 _ Zn Cr Mn Fe CoP 19. 2 69 1617 1057 6. 1 49 Co 119 Barren 429 1530 29 39 2. 2 2. 8 16. 4 76 2260 1128 7. 0 32 119 Discriminant analysis, using the above thirteen chemical determinations as variables, for each of 2775 samples from forty localities, indicated that samples {{could be classified as}} either Mineralized or Barren with an expected accuracy of greater than 80 percent. No single element or chemical determination is definitive, but collectively, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Ni, Mg, Fe and Co can distinguish between the two groups of ultramafics. Critical elements are Cr, Ni and Nif, assuming that values of Zn, Cu, Mg and Fe approximate the mean value for all West Australian komatiites. The Ni to Cr ratio is always greater than unity (1) in Mineralized komatiites and the Ni to NiP ratio is always less than 3. 5. Sulphur is not a diagnostic element. NOTES: 1. f indicates a partial or sulphide analysis. 2. Al, Ca, Mg and Fe results are expressed in percentages; all others in parts per million. Increasing Ni/Cr ratios and decreasing Ni/Ni ratios within a komatiite can be regarded as indicative of increasing nickel sulphide potential. Mineralized komatiites contain less Cr within the silicate lattice structure and less chromite than Barren komatiites. However, the more important relationship appears to be the lesser amount of Cr attached to the silicate mineral lattice. Correlation analysis showed that: 1. most correlations are much stronger in Barren than in Mineralized ultramafics; 2. the chalcophile elements, Cu, Ni, Co and Fe (constituents of nickel sulphide deposits), show moderate to strong correlations with the rock forming elements, Mg, Mn, Ca, Al in Barren ultramafics, but only weak or no correlation in the Mineralized ultramafics; 3. copper has moderate positive correlation with Fe, Mn, Ca, Al and negative correlation with Mg in Barren ultramafics but shows no correlation with these same elements in Mineralized ultramafics. These correlation differences suggest that in Barren komatiites Ni, Cu, Co and Fe are contained in the silicate mineral lattice whereas in Mineralized komatiites they are presently partly as a separate sulphide fraction. In addition they may also suggest that these sulphides were added or removed from Mineralized komatiites after the formation of the komatiite magma, probably by concentration and removal in arl immissible sulphide-oxide melt. Komatiites can be divided into two separate suites called volcanic and intrusive. Volcanic suites such as those at Kambalda and Windarra South may contain many individual komatiite flows. The basal section of a komatiite volcanic pile consists of a small number of thick units which may contain sulphide mineralization whereas the central and upper parts of the pile consists of multiple thin units. Both thick and thin units consist of an olivine cumulate derived lower part overlain by a silicate liquid derived upper part. In thick units the olivine cumulate section is <b>dominant</b> whereas in <b>thin</b> units the silicate liquid section is dominant. Spinifex texture is characteristic of unmetamorphosed sequences. In metamorphosed sequences such as Windarra South {{it is not possible to}} identify individual komatiites using mineralogical or textural criteria but it can be accomplished using chemical data. Intrusive suite komatiite sequences such as Forrestania or Perseverance usually consist of a small number of high Mg, homogeneous peridotites and/or dunites. Equigranular, equant olivine textures are characteristic. These komatiites are often continuous over strike lengths of the order of tens of kilometers and contain relatively little internal chemical variation. Volcanic komatiites such as those at Windarra South and Kambalda are considered to be ultramafic lavas. Chemical differences between volcanic and intrusive sequences have been defined. Typical chemical values for the cumulate section of a volcanic komatiite and for intrusive komatiites, both with moderate to high mineralization coefficients are: Classification NiP- -Ni CuP & Cu Al !: 19. Zn Cr Mn Fe CoP Co Volcanic Komatiites 1000 2100 30 - 90 1 - 2 17 - 24 60 1300 1000 5. 5 55 120 Intrusive Komatiites 1200 2500 5 - 60 0. 5 20 - 26 60 1000 900 6 60 125 In general, if Nif or Ni are less than 500 and 1800 ppm respectively, or Cr greater than 2100 ppm, a komati ite can be regarded as Barren. It has been possible to define sections of greenstone belts as prospective for nickel sulfides and other parts as unprospective. For example, the Forrestania section of the Forrestania-Southern Cross greenstone belt has a different chemical signature to the Southern Cross section. The latter section is unlikely to contain economic nickel sulphide accumulations...|$|R
