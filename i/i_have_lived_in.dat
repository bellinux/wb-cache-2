500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, liveâ€“in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
2500|$|The events concern a {{day when}} a major and unscrupulous {{televangelist}} (Brother Freddy) sees a scheduled appearance by Dale Evans go seriously wrong when an exotic Italian-looking fellow strolls on stage. He announces that he is Vanni Fucci (a character from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy) and that [...] "for the last seven hundred years <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> hell." [...] (pg 72) Each Bolgia of Dante's Hell is allowed to send one of its inhabitants (Fucci was of the Seventh Bolgia of the Eighth Circle of Hell) back to Earth {{for a brief period}} of time, and Fucci happened to be chosen. Unlike most such returnees, he is not indulging in as many worldly pleasures as he can, however, but has returned in order to remedy a distressing problem. He recounts that Hell and even gods are created and uncreated by the strength of people's beliefs, and unfortunately Fucci was condemned to eternal suffering simply because he had gotten politically cross-wise of Dante and Dante's Hell was the most popular version (and so, the real one).|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> {{those days}} <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> worn your flower {{at the court}} of the king," [...] she cried, with glowing cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "To-day {{at least}} is charming," [...] she said. [...] "But then I am quite used to your climate, you know. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Europe {{almost as much}} as in America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The light your {{industrial}} civilization gives is dim. I and {{the others}} would sooner have the dark. You hate the shadowy world because {{you do not know}} it; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> it long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever since I knew you," [...] he said slowly, [...] "there {{have been}} odd moments when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> torture. During the last fortnight, those moments have become hours. Last night the end came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glorious! I {{never look}} upon that sight," [...] said Aspel, with {{flashing}} eyes, [...] "without wishing that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> {{the days of}} the old Vikings." ...|$|R
60|$|I took Mr. Mason {{into the}} parlor, {{a room that}} I hardly knew, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the house about two years. Presently Gus came down the stairs.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I am only a poor girl,' {{returned}} Sissy. 'I {{was separated}} from my father - {{he was only a}} stroller - and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the house ever since.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My children,' she said, 'all {{the years}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the world, I {{have never heard of}} a shift spun from nettles. But what God commands, man can do. Why should not Renelde try it?' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was eager}} to know how long <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness; how often <b>I</b> <b>had</b> fought against the savages, and such like simple questions, all of which I {{answered}} until he was come to an end.|$|R
50|$|I {{became an}} anarchist only recently. It {{was no longer}} ago than around mid-1891 that I threw myself into the revolutionary movement.

6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Dahcotah, I {{have told}} no lie. Since the Great Spirit {{made me a}} man, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness, or on these naked plains, without lodge or family. I am a hunter and go on my path alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} of it, Mrs. Leith Fairfax. I never enquire after the effect of my work. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> {{comparative}} seclusion; and I scarcely know what collection of fugitive notes of mine you honor by describing as a book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} near Munich," [...] he added, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> this country forty years, mostly in Cincinnati. This young lady is my stepdaughter. It {{is for her}} health that I came here. She has been very ill." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rockfield (Studios) was an {{absolute}} dream because it was pastoral, funny and had a fantastic musical history...I moved here {{and became one of}} these dismal, happy, sad, failed musicians that other people cross the street to avoid...I really enjoyed my being in this Rockfield environment. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> this goldfish bowl in Led Zeppelin.

60|$|He {{then began}} to talk with me more familiarly; told me he hoped I was not left in bad circumstances; that Mr. ---- was reputed to be very rich, {{and that he had}} gained lately great sums by some jewels, and he hoped, he said, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> still a fortune {{agreeable}} to the condition <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|Oh! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> endless pain, [...] And I have lived, alas! in vain, [...] For none regard my woe-- [...] No father's care {{conveyed}} the truth, [...] No mother's fondness blessed my youth, [...] Ah! joys {{too great to}} know-- ...|$|E

60|$|Eliz. 'Twas more! 'twas more! I've tests: From youth <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> two {{alternate}} worlds, And {{night is}} live like day. This was no goblin!

60|$|Now {{all this}} while <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the swamp near the sea, {{but when my}} {{strength}} returned I thought of my old home, to which something seemed to draw me. Also there were no turnips near the swamp, and as the winter came on I found very little to eat there. So one day, or rather one night, I travelled back home.|$|R
5000|$|As a child, Edmond's family <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> houses {{designed}} by notable Australian architects - the Bridgeford House in Black Rock, {{designed by}} Robin Boyd in 1953; and the Quamby apartments in South Yarra, designed by Roy Grounds.

50|$|Joachim was an {{inspiration}} to me, and opened before my eyes horizons of that greater art of which until then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> ignorance.

I also played a great deal of chamber music with my fellow students.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{laughed a}} little. [...] "If you really wish to know, I {{think it is}} the grandest there is on this earth, as I believe it {{will be one of the}} greatest.

6000|$|... "It does matter," [...] {{said her}} sister with startling energy. [...] "How do you know, how do I know that I may not {{sometimes}} visit it? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> this house so long I {{am certain that}} I shall see it again.

6000|$|Sooner or later, we {{susceptible}} {{people pay}} with the heartache {{for the privilege}} of loving.

5000|$|Scientists {{are often}} accused {{of living in}} the [...] "Ivory Tower" [...] and not troubling their mind with realities and apart from my {{association}} with political movements in my juvenile years, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> ivory tower up to 1930. But science and technology are as important for administration now-a-days as law and order. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> gradually glided into politics because I wanted to be of some use to the country in my own humble way.|$|R

60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a {{thousand}} citizens {{in front of}} me, I {{would like to give}} them information, but you children already know all that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found out about the Educational Alliance.

So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> New York and knew nothing about the Educational Alliance.|$|R
