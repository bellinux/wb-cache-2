40|$|Simon Kuznets {{hypothesized}} that inequality in a country's {{distribution of income}} worsens {{in the early stages}} of its economic development and that the inequality improves as the country reaches higher stages of development (the 'inverted U hypothesis'). Empirical support for the inverted U hypothesis has been mixed. In testing <b>Kuznets</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> analysts have specified a variety of parametric forms for the relationship between inequality and development, including a quadratic form (a second-degree polynomial). Using data on income distributions on Native American reservations in the USA, the present analysis indicates that non-parametric estimates of the relationship can inform a parametric analysis. Specifically, while a regression with a second-degree polynomial finds mixed support for the hypothesis, the non-parametric analysis suggests the presence of such an inverse relationship. Indeed, the non-parametric form suggests that a polynomial of greater degree might better capture the relationship between economic development and income inequality. Hypothesis testing supports estimating a fourth-degree polynomial rather than a second-degree polynomial. All terms in the fourth-degree polynomial are statistically significant and the estimated coefficients support the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> These regression results counsel caution in testing the inverted U hypothesis by estimating only parametric forms which produce strictly concave functions. ...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} of research on income inequality is {{the search for a}} Kuznets curve. Two curvilinear relationships in particular have been documented in the literature: one between inequality and income and the other between inequality and environmental factors. More recently, inequality and its link to trade liberalisation has received a good deal of attention, not least because it is among the major controversies provoked by the globalisation process. The outcomes for developing countries of greater openness do not fit neatly with the predictions of standard trade theory. Given this, it is natural to ask whether the relationship between trade openness and inequality may be better understood in terms of the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> To this end, the study tests the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>hypothesis</b> in the context of trade liberalisation using data for Latin America. The evidence is new and is consistent with the Kuznets hypothesis: inequality increases with trade openness until a critical level of openness is reached after which inequality begins to fall. The curvilinear relationship between openness and inequality suggests that Latin American countries should continue with trade liberalisation measures but also introduce redistribution policies to ease the (initial) adverse consequences of liberalisation.
