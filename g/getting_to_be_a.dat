30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{differences}} by facility type, at merge segment, MR <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor related <b>to</b> the 1 st component due to the increased interruption of ramp traffic {{with the increase of}} traffic density. During the variation in traffic conditions, the significance of DR becomes lower than geometric variation at diverge segment. However, in high-density uncongested flow, LD is more important in contrast to low-density uncongested flow. Once a driver feels the difficulty for lane-changing maneuvers in diverging area, they may move onto the nearest lane to off-ramp in advance in the upstream of diverging area. As a result, the impact of lane-changing maneuvers on mainline traffic gets relatively low. In a sharp curve, crashes <b>are</b> still found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> probable with <b>a</b> decrease in k, which <b>is</b> similar <b>to</b> the tendency of CR model.|$|R
