5|$|He <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there,</b> {{he knows}} everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

25|$|Dharma traditions do {{not hold}} history central to their faith. Gautama Buddha {{emphasized}} that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of a reality that <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there.</b> He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor {{the last person to}} have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.|$|E
25|$|Tension builds as {{business}} associates wonder why Bartleby <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there.</b> Sensing {{the threat to}} his reputation but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the narrator moves his business out. Soon the new tenants come {{to ask for help}} in removing Bartleby, who now sits on the stairs all day and sleeps in the building's doorway at night. The narrator visits him and attempts to reason with him, and surprises even himself by inviting Bartleby to come live with him, but Bartleby declines the offer. Later the narrator returns to find that Bartleby has been forcibly removed and imprisoned in the Tombs. Finding Bartleby glummer than usual during a visit, the narrator bribes a turnkey to make sure he gets enough food. When the narrator returns a few days later to check on Bartleby, he has died of starvation, having preferred not to eat.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath {{and went up to}} the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that the summit of the mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E

I think we come off as a couple that has that has a genuine and deep connection. He <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> for me, but he's not impressed. I feel like we are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|E
500|$|Author Karina Longworth {{notes that}} despite her [...] "high level of stardom" [...] for decades, Streep {{has managed to}} {{maintain}} a relatively normal personal life. Streep lived with actor John Cazale for three years until his death from lung cancer in March 1978. Streep said of his death, [...] "I didn't get over it. I don't want to get over it. No matter what you do, the pain <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> in some recess of your mind, and it affects everything that happens afterwards. I think you can assimilate the pain and go on without making an obsession of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through", is {{a prayer}} to rock music, celebrating how it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> {{to help you}} through troubled times. One of its lyrics is [...] "You're never alone, 'cause you can put on the 'phones and let the drummer tell your heart what to do." [...] The fourth track also has dark overtones. [...] "It Just Won't Quit", Steinman explains, [...] "is {{about the fact that}} there are some things you never shake off... That's love, I guess." [...] "Out of the Frying Pan (And into the Fire)" [...] is a more upbeat song.|$|E

5000|$|Elegancegoes {{directly}} {{to the question of}} how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: Where did that creator come from? And where did his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>there,</b> then why not say that the laws of nature <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> and save a step? Carl Sagan ...|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{have seen}} the slime as {{symbolic}} of the Dragon Quest series {{in the same way}} that the Moogle represents Final Fantasy. Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii speculated that the popularity of the slime may come from its cuteness, how it is easy to defeat, and while the protagonists change in every Dragon Quest game, the slime <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there.</b> GamesRadar speculated that the intense [...] "grinding", or fighting of enemies in the Dragon Quest series exposed players to an abundance of slimes, but a positive association was created by their familiarity. Yoshiki Watabe, producer of , hypothesized its popularity came from it being a [...] "well designed character", but [...] "simple", being accessible to anyone.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jonathan Dakss Stone explained the album cover's concept, stating [...] "I wanted the flag to truly represent people of all colors. I wanted the color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. I wanted the color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there,</b> looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|E
500|$|On a Saturday night, Ned prays to God, but becomes {{angry when}} {{he feels he}} is not getting any response. The next morning, Ned is still angry and tells his sons {{he will not be}} going to church, scaring them. Guilt-ridden, he later rushes to church and upon entering, [...] sees a Christian rock band, Kovenant, performing. He is {{attracted}} to the singer, Rachel Jordan, who sings about not losing faith in God because he <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> for people. Inspired by the song, Ned later assists Rachel in loading some equipment onto her truck and confides in her of his loss, with which she sympathizes. He and Rachel become acquainted, but she has to leave for the next stop on the band's tour, promising to come back and meet up with him afterward.|$|E

500|$|Coates {{approaches}} Doggett in {{the fourth}} episode of season 4; Doggett responds {{in a manner that}} shows clearly that she is still affected by the rape. This is also the first time that Doggett openly refers to the incident as a 'rape'. Coates is seen to be visibly distressed by this. Towards the middle of the season, it is shown that Coates finally apologizes to Doggett and she, clearly surprised and relieved, forgives him and goes on to tell Big Boo about what happened. Big Boo, still furious about the rape, refuses to accept Doggett's decision, straining their friendship. In the twelfth episode of the season, Doggett explains to Big Boo the reasons why she decided to forgive Coates; [...] "Pain <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there...</b> but suffering is a choice". The two resume their friendship following this.|$|E
500|$|On {{existing}} in the MCU, {{specifically in the}} same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology {{of the universe is}} connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." [...] On references or [...] "easter eggs" [...] in the season, Rosenberg explained that [...] "A little <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> and in the writer’s room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they’re all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [...]" [...] She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a [...] "little something in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>there.</b> In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E
