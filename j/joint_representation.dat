40|$|Abstract-We {{consider}} “scale ” {{a physical}} attribute of a signal and develop its properties. We present an operator which represents scale and study its characteristics and representation. This {{allows one to}} define the scale transform and the energy scale density spectrum which {{is an indication of}} the intensity of scale values in a signal. We obtain explicit expressions for the mean scale, scale bandwidth, instantaneous scale, and scale group delay. Furthermore, we derive expressions for mean time, mean frequency, duration, frequency bandwidth in terms of the scale variable. The short-time transform is defined and used to obtain the conditional value of scale for a given time. We show that as the windows narrows one obtains instantaneous scale. Convolution and correlation theorems for scale are derived. A formulation is devised for studying linear scale-invariant systems. We derive <b>joint</b> <b>representations</b> of time-scale and frequency-scale. General classes for each are presented using the same methodology as for the time-frequency case. As special cases the joint distributions of Marinovich-Altes and Bertrand-Bertrand are recovered. Also, <b>joint</b> <b>representations</b> of the three quantities, time-frequency-scale are devised. A general expression for the local scale autocorrelation function is given. Uncertainty principles for scale and time and scale and frequency are derived. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{information}} {{in real world}} usually comes as different modalities. For example, images are usually associated with tags and text explanations; texts contain images to more clearly express the main idea of the article. Different modalities are characterized by very different statistical properties. For instance, images are usually represented as pixel intensities or outputs of feature extractors, while texts are represented as discrete word count vectors. Due to the distinct statistical properties of different information resources, {{it is very important}} to discover the relationship between different modalities. Multimodal learning is a good model to represent the joint representations of different modalities. The multimodal learning model is also capable to fill missing modality given the observed ones. The multimodal learning model combines two deep Boltzmann machines each corresponds to one modality. An additional hidden layer is placed on top of the two Boltzmann Machines to give the <b>joint</b> <b>representation.</b>|$|E

If the insured does not give an informed consent to continued representation, counsel must cease to represent both. Moreover, in the absence of such consent, where there are divergent interests of the insured and the insurer brought about by the insurer's reservation of rights based on possible noncoverage under the insurance policy, the insurer must pay the reasonable cost for hiring independent counsel by the insured. The insurer may not compel the insured to surrender control of the litigation ... Disregarding the common interests of both insured and insurer in finding total nonliability in the third party action, the remaining interests of the two diverge to such an extent as to create an actual, ethical conflict of interest warranting payment for the insureds' independent counsel.|$|E

30|$|The {{preceding}} methods {{only take}} one SAR image as the input signal {{to decide which}} class the target in the image belongs to. In practice, we can obtain multiple-view SAR images of the same physical target. Thus, some tried {{to make use of}} multiple-view SAR images under the theory framework of sparse representation. Exploring the sparse representation for the multiple input signals at the same time is a <b>joint</b> sparse <b>representation</b> problem [17, 18]. Therefore, Zhang et al.

5000|$|Of all {{the struggles}} made by Victor Ivan, {{the one he}} {{launched}} against Sarathnanda Silva, the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka (1999- 2009) which he aimed at safeguarding {{the independence of the}} judiciary is reckoned to be the most outstanding and daring struggle. The Ravaya once exposed a Magistrate who had been accused of raping a female respondent of a court case heard by him. Sarathnanda Silva, the Attorney General, adamantly maintained a rigid stand of safeguarding the accused when the Criminal Investigations Department had confirmed after investigations that the accused magistrate had actually committed the offence. Under the circumstance, Victor Ivan, began to delve into the character of the Attorney General himself on the presumption that he too, might be a corrupt person as much as the accused he was safeguarding. He was able to discover a good incident that revealed the corrupt nature of his character. When Sarath Nanda Silva {{was the head of the}} Court of Appeal, which was prior to his being appointed to the post of Attorney General, his legal wife had left him but not legally separated from him. During this time Sarath Nanda Silva lived with a mistress in his own house who happened to be the wife of a close friend of him. The husband of his mistress, a chemical engineer filed a case against his wife and Sarath Nanda Silva making both of them respondents seeking court approval to dissolve his marriage on account of the immoral behaviour of his wife with Sarath Nanda Silva [...] It came to light that the District Judge who heard this case had acted in favour of the Attorney General and in a manner which is oppressive to the chemical engineer and was contrary to the rule of law. The case record and the verdict of the judge amply manifested that the District Judge had been biased and acted as a puppet of the Attorney General. Victor Ivan exposed the true facts of this case accusing the magistrate and the Attorney General. At the same time he continued to voice against this rapist magistrate, the district Judge who chaired the case against Sarath Nanda Silva and Attorney general which ultimately resulted in the Chief Justice being compelled to appoint 2 tri partite committees to investigate into the allegations made against the magistrate and the district judge. The 2 committees found both of them guilty of the charges levelled against them by Victor Ivan. Apart from this, he filed a case in the Supreme Court against the Attorney General seeking his expulsion from the legal profession on the grounds of his corrupt behaviour. On the basis of his complaint, the Supreme Court initiated an investigation against the Attorney General. While the investigation was in progress, the incumbent Chief Justice went on retirement. Surprisingly, the President appointed Sarath Nanda Silva who had faced corruption charges as the New Chief justice. DatoParam Kumaraswamy of the UNO openly condemned this appointment. Sarath Nanda Silva was a close confidant of the President. The independent stand of the judiciary was not to her liking. She wanted to save her friend from the unfortunate mess he had fallen into and also to find a person like Sarath Nanda Silva whom she could manipulate in wielding her power over the judiciary.Victor Ivan making a vehement protest against this inapt appointment published the Ravaya newspaper as a Black Issue with a picture depicting the new Chief Justice taking the oath before the President overturned in black background. Thereafter, he submitted a fundamental rights petition challenging the appointment of the new Chief Justice. The International Bar association and the Law Commission of India making a <b>joint</b> <b>representation</b> sent V.S. Malimath, a retired Chief justice from Kerala to Sri Lanka to observe the proceedings of this historic trial’ The International Bar Association, in a report published in November 2001 on caption 'Sri Lanka: Failing to Protect the Rule of Law and the Independence of the Judiciary’ has given a comprehensive account of the illegal manner and ludicrous nature in which this inquiry was held. Victor Ivan, throughout the tenure of the new chief justice vehemently and persistently criticised all illegal actions and injustices that he committed in the arena of judiciary. Based on a comprehensive study of the telephone correspondences over a period of three months he was able to prove that the chief justice has had connections with the underworld. Based on the resultant crisis situation in the judiciary following the appointment of Sarath Nanda Silva as the chief justice, Victor Ivan published a book titled ‘Unfinished Struggle-For the Independence of the Judiciary’ while Sarath Nanda Silva was holding the post of Chief justice [...] Addressing the Second Global Conference of the Investigative Journalists held in Copenhagen from 2-4 May 2003, which he attended on invitation, Victor Ivan shared his experience of investigative journalism that he practised in regard to the judiciary of Sri Lanka and the legal battle he had to pursue in the process ...|$|E
