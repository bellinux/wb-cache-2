Having created an ideally perfect state, the philosopher proceeds to give an elaborate theory of the complex causes which produce revolutions of the moral effects of various forms of government and education, of the rise of the criminal classes and their connection with pauperism, and, in a word, to create history by the deductive method and to proceed from a priori psychological principles to discover the <b>governing</b> <b>laws</b> of the apparent chaos of political life.|$|E

The {{historical}} record of preliminary negotiations of oil contracts, oil filings, verdicts and judicial decisions about international {{oil and gas}} contracts would clearly indicate that {{the subject of the}} <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> has been considered to be the main role in negotiations of international oil and gas contracts in many cases. Furthermore, it has sometimes been the subject of dispute so that violation of the validity of the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> and misconception of it would result in insoluble consequences in oil filings. In addition to the investigation of the {{historical record}} of the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of international oil and gas contracts in Iran legislations, this paper would try to account for the subjects such as the mutual relationships of changes in the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> with the type of international oil and gas contracts, and the reasons for formation and increasing tendency toward lex petrolea as the applicable regulations regarding the disputes arising from such contracts. It would also attempt to study the role of regulations pertaining to public order and the mandatory rules of the host country in imposing the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> and accepting it on the behalf of oil companies, and also the role of the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> in establishing the contractual balance in the upstream oil and gas contracts in order to encourage the investing companies...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{issues surrounding}} {{the concept of}} the putative <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the contract by studying its role in establishing a void contract and personal unjust enrichment claims arising in the aftermath of voidness. Questions arising from a contract, such as whether the parties have fulfilled their mutual obligations, or the interpretation of certain terms used in the contract, are referred to the <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the contract. It is clear that the putative <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> needs to be accorded some role in any solution which prizes pragmatism and certainty in determining voidness. The three possible laws are the objectively determined <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the contract, the lexlocus transactionis and the lex fori. The lex fori is the law that is best suited to play this neutral role: its role can be justified logically and jurisprudentially {{as well as for the}} reasons of justice between the parties and expediency. Void contracts are an oxymoron. They are ‘contracts’ which do not exist; in other words, ‘contracts’ which are, in fact, not contracts at all. Void contracts give rise to some of the most demanding issues of choice of law as they yield logically intractable problems which have to be resolved by reference to putative factors and concepts. There are two parts of the equation when looking at choice of law for void contracts : first, establishing voidness; and secondly, the aftermath of voidness. The first initial question of which law determines whether a contract is void is generally answered by the putative <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the contract. 1 Once a contract is adjudged void, a claim that may be pursued in its aftermath is a personal unjust enrichment claim. The general choice of law rule in this area is also the putative <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the contract. 2 Thus, {{the concept of the}} putative <b>governing</b> <b>law</b> of the contract plays a central role in both parts of the equation where void contracts are concerned...|$|R

These states typically have very weak traditions of home rule, such that any significant legal change to a city or town's charter or <b>governing</b> <b>laws,</b> or an agreement between municipalities, must be authorized by an act of the legislature. There is usually a legal process by which a community may petition the legislature for such a change, and the outcome of this process, if the legislature consents, is special legislation.|$|E

Federal District Court has jurisdiction for arbitration conducted under FAA. The FAA is silent on the issue of punitive damages.b) Contract Names State Law: The arbitration will be conducted under the state law specified, unless parties agree otherwise. The state district court has jurisdiction for arbitration conducted under its arbitration act. Punitive damages vary according to state.c) Contract is Silent on Rules of Procedure: The arbitration will be conducted utilizing USADR’s Rules of Procedure.
