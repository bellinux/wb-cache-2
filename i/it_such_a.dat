5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned <b>it,</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E
5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office {{to learn of}} deals between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against <b>it.</b> <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Capello left debt-ridden Roma to {{sign with}} Juventus. His move came as a {{surprise}} because he had kept <b>it</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> secret, and because he had been engaged in a war of words with the Moggi family. One of Capello's first moves was to sign Emerson from Roma, further angering many of his critics who believed he had betrayed Roma. Capello's Juventus reached the quarter-finals of the 2004–05 and 2005–06 Champions Leagues before being eliminated by Liverpool and Arsenal respectively. Juventus also won the 2004–05 and 2005–06 Scudetti under Capello's leadership, but were later stripped off their trophies due to the team's involvement in the 2006 Serie A scandal.|$|E

During extraordinary sessions, state legislators can only act on subjects the governor recommends for consideration. When ever a vacancy occurs within the state legislature, the governor shall issue a writ of election to fill such vacancies. In case of a disagreement between the two houses of the legislature, at a regular or special session, the governor may adjourn them to such time as he shall deem proper, not beyond the day of the next stated meeting of the legislature. He or she may convoke the Oklahoma Legislature at or adjourn it to another place, when, in his opinion, the public safety or welfare, or the safety or health of the members require <b>it.</b> <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> change or adjournment must be concurred by two-thirds votes in all branches of the legislature.|$|E
25|$|A {{framework}} has {{a unique}} realization in d-dimensional space if every placement of the same graph with the same edge lengths is congruent to <b>it.</b> <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> framework must necessarily be rigid, because otherwise there exists a continuous motion bringing it to a non-congruent placement with the same edge lengths, but unique realizability is stronger than rigidity. For instance, the diamond graph (two triangles sharing an edge) is rigid in two dimensions, {{but it is not}} uniquely realizable because it has two different realizations, one in which the triangles are {{on opposite sides of the}} shared edge and one in which they are both on the same side. Uniquely realizable graphs are important in applications that involve reconstruction of shapes from distances, such as triangulation in land surveying, the determination of the positions of the nodes in a wireless sensor network, and the reconstruction of conformations of molecules via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|An {{equivalent}} formulation is {{that the}} edges of any n-vertex planar graph G may be subdivided into two edge-disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2 {{in such a way}} that both subgraphs have at least n/3 vertices and such that the intersection of the vertex sets of the two subgraphs has O(√n) vertices in <b>it.</b> <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> partition is known as a separation. If a separation is given, then the intersection of the vertex sets forms a separator, and the vertices that belong to one subgraph but not the other form the separated subsets of at most 2n/3 vertices. In the other direction, if one is given a partition into three sets A, S, and B that meet the conditions of the planar separator theorem, then one may form a separation in which the edges with an endpoint in A belong to G1, the edges with an endpoint in B belong to G2, and the remaining edges (with both endpoints in S) are partitioned arbitrarily.|$|E

Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content.|$|E
500|$|However, Ryan Book of Music Times, {{was less}} {{critical}} with his review: [...] " [...] {{took a break}} from colorful music videos {{to make a statement}} of racial relations... the song uses a less clear sample than the other tracks, but interpolates his words into the electronic breakdown {{at the end of the}} song". Marc Robisch of Thought Catalog felt that [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] is [...] "one of the most interesting out of any on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.", further adding that the outro of the song resembles the work of M.I.A.. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was mixed with his review, stating that the song [...] "is a jarring buzz kill – and that's what's appealing about L.A.M.B., even if <b>it</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> shallow celebration of fleeting style and outdated bling-bling culture, it can grate". [...] A review from Traxionary described [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] as [...] "a plea for interracial love–or the tolerant embrace of it–the central contention that [...] "beauty" [...] can be [...] "black or white/yellow or green"".

500|$|The {{majority}} of Sayyid {{believe they are}} one of the modern day descendants of Muhammad, and that they are therefore the descendants of Ishmael and his second son Qedar. Abu Ja'far al-Baqir (676–743 CE) wrote that his father Ali ibn Husayn informed him that Mohammed had said: [...] "The first whose tongue spoke in clear Arabic was Ishmael, when he was fourteen years old." [...] Hisham Ibn Muhammad al-Kalbi (737–819 CE) established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Mohammed using writings that drew on biblical and Palmyran sources, and the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs. His book, Jamharat al-Nasab ("The Abundance of Kinship"), seems to posit that the people known as [...] "Arabs" [...] are all descendants of Ishmael. Ibn Kathir (1301–1373) writes, [...] "All the Arabs of the Hijaz are descendants of Nebaioth and Qedar." [...] Medieval Jewish sources also usually identified Qedar with Arabs and/or Muslims. According to author and scholar Irfan Shahîd, Western scholars viewed this kind of [...] "genealogical Ishmaelism" [...] with suspicion, seeing it as, [...] a late Islamic fabrication because of the confusion in Islamic times which made <b>it</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> capacious term as to include the inhabitants of the south as well as the north of the Arabian Peninsula. But shorn of this extravagance, the concept is much more modest in its denotation, and in the sober sources it applies only to certain groups among the Arabs of pre-Islamic times. Some important statements to this effect were made by [...] Muhammed when he identified some Arabs as Ishmaelites and others as not. Ishmaelism in this more limited definition holds that Ishmael was both an important religious figure and eponymous ancestor for some of the Arabs of western Arabia. Prominence is given in Arab genealogical accounts to the first two of Ishmael's twelve sons, Nebaioth ( [...] , Nabīt) and Qedar ( [...] , Qaydār), who are also prominently featured in the Genesis account. It is likely that they and their tribes lived in northwestern Arabia and were historically the most important of the twelve Ishamelite tribes.|$|E

500|$|The mix of {{improvisation}} and R/funk elements {{is evident in}} [...] "Who Knows", which was the opening number for the second (after the brief [...] "Auld Lang Syne") and third shows. It is a loose jam rather than a structured song and during the performance for second show Hendrix teases the audience with [...] "I hope you don't mind us jamming a little bit, we're just messing around... seeing what we're gonna play next". [...] Built on Hendrix's guitar figure, [...] "Who Knows" [...] is framed by Cox's economical funk-blues bass line and Miles' steady drum beat, which Murray describes as [...] "a thick, lazy twitch". [...] Hendrix explores guitar phrases using different tones and effects between vocal sections. [...] According to Cox, Hendrix used a new combination of effects for the first time. [...] These included a Uni-Vibe phase shifter, an Octavia harmonizer (developed for him by Roger Mayer during the recording of his first album), a Fuzz Face distortion box, and a wah-wah pedal. [...] One mixture of them produces a [...] "whistling, shimmering, ring-modulated tone so rich with upper harmonics" [...] in the higher range, while in the lower range [...] "it almost sounds like 'Froggy Went a-Courtin''... all these [...] oct-intervals give <b>it</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> dramatic effect". [...] His use of the wah-wah employs [...] "rapid foot movement and wide sweeps [...] tend to make the melody fade in and out". [...] Also, by using a triplet rhythm with the pedal, a polyrhythm with the prevailing 4/4 beat is created. [...] The lyrics, some which borrow from other R songs, are also improvised and show considerable {{differences between the two}} renditions. [...] As it unfolds, there is an R vocal call and response section between Hendrix and Miles, then separate vocal sections for each, which Miles follows with scat singing. [...] During the middle section, most of the instrumentation drops out and returns with more Hendrix guitar tonal explorations before winding down at 8:23 (second show) and 9:32 (third show). [...] While McDermott feels that the jam is underdeveloped and biographer Harry Shapiro criticizes Miles' vocals, Shadwick and writer David Henderson focus on the [...] "easy groove" [...] and [...] "lilting flow". [...] Besides adding a fresh rhythmic element to his music, it also gives Hendrix more room to experiment with different approaches and sounds on guitar.|$|E

2500|$|Readers {{and audiences}} have {{interpreted}} the play’s attitude to warfare {{in several different}} ways.

2500|$|By the Norman conquest, London had {{overtaken}} Winchester as {{the largest}} city in England, {{due in part to}} Alfred the Great's investments in infrastructure, and after the Norman Conquest, King William I made it his capital.
