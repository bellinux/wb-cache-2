40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method of {{measuring}} {{the degree of}} currency misalignment {{through the use of}} offshore <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. Using default risk adjusted no-arbitrage conditions for <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> contracts, we calculate the spot exchange rates and the domestic interest rates that are implied from the observed <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. The difference between the implied and the observed spot exchange rates is our measure of currency misalignment. Our methodology is based on the presumption that, during a currency crisis, offshore <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> rates reflect market fundamentals more closely than onshore spot and <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. The latter are usually tightly regulated and heavily affected by government intervention during a non-normal event such as a financial crisis.

The paper deals with imperfect asset substitutability, the peculiarities of fixed exchange rates, {{and the impact of}} speculation in <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> markets. Whereas covered interest parity always holds in the cambist view, with the causality running from differentials in interest rates to differentials between the forward and the spot rates, a graphical analysis is provided to illustrate how the current spot rate may be influenced by the interest rate differential.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the uncovered interest parity assumption. It traces the history of the interest parity concept, summarizes evidence on the empirical validity of uncovered interest parity, and discusses different interpretations of the evidence and the implications for macroeconomic analysis. The uncovered interest parity assumption has been an important building block in multiperiod models of open economies, and although its validity is strongly challenged by the empirical evidence, at least at short time horizons, its retention in macroeconomic models is supported on pragmatic grounds by the lack of much empirical support for existing models of the exchange risk premium.

Dynamic forecasts indicate that the information in the forward premia can be used to reduce the root mean squared forecast error for the spot rate (relative to a random walk forecast) by at least 33 % at a six-month horizon and by between 50 % and 90 % at a one-year horizon.

40|$|In this research, monthly <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> {{rates are}} {{evaluated}} for possible existence of time varying risk premia in Singapore <b>forward</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> rates against US dollar. The time varying risk premia in Singapore dollar is modeled using non-Gaussian signal plus noise models that encompass non-normality and time varying volatility. The results from signal plus noise models show statistically significant evidence of time varying risk premium in Singapore <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> rates although {{we failed to}} reject the hypotheses of no risk premium in the series. The results from Gaussian versions of these models are not much different and {{are in line with}} Wolff (1987) who also used the same methodology in Gaussian settings. Our results show statistically significant evidence of volatility clustering in Singapore <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. The results from Gaussian signal plus noise models also show statistically significant evidence of volatility clustering and non-normality in Singapore <b>forward</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> rates. Additional tests on the series show that exclusion of conditional heteroskedasticity from the signal plus noise models leads to false statistical inferences. <b>Forward</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> rates, non-normality, risk premium, spot foreign exchange rates, signal extraction, volatility persistence...|$|R
