5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> her father were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven {{he is going to}} be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E
5|$|According to the saga, {{sometime}} after Haraldr Gille's victory over Magnús Sigurðarson, Earl Rögnvaldr's father, Kolr, sent messengers to Earl Páll, demanding that Earl Páll {{hand over the}} lands which the Norwegian king had granted to Earl Rögnvaldr. When Earl Páll refused this, Kolr's messengers proceeded to Caithness, where Frakökk lived. The messengers related to Frakökk of Kolr's proposal—that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Ölvir were to defeat Earl Páll, half of the earldom would be theirs. Frakökk agreed to the plan, saying that she would attack in mid-summer; she promised that during upcoming winter she would gather forces from her kinsmen, friends, and connections in Scotland and the Suðreyjar for the task. The next winter Earl Rögnvaldr {{and two of his}} chiefs, Sölmundr and Jón, gathered a force of men and about five or six ships for their expedition. The following summer their forces sailed from Norway to Shetland, where they were well received by the local bondsmen. Meanwhile, Frakökk and Ölvir assembled a small fleet of twelve ships in the Suðreyjar—although the saga describes the ships as small and poorly manned. At the middle of summer, Frakökk and Ölvir sailed for Orkney to fulfil their pledge of wresting the earldom from Earl Páll.|$|E

25|$|On August 8, 1969, Tate was {{two weeks}} from giving birth. She entertained two friends, actresses Joanna Pettet and Barbara Lewis, for lunch at her home, confiding in them her {{disappointment}} at Polanski's delay in returning from London. That afternoon, Polanski telephoned her as did her younger sister, Debra, who called to ask <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> their sister, Patti, could {{spend the night with}} her. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, Tate dined at her favorite restaurant, El Coyote, with Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski and Abigail Folger, returning at about 10:30p.m.|$|E

Leopold was too purely a politician not to be secretly pleased at {{the destruction of the}} power of France and of her influence in Europe by her internal disorders. Within six weeks of his accession, he displayed his contempt for France's weakness by practically tearing up the treaty of alliance made by Maria Theresa in 1756 and opening negotiations with Great Britain to impose a check on Russia and Prussia.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{relies on}} two {{properties}} of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated {{in the sense}} that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict <b>if</b> <b>she</b> (<b>and</b> thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.|$|E
25|$|Joe is demoted {{to private}} and {{locked in the}} stockade for {{allowing}} his prisoner to escape. Cindy Lou arrives for a visit just as a rose from Carmen is delivered to him, prompting her to leave abruptly. Having found work in a Louisiana nightclub, Carmen awaits his release. One night champion prizefighter Husky Miller enters with an entourage and introduces himself to Carmen, who expresses no interest in him. Husky orders his manager Rum Daniels to offer her jewelry, furs, and an expensive hotel suite <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> her friends Frankie and Myrt accompany him to Chicago, but she declines the offer. Just then, Joe arrives and announces he must report to flying school immediately. Angered, Carmen decides to leave with Sgt. Brown, who also has appeared on the scene, and Joe severely beats him. Realizing he will be sentenced to a long prison term for hitting his superior, Joe flees to Chicago with Carmen.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Don Carlos Hugo posed as a Francoist; his {{supporters}} pursued {{a policy of}} approaching the Falangist syndicalists, attempting to firmly mount the prince in political milieu of the regime and to enhance his chances of becoming a Francoist monarch in the future. When executing the strategy they tried to engage Carlists well adapted within the regime. It is not clear why Arellano, member of Don Juan’s private council and a leading Carlist Juanista, fell into this trap. During the 1963 Sanfermines he agreed to host Princess Irene in what was a carefully planned hugocarlista plot. The event was staged as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Don Carlos Hugo had first met there, a romantic gloom envisioned as a marketing trick to attract attention of national media. The maneuver was repeated in 1964, again with Arellano engaged. Following running of the bulls - with Don Carlos Hugo {{taking part in a}} carefully arranged publicity stunt – Arellano attended an evening cocktail party to honor the prince. However, events got out of control; young hugocarlistas, unaware of the plot, assaulted Arellano in the Tres Reyes hotel lobby, which terminated his brief rapprochement with the Javieristas.|$|E

[...] She added that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. [...] "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Cortana is {{constructed}} from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, {{the creator of}} the SPARTAN Project; Halsey's synaptic networks became the basis for Cortana's processors. According to the Halo novels, Cortana is classified as a [...] "smart" [...] AI, meaning that her creative matrix is allowed to expand, in contrast to the limited matrix of other [...] "dumb" [...] AI characters in the stories. This ability allows Cortana to learn and adapt beyond her basic parameters, but at the cost of a limited [...] "lifespan" [...] of only seven years; eventually, she will fall to rampancy, a terminal state of being for Artificial intelligence constructs, in which the AI [...] "develops delusions of godlike power", as well as utter contempt for its mentally inferior makers. Rampant AI normally cannot return to their previous state and must be destroyed before they harm themselves and others around them, but Cortana could be saved <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> the Master Chief can get back to Dr. Halsey on Earth; because she was created using the living tissue of Dr. Halsey.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Lee asks Michael {{about his}} latest {{experience}} with the [...] "green reality". At a police carnival at an amusement park, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla), Rex's girlfriend, asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Rex can bungee jump. As they are walking to the ride, Michael bumps into someone who claims {{that it was his}} fault. At the ride, Michael goes first, but the person in charge of the ride seems concerned about something; Michael passes out and wakes up in the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah is alive, but Rex is dead), as if the [...] "green reality" [...] were a dream. In the [...] "red reality", Dr. Lee says it is progress, that Michael is trying to tell himself that his son is dead and that he {{is on the verge of}} a breakthrough. Shortly after getting into his car, Michael suddenly sees the man who he bumped into at the amusement park. Michael sees the mystery man several more times throughout the episode and it becomes more clear the man is only a hallucination.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} {{on the first}} leg of his HIStory World Tour on September 1996. One month into the tour and several months after his divorce from Presley, Jackson's personal life made headlines as it was revealed that Debbie Rowe was pregnant with his child. One tabloid newspaper, the News of the World, told the story under the headline [...] "I'm Having Michael's Baby". Rowe reacted furiously to the publication, labeling the editorial staff [...] "bastards" [...] and complaining that they reported the story as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Jackson were freaks. J. Randy Taraborrelli later noted that the article, which had been put together from a secret tape recording between Rowe and a friend, had been fairly accurate. It detailed that Jackson was the father of the baby and that he would be raising the child alone. It also stated that Jackson impregnated Rowe artificially with his own sperm cells, a [...] "foolproof" [...] method of insemination. Further reports alleged that the relationship was an [...] "economic" [...] one; she was {{in it for the money}} and he sought a baby.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season episode [...] "Duets", she asks Santana to be her partner for the duet {{competition}} while they are making out. Santana rejects her, so Brittany attempts to make her jealous by dating fellow glee club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale). She sleeps with Artie, but Santana tells him that Brittany was just using him for his voice, so he breaks up with her, to Brittany's dismay. Brittany's relationship with Artie continues to develop; in [...] "Never Been Kissed", he gets her {{to go out with}} him again. As of [...] "Furt", they are officially dating. In [...] "Sexy", following her performance of [...] "Landslide" [...] with Santana and Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), Santana admits her true feelings for Brittany. Although Santana fears being ostracized by the McKinley High student body for being in a same-sex relationship, she confesses her romantic love to Brittany, feelings which are reciprocated. However, Brittany states that she loves Artie too, and would never do anything to hurt him, even if it means not being able to be with Santana. She says that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Artie ever break up, she would be Santana's, proudly so.|$|E

500|$|While Susie's {{addition}} helps The Fabulous Baker Boys experience success, it also {{results in}} complications {{among the group}} by disturbing some of the original act's traditions and threatening to come between the two brothers when Jack begins {{to fall in love}} with her. Susie and Jack's growing mutual attraction towards each other eventually threatens the stability of the trio. Having a family of his own, Frank is particularly concerned that if his younger brother Jack pursues Susie he will ultimately disregard her and cause her to leave the group, while Susie insists that she deserves a say in determining what songs the trio will perform, particularly lamenting that she is forced to sing [...] "Feelings" [...] at every scheduled performance. When Frank is pulled away from work for a family emergency around New Year's Eve, Susie and Jack seize the opportunity to make adjustments to their set list and ultimately make love in a late night jazz club after performing alone together. Frank is furious to learn that Susie and Jack have changed the set list without his permission and an argument ensues between Jack and Frank. Susie eventually leaves both the group and Jack due to Jack's refusal to express his true feelings for her, accepting a job singing jingles for television commercials. After mending his relationship with Frank, Susie receives a visit from Jack who apologizes for his behavior towards her; Susie does not clarify <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Jack will rekindle their romance before walking away.|$|E
500|$|The Ozians are cheering at {{the news}} that the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, is dead ("No One Mourns the Wicked"). Glinda arrives and an Ozian asks her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Elphaba were friends. She admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. She also tells them her name was Galinda before she changed it. A {{flashback}} starts with a scene in a school, Shiz, where Elphaba arrives. Elphaba was the daughter of the governor of Munchkinland - but it is heavily implied that she is the product of an affair between the governor's wife and a mysterious stranger and his bottle of [...] "green elixir." [...] Elphaba was born with green skin as a result. Her father despised her and showered his affection on her younger sister, Nessarose, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair. The two sisters both go to Shiz University, where the pretty and popular Galinda is also in their class ("Dear Old Shiz"). As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of silver slippers. The headmistress, Madame Morrible, decides to take Nessarose under her protection, despite Elphaba's objections, now without a roommate and ends up with Galinda, to the disgust of both. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister as she is wheeled away, and her frustration manifests itself physically in an explosion. Madame Morrible recognizes that she has special powers and decides to teach her sorcery - and to teach no one else, even though Galinda had her heart set on studying magic at school. She even tells Elphaba that her powers might allow her to work with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, something which Elphaba has dreamed of ("The Wizard and I").|$|E

A light novel titled Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze, written by Tomohito Osaki and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on Sakura sometime after the events of The Last: Naruto the Movie, where she, now a celebrated medical ninja who {{is in the middle of}} opening a new mental clinic with Ino, becomes worried when a conspiracy that threatens to destroy Konoha is using Sasuke as a scapegoat, potentially ruining his chance at redemption amongst the villagers. Sasuke's travels keep him away from their daughter, his whereabouts becoming a touchy subject for Sakura who insists over the years that Sasuke will return home once having completed his mission. After punching the ground in a fit of rage over Sarada asking <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Sasuke are married, Sakura wakes up to discover her daughter has left the village in search of Sasuke. By the time she catches up to the two, they are in the presence of Shin Uchiha, whom Sakura attacks and in doing so is teleported away with him to his hideout where she declines to assist him with her medical skills and pretends to be helpless in order to gain information on him. As soon as she is rescued by her husband, they return to the village after Shin's defeat. Soon after that, Sakura and Sarada see Sasuke off to his journey. Sakura later serves as a spectator for Sarada while she participates in the Chunin Exams and saves both herself and other onlookers from falling debris, afterward healing Hinata.|$|E
