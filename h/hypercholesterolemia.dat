5|$|Alirocumab and evolocumab, both {{monoclonal}} antibodies against PCSK9, {{are specifically}} indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy {{for the treatment}} of adults with heterozygous familial <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b> Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soluble epoxide {{hydrolase}} (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide hydrolase family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate phosphatase activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with familial <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit {{is derived from}} a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{abnormalities}} are in {{some cases}} completely responsible for <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> such as in familial <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> where one or more genetic mutations in the autosomal dominant APOB gene exist, the autosomal recessive LDLRAP1 gene, autosomal dominant familial <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> (HCHOLA3) variant of the PCSK9 gene, or the LDL receptor gene. Familial <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> affects about one in five hundred people.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitors, called statins, was {{a breakthrough in}} the prevention of <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> and related diseases. <b>Hypercholesterolemia</b> is considered {{to be one of the}} major risk factors for atherosclerosis which often leads to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases.|$|E
25|$|Various {{clinical}} practice guidelines {{have addressed the}} treatment of <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|LDL apheresis – {{removal of}} low density {{lipoprotein}} {{in patients with}} familial <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> lead to {{specific}} physical findings. For example, familial <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> (Type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia) {{may be associated}} with xanthelasma palpebrarum (yellowish patches underneath the skin around the eyelids), arcus senilis (white or gray discoloration of the peripheral cornea), and xanthomata (deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material) of the tendons, especially of the fingers. Type III hyperlipidemia {{may be associated with}} xanthomata of the palms, knees and elbows.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercholesterolemia</b> is {{typically}} {{due to a}} combination of environmental and genetic factors. Environmental factors include obesity, diet, and stress.|$|E
25|$|Among {{people whose}} life {{expectancy}} is relatively short, <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> is not {{a risk factor for}} death by any cause including coronary heart disease. Among people older than 70, <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> is not a risk factor for being hospitalized with myocardial infarction or angina. There are also increased risks in people older than 85 in the use of statin drugs. Because of this, medications which lower lipid levels should not be routinely used among people with limited life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercholesterolemia</b> {{may be a}} {{side effect}} of a number of {{medications}} including blood pressure medication, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressives, human immunodeficiency virus therapy, and interferons.|$|E
25|$|Statins {{may be less}} {{effective}} in reducing LDL cholesterol in people with familial <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> especially those with homozygous deficiencies. These people have defects usually in either the LDL receptor or apolipoprotein B genes, {{both of which are}} responsible for LDL clearance from the blood. Statins are still first line treatments in familial <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> although other cholesterol-reducing measures may be required. In people with homozygous deficiencies, statins may still prove helpful, albeit at high doses and in combination with other cholesterol-reducing medications.|$|E
25|$|Avoiding {{trans fats}} and {{replacing}} saturated fats in adult diets with polyunsaturated fats are recommended dietary measures to reduce total blood cholesterol and LDL in adults. In people with very high cholesterol (e.g. familial <b>hypercholesterolemia),</b> diet {{is often not}} sufficient to achieve the desired lowering of LDL, and lipid-lowering medications are usually required. If necessary, other treatments such as LDL apheresis or even surgery (for particularly severe subtypes of familial <b>hypercholesterolemia)</b> are performed. About 34 million adults in the United States have high blood cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Avogadro, Crepaldi and {{coworkers}} described six moderately obese patients with diabetes, <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> and marked hypertriglyceridemia, {{all of which}} improved when the patients were put on a hypocaloric, low-carbohydrate diet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercholesterolemia</b> (heterozygous {{familial}} and nonfamilial) {{and mixed}} dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb) to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, apo-B, triglycerides levels, and CRP {{as well as}} increase HDL levels.|$|E
25|$|Interactions with clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, {{which are}} fibrates used in {{accessory}} therapy {{in many forms}} of <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> usually in combination with statins, {{increase the risk of}} myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercholesterolemia,</b> {{also called}} high cholesterol, is the {{presence}} of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is a form of high blood lipids and hyperlipoproteinemia (elevated levels of lipoproteins in the blood).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{rosuvastatin}} on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious {{in improving the}} lipid profile of patients with <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.|$|E
25|$|Cereal β-glucans from oat, barley, wheat, and rye {{induce a}} variety of {{physiological}} effects that positively impact health. Barley and oat β-glucans have been studied for their effects on blood glucose regulation in test subjects with <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rosuvastatin is {{approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of high LDL cholesterol (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (<b>hypercholesterolemia),</b> and/or triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia). In February 2010, rosuvastatin was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} statins {{are effective}} at reducing cholesterol levels {{in those with}} familial <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b> Their long term safety is, however, unclear. Some recommend that if lifestyle changes are not enough statins should be started at 8 years old.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} of {{medications}} including gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus, hirsutism (excessive hair growth in a male-pattern distribution) with ciclosporin, hair loss with tacrolimus, obesity, acne, diabetes mellitus type 2, <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> and osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} non-HDL {{cholesterol}} and LDL {{in the blood}} may be a consequence of diet, obesity, inherited (genetic) diseases (such as LDL receptor mutations in familial <b>hypercholesterolemia),</b> or {{the presence of other}} diseases such as diabetes and an underactive thyroid.|$|E
25|$|Lovastatin (Merck's Mevacor) is a statin drug, {{used for}} {{lowering}} cholesterol {{in those with}} <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. Lovastatin is a naturally occurring compound found in low concentrations in food such as oyster mushrooms, red yeast rice, and Pu-erh.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} (≥20% occurrence, {{leading to a}} 11% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies {{for the treatment of}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis are: peripheral edema, <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, stomatitis, nasopharyngitis, acne, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, and myalgia.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} (≥30% occurrence, {{leading to a}} 5% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies of organ rejection prophylaxis in individuals with kidney transplants include: peripheral edema, <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, constipation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, increased creatinine, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia.|$|E
25|$|The National Lipid Association {{recommends}} {{that people with}} familial <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> restrict intakes of total fat to 25–35% of energy intake, saturated fat to less than 7% of energy intake, and cholesterol to less than 200mg per day. Changes in total fat intake in low calorie diets {{do not appear to}} affect blood cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{increase}} cholesterol LDL {{production by}} increasing production and activity of HMG-CoA reductase. These include the physiologic stress hormone cortisol and commonly used medicines for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or connective tissue disorders. Other steroid hormones and drugs are also implicated. In contrast, the thyroid hormone decreases cholesterol production. Hence, hypothyroidism (lack of thyroid hormone) causes <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of a class-action lawsuit and {{community}} settlement with DuPont, three epidemiologists conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that there was probably an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes: kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> (high cholesterol), and pregnancy-induced hypertension.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} most {{immunosuppressive}} regimens is prednisolone, a corticosteroid. Prednisolone suppresses the immune system, but its long-term use at high doses causes {{a multitude of}} side effects, including glucose intolerance and diabetes, weight gain, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> and cataract formation. Prednisolone alone is usually inadequate to prevent rejection of a transplanted kidney. Thus other, non-steroid immunosuppressive agents are needed, which also allow lower doses of prednisolone.|$|E
25|$|Diet has {{an effect}} on blood {{cholesterol}}, but the size of this effect varies between individuals. Moreover, when dietary cholesterol intake goes down, production (principally by the liver) typically increases, so that blood cholesterol changes can be modest or even elevated. This compensatory response may explain <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> in anorexia. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that dietary cholesterol is associated with higher blood cholesterol. Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. LDL and total cholesterol also increases by very high fructose intake.|$|E
25|$|Any {{inflammatory}} process, such as trauma, {{surgery or}} infection, can cause {{damage to the}} endothelial lining of the vessel's wall. The main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system. Inflammatory and other stimuli (such as <b>hypercholesterolemia)</b> can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state. When this occurs, endothelial cells downregulate substances such as thrombomodulin, which is a key modulator of thrombin activity. The end result is a sustained activation of thrombin and reduced production of protein C and tissue factor inhibitor, which furthers the pro-thrombotic state.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood sample}} after 12-hour fasting is {{taken by a}} doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to {{determine}} a lipoprotein profile. This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2mmol/L or more (200+mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL (good) cholesterol less than 1mmol/L (40mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> and cigarette smoking.|$|E
