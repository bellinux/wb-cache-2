The scope of the project is envisaged that the project is in complete functional compliance to the presently manually performed functions and also to provide for recommended future expansions. Further, this system can be directly implemented to be a more complete (integrated) product by providing access facilities through the web. Target group of members for the system are applicants, registrar, evaluation officer, other colleges and any other general users. Inputs for the system are problems the problems in existing system.

It does not exclude the possibility of academic selection at age 11 through the 11 Plus exam, whereupon pupils may proceed to the grammar school system on completion of primary education or carry on to other secondary schools.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{reliability}} and validity of faculty evaluations of medicine residents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study (2004 – 2012) involving 228 internal medicine residency graduates at the Medical College of Wisconsin who were evaluated by 334 attendings. Measures included evaluations of residents by attendings, based on six competencies and interns and residents’ performance on the American Board of <b>Internal</b> Medicine certification <b>exam</b> and annual in-service training examination. All residents had at least one in-service training examination result and 80 % allowed the American Board of Internal Medicine to release their scores. Results: Attending evaluations had good consistency (Cronbach’s α[*]=[*] 0. 96). There was poor construct validity with modest inter-rater reliability and evidence that attendings were rating residents on a single factor rather than the six competencies intended to be measured. There was poor predictive validity as attending ratings correlated weakly with performance on the in-service training examination or American Board of <b>Internal</b> Medicine certification <b>exam.</b> Conclusion: We conclude that attending evaluations are poor measures for assessing progress toward competency. It may be time to move beyond evaluations that rely on global, end-of-rotation appraisals...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This thesis {{analyzes}} the Crowd-Labor phenomenon, {{a subset of}} the Crowdsourcing industry where users of the related online platforms post tasks/projects and other users work on those tasks, usually in exchange for a payment. This work documents the current status of the platforms operating in this industry, providing new information regarding the numbers and trends. Its second objective is to understand how those companies are organized, what features they possess and how those features are related across different types of platforms. Methodology: Data collection regarding seventy-seven (77) characteristics from fifty-one (51) platforms. The characteristics are about the platforms themselves, their operations and the features they offer to their users. That was followed by an analysis of the data, and a grouping of certain related characteristics (for example, the sum of the number of available languages on the platform) and a correlation analysis to understand which types of platforms exist and what kind of platforms obtain that best performance. Findings: The analysis revealed that there are clusters of platforms based on the type of tasks/projects available on those platforms. Industry characteristics related with performance were analyzed, namely the existence of a forum, APIs, open challenges, the possibility of login & register using Facebook, fix payment fees for contractors, a leaderboard, the existence of multiple languages, <b>internal</b> <b>exams</b> for contractors to get certifications, tracking quality mechanisms and the possibility of project owners only paying when satisfied. Automated features (APIs and internal exams/certifications) stood out as a new positive performance differentiator for this recent industry, which is an original literature contribution originated from this thesis. Practical use: This work presents {{the current state of the}} Crowd-Labor industry, its benchmarks or industry standards, users’ motivations and a fact based opinion regarding its future, creating new knowledge that could be particularly useful for researchers, academics, crowdsourcing initiative owners, crowd-Labor users, entrepreneurs and investors. Limitations: An important limitation is that some of the answers to the characteristics used to analyze the Crowd-Labor Platforms were not made public by the platform owners, which didn’t make possible to capture the full picture of some of these platforms. However by studying 51 platforms, the collected data offers statistical evidence in the form of correlations that are statistically significant, which support the conclusions drawn from the analysis...|$|R

This study evaluated Internal Medicine residents׳ overall perceptions of the OSCE as a formative assessment tool. It focused on residents׳ perceptions of the OSCE stations׳ attributes, determined the acceptability of the process, and provided feedback to enhance further development of the assessment tool. The main objective was to assess Internal Medicine resident test-takers׳ perceptions and acceptance of the OSCE, and to identify its strengths and weaknesses through their feedback. Sixty six residents were involved in the studied administered on November 8 th 2012 at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Overall, resident׳s evaluation of the OSCE was favorable and encouraging. To this end, we recommend that formative assessment opportunities using the OSCE for providing feedback to students {{should be included in the}} curriculum, and continuing refinement and localized adaptation of OSCEs in use should be pursued by course directors and assessment personnel...|$|R
