50|$|European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<b>ECWVTA),</b> {{currently}} this applies to passenger cars. On the 29th October 2012, <b>ECWVTA</b> {{was extended to}} cover all new road vehicles and their trailers.|$|E
50|$|EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval (also called Pan European Type Approval) is {{to prevent}} trade barriers, {{and at the same}} time {{guarantee}} the level of safety and restricted environmental influence of a vehicle. Thanks to that, the car can be registered in each European member state without additional national tests or approval. This harmonisation results in reduced costs and lead time for the manufacturer, importer as well as the consumer. Mandatory compliance date for <b>ECWVTA</b> for M1 vehicles was 2009-04-29. However cars that already have an <b>ECWVTA</b> but are imported from non EC countries often need to be re-approved when entering the EC.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{the second}} {{generation}} Enviro200 received a facelift {{in order to allow}} the type to comply with European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<b>ECWVTA)</b> regulations. Some of the major external changes included the introduction of white LED daytime running lights below the headlights, the relocation of the offside emergency door, redesigned front and rear bumpers and the introduction of several new Enviro200 lengths.|$|E
50|$|Usually volume {{manufacturers}} {{provide a}} European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<b>ECWVTA)</b> whilst niche makers {{can use the}} European Union Small Series Type Approval (ECSSTA) that allows registration in any EC country (although local modification may be required. Different local rules apply in different EC countries: for example most of Europe drives on the right, so headlights must dip right, but {{the reverse is true}} for the United Kingdom and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Minibikes are not {{manufactured}} to {{meet these}} requirements, and {{would need to be}} modified significantly to do so. Reported instances of this occurring are incredibly rare, meaning that it is very unlikely that minibikes can actually be registered for road use. However, where a minibike or other vehicle does not have <b>ECWVTA,</b> it might conceivably pass a Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval (MSVA) inspection which would result in a Ministerial Certificate of Approval, permitting it to be road-registered.|$|E
5000|$|European Community Whole Vehicle Approval (ECWVA) is {{a single}} EC-wide Certificate of Conformity for volume {{manufacturers}} producing any number of similar vehicle types or products each year, who can then sell their wares via authorized agents in any EC country without further testing. The <b>ECWVTA</b> is integrated with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe agreement of 1998 concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles in diverse non-EC countries including, for instance, Russia and South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, it {{is illegal}} for minibikes to be ridden on public roads or {{off-road}} on public land. The only places these types of vehicle may be ridden are purpose-built race tracks and privately owned land with the owner's permission (and where they do not cause harassment, alarm or distress). All of these minibikes are regarded as [...] "motor vehicles" [...] as defined by section 185 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and so to be ridden on the public road, a motor vehicle must comply with all aspects of road traffic law and meet the mandatory European construction requirements by having a [...] "Certificate of Conformity" [...] indicating that they have European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<b>ECWVTA).</b>|$|E
