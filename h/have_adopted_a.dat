5|$|In mid-September 2008, after {{protracted}} negotiations {{overseen by}} the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal which would see Mugabe retain control over the army. Donor nations <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> 'wait-and-see' attitude, wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts, which are estimated {{to take at least}} five years. On 11 February 2009 Tsvangirai was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Mugabe.|$|E
5|$|SBASE, {{along with}} the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> zero {{tolerance}} policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400â€“6000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often being made to clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, a 777-style interior, {{known as}} the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior {{features}} even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> simpler modification {{known as the}} Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. Falun Gong communities inside and outside China <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> variety of approaches to resist and mitigate the persecution in China. These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} piecemeal amendments {{have been}} added in response to federal developments. Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session now may be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime. Since 1996 Virginia and other states <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> provision protecting {{the right of the}} people to hunt, fish and harvest game.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> {{range of}} {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays {{a batch of}} eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E
5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} off-limits to outsiders. Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled down, some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, {{is the leader of the}} group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance {{and has been}} studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E

25|$|Discarding is {{a problem}} in all fisheries, and nations <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> number of {{measures}} to deal with the issue.

25|$|More broadly, {{the term}} Sephardim has today {{also come to}} refer to {{traditionally}} Eastern Jewish communities of West Asia and beyond who, although not having genealogical roots in the Jewish communities of Iberia, <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> Sephardic style of liturgy and Sephardic law and customs imparted {{to them by the}} Iberian Jewish exiles {{over the course of the}} last few centuries.

25|$|An additional, though smaller, {{number of}} Bulgarian Muslims, {{also from the}} Central and Eastern Rhodopes, have {{converted}} into Orthodox Christianity or <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> Christian identity since 1990. The process of conversion has affected mostly Muslim Bulgarians living among or next to ethnic Turks, i.e. the regions of Nedelino, Kirkovo, Zlatograd and Krumovgrad. In some cases, the conversion has affected whole villages, which <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> Christian Bulgarian identity, {{as in the case}} of Zabardo in the Chepelare Municipality or the younger generations in a village, as in the case with the village of Pripek in the Dzhebel Municipality. Bulgarian and Christian names are common, even among those who do not espouse a Christian identity, in particular, in the Eastern Rhodopes. For example, only one-third of the Muslim Bulgarian population of the region of Kirkovo, mostly people aged over 60, have Muslim names. Another tendency in the last years is for younger people to restore their Bulgarian names for the purpose of working abroad or studying in the country, as in the village of Varbina in the Municipality of Madan where 475 out of 1,160 residents have recently changed their names to Bulgarian and Christian ones.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the wide scientific acceptance {{of the theory of}} evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists (Fisher, Dobzhansky) whose work confirmed Darwin's theory, were also Christians who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> theistic evolution viewpoint, where God provides a divine spark that ignited the process of evolution and (or), where God has guided evolution in one way or another.|$|E
25|$|At Vespers and Matins, {{different}} kathismata {{are read}} {{at different times}} of the liturgical year and on different days of the week, according to the Church's calendar, so that all 150 psalms (20 kathismata) are read {{in the course of a}} week. During Great Lent, the number of kathismata is increased so that the entire Psalter is read twice a week. In the twentieth century, some lay Christians <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> continuous reading of the Psalms on weekdays, praying the whole book in four weeks.|$|E
