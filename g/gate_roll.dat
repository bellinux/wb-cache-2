50|$|The hills are the {{location}} of affluent suburban communities and cities together known as Palos Verdes, and include Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, <b>gated</b> <b>Rolling</b> Hills, and Rolling Hills Estates.|$|R
60|$|After {{considerable}} parleying he {{consented to}} admit {{them to the}} city, {{and a moment later}} the wheel-like <b>gate</b> <b>rolled</b> back within its niche, and Thuvia and Carthoris entered the city of Lothar.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the heads}} had all bobbed down and {{disappeared}} behind the walls, {{so there was}} no answer. They waited a long time before the <b>gate</b> <b>rolled</b> back with a rumbling sound, and a loud voice cried, [...] "Enter!" [...] But they lost no time in taking advantage of the invitation.|$|R
6000|$|Then my {{lips and}} eyes were sealed with silence and with darkness, so that I was dumb and blind. The <b>Gates</b> <b>rolled</b> back, the Doors swung wide, and I was swept into the city {{that is in the}} Place of Death. I was swept swiftly I know not whither, till at length I stood upon my feet. Again the great Voice pealed: ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{walks on}} again, and {{kneeling}} before the goddess in the shrine, embraces {{her feet and}} makes his prayer to her. Now the <b>gates</b> <b>roll</b> open, and a procession enters, headed by a veiled, noble-looking woman, who bears offerings, which she sets {{on the table before}} the shrine, bending her knee to the effigy of the goddess. Her oblations made, she turns to depart, and as she goes brushes her hand against the hand of the watching priest, who hesitates, then follows her.|$|R
60|$|The Piazza del Popolo was a lake, {{with the}} four stone lions just visible, and still {{spouting}} water, {{though it was a}} drug in the market. In at the open <b>gate</b> <b>rolled</b> a muddy stream, bearing hay-stacks, brushwood, and drowned animals along the Corso. People stood on their balconies wondering what they should do, many breakfastless; for how could the trattoria boys safely waft their coffee-pots across such canals of water? Carriages splashed about in shallower parts with agitated loads, hurrying to drier quarters; many were coming down ladders into boats, and crowds stood waiting their turn with bundles of valuables in their hands.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, Hanson {{developed}} two <b>gated</b> communities, <b>Rolling</b> Hills, California, {{as well as}} Hidden Hills, California. From 1932 to 1944, {{he served}} as President of the Palos Verdes Corporation. He also worked with architect Charles H. Cheney (1884-1943) to design a highway surrounding the Palos Verdes Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Pressure-mounted gates are {{typically}} {{held in place}} by friction with the walls on either side, while hardware-mounted gates are screwed into the wall studs and swing fully open like a door. There are hardware-mounted gates that can be customized to fit wide and irregularly shaped openings, as well as mesh retractable <b>gates</b> that <b>roll</b> out of the way.|$|R
40|$|The {{crossroads}} of Flatbush (often called The Junction) is a five point intersection of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. A crossroad where ethnic groups step beyond subtle neighborhood boundaries and merge to use public services and shops. Steel <b>gates</b> <b>roll</b> {{up at the}} beginning of each day and pushcarts slip onto the sidewalk. Pedestrians jostle vendors and vendors strike bargains. Senior citizens seeks unlit corners after tracing the sun's path. Night shift workers yawn while gradually adjusting to the morning rush. High school and college students dart in and out of donut shops as they make their way to classes. The electricity emitted from such an urban environment has a lasting effect. It is this energy that I wish to capture in my design exploration for student housing. The development of a physical form that would reflect the vibrancy of The Junction. by Keith A. Campbell.

5000|$|The Great Gate {{was very}} strong, {{constructed}} {{of iron and}} steel and guarded by stone towers and bastions. The iron doors of the <b>Gate</b> <b>rolled</b> back to open. Passwords were required to enter the Great Gate {{and each of the}} six other gates of Minas Tirith. The Great Gate was breached during the War of the Ring. Sauron's forces under the command of the Witch-king of Angmar besieged the City on 13th 'March'. Before dawn on 15th 'March', the battering ram Grond smashed into the Great Gate three times while the Witch-king spoke words of power. [...] "As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground." [...] The Witch-king rode through the Gate where Gandalf awaited him, but then the Rohirrim arrived and the Witch-king went to fight them in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields where he was slain.|$|R
50|$|Beginning not {{far from}} the source of the North Platte River, Northgate Canyon is the river's gateway north. The water follows the western flank of the Park Range in Colorado as it plunges at {{approximately}} 20 ft/mile through the canyon. The high gradient produces some of Colorado's and Wyoming's best Class III+ rapids, including Windy Hole, Cowpie, Narrow Falls (The <b>Gate),</b> Tootsie <b>Roll,</b> and Stovepipe.|$|R
50|$|The Stone is {{situated}} on {{the northwest corner of}} Avenue C and 2nd Street, in a building which used to be the Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant. Residential apartments are located above The Stone in the same building, though residents enter the building through a separate door along Avenue C. The only signage visible is the wording The Stone in small gold lettering painted on the door which is visible after the metal security <b>gate</b> is <b>rolled</b> up a few hours before each performance.|$|R
6000|$|He lifts me to {{the golden}} doors; [...] The flashes come and go; [...] All heaven bursts her starry floors, [...] And strows [3] her lights below, [...] And deepens on and up! the <b>gates</b> [...] <b>Roll</b> back, and far within [...] For me the Heavenly Bridegroom waits, [4] [...] To make me pure of sin. [5] [...] The sabbaths of Eternity, [...] One sabbath deep and wide-- [...] A light upon the shining sea-- [...] The Bridegroom [6] with his bride! ...|$|R
60|$|I pulled myself {{together}} with an effort and followed him more closely. We passed under a bridge of solid masonry, moss-encrusted, and indented with the storms of ages and the ruder marks of battering-ram and cannon, across a wide, circular courtyard protected by massive iron <b>gates,</b> which <b>rolled</b> slowly open before us with many ponderous creakings and gratings, as though reluctant to admit a stranger, into a great, white, stone-paved hall, dimly lighted, yet sufficiently so to enable me to perceive the long rows of armoured warriors which lined the walls, and the lances and spears and shields which flashed above their heads.|$|R
50|$|Sandford {{was born}} at Torrington in Devon and became an accountant, {{eventually}} becoming manager of Ashton <b>Gate</b> Iron <b>Rolling</b> Mills. In 1883 he moved to Sydney, employed to organise a wire-netting plant at Five Dock. He had left two children by a previous marriage in England, but he married Caroline Newey on 3 May 1884 at Goulburn, working in Lithgow and Mittagong. In 1892 he purchased the Eskbank ironworks at Lithgow, and was given a government contract in railway parts. Around this time he became a vigorous protectionist, leading the Lithgow National Protection Association and running unsuccessfully for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Hartley on a protectionist platform.|$|R
60|$|Already {{the army}} had been gone a month, but news of it came daily to the town, and such news as all men could read, for through the landward <b>gates</b> there <b>rolled</b> one {{constant}} stream of wagons, pouring down the Libourne Road, and bearing the booty of Southern France. The town was full of foot-soldiers, for none but mounted men had been taken by the Prince. With sad faces and longing eyes they watched {{the passing of the}} train of plunder-laden carts, piled high with rich furniture, silks, velvets, tapestries, carvings, and precious metals, which had been the pride of many a lordly home in fair Auvergne or the wealthy Bourbonnais.|$|R
50|$|The Corps of Engineers {{maintains}} the structures and, {{in times of}} flood, monitors their piers for scouring and stability. The Corps of Engineers has two 25-ton cranes used to lift and lower the flood <b>gates.</b> The cranes <b>roll</b> on special tracks next to the roadway, enabling the operators to open or shut any spillway gate or perform maintenance while the roadway is in use.|$|R
60|$|Entering the <b>gate,</b> the postchaise <b>rolled</b> heavily along a sandy road, between naked declivities, {{gradually}} descending {{into one}} of those gentle and sheltered valleys, in which the sleek monks of old loved to nestle themselves. Here a sweep of the road round an angle of a garden wall brought us full in front of the venerable edifice, embosomed in the valley, with a beautiful sheet of water spreading out before it.|$|R
60|$|In {{the tumult}} that burst over my ears I sat {{staring at the}} dots on my score card. Fourteen strike outs! one scratch hit! No base on balls since the first inning! That told the story which deadened senses doubted. There was a roar in my ears. Some one was {{pounding}} me. As I struggled {{to get into the}} dressing room the crowd mobbed me. But I did not hear what they yelled. I had a kind of misty veil before my eyes, in which I saw that lanky Rube magnified into a glorious figure. I saw the pennant waving, and the gleam of a white cottage through the trees, and a trim figure waiting at the <b>gate.</b> Then I <b>rolled</b> into the dressing room.|$|R
2500|$|Each chamber {{has three}} lateral water-saving basins, {{for a total}} of nine basins per lock and 18 basins in total.

6000|$|As he spoke, Walter half leaned {{upon the}} gate beside him, and {{adjusted}} the knife behind the vicar's back scientifically. Then, {{without a word}} more, {{in spite of a}} natural shrinking, he drove it home up to the haft, with a terrible effort of will, at the exact spot on the back that the books had pointed out to him. It was a painful thing to do, but he did it carefully and well. The effect of Walter Dene's scientific prevision was even more instantaneous than he had anticipated. Without a single cry, without a sob or a contortion, the vicar's lifeless body fell over heavily {{by the side of the}} <b>gate.</b> It <b>rolled</b> down like a log into the dry ditch beneath. Walter knelt trembling on the ground close by, felt the pulse for a moment to assure himself that his uncle was really dead, and having fully satisfied himself on this all-important point, proceeded to draw the knife neatly out of the wound. He had let it fall in the body, in order to extricate it more easily afterward, and not risk pulling it out carelessly so as to get himself covered needlessly by tell-tale drops of blood, like ordinary clumsy assassins. But he had forgotten to reckon with little King Charlie. The dog jumped piteously upon the body of his master, licked the wound with his tongue, and refused to allow Walter to withdraw the knife. It would be unsafe to leave it there, for it might be recognized. [...] "Minimize the adverse chances," [...] he muttered still; but there was no inducing King Charlie to move. A struggle might result in getting drops of blood upon his coat, and then, great heavens, what a terrible awakening for Christina! [...] "Oh, Christina, Christina, Christina," [...] he said to himself piteously, [...] "it is for you only that I could ever have ventured to do this hideous thing." [...] The blood was still oozing out of the narrow slit, and saturating the black coat, and Walter Dene with his delicate nerves could hardly bear to look upon it.|$|R
6000|$|He {{still had}} no desire for sleep, but he began slowly to undress. His clothes, his tie, {{everything}} he had been wearing, seemed to him to reek of accumulated perfumes of the night, and he flung them from him with feverish disgust. There was a small bath-room opening from his sleeping chamber, and with a desire for complete cleanliness which was not wholly physical, he filled the bath and plunged in. The touch of the cold water was inspiring and he stepped out again into a new world. Much of the horror of so short a time ago had gone, but with his new self had come an ever-increasing distaste for any resumption, in any shape or form, of his associations {{of the last few}} days. He must get away. He rummaged through his things and found a timetable. In less than an hour he was dressed, his clothes were packed, and the bill was paid. He wrote a short note to Davenant and a shorter one to Ella. Ignoring {{the events of the last}} night, he spoke of a summons home. He enclosed the receipted hotel bill, and something with which he begged her to purchase a souvenir of her visit. Then he drank some coffee, and with a somewhat stealthy air made his way to the lift, and thence to the courtyard of the hotel. Already a small victoria was laden with his luggage; the concierge, the baggage-master, the porters, were all tipped with a prodigality almost reckless. Shaven, and with a sting of the cold water still upon his skin, in homely flannel shirt and grey tweed travelling clothes, he felt like a man restored to sanity and health as his cab lumbered over the long cobbled street, on its way to the Gare du Nord. It was only a matter of a few hours, and yet how sweet and fresh the streets seemed in the early morning sunshine. The shops were all open, and the busy housewives were hard at work with their bargaining, the toilers of the city thronged the pavements, everywhere there was evidence of a real and rational life. The city of those few hours ago was surely a city of nightmares. The impassable river flowed between. Macheson leaned back in his carriage and his eyes were fixed upon the blue sunlit sky. His lips moved; a song of gratitude was in his heart. He felt like the prisoner before whom the iron <b>gates</b> have been <b>rolled</b> back, disclosing the smiling world! ...|$|R
