40|$|A stereocomplex {{is formed}} by mixing {{isotactic}} and syndiotactic poly (methyl methacrylate) (it- and st-PMMA) under suitable circumstances. This thesis describes {{the investigation of}} the structure of this stereocomplex. The final reult is a model consisting of a double-stranded helix in which the nearly extended <b>isotactic</b> <b>chain</b> is surrounded by the syndiotactic chain. [...] Zie: Summary...|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} {{radial distribution}} functions {{of a sample}} of amorphous (atactic) poly(propylene) and of an isotactic one were compared, showing the absence, in the former sample, of interatomic correlations beyond 8 Å (1 Å = 0, 1 nm). The influence {{of the length of}} atactic and <b>isotactic</b> <b>chain</b> segments on the calculated X-ray interference functions was investigated. A model based on the arrangement of atactic chains in close-packed spheres fits well the experimental X-ray diffraction pattern of the amorphous sample...|$|E
40|$|The homochirality, or isotacticity, of {{the natural}} amino acids {{facilitates}} the formation of regular secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets. However, many examples exist in nature where novel polypeptide topologies use both l- and d-amino acids. In this study, we explore how stereochemistry of the polypeptide backbone influences basic properties such as compactness {{and the size of}} fold space by simulating both lattice and all-atom polypeptide chains. We formulate a rectangular lattice chain model in both two and three dimensions, where monomers are chiral, having the effect of restricting local conformation. Syndiotactic chains with alternating chirality of adjacent monomers have a very large ensemble of accessible conformations characterized predominantly by extended structures. <b>Isotactic</b> <b>chains</b> on the other hand, have far fewer possible conformations and a significant fraction of these are compact. Syndiotactic chains are often unable to access maximally compact states available to their isotactic counterparts of the same length. Similar features are observed in all-atom models of isotactic versus syndiotactic polyalanine. Our results suggest that protein isotacticity has evolved to increase the enthalpy of chain collapse by facilitating compact helical states and to reduce the entropic cost of folding by restricting the size of the unfolded ensemble of competing states...|$|R
40|$|Herein, we {{describe}} {{new methods to}} produce colloidal particle chains of three stiffness regimes that can be observed on a single-particle level, that is, {{on the level of}} the monomers that make up the chain; the chains can even be observed in concentrated systems without using molecular tracers. These methods rely on the following: dipolar interactions induced by external electric fields in combination with long-range charge repulsion to assemble the particles into chains only, and a bonding step to ensure that the particles remain assembled as chains even after the external field is switched off. We can control the length and the flexibility of the chains. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is generally applicable by using it to prepare several other colloidal polymers, such as block-copolymer chains, which are formed by combining rigid and flexible chains, spherocylinders, which are formed by heating rigid chains, and both atactic and <b>isotactic</b> <b>chains,</b> which are formed from heterodimericparticle monomer units. We demonstrate that the flexibility of the charged chains can be tuned from very rigid (rod-like) to semiflexible (as in the simplified polymer model of beads on a string) by changing the ionic strength. This method can, in principle, be used with any type of colloidal particle. Moreover, our systems can be matched in terms of refractive index and density, so that bulk measurements in real space are possible...|$|R
50|$|In eutactic macromolecules, substituents may occupy any {{specific}} (but potentially complex) sequence of positions along the <b>chain.</b> <b>Isotactic</b> and syndiotactic polymers are instances {{of the more}} general class of eutactic polymers, which also includes heterogeneous macromolecules in which the sequence consists of substituents of different kinds (for example, the side-chains in proteins and the bases in nucleic acids).|$|R
40|$|Propylene was copolymerized with allylanisole (AA) using Me 2 Si(Ind) (2) ZrCl 2 and Et(Ind) (2) ZrCl 2, and the methylaluminoxane MAO co{{catalyst}} at 70 degrees C and a cocatalyst to catalyst (Al:Zr) {{molar ratio}} of 1000. It was fed at 8. 5 bar(g). The weight-average molecular weight, (M) over bar (w), for both metallocenes decreased as the AA feed concentration increased. Therefore, allylanisole acted as an in situ chain transfer agent. The chain transfer constants, k(tr) /k(P), of AA for Et(Ind) (2) ZrCI 2 and Me 2 Si(Ind) (2) ZrCl 2 {{turned out to}} be 0. 33 and 0. 40, respectively. The characterization of the resulting products by (HNMR) -H- 1 demonstrated that AA end-capped the <b>isotactic</b> poly(propylene) <b>chains</b> which showed to be low molecular weight oligomers; 4. 96 x 10 (3) <= (M) over bar (w) <= 9. 80 x 10 (3). An appropriate chain transfer mechanism for AA has been proposed...|$|R
40|$|Commercially {{available}} Al isopiopoxide (Al(OiPr) 3) {{has proved}} to be an efficient initiator for the bulk polymerization of lactide. The ring-opening polymerization proceeds through a "coordination-insertion" mechanism and the selective rupture of the acyl-oxygen bond of the monomer Polyester chains are selectively end-capped with an aluminum alkoxide and an isopropoxy group. Therefore, substitution of Al tris(4 -penten- 1 -olate) for Al(OiPr) 3 leads to the formation of macromonomers In the temperature range from 110 to 150 °C, polymerization is "living", i. e. the molecular weight can be predicted by the initial monomer-to-Al molar ratio and the monomer conversion. The narrower polydispetsity of poly(L,L-lactide) compared to the amorphous poly(D,L-lactide) (1. 3 compared to 1. 9, respectively), both prepared in the bulk, is thought to result from the restricted mobility of the crystallized <b>isotactic</b> polyester <b>chains.</b> When the temperature is increased up to 180 °C, inter- and intramolecular transesterification reactions interfere with chain propagation.

40|$|Supercritical {{assisted}} atomization (SAA) under {{reduced pressure}} {{was used to}} produce microparticles with defined spherical morphology, controlled particle size and distribution of PEG–PLA copolymers. These compounds, because of their low glass transition temperature are difficult to process using other techniques. Different architectures were tested to optimize PEG–PLA copolymers {{from the point of}} view of SAA processability and their pharmaceutical application. Synthesis and micronization of copolymers with relative content of PEG:PLA of 1 : 4 (w/w) and 1 : 8 (w/w) and with atactic or stereoregular (isotactic) PLA arms were performed and the architectures of linear copolymers (l, PEG(PLA)), branched of first generation (G 1, PEG(PLA) 2) and branched of second generation (G 2, PEG(PLA) 4), characterized by one, two and four PLA arms respectively, were tested. Well defined particles of the linear copolymer PEG–PLA, with <b>isotactic</b> PLA <b>chain,</b> were obtained with a mean particle size of 0. 25 – 0. 45 ��m, for both PEG:PLA ratios. G 2 branched copolymer were successfully micronized in the case of 1 : 8 PEG:PLA ratio with isotactic PLA blocks and spherical particles with a mean particle size of about 0. 3 ��m were obtained. On the contrary, the G 1 copolymers with isotactic PLA arms formed coalescing microparticles when processed by SAA. Copolymers with atactic PLA arms, independently on the architecture, were not successfully processable. SAA process did not modify the structure of the starting copolymers, as shown by 1 H NMR and GPC analyses. The microparticles obtained showed a lower degree of crystallinity compared to the untreated materials, as confirmed by XRPD and DSC analyses. The G 2 branched 1 : 8 PEG:PLA copolymer, because of the structure and the size of the obtained particles, can be considered the most promising for the controlled release of a drug...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{chemistry}} of poly(lactic acid) was carried out {{with a focus on}} techniques and applications of PLA polymer and copolymers with reference to some of the work that has been accomplished over the last 20 years or so. A {{review of the}} characterisation techniques used to analyse PLA polymers and copolymers was also carried out giving reference to the equipment and methods used herein. 	An investigation into the potential of PLA as the hydrophilic portion of a polymeric surfactant was carried out. To develop PLA based surfactants, the ring opening polymerisation of lactide was carried out in a melt {{in the presence of a}} long chain alcohol (C₇ to C₂₀) or diol (C₄ & C₆) to produce AB or ABA type polymers that follow the traditional surfactant template. Stannous octanoate and 4 -dimethylaminopyridine were typically used as catalysts due to their high activity and relative cheapness. PLA only shows good hydrophilicity with up to 12 lactic acid units in the chain. Above this the electrostatic interactions between polymer chains reduced water solubility. It was also noted that D,L-lactide produced more water soluble polymers (syndiotactic) than the enantiomerically pure L-lactide (<b>isotactic</b> polymer <b>chains).</b> 	An investigation of the hydrophobic properties of PLA was carried out to evaluate their usefulness for other biodegradable surfactant applications. To this end an investigation of sugars as the hydrophilic portion of the molecule was carried out. Due to problems with solubilising sugars, they were deemed unsuitable for use as initiatiors within the scope of this research. Choline chloride was then investigated as a potential hydrophilic initiator and indeed has produced some of the most water soluble of PLA polymers. Choline chloride presented several challenges as an initiator, its high melting point resulted in polar solvents such as t-butanol being employed. Alternatively, more success was achieved by preparation of a choline chloride eutectic mixture prior to the polymerisation. It was discovered that a choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture was capable of self initiation, thus required no further addition of catalyst, this result shows a potential step forward in PLA green chemistry. A final investigation into producing surface-active PLA in a one-pot process that required only a hydroxycarboxylate initiator was carried out. The production of PLA sodium or potassium salts was carried out in a melt polymerisation and the results show some promise. Initiators that have been employed include a range of a, b and g-hydroxycarboxylic acids. These work through tautomerisation to the alkoxide, which then initiates a living type polymerisation of lactide to produce surface-active polymers. As well as the synthesis of these polymers some analysis of the physical and aqueous properties of these materials was carried out. PLA sodium salts were shown to have reasonable surfactant ability (45 mNm⁻¹) and low CMC values of around 5 x 10 ⁻⁹ mol cm⁻³. They were also shown to have some properties as emulsifiers, and in some cases showed non-Newtonian fluid behaviour such as shear-thinning (thixotropy) and shear-thickening (dilatant). The thermal characteristics of the polymers such as T[subscript]g and stability were assessed as well as their ability to retain water...|$|R
