40|$|We {{report that}} the {{electron}} spin relaxation time, T 1, in a GaAs quantum dot with a spin- 1 / 2 ground state has a 180 degree periodicity in {{the orientation of the}} in-plane magnetic field. This periodicity has been predicted for circular dots as due to the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin orbit contributions. Different from this prediction, we find that the extrema in the T 1 do not occur when the magnetic field is along the [110] and [1 - 10] crystallographic directions. This deviation is attributed to an <b>elliptical</b> <b>dot</b> confining potential. The T 1 varies by more than an order of magnitude when rotating a 3 Tesla field, reaching about 80 ms for the magic angle. We infer from the data that in our device the sign of the Rashba and Dresselhaus constants are opposite. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|Electron {{states are}} studied for quantum dots in a {{strained}} Si quantum well, {{taking into account}} both valley and orbital physics. Realistic geometries are considered, including circular and <b>elliptical</b> <b>dot</b> shapes, parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields, and (most importantly for valley coupling) the small local tilt of the quantum well interface away from the crystallographic axes. In absence of a tilt, valley splitting occurs only between pairs of states with the same orbital quantum numbers. However, tilting is ubiquitous in conventional silicon heterostructures, leading to valley-orbit coupling. In this context, "valley splitting" {{is no longer a}} well defined concept, and the quantity of merit for qubit applications becomes the ground state gap. For typical dots used as qubits, a rich energy spectrum emerges, as a function of magnetic field, tilt angle, and orbital quantum number. Numerical and analytical solutions are obtained for the ground state gap and for the mixing fraction between the ground and excited states. This mixing can lead to valley scattering, decoherence, and leakage for Si spin qubits. Comment: 18 pages, including 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Addition energy spectra at 0 T of {{circular}} and ellipsoidally deformed few-electron vertical {{quantum dots}} are measured and compared to results of model calculations within spin-density functional theory. Because of the rotational symmetry of the lateral harmonic confining potential, circular dots show a pronounced shell structure. With {{the lifting of}} the single- particle level degeneracies, even a small deformation is found to radically alter the shell structure leading to significant modifications in the addition energy spectra. Breaking the circular symmetry with deformation also induces changes in the total spin. This "piezo-magnetic" behavior of quantum dots is discussed, and the addition energies for a set of realistic deformation parameters are provided. For the case of the four-electron ground state at 0 T, a spin-triplet to spin-singlet transition is predicted, i. e. Hund's first rule no longer applies. Application of a magnetic field parallel to the current confirms that this is the case, and also suggests that the anisotropy of an <b>elliptical</b> <b>dot,</b> in practice, may be higher than that suggested by the geometry of the device mesa in which the dot is located.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new high {{capacity}} color barcode. The barcode we propose uses the cyan, magenta, and yellow (C,M,Y) colorant separations available in color printers and enables high capacity by independently encoding data {{in each of these}} separations. In each colorant channel, payload data is conveyed by using a periodic array of elliptically shaped dots whose individual orientations are modulated to encode the data. The orientation based data encoding provides beneficial robustness against printer and scanner tone variations. The overall color barcode is obtained when these color separations are printed in overlay as is common in color printing. A reader recovers the barcode data from a conventional color scan of the barcode, using red, green, and blue (R,G,B) channels complementary, respectively, to the print C, M, and Y channels. For each channel, first the periodic arrangement of dots is exploited at the reader to enable synchronization by compensating for both global rotation/scaling in scanning and local distortion in printing. To overcome the color interference resulting from colorant absorptions in noncomplementary scanner channels, we propose a novel interference minimizing data encoding approach and a statistical channel model (at the reader) that captures the characteristics of the interference, enabling more accurate data recovery. We also employ an error correction methodology that effectively utilizes the channel model. The experimental results show that the proposed method works well, offering (error-free) operational rates that are comparable to or better than the highest capacity barcodes known in the literature.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aim is to}} increase the capacity of barcode (i. e.) Number of data bits embedded inside barcode will be increased by encoding data through orientation modulation in <b>elliptical</b> <b>dot</b> array. BARCODES that encode digital data on physical media are commonly utilized in commercial applications for tracing/tracking of trade items, in security applications for linking personal documents with a user, or in other applications as an auxiliary channel to encode additional information on a physical medium. which are fundamentally analog, these methods can add security and functionality and features that are associated with digital techniques at the expense of consuming space on the media. For instance, in personal IDs, driving licenses and passports, high capacity can enable the encoding of a sample speech signal, a picture, or other identifying personal information which in turn may be used to establish authenticity of the user. Care must, however, be exercised in designing color barcodes to ensure that they are robust to variations in the color printing and scanning processes, which have a greater impact when considering color rather than black/white reproduction and capture. 2 D bar codes are being considered for new emerging applications such as M-ticketing, where they carry selected information of a ticket that is received via a mobile phone; reliable and secure personal identification, where they store personal biometric data on the identification document; and visual communications with side information, where they can be used as an auxiliary channel conveying additional data for improving visual communications...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of the minimum energy required to change the information content of physical switches is attracting a growing interest because current computer technology is facing fundamental challenges, such as increased power dissipation, and rapidly approaching the limits of scaling. In this context, bistable nanomagnetic switches {{can be used to}} store bits of information, associating each logic state to a different equilibrium orientation of the magnetization. Here we present the results of virtual experiments implemented by micromagnetic simulations on elongated dots of Permalloy, performing a reset to 1 operation, also known as Landauer erasure. We show that for isolated, realistic, elliptical dots with sub- 100 nm lateral dimension, the minimum-energy consumption turns out to be consistent with the value expected for an ideal bistable switch, i. e., E = k(B) T x ln(2), known as the Landauer limit. The only condition to achieve the correct limit is that the adopted erasure protocol includes a proper time interval where the probability distribution of the magnetization has the same amplitude in the two possible states. However, it is shown that significant deviations from the theoretical limit can be found either increasing the lateral dot dimension above about 100 nm or considering a rectangular (rather than <b>elliptical)</b> <b>dot</b> shape, where the presence of straight edges promotes a nonuniform behavior of the dot magnetization. Finally, we show that if the magnetic switch is not isolated, as it happens in potential devices where a regular array of dots is present, the dipolar interaction among adjacent switches can lead to either a reduction or an increase of the minimum dissipated energy, depending on the specific geometric arrangement of the magnetic dots...|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneous {{ferromagnetic}}-superconducting {{systems such}} as a regular array of ferromagnetic nano dots deposited {{on the top of}} a superconducting thin film have attracted many research teams both experimental and theoretical. The interest in these systems does not only stem from being good candidates for technological applications, but also because they represent a new class of physical systems where two competing order parameters can coexist. This work focuses on the theoretica laspects of these systems by studying the static and dynamics of few model systems. In the first part, the static properties of a superconducting thin film interacting with a ferromagnetic texture are considered within the London approximation. In particular, the ferromagnetic textures considered here are a circular dot of submicrometer size with in-plane magnetization, an <b>elliptical</b> <b>dot</b> magnetized in the direction perpendicular to the superconductor, and a ferromagnetic dot magnetized in the direction normal to the superconducting film and containing non magnetic cavities. I also consider the interaction of vortices in the superconductor with a ferromagnetic columnar defect which penetrates the supercondcting film. In each case the vector potential and magnetic field of the ferromagnet in the presence of the superconductor are calculated. Afterward the presence of vortices in the superconductor is assumed and the energy of vortex-texture system is found. The pinning potential and force supplied by the texture are then derived from the energy of interaction between the ferromagnet and superconductor. I show that if the magnetization of the ferromagnet exceeds a critical value then vortices are spontaneously created in the ground state of the system. Such spontaneous creation of vortices is possible mostly in a close vicinity of the superconducting transition temperature Ts. For every case, the threshold value of the magnetization at which vortices start to be spontaneously created in the SC is calculated as a function of the parameters of the texture geometry. The phase diagrams for transitions from vortexless regime to regimes with one or more vortices are determined for all cases. In the second problem, the transport properties of a ferromagnetic superconducting bilayer with alternating magnetization and vortex density are studied within a phenomenological model. I show that pinning forces do not appear for continuous distribution of vortices, so a discrete model for the bilayer system is constructed. Afterward, I calculate the pinning forces acting on vortices and antivortices resulting from highly inhomogeneous distribution of flux lines and prove that this system has strong transport anisotropy. In the absence of random pinning, the system displays a finite resistance for the current in the direction perpendicular to the domains while its resistance vanishes for the parallel current. The transport anisotropy strongly depends on temperature. I study this dependence and show that the ratio of parallel to perpendicular critical current is largest close to the superconducting transition temperature Ts and the vortex disappearance temperature Tv while it has a minimum in between them...|$|E

The numerical calculations of those analytical expressions were confirmed by micromagnetic simulations, revealing that linear-regime steady-state VC motions driven by any polarized oscillating currents can be interpreted simply by the superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise rotational eigenmodes.

These features can be understood most simply in terms of nodal planes defined relative to the orientation of the static magnetization. A new, generalized labeling scheme is proposed that simplifies discussion and comparison of modes from different geometries. It is shown that the lowest-frequency mode for small dots is characterized by an in-phase precession of spins, without nodal planes, but with a maximum amplitude at the edges. This mode softens at an applied switching field with magnitude comparable to the coercive field and determines specific aspects of magnetization reversal.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} matrix method, {{which has}} been recently introduced for spin mode calculations in magnetic nano-dots, is reviewed. The method is a hybrid of micro-magnetic simulations (i. e. the dot is approximated out of small cells) and an eigenvalue/eigenvector approach, which requires the computation of a matrix, whose elements represent the torque acting on each cell. We apply this method to calculate the normal modes of dots of different shape (parallelepipeds, disks, ellipses and rings), material (Fe, Permalloy) and magnetization state (saturated, vortex, with and without external field). In each case, the equilibrium configuration is preliminarily computed and then used to perform the dynamical calculation, which yields the eigenvalues (frequencies) and eigenvectors (profiles) of the spin modes. The modes are classified according to {{the orientation of the}} nodal lines with respect to the local magnetization, and are investigated in their frequency dependence on the wave-vector, nodal number and applied field.

We showed as for limited {{size of the}} periodic arrays the transition of the magnetization during the reversal starts at the edges and corners of the array and propagates inside the pattern, so that in a restricted field range the magnetization results to be not uniformly distributed. While {{the shape of the}} <b>dots</b> (circular, <b>elliptical,</b> etc.) introduces a Configurational Anisotropy, we find that the finite array dimensions introduce an additional Global Configurational Anisotropy. Both effects originate at the demagnetizing interactions playing at different space scales: the dot and total array space scale, respectively. Simulations of dot arrays are often restricted to one dot assuming isolated non-interacting magnetization processes. Periodic boundary conditions are often used to incorporate interdot interactions, still limiting computations to a restricted number of dots and assuming infinite lattice periodicity. Then, configurational anisotropy is accounted for, but global configurational anisotropy is not. We show that mutual dot interactions together with finite array dimensions have a nonnegligible impact on the magnetization reversal of a dot array. We numerically and experimentally study the hysteresis properties of Permalloy (Py) arrays of 16 x 16 circular and <b>elliptical</b> <b>dots,</b> with thickness ranging between 10 and 25 nm and lateral size between 300 and 500 nm. In magnetooptical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements, in-field magnetic force microscope (MFM) measurements and simulations, we find that global shape anisotropy steers the magnetization reversal of the array: the dots run through different magnetization states depending on the dot location and collective magnetization processes occur, leading to transition avalanches and formation of magnetization chains. Moreover, we find that imperfections as edge roughness and external perturbations, as the MFM measurement itself, anticipate the dots reversal path set by the global configurational anisotropy and promote field induced magnetization state changes. These findings are important in the development of applications that rely on a robust control of dot magnetization states in dot arrays...|$|R

Ferromagnetic resonance spectra were collected while continuously sweeping between large positive and negative fields, together with the opposite direction, for a broad range of closely spaced frequencies. The data reveal several modes, with frequency/field trajectories persisting through field reversal, after which they soften and disappear below certain critical fields. Calculations based on the dynamical matrix method[2] and the discrete dipole approximation were performed which show excellent agreement with the experimentally observed results for both the dynamic and static response of our arrays, including the positions of the instabilities. The angular dependence of both the static and dynamic behavior is also investigated.

Actually, it has been recently demonstrated that the bandwidth of the mode that softens at the critical transition field, undergoes dramatic variations even when just approaching this critical field. This fact can result in a band broadening also for modes usually non-dispersive (like some end modes). In some cases, it is possible to design the magnonic crystal to be characterized by a soft mode with the desired symmetry, in order to use its bandwidth variation close to the transition field for a specific purpose. We show this concept as emerging from calculations within the dynamical matrix method: first, for square arrays of disks in the saturated and also in the vortex state, then for rectangular arrays of interacting <b>elliptical</b> <b>dots,</b> magnetized along the minor and also major axis, and find out the behavior of the soft mode dispersion close to different magnetic transitions. We discuss the correlation among: the magnetization curve, the soft mode frequency vs. field curve, and the frequency vs. wavevector curve. In the vortex-to-saturated transition the soft mode is characterized by a bandwidth that goes to zero at a magnetic field quite distinct from the critical transition field, and we call this field stopping field, because at this field the collective soft mode turns into nondispersive (stationary). We believe that this features might be used to design versatile devices, in which information can be stored or delivered at the energy costs of a small magnetic field variation...|$|R
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} phonon-assisted spin {{relaxation of}} an electron confined in an <b>elliptical</b> quantum <b>dot</b> (QD) {{subjected to a}} tilted magnetic field. In the presence of both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit terms, the relaxation rate is anisotropic {{with respect to the}} in-plane field orientation. This anisotropy originates from the interference, at nonzero tilt angle, between the two spin-orbit terms. We show that, in a narrow range of magnetic field orientations, the relaxation rate exhibits anomalous sensitivity to variations of the QD parameters. In this range, the relative change in the relaxation rate with in-plane field orientation is determined solely by the spin-orbit coupling strengths and by the dot geometry. This allows simultaneous determination of both Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling parameters and the dot ellipticity from analysis of the angular dependence of the relaxation rate.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{results obtained}} {{in the field of}} spin excitations in nanometric magnetic dots are reviewed. The dynamical matrix method and analytical approaches are described and applied to the cases of circular and <b>elliptical</b> planar permalloy <b>dots.</b> For discs, the spin dynamics in the vortex and saturated states is investigated. For saturated ellipses, the dependence of frequencies and mode profiles is studied {{as a function of the}} direction of the in-plane applied field and dot eccentricity. The results allow us to interpret Brillouin scattering data in terms of mode symmetry and localization...|$|R

An approach to image the domains and domain walls of small ferromagnetic entities using atomic force microscopy(AFM), with a nonmagnetic AFM probe, has been developed. Exciting the sample in an external acmagnetic field, the distribution of magnetostrictive response at the surface is detected. By this technique, the domains and domain walls of submicron Co dots have been imaged with a 1 nm lateral resolution. In <b>elliptical</b> Co <b>dots</b> with a 350 -nm-long axis on a triangular lattice array with 400 nm periodicity, we find evidence for two domains with opposite magnetization orientation across a wall. The domain-wall width in these dots {{is found to be}} about 35 nm. Furthermore, we observe a ferromagnetic alignment of the domains in the neighboring dots, which suggests a magnetostatic interaction among the dots...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic disks or dots of soft {{magnetic}} material of sub-micron dimensions may have as the lowest energy magnetic configuration a single-domain structure, with magnetization either perpendicular of {{parallel to the}} plane, or else may form magnetic vortices. The properties of these vortices {{may be used to}} encode data bits, in magnetic memory applications. In the present work the OOMMF code was used to compute by micromagnetic simulation the energy and the magnetization of circular and elliptical nanodots of permalloy. For the <b>elliptical</b> magnetic <b>dots</b> the analysis was made for variable thickness and length of major axis, keeping a 2 : 1 axis ratio. From the simulations, a phase diagram was constructed, where the ground state configurations of the nanodots are represented in a diagram of nanodot height versus length of the major axis $ 2 a$ of the ellipse. The phase diagram obtained includes regions with one and two vortices; it is similar, but more complex than that derived using a numerical scaling approach, since it includes configurations with lateral vortices. These diagrams are useful as guides for the choice of dimensions of elliptical nanodots for practical applications. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
