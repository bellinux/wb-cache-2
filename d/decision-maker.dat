5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a <b>decision-maker</b> for purpose A, it is unlawful for the <b>decision-maker</b> to exercise the power for purpose B, because the <b>decision-maker</b> would be using the power for an unauthorized purpose.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} how <b>decision-makers</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{personal}} characteristics and organisational characteristics {{can influence the}} screening of immigrant professionals during the recruitment and selection process. The sample consisted of 220 <b>decision-makers</b> in the engineering industry working in New South Wales, Australia. The results show White/Anglo Australian <b>decision-makers</b> had more suitability concerns of ethnic migrant candidates during the recruitment and selection process than <b>decision-makers</b> of other ethnicities. However, this was moderated by organisational characteristics of size and clientele. <b>Decision-makers</b> in larger organisations and a diverse ethnic client base showed less suitability concerns of migrant candidates during the recruitment and selection process...|$|R
40|$|Selecting {{concepts}} involves challenging decisions because <b>decision-makers</b> {{must consider}} many factors {{and the implications}} of the selection are far-reaching and unknown. As markets become increasingly sustainability-driven, bringing sustainability considerations into the decision is necessary. This is challenging due to the complexity of the concept of sustainability and it being unfamiliar to many <b>decision-makers.</b> In this work we therefore aimed to develop support for helping <b>decision-makers</b> to consider sustainability when selecting a concept. We undertook a case study where we studied <b>decision-makers</b> selecting a road construction process. Then we developed a method of support to help these <b>decision-makers</b> to select a process. The developed method helps <b>decision-makers</b> consider sustainability aspects when selecting concepts. The method supports <b>decision-makers</b> to compare alternatives by using indicators that are based on the values of actors in the extended value network. Global society is included as an actor who values development that is more sustainable. We modelled and visualised the outputs from the developed method in order to support <b>decision-makers</b> in the case study with their specific decision. Early indications from our testing are that the method and general approach could be useful for <b>decision-makers</b> wanting to consider sustainability in concept selection.

5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the <b>decision-maker</b> to adduce {{evidence}} in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved. A mere assertion by the <b>decision-maker</b> that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of national security. In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E
5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a <b>decision-maker</b> has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Sargsyan {{tightened}} {{his grip on}} the Armed Forces, establishing himself as a virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the Republican Party and joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the de facto <b>decision-maker</b> in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature.|$|E
40|$|We analyze a model where <b>decision-makers</b> are {{initially}} uninformed {{of their}} risk type and can obtain such information by performing a costless test before insurance policy purchase. Information status can be con-cealed or revealed to insurers {{at the discretion}} of <b>decision-makers.</b> More-over, information has decision-making value since it allows to optimally choose a self-insurance action (secondary prevention). First insurers pro-pose contracts to <b>decision-makers.</b> Then, <b>decision-makers</b> decide whether to perform the test and, possibly, whether to show it to insurers. Then <b>decision-makers</b> accept a contract and, finally, they choose prevention. We focus, in particular, on the welfare properties of equilibria and pro-vide a simple graphical analysis.

30|$|Game theory [1] is {{a bag of}} {{analytical}} tools {{designed to}} help us understand the phenomena that we observed when <b>decision-makers</b> interact. The models of game theory are highly abstract representations of classes of real-life situations. The basic assumption is that the <b>decision-makers</b> pursued well-defined exogenous objectives and take into account their knowledge and expectations of other <b>decision-maker’s</b> behavior.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{psychological}} {{research shows}} that <b>decision-makers</b> react differently when information is retrospective or prospective (e.g., Conlon and Parks 1987; Schultze et al. 2012). This might open interesting avenues for further research because <b>decision-makers</b> often receive retrospective and/or prospective information (e.g., corporate planning, budgeting). Further research should analyze whether <b>decision-makers</b> react differently when facing an overly high level of retrospective versus prospective information.|$|R
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a <b>decision-maker</b> should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} <b>decision-maker,</b> a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|In Berks County, {{snow and}} sleet along with very cold {{temperatures}} combined with some accidents {{and other aspects}} to cause a 50-mile backup on Interstate 78. Many motorists, including more than 100 trucks, were stuck on the interstate for nearly 24 hours, without food, water and running out of fuel. At 12:26 PM on the 14th, a caller tells a 911 center he???s been stuck in traffic on westbound Interstate 78 near the Berks-Lehigh county line {{for more than an}} hour. At 1:02 PM, a truck driver tells the Berks Communications Center about a seven-mile backup on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 78 near Hamburg. At 4:40 PM, a 911 caller asked to speak to the Berks Emergency Management Agency. The Berks Deputy Coordinator took the call. At 4:59 PM, The Berks Deputy Coordinator called the State Emergency Operations Center and was told the center learned of the backup at 4:33 PM. At 5:22 PM, Berks Emergency Management calls the state police at the Hamburg barracks but cannot get through, so he decided to drive there. At 6:08 PM, the Berks Emergency Management Deputy Coordinator finds that the Hamburg barracks is without power and phones. At 6:27 PM, a senior <b>decision-maker</b> from PennDOT is requested to arrive at the Hamburg state police barracks to help with communications.

30|$|Although {{decision}} support IS and {{the acquisition of}} information developed rapidly, the <b>decision-maker’s</b> cognitive capacity did not. Simon and Newell (1971) stated that limited short-term or working memory and limited information processing capacity per time unit are two decisive factors explaining why <b>decision-makers</b> cannot incorporate an overly high level of information given limited time. 2 While pre-IT <b>decision-makers</b> could evaluate the acquired information while further analysis was being pursued, today, additional information is available in a minimum of time. Hence, <b>decision-makers</b> may face situations in which they receive much more information than {{they are able to}} evaluate.|$|R

When <b>decision-makers</b> in firms choose how much attention they devote to aggregate conditions, complete price stabilization is optimal also in response to shocks that cause inefficient fluctuations under perfect information. Hence, recognizing that <b>decision-makers</b> in firms can choose how much attention they devote to aggregate conditions has major implications for optimal policy. ...|$|R
5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a <b>decision-maker</b> acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E

40|$|<b>Decision-makers</b> {{can learn}} from their own past {{experience}}, and, potentially, {{from the experience of}} other <b>decision-makers</b> who face similar problems. When experience is private information, communication is necessary to learn from others. In a twoperiod model in which <b>decision-makers</b> care about their reputation, we study how the assignment of decision rights (who decides on the actions taken in period two?) and the information on which reputations are based determine (i) the willingness to share information, (ii) decisions, and (iii) welfare. Centralizing decision rights may hurt welfare due to the negative effect on the quality of communication. The welfare effects of reputation depend on whether perceptions of a <b>decision-maker’s</b> ability are based solely on his own action or on comparisons across <b>decision-makers,</b> and on the assignment of decision rights...|$|R
50|$|The context or {{framing of}} {{problems}} adopted by <b>decision-makers</b> results {{in part from}} extrinsic manipulation of the decision-options offered, {{as well as from}} forces intrinsic to <b>decision-makers,</b> e.g., their norms, habits, and unique temperament.|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainable}} science-based {{management of}} natural resources requires knowledge exchange between scientists and environmental decision-makers; however, evidence suggests that information flow is inhibited by a range of barriers. To date, {{our understanding of the}} range and importance of factors limiting knowledge exchange between scientists and <b>decision-makers</b> is based primarily on the perceptions of <b>decision-makers,</b> while the perceptions of scientists have been largely overlooked. This study addresses this knowledge gap by quantitatively assessing the perceptions of scientists, represented by a sample of 78 Australian marine scientists, regarding (i) the role and importance of engaging with environmental <b>decision-makers</b> on a personal level, (ii) the role and importance of engaging with environmental <b>decision-makers</b> at the institutional level, (iii) current barriers to engaging with environmental <b>decision-makers</b> and (iv) options for overcoming barriers to engaging with environmental <b>decision-makers.</b> Survey results suggest that Australian marine scientists feel that they have an obligation to engage <b>decision-makers</b> in their science, and that engaging with and communicating to environmental <b>decision-makers</b> is important on a personal level. This study also identifies a range of barriers that impede engagement activities, including inadequate measures of science impact that do not account for engagement activities, a lack of organisational support for engagement activities, insufficient time to conduct engagement activities in addition to other responsibilities and a lack of funding to support engagement activities. To overcome these barriers, participants identified the need for institutional innovation by research institutions, research funders and decision-making agencies alike to promote a culture whereby knowledge exchange activities are legitimised as core business for research scientists, and recognised and rewarded appropriately. Although difficulties exist in implementing such institutional innovations, doing so will improve two-way knowledge exchange among scientists and <b>decision-makers</b> and improve the likely success of environmental management...|$|R
25|$|An error as to a {{jurisdictional}} fact or precedent fact {{is committed}} when a <b>decision-maker</b> {{makes a decision}} {{in the absence of}} a fact that must exist objectively before the <b>decision-maker</b> is empowered by the legislation to decide. Here, the courts are not concerned with the evaluation of facts, but whether the facts exist for the decision maker to exercise his power.|$|E
25|$|However, {{subject to}} the {{requirements}} of fairness, a <b>decision-maker</b> should consider whether, on the particular facts of the case, reasons should be given. A failure by the <b>decision-maker</b> to provide reasons may justify an inference that its reasons are bad in law or that it has exercised its powers unlawfully. The rationale behind the argument that a <b>decision-maker</b> should provide reasons is that {{it is one of the}} cornerstones of a good administration. Furthermore, if some right or interest such as livelihood or property is at stake, or if there is some legitimate expectation, reasons should be given when a decision is adverse to the applicant as a matter of fairness.|$|E
25|$|Decisions {{rendered}} without {{reasons are}} not without implications: in the landmark decision in Padfield v.

50|$|The PAPRIKA method {{resolves}} this ‘impossibility’ {{problem by}} ensuring {{that the number of}} pairwise rankings that <b>decision-makers</b> need to perform is kept to a minimum - i.e. {{only a small fraction of}} the potentially millions or billions of undominated pairrs - so that the burden on <b>decision-makers</b> is minimized and the method is practicable. PAPRIKA keeps the number of pairwise rankings performed by <b>decision-makers</b> to a minimum by, for each undominated pair explicitly ranked by <b>decision-makers,</b> identifying (and eliminating) all undominated pairs implicitly ranked as corollaries of this and other explicitly ranked pairs. Fundamental to the efficiency of the method is application of the transitivity property of additive value models, as illustrated in the simple demonstration later below.|$|R
25|$|The {{exercise}} of an unqualified discretion may be attacked {{if it was}} exercised in bad faith, {{or if it was}} so unreasonable as to show that there could not have been any real of genuine {{exercise of}} discretion. Hence, so long as the <b>decision-maker</b> genuinely considers all the evidence, is willing to consider exceptions, and applies guidelines in a flexible manner, the court will not find that the <b>decision-maker</b> has fettered its discretion.|$|E
25|$|Justice Chan {{relied on}} a United Kingdom case, Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976), to {{ascertain}} the law with regard to this ground of judicial review. In this case, the House of Lords held that statutory provisions which are framed to include the word satisfaction may exclude judicial review on matters of pure judgment by the <b>decision-maker,</b> but judicial review will not be excluded in all cases. Lord Wilberforce held that when the judgment {{is dependent on the}} existence of relevant facts, the court has to ascertain if the facts truly exist and if they have been properly taken into account, although the evaluation of the facts is for the <b>decision-maker</b> alone. If these requirements are not met, an aggrieved person is entitled to challenge the decision, and the court can intervene {{on the grounds that the}} <b>decision-maker</b> acted outside its powers, outside the purpose of the legislation empowering it, unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact. Lord Diplock mentioned it was also necessary to consider if the <b>decision-maker</b> had taken into consideration only matters which he ought to have considered.|$|E
