5|$|Counselor: Counselors are {{required}} {{as part of}} the core team by Medicare regulations. Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve. While not <b>every</b> <b>patient</b> will see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices {{have to be able to}} provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E
5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on <b>every</b> <b>patient</b> with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: <b>Every</b> <b>patient</b> is {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E

5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that <b>every</b> <b>patient</b> on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

25|$|None {{of these}} systems are perfect. For example, they are {{unreliable}} at extremes of age (e.g. neonates, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as nitrous oxide, may produce anesthesia without reducing {{the value of the}} depth monitor. This is because the molecular action of these agents (NMDA receptor antagonists) differs from that of more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Thirdly, they are prone to interference from other biological potentials (such as EMG), or external electrical signals (such as electrosurgery). This means that the technology that will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for <b>every</b> <b>patient</b> and every anesthetic does not yet exist.|$|E

Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volumes were measured; the patients underwent pre-procedure and 6-month post-procedure MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations. At 6-months post-procedure, each woman had {{a significant increase in}} breast volume, ranging 60–200 per cent, per the MRI (n=12) examinations. The size, form, and feel of the breasts was natural; post-procedure MRI examinations revealed no oil cysts or abnormality (neoplasm) in the fat-augmented breasts. Moreover, given the sensitive, biologic nature of breast tissue, periodic MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations are required to monitor the breast-tissue viability and the maintenance of the large volume (+300cc) fat grafts.|$|E

2500|$|Treatments and {{procedures}} administered by Paramedics fall {{under one of}} two categories, off-line medical orders (standing orders) or on-line medical orders. On-line medical orders refers to procedures that must be explicitly approved by a base hospital physician or registered nurse through voice communication (generally by phone or radio) and are generally rare or high risk procedures (e.g. rapid sequence induction or cricothyrotomy). In addition, when multiple levels can perform the same procedure (e.g. AEMT-Critical Care and Paramedics in New York), a procedure can be both an on-line and a standing order depending {{on the level of}} the provider. Since no set of protocols can cover <b>every</b> <b>patient</b> situation, many systems work with protocols as guidelines and not [...] "cook book" [...] treatment plans. Finally, systems also have policies in place to handle medical direction when communication failures happen or in disaster situations.|$|E
2500|$|Psychiatrist Joel Paris {{argues that}} {{psychiatry}} is sometimes susceptible to diagnostic fads. Some {{have been based}} on theory (overdiagnosis of schizophrenia), some based on etiological (causation) concepts (overdiagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder), and some based on the development of treatments. Paris points out that psychiatrists like to diagnose conditions they can treat, and gives examples of what he sees as prescribing patterns paralleling diagnostic trends, for example an increase in bipolar diagnosis once lithium came into use, and similar scenarios with the use of electroconvulsive therapy, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs. He notes that {{there was a time when}} <b>every</b> <b>patient</b> seemed to have [...] "latent schizophrenia" [...] and another time when everything in psychiatry seemed to be [...] "masked depression", and he fears that the boundaries of the bipolar spectrum concept, including in application to children, are similarly expanding. Allen Frances has suggested fad diagnostic trends regarding autism and Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|E

Although his work is often neglected in the history of health care assessment, Codman's work anticipated contemporary approaches to quality monitoring and assurance, establishing accountability, and allocating and managing resources efficiently.|$|R
40|$|Background: Tuberculosis {{represents}} the major threat {{for the health}} protection in the military forces. The aim of this retrospective and descriptive studywas the evaluation of risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis in military recruits. Material and methods: 51 military recruits with tuberculosis diagnosed during 01. 01. 2010 - 31. 12. 2015 in Chisinau military quarters and managed inthe Hospital of Pneumophtysiology were assessed. Results:Most of military recruits aged 18 - 22, were residents of the rural localities, graduated incomplete general school or lyceum and were economicallyvulnerable. One half of the group consisted of active smokers and <b>every</b> tenth <b>patient</b> abused alcohol. <b>Every</b> fourth <b>patient</b> had tuberculosis in childhoodand every tenth had family contact with a tuberculosis-affected person. Disease’s insidious onset was established in {{one half of the}} group and the acuteonset in <b>every</b> fourth <b>patient.</b> <b>Every</b> tenth <b>patient</b> was diagnosed with tuberculosis within the first 6 months after the enrollment. Only one half of thegroups were symptomatic patients, who complained of cough, asthenia and loss of weight. Pulmonary infiltrative tuberculosis predominated amongrecruits. Extensive infiltrates and involvement of both lungs were identified in a lower proportion. The high rate of successful treatment outcome wasendangered by the high rate of lost to follow-up patients, demonstrating poor evaluation and follow-up after the discharging from the hospital. Conclusions: The epidemiological studies among military recruits are limited. The high rate of young, economically vulnerable men with risk factorsdemonstrates their priority for active screening. Treatment outcomes must be improved by the implementation of the adequate follow-up after hospitaldischarging...|$|R
