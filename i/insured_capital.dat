The aim of the study is to examine the prognostic value of parameters from the health declaration and application form on extra mortality based on results from additional medical testing. A history register-based cohort study was conducted including about 15. 000 application files accepted between 2007 and 2010. Blood pressure, lipids, cotinine and glucose levels were used as dependent variables in logistic regression models. Resampling validation was applied using 250 bootstrap samples to calculate area under the curves (AUC's). The AUC was used to discriminate between persons with and without at least 25 % extra mortality. BMI and the overall assessment of the health declaration by an insurance physician or medical underwriter showed the strongest discrimination in multivariable analysis. Including all variables at minimum cut-off levels resulted in an AUC of 0. 710 while by using a model with BMI, the assessment of the health declaration and gender, the AUC was 0. 708. Including all variables at maximum cut-off levels lead to an AUC of 0. 743 while a model with BMI, the assessment of the health declaration and age resulted in an AUC of 0. 741. The outcome of this study shows that BMI and the overall assessment of the health declaration were the dominant variables to discriminate between applicants for life-insurance with and without at least 25 percent extra mortality. The variable <b>insured</b> <b>capital</b> set by insurers as factor for additional medical testing could not be established in this study population. The indication for additional medical testing at underwriting life-insurance can possibly be done on limited variables instead of the obligatory medical testing based on age and the amount of <b>insured</b> <b>capital...</b>|$|E

We initially show how {{to duplicate the}} cash-flows of a call by using a leveraged portfolio of stocks. After, we simulate another portfolio which aims to replicate a protective put. Finally, we simulate the cushion technique of Black and analyse {{the sensitivity of the}} insured portfolio to some parameters like the degree of risk aversion of the investor. We consider the limits of each of the studied strategies. Financial Engineering; Portfolio Insurance; Monte Carlo simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|Published online: 09 July 2016 This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} shocks on food security and the insurance role of social capital and informal social networks. In particular, by combining household panel data, weather data, self-reported shocks and detailed social capital information, the paper investigates the insurance role of social capital against covariate and idiosyncratic shocks. Our results suggest that both covariate and idiosyncratic shocks increase the prevalence of food insecurity. However, households with a higher stock of social capital were able to smooth consumption. We also found that food consumption is not <b>insured</b> through social <b>capital</b> when a shock affects the whole risk-sharing network. Moreover, we show that formal policy interventions such as access to consumption credit and safety nets are the only effective ways of insuring food consumption when a shock affects the entire risk-sharing network.

40|$|Use of {{a promise}} to pay by a bank to insure an {{outstanding}} loan in order to return {{the value of the}} <b>insured</b> amount into <b>capital</b> for use in writing a new loan is an invention in banking with calculably greater potential economic impact than the original invention of reserve banking. The consequence of this lending invention is to render the existing money multiplier equations of reserve banking obsolete whenever it is used. The equations describing this multiplier do not converge. Each set of parameters for reserve percentage, nesting depth, etc. creates a unique logarithmic curve rather than approaching a limit. Thus it is necessary to show behavior of this new equation by numerical methods. It is shown that remarkable multipliers occur and early nesting iterations can raise the multiplier into the thousands. This money creation innovation has the demonstrated capacity to impact nations. Understanding this new multiplier is necessary for economic analyses of the GFC. [...] GFC,CDS,AIG,money multiplier,banking multiplier...|$|R
50|$|However, some economists, such as Barry Eichengreen {{argue that}} this is not as true {{when it comes to the}} {{denomination}} of official reserves because the network externalities are not strong. As long as the currency's market is sufficiently liquid, the benefits of reserve diversification are strong, as it <b>insures</b> against large <b>capital</b> losses. The implication is that the world may well soon begin to move away from a financial system dominated uniquely by the US dollar. In the first half of the 20th century multiple currencies did share the status as primary reserve currencies. Although the British Sterling was the largest currency, both the French franc and the German mark shared large portions of the market until the First World War, after which the mark was replaced by the dollar. Since the Second World War, the dollar has dominated official reserves, but this is likely a reflection of the unusual domination of the American economy during this period, as well as official discouragement of reserve status from the potential rivals, Germany and Japan.|$|R
5000|$|In this period, the Ottoman Empire {{spent only}} {{small amounts of}} public funds on education; for example in 1860-61 only 0.2 per cent of the total budget was {{invested}} in education.As the Ottoman state attempted to modernize its infrastructure and army in response to threats from the outside, it also opened itself up to {{a different kind of}} threat: that of creditors. Indeed, as the historian Eugene Rogan has written, [...] "the single greatest threat to the independence of the Middle East" [...] in the nineteenth century [...] "was not the armies of Europe but its banks." [...] The Ottoman state, which had begun taking on debt with the Crimean War, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1875. By 1881, the Ottoman Empire agreed to have its debt controlled by an institution known as the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, a council of European men with presidency alternating between France and Britain. The body controlled swaths of the Ottoman economy, and used its position to <b>insure</b> that European <b>capital</b> continued to penetrate the empire, often to the detriment of local Ottoman interests.|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{the banking}} {{multiplier}} {{has been in}} a range of 4 to 100, with 25 % to 1 % reserve ratios at most layers of the banking system encompassing the majority of its range in recent centuries. Here it is shown that multipliers over 1 000 can occur from a new mechanism in banking. This new multiplier uses a default insurance note to insure an outstanding loan in order to return the value of the <b>insured</b> amount into <b>capital.</b> The economic impact of this invention is calculably greater than the original invention of reserve banking. The consequence of this lending invention is to render the existing money multiplier equations of reserve banking obsolete where it occurs. The equations describing this new multiplier do not converge. Each set of parameters for reserve percentage, nesting depth, etc. creates a unique logarithmic curve rather than approaching a limit.

Why have the United States been paying seven, eight, ten per cent for money for years past, when the same commodity can be got elsewhere at half that rate of interest? Why, because though among the richest proprietors in the world, creditors were not sure of them. So the States have had to pay eighty millions yearly {{for the use of}} money which would cost other borrowers but thirty. Add up this item of extra interest alone for a dozen years, and see what a prodigious penalty the States have been paying for repudiation here and there, for sharp practice, for doubtful credit. Suppose the peace is kept between us, the remembrance of this last threat alone will cost the States millions and millions more. If they must have money, we must have a greater interest to <b>insure</b> our jeopardized <b>capital.</b> Do American Companies want to borrow money--as want to borrow they will? Mr. Brown, show the gentleman that extract from the New York Herald which declares that the United States will confiscate private property {{in the event of a}} war.
