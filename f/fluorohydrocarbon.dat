40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{research}} described in this thesis were to explore the chemistry of some model compounds related to <b>fluorohydrocarbon</b> polymers, in particular the copolymer of (I), especially to obtain definitive information about mechanisms of cross-linking and polymer degradation and to explore new approaches to cross-linking. A range of model compounds of the form (III) and (IV) were synthesized and the results obtained demonstrate that aryl-ether cross-links of the form (II) are stable {{in the presence of}} various bases at elevated temperatures. This indicates that these links are not responsible for the instability of copolymers cured in this way. Models of the form (III) and (IV) show surprisingly low reactivity under typical curing conditions, indicating that either the polymers themselves are more reactive or reaction occurs by an unexpected mechanism. In pursuit of the likely cross-linking mechanism it was shown that polymers of the forms (I) and (CF(_ 2 CH(_x) F(_ 2 -X)) (_n), x= 1, 2,are highly susceptible to elimination of HF in the presence of Lewis acids, e. g. SbF(_ 5) to yield highly unsaturated materials. Model chemistry involving SbF(_ 5) resulted in novel eliminations of HF, e. g. (quant.) (V) (VI) the formation of some stable long-lived carbocations, e. g. and other novel chemistry, e. g. a 1, 5 elimination of HF new approach to cross-linking was also developed involving the incorporation into the copolymer (I) of crowded comonomer units, e. g. when copolymers containing the structures (XI) where heated radicals were found via hemolytic cleavage to promote cross-linking: examination of the model compounds yielded new re-actions including a route to seven-membered cyclic ethers, and an unexpected ring closure reaction catalysted by NBU(_ 3),(HF) (_X), The reactivity of the models was also examined in the areas of nucleophilic attack, base-catalysed elimination of HF, addition of 1, 3 -dipoles, the formation of long-lived carbanions and one-electron transfer chemistry.

Compared to micron-sized aluminum (μAl) higher reactivity, lower ignition temperature and condensed combustion products of reduced size can be achieved. This work focuses on the pre-burning characterization of nAl. In the analysis, different features of various powders (passivated by air or organic compounds, and eventually coated by hydrocarbons and <b>fluorohydrocarbons)</b> are investigated focusing on the application in energetic systems. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), specific surface area (SSA) measurement, and volumetric techniques are considered for an extensive characterization of the powder morphology (particle size, shape, and texture), structure, and composition (active metal content). The reactivity of nAl is investigated at low- and high-heating rates. The behavior of powder suspensions is analyzed by a plate-plate rheometer considering hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as the suspending medium. The effects of the nAl passivation/coating layer on the viscosity of HTPB-based slurries are discussed.

In addition, the authors {{mentioned}} that molecular fluorine spontaneously reacts with clean titanium and also TiO 2 at temperatures higher than 200 °C and 350 °C, respectively. In addition, the presence of initial surface contamination is suspected to enhance the reaction mechanisms. Number of reported studies on the plasma etching contaminations has been described since the early 1980 s [15, 16]. Fluorine contamination is frequently detected by spectroscopic surface analyses techniques (ESCA, XPS...) in typical plasma etching of SiO 2 [16]. In particular, mixture of gases containing fluorocarbons (CF 4) and <b>fluorohydrocarbons</b> (CHF 3) are commonly used for SiO 2 etching. A great effort {{has been made in}} the past to understand the physico-chemical interactions at the solid-gas interface in reactive plasmas. Contamination may occur simultaneously by the etching process itself and/or the subsequent surface exposure to air. Herner et al. [17] has detailed in his paper the question of fluorine solubility in Ti films and the well-known [...] "volcano" [...] reaction in TiN/Ti, and pointed out the increase of film resistivity as one of the main effects of fluorine contaminations. In our conditions, and among the consequences of the temperature rise during stress, local increase of fluorine concentrations and its probable thermally activated reaction with Ti layer is suspected to degrade more the electrical properties of the device metal contacts. This seems to be consistent with its electrical performance degradations [7].|$|R
40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are {{stable in}} the {{atmosphere}} and may reach the stratosphere. They are cleaved by UV-radiation in the stratosphere to yield chlorine radicals, which are thought {{to interfere with the}} catalytic cycle of ozone formation and destruction and deplete stratospheric ozone concentrations. Due to potential adverse health effects of ozone depletion, chlorofluorocarbon replacements with much lower or absent ozone depleting potential are developed. The toxicology of these compounds that represent chlorofluorohydrocarbons (HCFCs) or <b>fluorohydrocarbons</b> (HFCs) has been intensively studied. All compounds investigated (1, 1 -dichloro- 1 -fluoroethane [HCFC- 141 b], 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane [HFC- 134 a], pentafluoroethane [HFC- 125], 1 -chloro- 1, 2, 2, 2 -tetrafluoroethane [HCFC- 124], and 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethane [HCFC- 123]) show only a low potential for skin and eye irritation. Chronic adverse effects on the liver (HCFC- 123) and the testes (HCFC- 141 b and HCFC- 134 a), including tumor formation, were observed in long-term inhalation studies in rodents using very high concentrations of these CFC replacements. All CFC replacements are, to varying extents, biotransformed in the organism, mainly by cytochrome P 450 -catalyzed oxidation of C-H bonds. The formed acyl halides are hydrolyzed to give excretable carboxylic acids; halogenated aldehydes that are formed may be further oxidized to halogenated carboxylic acids or reduced to halogenated alcohols, which are excretory metabolites in urine from rodents exposed experimentally to CFC replacements. The chronic toxicity of the CFC replacements studied is unlikely to be of relevance for humans exposed during production and application of CFC replacements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{crystallinity}} {{of cellulose}} {{is a principal}} factor limiting the efficient hydrolysis of biomass to fermentable sugars or direct catalytic conversion to biofuel components. We evaluated the impact of TFA-induced gelatinization of crystalline cellulose on enhancement of enzymatic digestion and catalytic conversion to biofuel substrates. Results Low-temperature swelling of cotton linter cellulose in TFA at subzero temperatures followed by gentle heating to 55  °C dissolves the microfibril structure and forms composites of crystalline and amorphous gels upon addition of ethanol. The extent of gelatinization of crystalline cellulose was determined by reduction of birefringence in darkfield microscopy, loss of X-ray diffractability, and loss of resistance to acid hydrolysis. Upon freeze-drying, an additional degree of crystallinity returned as mostly cellulose II. Both enzymatic digestion with a commercial cellulase cocktail and maleic acid/AlCl 3 -catalyzed conversion to 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and levulinic acid were markedly enhanced with the low-temperature swollen cellulose. Only small improvements in rates and extent of hydrolysis and catalytic conversion were achieved upon heating to fully dissolve cellulose. Conclusions Low-temperature swelling of cellulose in TFA substantially reduces recalcitrance of crystalline cellulose to both enzymatic digestion and catalytic conversion. In a closed system to prevent loss of <b>fluorohydrocarbons,</b> the relative ease of recovery and regeneration of TFA by distillation makes it a potentially useful agent in large-scale deconstruction of biomass, not only for enzymatic depolymerization but also for enhancing rates of catalytic conversion to biofuel components and useful bio-products.

40|$|In {{the given}} review article {{analysis}} of the literature and patent sources concerning main methods for intensification of extraction processes of medicinal vegetative raw materials – use of condensed gases and supercritical fluids (SCF) on more acceptable extractants {{has been carried out}} for last 20 years. Urgency of the specified technologies consists in need for replacement of traditional extraction methods on power- and time-saving ones, and also in use of nontoxic, fire-proof and low-boiling solvents because the most of routine organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, acetone, chloroform, ethylacetate, etc.) are toxic and/or flammable or expansive and rather hard to evaporate out from extracts obtained. The abovementioned trends are the most universal for intensification of extraction processes and sometimes purification of final or intermediate products acceptable for commercial scale of manufacture. The main advantages and disadvantages of the given methods are compared for different plant species and groups of biologically active substances (BAS). It has been shown that in most cases supercritical СО 2 (SC-СО 2) are inferior in its dissolving ability to number of condensed gases and, besides, such technology is much more expensive. The range of BAS taken with SC-СО 2 is limited to mainly lipophilic compounds because of zero electrical dipole moment of SC-СО 2 and its low polarity. As extractants alternative to SC-СО 2 with higher dissolving ability SC - ethane, nitrogen monoxide, freons - R 134 а, R 23, R 32, R 408 and number of others can be used. Also to enlarge range of extractable BAS it is possible to add different cosolvents, mainly ethanol or methanol in quantity up to 20 %. At the same time in phytochemical production prospective alternatives to liquid or supercritical СО 2 are certain condensed gases with wider range of physico-chemical properties: fluorinated derivatives of hydrocarbons (freons), liquid ammonia, dimethyl ether (DME), sulfur hexafluoride (insulating gas) or their mixtures, etc. Their major characteristics include lower vapor pressure if compared with liquid СО 2, antimicrobic activity allowing to solve one the main problem in phytochemical production – microbial contamination of extracts (and other herbal drug preparations), possibility to extract not only lipophilic, but also more polar substances depending on choice of solvents or their mixes and their higher extraction rate. It has been found that some kinds of freons (for example, R 22) due to their higher polarity are able to take wider spectrum of BAS than liquid СО 2 : essential and fat oils, fat-soluble vitamins, coumarins, carotenoids, phenolic alcohols, valrates, iridoids, some alkaloids and flavonoids. Besides, certain freons (for example, С 318) have very high selectivity allowing to extract essential oils without accompanying fats. Some condensed gases, such as liquid ammonia, dimethyl ether and difluoromethane (freon R 32) can be used as well for obtaining of hydrophilic BAS (saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids). Thus such solvents should be polar enough or can be mixed with polar modifiers. Supercritical fluids and some subcritical condensed gases are suitable for fractionating of primary (crude) extracts because their selectivity considerably depends on temperature, pressure and composition (in case of mixtures with each other or with cosolvents). Also high selectivity of condensed gas and SCFs is shown in near-critical areas. Very important property of most of condensed gases and SCFs is their ability to considerably reduce microbial contamination of extracts in comparison with initial plant raw materials. Conclusions. Among existing methods for intensification of stage of plant extraction the most applicable for commercial scale is use of condensed gases and supercritical fluids as extractants. It is found that for today in the world the most widespread SCF is carbon dioxide. The main lacks of СО 2 as an extractant are high working pressure and narrow spectrum of extractable BAS which is limited only to lipophilic substances. This induces the search for alternative condensed gases and SCF among which <b>fluorohydrocarbons</b> (freons) are of the greatest interest. Also perspective methods of extraction intensification are applications of ultrasound, microwave field and some other methods of raw material processing, but meanwhile they have not got industrial value because of insufficient scientific base...|$|R
