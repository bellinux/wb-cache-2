40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{appraisal}} of various design aspects {{of new and}} <b>extended</b> <b>primary</b> <b>schools</b> in Essex built between 1973 and 1993. The investigation method included a review of <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> design literature and County Council archives, interviews with Officers concerned with the design and operation of <b>primary</b> <b>schools,</b> visits to schools, analysis of user comment by questionnaire, and investigative essays. The appraisal contains three parts:- part one a review of primary education since 1973; part two strategic aspects of <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> design, including, planning, constructional systems, aesthetics, environmental design, engineering services, interior and exterior design; part three detailed requirements of today's <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> room by room; plus conclusions promulgating lessons for the future. Main conclusions of the study are :- - Economic and political pressures have reduced quality and space standards, encouraged traditional teaching methods, and reduced community use. - The County Architect and Education department's influence diminished as power was delegated to individual schools. - Limited generic plans, including the paired classbase, have developed which are a useful precedent for future design teams. - System building produced stereotype deep plan buildings, with austere architecture which failed to respect their setting or delight users. Current traditional pitched roof designs are more successful, but relatively uninspired. - Despite environmental design and engineering attempting to balance conflicting factors and reduce energy consumption by using alternative fuels and solar passive methods, users prefer locally controlled traditional heating and ventilation systems. - Interiors are high quality with a domestic ambience, whereas exteriors are poor quality with windswept wastelands without enclosure or facilities for outside teaching. - Users believe 1980 s schools are too small, sufficient classbase space is a priority, and demand better quality exteriors. This thesis should provide {{a clear view of}} the clients' requirements, past precedent, and critical relationships and will help future multi-disciplinary design teams, working under difficult conditions, produce better <b>primary</b> <b>schools</b> for Essex...|$|R

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that dementia screening tests may be biased against low levels of education, whereas others find that {{a low level of}} education is a genuine risk factor for dementia. The present paper attempts to reconcile these conflicting views by examining item bias and test bias indices of the mini mental state examination (MMSE). Psychometric calculations and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses of sensitivity and specificity as performed by earlier studies were replicated and extended from the database of the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly. This is a population survey on cognitive decline and dementia (age range 65 - 84). Subjects with a low level of education (<b>primary</b> <b>school)</b> were compared with better educated subjects (at least some secondary education). Cases were matched by age and sex. The results indicate that the MMSE is not educationally biased as far as item characteristics, reliability, and construct validity are concerned. Yet its predictive validity as a screening test for dementia is educationally biased. This bias will effectively be eliminated with a two point higher cut off score for the subjects whose education <b>extends</b> beyond <b>primary</b> <b>school.</b> Even after such score correction, a low level of education probably remains a genuine risk factor for dementi...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper.

The paper will present a view of modelling in a technological context that has been arrived at in part from detailed observation and analysis of this video material. The view is that modelling has a range of distinct purposes (e. g. communicating, evaluating, etc.); has distinct kinds (e. g. 2 D, 3 D, symbolic, etc.); and that unless these purposes and kinds are distinguished at least in the teacher's mind, some of the most valuable teaching points will be lost. Using the purposes and kinds as an analytical framework then enables a range of models and modelling media to be analysed as to their suitability and an assessment of modelling in the design and technology order to be made...|$|R

The program was accomplished in a Belgrade <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> during the 2001 / 2002 academic year, comprising students of 1 st and 2 nd grades (N= 77).
