40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This study {{attempted}} {{to answer the}} following question: What instructional methods should dietetic preceptors use to help dietetic interns meet the performance requirements specified by the American Dietetic Association (ADA, 1991) for entry-level dietitians? A national sample of 170 dietetic preceptors was surveyed. Ninety provided usable information to examine both the instructional methods they used to train interns as well as those methods they might try to use. Thirty instructional methods were grouped into six categories: one-to-one methods, practice/experiential methods, reading-writing methods, lecture-discussion methods, exercises/problem sets and student-directed learning. This study recommends seven "best" methods and seven "best" techniques for preceptors to use when instructing interns. Two methods, supervised practice and unsupervised practice, seemed the most important to include in the training of potential preceptors. These methods are effective, practical, and address criticality pertaining to {{the health and safety of}} patients and clients. To a lesser extent cost efficiency in these methods is related to the use of the preceptor's time. Unsupervised practice is the least time-intensive for the preceptor, but requires supporting techniques, such as, feedback or conferencing, to address health and safety issues. Five less expensive methods with equal effectiveness for promoting learning for adults can supplement or support these more costly one-to-one and supervised practice methods. These methods are shadowing, case studies, simulations, student-directed seminars and role playing. In addition, self-instruction, student teams, team building <b>exercises,</b> <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercises</b> and learning contracts can be blended with other instructional methods for better preceptor instruction. Since only 40 percent of the 90 preceptors surveyed reported having any preceptor training, a proposal is made to train new and experienced preceptors in the most applicable methods and techniques they can use in instructing and precepting dietetic interns...|$|R

This study described, analyzed and assessed the effectiveness of four selection variables (interview, <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise,</b> group discussion and the Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS)) of a pre-employment assessment process. It examined the relationship between teaching performance of part-time faculty in an allied health degree completion program (as measured by the Faculty Assessment Form (FAF)) and the results of the pre-employment assessment process of selection. Fifty faculty were purposefully selected {{to participate in the study}} and 306 students completed 1, 430 Faculty Assessment Forms. Factor analysis performed on PALS and FAF indicated that both were bifactorial and homogeneous among the sample studied. The Cronbach alpha analysis indicated a strong reliability and internal consistency in both PALS and FAF. Four research hypotheses were tested using multiple statistical procedures. Rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis was measured at the 0. 05 level of significance unless otherwise stated. Null hypothesis one showed no significant difference between the degree of support for the collaborative mode by full-and part-time faculty and Conti's comparative sample. Null hypothesis two indicated the relationship between the degree of faculty support for the collaborative mode and student assessment of full and part-time faculty was significantly positive. Faculty who practiced adult learning principles in the collaborative mode displayed more functionality of role behaviors than those who used a non-collaborative mode. Null hypothesis three, the <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> and the PALS, showed a strong positive correlation with FAF. The interview and group discussion showed a low correlation between them and the FAF. Null hypothesis four tested the relationship between four selection variables and eight faculty assessment variables. Two selection variables (the <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> and the PALS) and eight of the faculty assessment variables had strong positive associations. Concluding evidence supported the use of four prediction variables in the pre-employment assessment. This process, with some revisions of four selection activities and corresponding rating scales, is an appropriate mechanism for predicting teaching performance. Further research is needed to investigate other assessment activities in selecting faculty for teaching positions. Longitudinal studies should be conducted for changes in faculties' functionality of role behaviors and performance outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Results {{supporting}} the predictive validity of assessment centres (e. g., Gaugler, Rosenthal, Thornton 2 ̆ 6 Bentson, 1987) {{are at odds}} with widely reported findings that behavioural consistency among assessment centre exercises is low (e. g., Sackett 2 ̆ 6 Dreher, 1982). Lack of behavioural consistency raises doubts as to how assessment centres work. Drawing from principles of person-situation interactionism, a trait activation hypothesis is proposed to help explain the conflicting findings and direct development of valid simulation exercises. The hypothesis holds that the behavioural expression of a trait requires arousal of that trait by trait-relevant situational cues. Cross-situational consistency in behaviour is thereby conceived to be largely a function of consistency in trait-arousing cues.;Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis. In Study 1, 123 undergraduates completed personality scales representing aspects of task and person orientations, and an <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> designed to elicit task- and person-related behaviours. Half the participants completed the in-basket under directions to 2 ̆ 2 get the job done 2 ̆ 2 (i. e., task-emphasis condition) and the other half, under directions to 2 ̆ 2 show concern for workers 2 ̆ 2 (i. e., person-emphasis condition). Based on the trait activation hypothesis, trait-behaviour correlations were expected to be stronger in the more trait-relevant condition (i. e., task-related traits with task-related behaviours in the task-emphasis condition, person-related traits with person-related behaviours in the person-emphasis condition). Moderated regression analysis suggested that linkages were stronger in the person-emphasis condition regardless of the type of trait (i. e., task- vs. person-related). Thus, support for trait activation was limited. Study 2 (N = 124) paralleled Study 1 except that (a) the task- versus person-emphasis manipulation was strengthened, and (b) a broader array of task- and person-related traits was considered. Results were more supportive of trait activation as originally conceived: task-related traits generally showed stronger positive relations with task-related behaviours in the task-emphasis condition. Evidence regarding person-related traits was weaker, possibly due to the <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> being less relevant to such traits.;Results, although modest, have important implications regarding cross-situational consistency (a) within simulation exercises as a form of reliability, (b) between exercises as evidence regarding the construct validity of assessment centres, (c) between testing and job settings as a basis for predictive validity, and (d) among job settings as a basis for the differential validity of trait measures. Subsidiary findings are that (a) task and person orientations warrant consideration as broad personality traits, (b) reliability in coding in-basket responses is itself replicable, (c) cross-situational consistency within an <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> is replicable and increases with behavioural aggregation within situations, and (d) in-basket responses are multidimensional...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the criterion-related validity of an assessment center's competency dimension ratings, exercise ratings, and standardized test scores. Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated assessment centers display substantial evidence of content and criterion-related validity.

The suggestions of these researchers are addressed through a more detailed examination of the criterion-related validity of an assessment center. Despite a number of methodological issues, two competency dimensions and two components stand out as viable predictors of the criteria used in this study.

40|$|This {{research}} suggests that management styles are shaped by developmental stage, that is, {{by the way the}} individual makes meaning of his or her world.

Research suggests that effective managers tend to exhibit certain patterns of decision making and leadership. For example, effective managers have been characterized as using logical-incremental and dialectical approaches in making decisions (Mason & Mitroff, 1981; Quinn, 1980), as able to balance concerns for task with concerns for people (Blake & Mouton, 1964), as able to vary their behavior to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} situations (Hersey &...|$|E

In addition, both strong and weak believers reported more anger when the outcome was unfavorable than when it was favorable.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to obtain and sustain {{competitive}} advantage via creative performance, organizations often seek individuals who possess traits known to improve the likelihood for creativity. Literature suggests that contextual factors may influence the level of creative performance of individuals with creative potential.

I assert that organizational justice (i. e., distributive, procedural, and interactional) may not only moderate the relationship between creativity enhancing traits and creative performance, it may also have a main effect relationship with creative performance. Therefore, I investigate the relationship between {{variables found to be}} precursors to individual creativity, distributive justice, procedural justice, interactional justice, and creative performance in a laboratory setting utilizing undergraduate business students.

Thus, {{there is some evidence that}} justice factors may have a limited relationship with individual creative performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{quasi-experimental}} {{field study}} explores how follower voice, leader regulatory focus and leader-member exchange (LMX) affect leader attention and decision-making. The model responds {{to calls for}} more work into the interplay between leaders and followers and the effect on leadership (Avolio, 2007; Howell 2 ̆ 6 Shamir, 2005), the integration of top-down and bottom-up processes that affect attention (Ocasio, 2011; Rerup, 2009); and the types, tactics, targets, and outcomes of follower voice (Morrison, 2011). Twenty-seven established leaders and their followers completed on-line instruments in a time-lagged fashion. Leaders {{were asked to respond}} to common managerial issues based on the GMIB, a well-known <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> (Joines, 2011).

Results show the quality of the relationship between the leader and the follower message sender influenced leader interest and decision-making directly and as a moderator of the path between follower voice type and leader decision-making. Regulatory focus did not moderate the relationship between follower voice and leader attention. Contrary to predictions, promotive voice (messages about opportunities) influenced leader attention and decisions more than prohibitive voice (messages about threats).

The sample for this study was composed of 102 undergraduate students (45 males, 57 females).

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} role of values in the problem-solving and decision-making activities of leaders using an established and validated theory on the content and structure of personal values. Undergraduate student participants completed a managerial assessment center that required them to solve managerial problems, complete an <b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise,</b> and respond to several questionnaires. Participants 2 ̆ 7 past leadership activities were assessed along with their willingness to engage in destructive leader behavior {{and their ability to}} generate original, high quality solutions to leadership problems. Destructiveness was defined as striving for personal gains over collective organizational interests and/or focusing on short-term gains over long-term organizational goals. Results revealed that achievement values and power values were positively related to leader emergence whereas hedonism goals were negatively related to leader emergence. Participants 2 ̆ 7 value systems were also found to predict their willingness to engage in destructive behavior. In addition, having an authority figure support destructiveness moderated the effect of values such that {{with the support of the}} company president, participants with self-enhancement values were more destructive than were those with self-transcendence values. These groups did not differ when the authority support was not present. Results also showed that participants 2 ̆ 7 defined an ambiguous leadership problem in a manner that reflected their personal values, which mediated the relationship between values and solution destructiveness. Although personal values influenced problem definitions and the destructiveness of problem solutions, they did not directly affect the quality, originality, or creativity of the problem solutions. However, participants who engaged in problem construction generated solutions that were more original, higher in quality, and more creative than did participants who did not engage in problem construction. Overall, results of this study provided empirical support for the popular assertion that personal values play an important role in organizational leadership. Implications of the results for today 2 ̆ 7 s organizational are discussed along with suggestions for future empirical research that will help to delineate further the complex influence personal values have on organizational behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{models of}} ethical {{decision}} making in business have placed little emphasis {{on the role of}} awareness of ethical dilemmas in determining the ethical outcome of business decision making. After a review of previous models, a contingency model is proposed that explicitly includes the issue of ethical awareness and its role in ethical {{decision making in}} business. The resulting contingency model of ethical decision making in business is based on both psychological and sociological theories. Problem content is hypothesized to interact with social expectations to create a state of ethical awareness. This ethical awareness is hypothesized to be affected by {{the presence or absence of}} codes of conduct, as well as the presence or absence of risk, as the decision maker moves from awareness of problem dimensions to intention formation. It is thought that risk further affects the decision maker as he/she progresses from intention formation to action. Outcomes are hypothesized to feed back into the awareness and intention formation stages. The model is fully described, and a number of research propositions are offered. The model is partially tested in this dissertation. An issue raising high ethical awareness and an issue raising low ethical awareness are tested for their impact on decision making. Further, the impact of business and professional codes are examined, as well as the role of risk in ethical decision making. It is found that different variables impact the decision process, depending on high or low states of ethical awareness. High ethical awareness results in a high frequency of ethical decisions, but low ethical awareness has no impact on frequency of ethical decisions. It is found that codes do not have impact in the laboratory setting, but risk does, under conditions of low ethical awareness. Under a condition of high ethical awareness, ethical awareness positively impacted ethical decision making. Under a condition of low ethical awareness, ethical awareness did not impact ethical decision making, but age negatively impacted ethical decision making, and work experience positively impacted ethical decision making. The study may be limited due to sample (MBA students) and technique (<b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise).</b> Suggestions for future research were to: (1) investigate the cause of high or low ethical awareness, using the problem content and social expectation interaction as one hypothesis; (2) verify the use of differential information in the decision process, dependent on condition of high or low ethical awareness; and (3) find more productive ways of identifying the action of codes in the ethical decision making process...|$|E
40|$|The {{violation}} of societal shared convictions {{is a phenomenon}} which can occur in different situations of daily living. Previous research investigated this phenomenon in various domains (e. g., morality and competence) separately while neglecting the similarities. This dissertation’s basic assumption is that violations of societal shared convictions in various domains lead to the same state, namely a legitimacy crisis, as the construct of legitimacy {{is closely related to}} social norms and values. A legitimacy crisis is an individual’s perception that his or her actions or characteristics are not or less appropriate as they are discrepant to the societal shared convictions in the given situation. Based on the general assumption that legitimacy crises go beyond existing theories on the {{violation of}} societal shared convictions, this work contributes to three general issues: First, it provides a theoretical integration into and continuation of overarching theoretical frameworks of legitimacy, discrepancy and threat. Second, it conducts an empirical examination of legitimacy crises throughout the two main domains of morality and competence, focusing especially on the mediating function of legitimacy crises between the discrepancy and subsequent consequences. Third, it contributes a theoretical development and empirical examination of emotional and behavioral consequences of legitimacy crises across the two main domains of morality and competence. To address these issues, this dissertation discusses the general meaning of legitimacy in the context of social and organizational psychology research and especially the different perspectives on legitimacy, thereby working out {{a deeper understanding of the}} self and legitimacy. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that experiencing legitimacy crises is threatening for one´s self as it followed by specific emotional and behavioral reactions. To empirically investigate the theoretical considerations, nine studies in various domains with different methods (scenarios, recall, face-to-face interactions and field studies) were conducted. The four studies in Chapter 4, four studies generally focus on the construct of legitimacy crises in the context of morality and competence, and examine the mediating function of a legitimacy crisis on the emotional and behavioral consequences. While participants in the first two studies worked on a scenario about a psychology intern in a hospital, participants in the last two studies dealt with unmoral behavior (<b>in-basket</b> <b>exercise</b> and a recall task about an unmoral behavior). Independent from the domain, all four studies of Chapter 4 provide evidence that legitimacy crises are judgments of a perceived violation of societal shared convictions. The results show the expected mediating function of legitimacy crises between the perception of the violation of societal shared convictions and moral emotions (guilt and shame). Whereas feelings of guilt led to an increase of moral behavior, feelings of shame decreased moral behavior. As an example for the moral domain, Chapter 5 takes a closer look on the role of bystanders in the context of social exclusion. Bystanders’ inactions violate the social norms of inclusion and equality. Until now, research on social exclusion has focused primarily on targets and perpetrators, demonstrating that both experience social exclusion situations as threatening. This chapter wants to expand this knowledge and improve the understanding of the psychological processes of bystanders to potentially facilitate interventions for social exclusion situations. The results of three studies with varying methods (recall and face-to-face interaction paradigm) strengthen the general findings of Chapter 4. Bystanders who evaluate their inaction as less appropriate report more feelings of shame and guilt which lead to more social defense reactions compared to targets. To extend the general findings on competence in Chapter 4, Chapter 6 exemplarily examines leaders who perceive that they are not able to meet the expectations of the leadership role in two field studies. The findings demonstrate that leaders, who perceived to be violating the societal expectations towards their role as leader, evaluated their actions as less appropriate thereby eliciting a higher extent of job insecurity that led to more silence behavior. Moreover, the results show that leader silence and follower silence are negatively related, especially when the leader is perceived as unjust. In line with the findings of Chapter 4 and 5, the construct of legitimacy crises is also a relevant mediator in the context of leadership. In general, the theoretical considerations and the empirical findings of this dissertation demonstrate the important role of the construct of legitimacy crises in various domains and emphasize its mediating function between the violation of societal shared convictions and the subsequent emotional and behavioral reactions. The findings provide theoretical and practical implications. To understand the underlying process of discrepancies with normative standards, the Self-Standards Model and the construct of legitimacy crises provide an important theoretical framework, which works independent from the specific domain. Understanding legitimacy crises provides starting points for the development of interventions for people experiencing legitimacy crises. Die Verletzung von gesellschaftlich geteilten Überzeugungen ist ein Phänomen, welches in verschiedenen Situationen des täglichen Lebens auftreten kann. Die bisherige Forschung hat dieses Phänomen in unterschiedlichen Bereichen (bspw., Moral und Kompetenz) getrennt betrachtet und mögliche Gemeinsamkeiten vernachlässigt. Diese Dissertation geht davon aus, dass die Verletzung von gesellschaftlich geteilten Überzeugungen in unterschiedlichen Bereichen zu dem gleichen Zustand führt, einer Legitimitätskrise, da gerade das Konzept der Legitimität mit gesellschaftlichen Normen und Werten eng verknüpft ist. Eine Legitimitätskrise ist die Wahrnehmung eines Individuums, dass deren Handlungen oder Eigenschaften in Bezug zu gesellschaftlichen Überzeugungen in einer bestimmten Situation gar nicht oder wenig angemessen sind. Ausgehend von der generellen Annahme, dass Legitimitätskrisen über bestehende Theorien im Rahmen der Verletzung von gesellschaftlichen Überzeugungen hinausgehen, trägt diese Arbeit zu drei generellen Punkten bei: Erstens, eine theoretische Integration und Weiterführung von übergreifenden theoretischen Rahmenmodellen in Bereichen Legitimität, Diskrepanzen und Bedrohungen. Zweitens, eine empirische Untersuchung von Legitimitätskrisen in den beiden zentralen Bereichen Moral und Kompetenz. Drittens, theoretische Entwicklung und empirische Untersuchung von emotionalen und behavioralen Konsequenzen von Legitimitätskrisen in den beiden Bereichen Moral und Kompetenz. Zur Erreichung dieser Punkte wird im Rahmen der Dissertation zunächst die generelle Bedeutung von Legitimität im Kontext sozial und organisationspsychologischer Forschung diskutiert, besonders die verschiedenen Perspektiven von Legitimität. Dies dient vor allem der Herausarbeitung eines tieferen Verständnisses von Selbst und Legitimität. Des Weiteren geht diese Arbeit näher darauf ein, dass Legitimitätskrisen bedrohlich für das eigene Selbst sind und wie Menschen auf der emotionalen und behavioralen Ebene damit umgehen. Zur empirischen Untersuchung dieser theoretischen Überlegungen wurden neun Studien in unterschiedlichen Bereichen mit verschiedenen Methoden (Szenarien, Erinnerung, direkte Interaktionen und Feldstudien) durchgeführt. Kapitel 4 beschäftigt sich in vier Studien mit dem Konstrukt der Legitimitätskrise im Kontext von Moral und Kompetenz. Dabei wird auch die mediierende Funktion auf emotionale und behaviorale Konsequenzen näher untersucht. Während die Teilnehmer in den ersten beiden Studien an einem Szenario über ein Praktikum in einem Krankenhaus arbeiten, beschäftigen sich die Teilnehmer der letzten beiden Studien mit unmoralischen Verhaltensweisen (Postkorbübung und Erinnerungsaufgabe über unmoralisches Verhalten). Unabhängig vom Bereich legen alle vier Studien in Kapitel 4 nahe, dass Legitimitätskrisen Bewertungen einer wahrgenommenen Verletzung von gesellschaftlich geteilten Überzeugungen sind. Die Ergebnisse zeigen die mediierende Funktion von Legitimitätskrisen zwischen der wahrgenommenen Verletzung gesellschaftlich geteilter Überzeugungen und moralischen Emotionen (Schuld und Scham). Während Gefühle von Schuld zu einem Anstieg von moralischem Verhalten führen, reduzieren Gefühle von Scham moralisches Verhalten. Beispielhaft für den moralischen Bereich, beschäftigt sich Kapitel 5 näher mit der Rolle von Bystandern im Rahmen von Sozialem Ausschluss. Das Nichthandeln von Bystandern verletzt dabei soziale Normen von Inklusion und Gleichheit. Die bisherige Forschung hat sich hauptsächlich mit Opfern und Tätern auseinandergesetzt und zeigt, dass beide Situationen Sozialen Ausschlusses als bedrohlich empfinden. Dieses Kapitel möchte den bisherigen Wissensstand erweitern und die Erkenntnisse über die psychologischen Prozesse bei Bystandern verbessern um mögliche Interventionen daraus ableiten zu können. Die Ergebnisse von drei Studien mit ganz unterschiedlichen Methoden (Erinnerung und direkte Interkation) stärken die Befunde aus Kapitel 4. Im Vergleich zu Opfern bewerten Bystander ihr Nichthandeln als weniger angemessen, berichten mehr Scham und Schuld, was wiederum zu mehr sozialen Verteidigungsreaktionen führt. Kapitel 6 vertieft die generellen Erkenntnisse aus Kapitel 4 im Bereich Kompetenz, indem es sich im Rahmen von zwei Feldstudien exemplarisch mit Führungskräften beschäftigt, welche sich nicht in der Lage sehen, die an sie gestellten Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Führungskräfte, die eine Verletzung von gesellschaftlich geteilten Überzeugungen an sich wahrnehmen, ihre Handlungen als weniger angemessen bewerten, was zu einem höheren Ausmaß an Jobunsicherheit führt, dass wiederum Schweigeverhalten erhöht. Außerdem zeigt sich, dass Schweigeverhalten von Führungskräften und Mitarbeitern in einem negativen Zusammenhang steht, vor allem wenn die Führungskraft als ungerecht wahrgenommen wird. Wie in Kapitel 4 und 5 zeigt sich auch hier, dass das Konstrukt der Legitimitätskrisen als relevanter Mediator im Rahmen von Führung angesehen werden kann. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass die theoretischen Überlegungen als auch empirischen Befunde dieser Dissertation zeigen, dass das Konstrukt der Legitimitätskrise in verschiedenen Bereichen eine wichtige Rolle spielt, vor allem die mediierende Funktion zwischen Verletzung gesellschaftlich geteilter Überzeugungen und dem unmittelbar nachfolgenden emotionalen und behavioralen Reaktionen. Aus den Ergebnissen lassen sich theoretische und praktische Implikationen ableiten. Um die zugrundeliegenden Prozesse von Diskrepanzen besser verstehen zu können, bietet das Self-Standards Model und das Konstrukt der Legitimitätskrise ein geeignetes Rahmenmodell, welches unabhängig von dem jeweiligen Bereich funktioniert. Des Weiteren liefern diese Erkenntnisse Ansatzpunkte um Interventionen für Menschen entwickeln zu können, deren Legitimitätswahrnehmung in eine Krise geraten ist...|$|E
