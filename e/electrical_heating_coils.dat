50|$|In the 1970s, {{glass-ceramic}} cooktops {{started to}} appear. Glass-ceramic has very low thermal conductivity, a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of practically zero, but lets infrared radiation pass very well. <b>Electrical</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coils</b> or infrared halogen lamps {{are used as}} heating elements. Because of its physical characteristics, the cooktop heats more quickly, less afterheat remains, and only the plate heats up while the adjacent surface remains cool. Also, these cooktops have a smooth surface and are thus easier to clean, but are markedly more expensive.|$|E

Silver-oil nanofluid prepared by Electrical Explosion of Wire technique and observed no nanoparticles agglomeration during nanofluid preparation process and carried out experiments. The average size of particles established to 20 nm. Nanofluids with various particle weight fractions of 0. 12 %wt., 0. 36 %wt. and 0. 72 %wt. were employed. The nanofluid flowing between the tubes is <b>heated</b> by an <b>electrical</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> wrapped around it. The effects of different parameters such as flow Reynolds number, diameter ratio and nanofluid particle concentration on heat transfer coefficient are studied.

For extending the previous study by Jafarimoghaddam et al., we selected the nanoparticles with the average size of 20 nm and also other conditions of the experiment are based on Jafarimoghaddam et al. (2016) [1]. The applied nanofluid was prepared by Electrical Explosion of Wire technique with no accumulation during the experiment. The tube was <b>heated</b> using an <b>electrical</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> covered it. The effects of different parameters such as flow Reynolds number and nanofluid particle concentration on heat transfer coefficient are studied. The acquired experimental data were used to establish a correlation for predicting Nusselt number of nanofluid flow inside the annular tube. This correlation has been presented by using the exponential regression analysis and least square method. Correlation is valid for Cu/Base Ethylene Glycol nanofluid flow with the volume concentrations between 0. 011 and 0. 171 in the hydrodynamically fully developed laminar flow regime with Re< 160 which is most applicable in micro heat sinks...|$|R

Therefore {{it is necessary that}} these grains are properly dried and stored to ensure availability and wholesomeness throughout the year. Advancements have taken place in the practice of drying since the first world war.

Main objectives of this study were to improve on the design of an existing cabinet grain dryer (to redesign the already existing cabinet grain dryer so as to: (i) Optimize efficiency at low cost (ii) Reduce total time of drying (iii) Produce viable and quality grain. Approach: The improvement on the design of the existing cabinet dryer had been achieved through proper focus on the selection of power source, materials and other design criteria for the various components of the existing one.

The dryer also consisted of a thermostat which turns off the machine if inlet temperature exceeds 40 °C. Results: The result of the improvement on the design of a cabinet grain dryer showed that; (i) It was less costly (ii) It was cheap to maintain since the fan is the only moving component and can hardly become faulty (iii) drying time of the grain was reduced (iv) The machine ergonomic; operation of the machine does not require specialization (v) The machine is safer to operate since the use of gas has been eliminated (vi) Time between two batches was reduced with the introduction of a trolley (vii) Energy for loading or unloading reduced since the trays can be loaded and unloaded outside the cabinet. Conclusion: Drying of grains safer since fire hazards were reduced owing to the use of gas in the previous design. Heater supplied the right quantity of heat and incorporates a fan which supplies right quantity of air needed to distribute this heat evenly to all grains in drying chamber.

In this work CH 4 and CO 2 were converted to product gas which mainly contains H 2, CO, CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 O. Chemical equilibrium analysis used to predict the product gas composition at different CH 4 /CO 2 ratio and different temperature.

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a variable speed fan and a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through – the fan is upstream of the <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> ...|$|R
