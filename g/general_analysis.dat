25|$|Self-categorization {{theory is}} a social {{psychological}} theory that describes {{the circumstances under which}} a person will perceive collections of people (including themselves) as a group, as well as the consequences of perceiving people in group terms. Although the theory is often introduced as an explanation of psychological group formation (which was one of its early goals), it is more accurately thought of as <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> of the functioning of categorization processes in social perception and interaction that speaks to issues of individual identity as much as group phenomena.|$|E
25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> {{strategy}} {{begins with}} high resolution cameras {{to look for}} features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize {{a small portion of}} it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{analysis is}} currently being used in AM fungal research to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes from target species or experimental samples. The most common tool or method is to use functional gene array (FGA) technology, a specialized microarray that contains probes for genes that are functionally important in microbial processes such as carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus cycling. FGAs {{have the ability to}} simultaneously examine many functional genes. This technique is typically used for <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> of functional microbial genes, but when complemented with genetic sequencing, inferences can be made about the connection between fungal community composition and microbial functionality.|$|E

25|$|Nicole Oresme at the University of Paris and the Italian Giovanni di Casali {{independently}} provided graphical {{demonstrations of}} this relationship, {{asserting that the}} area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total distance traveled. In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid's Elements, Oresme made a more detailed <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated {{the sum of the}} odd numbers are the square numbers, the total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.|$|E
25|$|Physics is the <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> of nature, {{conducted}} {{in order to}} understand how the universe behaves. On the other hand, the study of meteorological weather patterns or human behavior is only of interest to humans themselves. The point is that having a perspective on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that has a perspective must be part of the physical reality to which it applies its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have a perspective on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.|$|E

2500|$|Nucleic acids {{are often}} {{denatured}} by including urea in the buffer, while proteins are denatured using sodium dodecyl sulfate, usually {{as part of}} the SDS-PAGE process. [...] For full denaturation of proteins, it is also necessary to reduce the covalent disulfide bonds that stabilize their tertiary and quaternary structure, a method called reducing PAGE. Reducing conditions are usually maintained by the addition of beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. For <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> of protein samples, reducing PAGE is {{the most common form of}} protein electrophoresis.|$|E
2500|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} usually {{assumes that}} marginal changes are infinitesimals or limits. (Though this assumption makes the analysis less robust, it increases tractability.) One is therefore often told that [...] "marginal" [...] {{is synonymous with}} [...] "very small", though in more <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> {{this may not be}} operationally true (and would not in any case be literally true). [...] Frequently, economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a resource, because decisions are often made in terms of units; marginalism seeks to explain unit prices in terms of such marginal values.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{systematic}} {{classification of}} amphorae types was {{undertaken by the}} German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphorae deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio {{at the end of}} the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the [...] In his studies of the amphorae deposit he was the first one to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called Dressel table, which is still used today for many types. Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications which are usually named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951, and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977–1978. The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989, whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat. Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970. Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955. For a <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella, and Peacock and Williams.|$|E

6000|$|One of {{the merits}} of the <b>general</b> <b>analysis</b> of mind which we shall be {{concerned}} with in the following lectures is that it removes the atmosphere of mystery from the phenomena brought to light by the psycho-analysts. Mystery is delightful, but unscientific, since it depends upon ignorance. Man has developed out of the animals, and there is no serious gap between him and the amoeba. Something closely analogous to knowledge and desire, as regards its effects on behaviour, exists among animals, even where what we call [...] "consciousness" [...] is hard to believe in; something equally analogous exists in ourselves in cases where no trace of [...] "consciousness" [...] can be found. It is therefore natural to suppose that, what ever may be the correct definition of [...] "consciousness," [...] "consciousness" [...] is not the essence of life or mind. In the following lectures, accordingly, this term will disappear until we have dealt with words, when it will re-emerge as mainly a trivial and unimportant outcome of linguistic habits.|$|E
