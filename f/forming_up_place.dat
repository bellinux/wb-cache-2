5000|$|The {{battalion}} {{was part}} of the 93rd Infantry Brigade, which had been given the task to capture [...] "RAJA" [...] and [...] "RANI".

5000|$|There was {{no change}} in brigade plan except 2nd Battalion, The Sikh Regiment was given the [...] "RAJA" [...] picquet and 3rd Battalion the Dogra Regiment [...] "RANI" [...] {{features}} as their objectives. RCL guns were taken forward to soften up the defences of [...] "RAJA" [...] and [...] "RANI" [...] picquets as 3.5 inch Rocket Launchers {{did not seem to}} have any impact on the defences. Captain Kalam Singh of the battalion manpacked the 106mm RCL and carried them forward on mules, along a narrow track in the hilly terrain. One of the RCL guns sights got damaged. He deployed these RCL guns ahead of the Brigade <b>Forming</b> <b>Up</b> <b>Place,</b> silencing several enemy machine gun posts. The Brigade objectives [...] "RAJA" [...] and [...] "RANI" [...] were captured after a very stiff fight but the two assaulting Battalions suffered heavy casualties. The battalion had to capture one of the most dominating features in the area. Second Lieutenant Mohinder Singh led the platoon stealthily and reached the objective. After a stiff resistance the enemy withdrew leaving two dead and one wounded. The next morning at 0700 hours, the company commander, Major Megh Singh, attacked Aridhok with a coy less a platoon of ‘D’ Company without any fire support in broad daylight. Choosing the most difficult approach, Second Lieutenant Mohinder Singh and his platoon completely surprised the enemy. For this gallant action Lance Naik Abdul Rehman was awarded the Sena Medal. The Regimental Medical officers of the tree Battalions were moved forward to ‘C’ Company position to treat the casualties. Subedar Major Hoshiar Singh, SM, organized the evacuation of the casualties to the Advance Dressing Station established at Poonch and the Light Hospital established at Surankot {{with the help of the}} 300 villagers. Mention must be made to Mrs. Maini (mother of Lieutenant Colonel S.D. Maini, ex. commanding officer of the battalion); she organised and mustered civilians of their help.|$|E

5|$|The first {{element of}} the British 6th Airborne Division to land was the 8th Parachute Battalion, part of the 3rd Parachute Brigade under Brigadier James Hill. The brigade {{actually}} dropped nine minutes earlier than scheduled, but successfully landed in drop zoneA, while facing significant small-arms and 20mm anti-aircraft fire. The brigade suffered a number of casualties as it engaged the German forces in the Diersfordter Wald, but by 11:00hours the drop zone was all but completely clear of enemy forces and all battalions of the brigade had <b>formed</b> <b>up.</b> The key <b>place</b> of Schnappenberg was captured by the 9th Parachute Battalion {{in conjunction with the}} 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, the latter unit having lost its Commanding Officer (CO), Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nicklin, to German small-arms fire only moments after he had landed. Despite taking casualties the brigade cleared the area of German forces, and by 13:45 Brigadier Hill could report that the brigade had secured all of its objectives. Canadian medical orderly Corporal Frederick George Topham was awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts to recover casualties and take them for treatment, despite his own wounds, and great personal danger.|$|R
