500|$|Chrysippus had a {{long and}} {{successful}} career of resisting the attacks of the Academy and hoped not simply to defend Stoicism against the assaults of the past, but also against all possible attack in the future. He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of Stoicism.

500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think <b>it</b> <b>was...</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her".

Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness.

2500|$|In his villa in Rapallo, Sibelius wrote: [...] "Don Juan. I {{was sitting}} in the dark in my castle when a {{stranger}} entered.

At last the stranger began to sing — then Don Juan knew who <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> death." [...] On the same piece of paper, he wrote the bassoon theme for the [...] first part of the second movement, out of which a pizzicatoed string [...] "walking bass" [...] stems. Two months later in Florence, he drafted the second theme, with a note reading [...] "Christus," [...] perhaps symbolizing the death and resurrection of the movement, or even of Finland. Scholars also suggest that Sibelius modeled the second movement after Dante's Divine Comedy. Nonetheless, Robert Kajanus said that the movement [...] "strikes one as the most broken-hearted protest against all the injustice that threatens at the present time to deprive the sun of its light and our flowers of their scent." [...] The movement culminates with a towering, brassy theme, following by an ethereal, mist-like motif in the divided strings.|$|E
2500|$|But {{first it}} was {{necessary}} to provide accommodations for the newcomers, a difficult problem to resolve given the cramped proportions of the city of Rio at that time. In particular, there were few homes suitable for the nobility, {{especially in the case of}} the royal family, who were installed in the viceregal palace, known today as the Paço Imperial (Imperial Palace). Though large, it was comfortless and nothing like Portuguese palaces. As large as <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not enough to accommodate everyone, so neighboring buildings were also requisitioned, such as the Carmelite Convent, the town hall, and even the jail. To meet the needs of other nobles, and to install new government offices, innumerable small residences were hastily expropriated, their proprietors arbitrarily ejected, at times violently in the face of resistance. Despite the efforts of Viceroy Marcos de Noronha e Brito and of Joaquim José de Azevedo, the regent was still poorly accommodated. Merchant Elias Antônio Lopes offered his country house, the Quinta da Boa Vista, a sumptuous villa in excellent location that immediately met with the prince's satisfaction. Renovations and expansion transformed this into the Paço de São Cristóvão ("Palace of Saint Christopher"). Carlota Joaquina, for her part, preferred to settle on a farm near the beach of Botafogo, continuing her habit of living apart from her husband.|$|E

2500|$|West next {{starred in}} Every Day's a Holiday (1937) for Paramount before their {{association}} {{came to an}} end. Again, due to censor cuts, the film performed below its goal. Censorship had made West's sexually suggestive brand of humor impossible for the studios to distribute. West, along with other stellar performers, was put {{on a list of}} actors called [...] "Box Office Poison" [...] by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners Association. Others on the list were Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire, Dolores del Río, Katharine Hepburn, and Kay Francis. The attack was published as a paid advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter and was taken seriously by the fearful studio executives. The association argued that these stars' high salaries and extreme public popularity did not affect their ticket sales, thus hurt the exhibitors. This did not stop producer David O. Selznick, who next offered West the role of the sage madam, Belle Watling, the only woman ever to truly understand Rhett Butler, in his film version of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind after Tallulah Bankhead turned him down. West also declined the part, claiming that as <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too small for an established star, and that she would need to rewrite her lines to suit her own persona.

2500|$|A {{private road}} once ran across {{all of the}} Hollins holdings, {{crossing}} Bayview Ave and through the estate of HB Hollins Jr., where it continued into what is now Hecksher State Park. [...] The outline of this road can be seen running through the woods {{on one of the}} last undeveloped parcels of land off White Oak Lane. [...] As recently as the 1980s, one area resident was concerned as the road was still listed as a legal right-of-way in his property deed. [...] a local historian believes that parts of this road, particularly the part of it {{on the east side of}} bayview avenue which included the driveway to HB Hollins Jrs. house, Crick Holly, was one of the earliest roads in the area and connected the first Nichol settlement located on the shore of the bay in Hecksher Park with Gibbs Patent, and a grist mill which Nichol and Gibbs operated on the west side of Chaplain's Creek and on to the village of islip. [...] This road ran diagonal across all of the known and modern, grid like, roads in the area and the last of it, with the exception of what remains in Hecksher Park, was the driveway to HB Hollins Jrs. Crick Holly; if this was in fact a colonial era road, and there is strong evidence <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> obliterated with little attention when Crick Holly was developed in the 1980s.
