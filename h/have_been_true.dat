5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it {{as likely to have}} been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, the Life is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, this would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> for Paraceratherium; he points to robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea.|$|E
25|$|Another idea is {{that the}} Viking {{population}} had exceeded the agricultural potential of their homeland. This may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> of western Norway, where there were few reserves of land, but it is unlikely the rest of Scandinavia was experiencing famine.|$|E

25|$|Despite their {{adaptation}} {{to living in}} trees, sloths (like many other rainforest animals) make competent swimmers. This is likely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> of the extinct ground sloths, as well, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that megalonychid sloths were able to colonise the Antilles by the Oligocene, and that the megalonychid Pliometanastes and the mylodontid Thinobadistes were able to colonise North America about 9 million years ago, well before the existence of the Isthmus of Panama. Additionally, the nothrotheriid Thalassocnus of the west coast of South America became adapted to a semiaquatic marine lifestyle.|$|E

25|$|If the {{ratios of}} the 80% SERT {{occupancy}} dosage and the approved clinical dosage range are calculated and compared for SSRIs, SNRIs, and clomipramine, it can be deduced that clomipramine {{is by far the}} strongest SRI used medically. The lowest approved dosage of clomipramine can be estimated to be roughly comparable in SERT occupancy to the maximum approved dosages of the strongest SSRIs and SNRIs. Because their mechanism of action was originally not known and dose-ranging studies were never conducted, first-generation antipsychotics were dramatically overdosed in patients. It has been suggested that the same may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> for clomipramine and other TCAs.|$|E

25|$|Sparse {{remnants}} of trails and other artifacts indicate a sporadic early Polynesian presence. A canoe, a blue bead, pieces of bamboo, and other relics of early settlers have been found. The island's prehistoric settlement {{may have begun}} about 1000 BC when eastern Melanesians traveled north and may have extended down to Rawaki, Kanton, Manra and Orona of the Phoenix Islands, 500 to 700km southeast. K.P. Emery, an ethnologist for Honolulu's Bernice P. Bishop Museum, indicated that settlers on Manra Island were apparently of two distinct groups, one Polynesian and the other Micronesian, hence the same might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> on Howland Island, though no proof {{of this has been}} found.|$|E
25|$|Alienation was {{not always}} possible, and {{sometimes}} {{the permission of the}} lord was required. It is the opinion of Pollock and Maitland that {{in the middle of the}} 13th century the tenant enjoyed a large power of disposing of his tenement by act inter vivos, though this was subject to some restraints in favor of his lord. Other opinions have been expressed. Coke regarded the English tradition as one of ancient liberty dictated by custom. The tenant had relative freedom to alienate all or part of his estate. Blackstone was of a differing conclusion. The “learning of feuds” started with the inalienability of the fief as a starting point. Pollock and Maitland believe Coke’s opinion to be the more valid one. Both views may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true.</b> Modern scholars may have given more weight to the written and declared law of the Normans than existed in reality.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} the {{conspiracy}} in Rome was a massive blow to Catiline. Upon hearing {{of the death of}} Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura and the others, many men deserted his army, reducing the size from about 10,000 to a mere 3,000. He and his ill-equipped army began to march towards Gaul and then back towards Rome several times in vain attempts to avoid a battle. However, Catiline was forced to fight when Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer blocked him from the north with three legions. So, he chose to engage Antonius Hybrida's army near Pistoia, hoping that he could defeat Antonius in the ensuing battle and dishearten the other Republican armies. Catiline also hoped that he might have an easier battle against Antonius who, he assumed, would fight less determinedly, as he had once been allied with Catiline. In fact, Catiline may have still believed that Antonius Hybrida was conspiring with him—which may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true,</b> as Antonius Hybrida claimed to be ill {{on the day of the}} battle.|$|E

25|$|A charismatic monk and {{powerful}} orator named Peter the Hermit of Amiens was the {{spiritual leader of}} the movement. He was known for riding a donkey and dressing in simple clothing. He had vigorously preached the crusade throughout northern France and Flanders. He {{claimed to have been}} appointed to preach by Christ himself (and supposedly had a divine letter to prove it), and it is likely that some of his followers thought he, not Urban, was the true originator of the crusading idea. It is often believed that Peter's army was a band of illiterate, incompetent peasants who had no idea where they were going, and who believed that every city of any size they encountered on their way was Jerusalem itself; this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> for some, but the long tradition for pilgrimages to Jerusalem ensured that the location and distance of the city were well known. While the majority were unskilled in fighting, there were some well-trained minor knights leading them, such as Walter Sans-Avoir (also mistakenly known as Walter the Penniless), who was experienced in warfare. A list of known members of Peter's army can be found in Riley-Smith, et al, A Database of Crusaders to the Holy Land.|$|E
25|$|Fossils of Confuciusornis {{show that}} it had an {{exceptionally}} large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this crista deltopectoralis was with Confuciusornis pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight miscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of Archaeopteryx, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidum. The sternum (breastbone) was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel {{may or may not}} have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make Confuciusornis incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight; the same would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>true</b> for Archaeopteryx.|$|E
