5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he thought <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he {{lost control of the}} robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{running in}} {{practice}} and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead when he pitted, {{and he went on}} to take his third victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton's one hundredth Grand Prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on the third lap and spent most of the race {{at the tail end of}} the field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem. Confusion briefly reigned when Hamilton, in seventeenth place at the time, began lapping faster than the leaders and sought to unlap himself. Sebastian Vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by McLaren to force both him and Alonso to drive defensively against Hamilton, slowing them down enough to allow team-mate Jenson Button to leap-frog them at the second round of stops; Vettel lost a position to Button, but Alonso was unaffected, as Ferrari pitted him before Hamilton could interfere with his race. Button briefly looked as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pace to pass Alonso for the race lead, but the race was deadlocked in the final twenty laps, and Button began to fade in the final five laps of the race. The race was marked by another technical dispute regarding Red Bull Racing, who were referred to the stewards by FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on the Red Bull RB8. The stewards elected to take no action against Red Bull, stating that the team had not violated any of the technical regulations, but noted that they did not accept all of the arguments presented by the team when asked to explain. The stewards were less forgiving of Vettel, who ran wide at the hairpin while trying to pass Button and could only complete the pass outside the limits of the circuit. Vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty, demoting him to fifth overall. With Button promoted to second, Kimi Räikkönen inherited third place and Kamui Kobayashi was classified a career-best fourth.|$|E

In Florence Steno focused on the muscular system and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steno proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.|$|E

500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|Whilst Gwen by {{the third}} series has become a more militant character, Rhys retains his everyman status and takes {{on the role of}} {{audience}} surrogate; press material describes him as [...] "the ordinary guy in the street" [...] and [...] "the normal person's eyes and ears" [...] who [...] "says what he thinks about the situations Torchwood find themselves in, bringing the reality back to them". Paul Collins comments of the significance of Rhys having the first dialogue in the serial, remarking that this is Torchwoods [...] "determination to establish its domestic credentials before subverting them". Rhys becomes a reluctant hero; Kai Owen states that he [...] "would rather not get involved <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> choice", but when faced with the life-or-death situations in the serial [...] "he doesn't run away from it" [...] because the character has [...] "seen so many things". This, in Owen's eyes, makes the Rhys seen in Children of Earth a [...] "very brave hero who has grown in stature". Rhys retains core character status for the fourth series, [...] Whilst Kai Owen explains that Rhys will always be at the forefront of [...] "Gwen's troubles or fights or adventures" [...] because of his concern for her, he remains unafraid to tell her when she has become too consumed by her job. Davies links the relationship between Gwen and Rhys in the fourth series to the show's continued exploration of human sexuality, stating that [...] "open sexuality has to include everything" [...] including [...] "a husband/wife great big crime-fighting team... happily in love".|$|E

500|$|In 1813, {{with the}} tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously {{consider}} the question of Charlotte's marriage. [...] The Prince Regent and his advisors decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. [...] Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself {{and many of the}} guests. [...] Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers. [...] Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. [...] According to Charlotte, [...] "He spoke as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most improper ideas of my inclinations. [...] I see that he is compleatly [...] poisoned against me, and that he will never come round." [...] She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry [...] "the Orange or the Cheese" [...] (a reference to Gloucester cheese), [...] "Slender Billy" [...] or [...] "Silly Billy". [...] The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that [...] "I could not quit this country, as Queen of England still less" [...] and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to [...] "visit his frogs solo". [...] However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. [...] She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.|$|E
