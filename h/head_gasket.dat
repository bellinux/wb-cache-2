25|$|The 8C engine, {{first entered}} at the 1931 Mille Miglia road race through Italy, had a common crankcase, now with two alloy four-cylinder blocks, which also {{incorporated}} the heads. The {{bore and stroke}} (and hence rods, pistons and the like), {{were the same as}} the 6C 1750 (bore: 65mm, stroke: 88mm 2,336cc). There was no separate head, and no <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> to fail, but this made valve maintenance more difficult. A central gear tower drove the overhead camshafts, superchargers and ancillaries. As far as production cars are concerned, the 8C engine powered two models, the 8C 2300 (1931–1935) and the even more rare and expensive 8C 2900 (1936–1941), bore increased to 68mm and stroke to 100mm (2,905cc).|$|E
25|$|Issues dropped, and in 1988 {{the service}} was reduced from 5 to 2 days a week, in part perhaps due to {{increasing}} mechanical difficulties. The once famously reliable van had problems with its radiator ensuring {{it had to be}} constantly stopped and attended by the last Mobile Librarian, Malcolm Fletcher. Then it blew a <b>head</b> <b>gasket.</b> With the onset of amalgamation of Birkenhead into the wider North Shore Libraries it was superseded by the system Mobile anyway, and the Bedford was eventually retired in 1992. Not wanted by Motat or the Devonport Museum it eventually went to the North Shore Vintage Car Club. Over its eleven years of operation it had issued over 163 thousand items.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{several other}} Australian drivers {{including}} Alan Jones and Larry Perkins, Brock {{did not seek}} a full-time racing career outside Australia. He did attempt the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times in privateer vehicles, firstly in 1976 in the Team Brock BMW 3.0CSL which was bought in South Africa in late 1975 and shipped to Melbourne where it was completely stripped and rebuilt. His co-driver was former Aussie and UK resident Brian Muir with the BMW lasting 17 hours before a <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> blew. He then returned for the 1981 race teamed with former HDT teammate Colin Bond and Bathurst co-driver Jim Richards in the Porsche Cars Australia #74 Porsche 924 Carrera GTR but while the team practiced, they were only named as a reserve, not participating in the race itself.|$|E

25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} six months, the Carlins again made modifications to their vessel, {{with the most}} important being a large, purpose-built tank {{that was to be}} towed behind the craft. This increased the total fuel capacity of Half-Safe to 735 gallons (3,337 L), with the vessel also carrying 30 gallons (136 L) of water, eight gallons (36 L) of oil, and six weeks' worth of provisions. The couple left Halifax on 19 July 1950, and, after a 32-day voyage, arrived on Flores, the most westerly island of the Azores. Their landing was well-received, with LIFE featuring the crossing in a multiple-page article later that year, which also featured many of the Carlins' photographs. However, the journey had not occurred without mishap – Carlin was forced to remove the cylinder head several times in order to clean the carbon from the valves and replace the <b>head</b> <b>gasket,</b> and the couple lost radio contact halfway through the voyage, leading to fears they had been lost at sea. From Flores, the couple progressed to Horta on the island of Faial, a distance of [...] They then travelled to Madeira, having obtained surplus fuel from a passing Portuguese cruiser midway through the trip. Although originally expected to head directly to Lisbon, Portugal, from Madeira, the couple instead chose to head for Morocco via the Canary Islands, coming ashore at Cap Juby in the Spanish territory of Rio de Oro on 23 February 1951.|$|E
5000|$|RPO LB7 (engine code [...] "1") {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2001 and continued until early-2004. It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and an experimental composite design cylinder head. The most common issue with the LB7 is injector failure, so common that a special policy bulletin was issued (#04039B). Fuel leaked and entered the crankcase, causing oil dilution. Early on, customers came forward complaining of severe overheating, and in some situations, blown <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Initially GM denied it was a problem, but after being sued by a consumer group, GM relented and included overheating and blown <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> as a warranted item.|$|R
50|$|Some wasserboxers were {{plagued by}} water jacket gasket {{failures}} (often erroneously {{referred to as}} <b>head</b> <b>gaskets)</b> due to several design issues.

50|$|Finally, {{although}} pre-production engines cast by {{an outside}} foundry performed well, those fitted to production cars were made very poorly in house by a plant troubled with industrial unrest and poor quality control.

2500|$|Owing {{to a large}} {{error in}} the factory head bolt torque {{specifications}} (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> {{in lieu of a}} copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown head gaskets.

5000|$|Raising the {{compression}} ratio {{by reducing the}} size of the combustion chamber, which makes more efficient use of the cylinder pressure developed and leading to more rapid burning of fuel, by using larger compression height pistons or thinner <b>head</b> <b>gaskets,</b> or by using a milling machine or [...] "shaving" [...] the cylinder head.

50|$|A poorly {{maintained}} {{cooling system}} could {{also lead to}} overheating and, especially with the higher stressed turbo engines, <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> problems.The <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> problem has been treated with {{the adoption of a}} multi-layer steel <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> which replaces the fiber one.|$|E
5000|$|This {{combined}} with the early practice of installing the <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> with plastic locating dowels, which subsequently melted when the engines overheated, allowed the head gaskets to [...] "walk."

50|$|The {{condition}} of a <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> is typically investigated by checking the compression pressure with a pressure gauge, or better, a leak-down test, and/or noting {{any indication of}} combustion gases in the cooling system on a water-cooled engine. Oil mixed with coolant and excessive coolant loss with no apparent cause, or presence of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gases in the expansion tank of the cooling system can also be signs of <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> problems. A good sign of <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> failure on water-cooled engines {{is the presence of}} a substance that resembles mayonnaise in the oil, often to be seen on the dipstick, or oil filler cap.

50|$|General Motors marine {{automobile}} {{engines are}} based on a gasoline truck engine.
