40|$|Abstract. The {{delivery}} and courier services are entering {{a period of}} rapid change due to the recent technological advancements, E-commerce competition and crowdsourcing business models. These revolutions im-pose new challenges to the well studied vehicle routing problem by de-manding a) more ad-hoc and near real time computation- as opposed to nightly batch jobs- of delivery routes for large number of <b>delivery</b> <b>locations,</b> and b) the {{ability to deal with}} the dynamism due to the changing traffic conditions on road networks. In this paper, we study the Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (TDVRP) that enables both efficient and accurate solutions for large number of delivery loca-tions on real world road network. Previous Operation Research (OR) approaches are not suitable to address the aforementioned new chal-lenges in delivery business because they all rely on a time-consuming a priori data-preparation phase (i. e., the computation of a cost matrix between every pair of <b>delivery</b> <b>locations</b> at each time interval). Instead, we propose a spatial-search-based framework that utilizes an on-the-fly shortest path computation eliminating the OR data-preparation phase. To further improve the efficiency, we adaptively choose the more promis-ing <b>delivery</b> <b>locations</b> and operators to reduce unnecessary search of the solution space. Our experiments with real road networks and real traffic data and <b>delivery</b> <b>locations</b> show that our algorithm can solve a TD-VRP instance with 1000 <b>delivery</b> <b>locations</b> within 20 minutes, which is 8 times faster than the state-of-the-art approach, while achieving similar accuracy. ...|$|R

Both maternal and neonatal health outcomes improve when skilled personnel provide delivery services within health facilities. Determinants of <b>delivery</b> <b>location</b> {{are crucial to}} promoting health facility deliveries, but {{little research has been}} done on this issue in Ghana. This study explored factors influencing <b>delivery</b> <b>location</b> in predominantly rural communities in Ghana. Data were collected from 1, 500 women aged 15 - 49 years with live or stillbirths that occurred between January 2011 and April 2013. This was done within the three sites operating Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems, i. e., the Dodowa (Greater Accra Region), Kintampo (Brong Ahafo Region), and Navrongo (Upper-East Region) Health Research Centers in Ghana. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of <b>delivery</b> <b>location,</b> controlling for covariates that were statistically significant in univariable regression models. Of 1, 497 women included in the analysis, 75. 6 % of them selected health facilities as their <b>delivery</b> <b>location.</b> After adjusting for confounders, the following factors were associated with health facility delivery across all three sites: healthcare provider's influence on deciding health facility delivery, (AOR = 13. 47; 95 % CI 5. 96 - 30. 48), place of residence (AOR = 4. 49; 95 % CI 1. 14 - 17. 68), possession of a valid health insurance card (AOR = 1. 90; 95 % CI 1. 29 - 2. 81), and socio-economic status measured by wealth quintiles (AOR = 2. 83; 95 % CI 1. 43 - 5. 60). In addition to known factors such as place of residence, socio-economic status, and possession of valid health insurance, this study identified one more factor associated with health facility delivery: healthcare provider's influence.

40|$|The present paper studies a {{generalization}} of the less-than-truckload pickup and delivery problem. The problem at hand arises in the hinterland of container terminal where empty and loaded containers {{have to be}} transported between a container depot {{and a set of}} customer locations. However, requests including empty containers are only partially specified. That is, either the pickup location or the <b>delivery</b> <b>location</b> of a request including the transportation of an empty container is a priori known. Customers who demand an empty container do not care which specific empty container is provided, i. e., while the <b>delivery</b> <b>location</b> is given, the pickup location is part of the problem's solution. To solve this problem, an iterated three-phase heuristic is introduced. The first phase completes the partially specified requests, the second phase solves a standard pickup and delivery problem, the third phase changes parameters of the objective function and the process iterates. Computational results on a set of 1, 000 test instances are presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two stochastic {{variants of}} the Share-a-Ride problem: one with stochastic travel times {{and one with}} stochastic <b>delivery</b> <b>locations.</b> Both variants are formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model with recourse. The objective is to maximize the expected profit of serving a set of passengers and parcels using a set of homogeneous vehicles. Our solution methodology integrates an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic and three sampling strategies for the scenario generation (fixed sample size sampling, sample average approximation, and sequential sampling procedure). A computational study is carried out to compare the proposed approaches. The {{results show that the}} convergence rate depends on the source of stochasticity in the problem: stochastic <b>delivery</b> <b>locations</b> converge faster than stochastic travel times according to the numerical test. The sample average approximation and the sequential sampling procedure show a similar performance. The performance of the fixed sample size sampling is better compared to the other two approaches. The results suggest that the stochastic information is valuable in real-life and can dramatically improve the performance of a taxi sharing system, compared to deterministic solutions...|$|R
