Cote de Pablo is occasionally {{required to perform}} dialogues in Hebrew, Ziva's native language. She said of the process, [...] "When I learn it, I learn it like a prayer, chanting it for a while.

50|$|The transcriptions of {{the tune}} for {{different}} sets of words vary both in notes and in rhythmic phrasing. The version in The Beggar's Opera differs most widely, {{with most of the}} dotted rhythms smoothed out into a regular succession of crotchets. We cannot say whether Scott had any particular variation in mind; he professed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for time but little or none for tune. All are in a minor key, and their melancholy and their subtle rhythms will surprise anyone familiar only with the setting now best known.|$|E

At {{one time}} or another, Martin {{employed}} Merv Griffin, Buddy Clark, pianists Sid Appleman and Terry Shand, saxophonist Elmer Feldkamp, Stuart Wade, violinist Eddie Stone, and many others. Helen Ward was a singer for Martin just before she joined Benny Goodman's new band.|$|R

Stephens told interviewer Tony Capobianco, [...] "Accents have interested me since I was a little kid.

5000|$|Valley of the Dolls {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a roman a clef, with its characters based on such famous figures as Judy Garland, Carole Landis, Dean Martin, and Ethel Merman. In 1973, after publication of her third novel, Susann said, [...] "They can keep calling it that roman a clef. It'll only make my books sell, I don't care."

He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for wheels, and the {{trampling}} of hoofs; {{but there}} appeared to be so many horses and carriages rattling towards them, from a distance, {{that it was impossible to}} form a guess at their number.

[...] He praised Highsmith's writing: [...] "Without overwriting, without belaboring a point, she skillfully probes deeper and deeper.

'Picking one up' was apt to {{be needed}} by Herbert, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> and voice, but had always {{regarded}} it as 'bosh' to cultivate them, except for the immediately practical purposes that had of late been forced on him.

[...] It contains [...] "...heavy flowing strings and emotion-filled keyboard melodies, as on 'A Lover's Return'", states the Johnson County Sun, while Ross Boissoneau of Allmusic contradicts saying, [...] "...Joseph <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for melody, but he pretty much refrains from Yanni's trademark sweeping, whooshing synth swells." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{content of}} the louvação can be improvised as well, so <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> is {{critical}} to singing the chorus. The louvação, just as the ladainha, is strophic, {{but there is no}} variation in the melody from one louvação to another. However while it is most often sung in a major tonality, sometimes it can be heard in minor if the ladainha is also minor. The chorus is sung in unison, though an occasional harmonization, usually a third above, is sometimes used as a punctuation by one of the singers.|$|R
25|$|Laurents {{decided to}} develop a story with a similar {{character}} at its center, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first instinct {{was to create a}} crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> way with words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|R

Yet Breton was an old literary language with the first manuscripts in it surviving from a century earlier than such manuscripts in French.(3) ...|$|R
50|$|Smirnov {{was born}} in the city of Moscow, Russia on April 30, 2003. Mikhail's success as a singer is no less {{impressive}} considering his family background - born to parents who are mathematicians, who both graduated from the Maths & Mechanics faculty at the Moscow State University. When he was three years old, Mikhail suddenly began to stutter and his parents sent him to singing lessons as part of the therapy. There, his first vocal coach noticed that Mikhail not only <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for music but also a wonderful voice. His mother, who also graduated from music school and plays piano, cultivated Mikhail’s love of music throughout his childhood.|$|R
50|$|Vampilov started {{school in}} 1944 and was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> student, but not outstanding. He drew well and enjoyed singing.

He took part {{both in the}} school {{orchestra}} and, in the university, in an ensemble of folk instruments. Other activities duringhis school years included fishing, soccer, the school’s drama circle, and a passion for writing verses, which he hid from his family and read to friendssworn to secrecy. In 1954 Vampilov graduated from the gymnasium and took the entrance exams for the Department of Historical Philology at theIrkutsk State University. Since he failed the German exam, {{he had to take}} the entrance exams again in 1955.|$|R
5000|$|Harmony {{has so far}} {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Gregory Heaney from Allmusic, although applauding {{the production of the}} album, criticized the album's lyrics, saying that [...] "while the production has grown up, Drew still seems {{to be in the same}} place as a songwriter. ... Though Drew has proven that he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for melody, his over-sweetened lyrics rob the songs of any real emotional weight." [...] Scott Heisel from Alternative Press, however, was more positive, stating that [...] "the most hated man in emo ... sounds even stronger than he did on his debut album, turning in consistently better vocal performances that demonstrate a slight hint of ... maturity while handling lyrical topics both serious ... and not-so-much." ...|$|R
6000|$|One word as to {{his musical}} skill and his {{performance}} on the flute, which comes up so invariably in all his fireside revels. He really knew nothing of music scientifically; he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear,</b> and may <b>have</b> played sweetly; but we are told he could not read a note of music. Roubillac, the statuary, once played a trick upon him in this respect. He pretended to score down an air as the poet played it, but put down crotchets and semi-breves at random. When he had finished, Goldsmith cast his eyes over it and pronounced it correct! It is possible that his execution in music was like his style in writing; in sweetness and melody he may <b>have</b> snatched <b>a</b> grace {{beyond the reach of}} art! ...|$|R
5000|$|Molar was {{an ambitious}} talent scout, a shrewd businessman, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> {{for what the}} general public and young people were {{interested}} in hearing.

As the owner of the label Fermata he both promoted local talent like Mercedes Sosa, El Club del Clan, Los Abuelos de la Nada and Los 5 Latinos and discovered talent, like Miguel Peralta, who performed in his early career as Miguel Abuelo. He also created famous ensembles like The Golden Triplets and adapted songs by Paul Anka, the Beatles, Chubby Checker, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, Neil Sedaka and others for Spanish singers like Sandro and Palito Ortega.|$|R

They have worked to determine what qualities make a [...] "good language learner" [...] (Mollica, Neussel, 1997). Some of their common findings are that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> strong drive to communicate, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> and <b>good</b> listening skills (Mollica, Neussel, 1997).|$|R

Hill studied composition with Alfred Hill, who would later become her husband, at Shirley School, Edgecliff. With Alfred Hill as conductor, Godfrey Smith and the Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society performed Mirrie Hill’s first orchestral work, Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra, in 1914 at the Sydney Town Hall. Hill was unable to study in Germany because of World War I, so she instead went to the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, where she was awarded a scholarship by the director, Henri Verbrugghen.|$|R
50|$|Although Anhalt’s {{mother had}} some {{interest}} in serious music and opera, she was not especially musical, however a piano was always present in her home. It was Anhalt’s father who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> passion and deep love for music, which is where Anhalt developed most of his love for music, in addition to early experiments on the piano at home. Although he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for harmony, and taught himself to play the violin, he did not receive proper musical education. Some of Anhalt’s earliest musical memories were of him pretending to control the music’s flow while attending outdoor musical performances on Margaret Island. At the age of four, he was captivated by sounds on the Danube originating from the river barges and {{the flow of the}} water. He imagined that by some means he could make music out of these sounds.|$|R
60|$|After dinner, {{the countess}} showed Harry her {{excellent}} collection of Bartolozzis, and Harry, who {{knew something about}} them, showed the countess that she was wrong as to the authenticity {{of one or two}} among them. Then Gladys played passably well, and he sang a duet with her, {{in a way that made}} her feel a little ashamed of her own singing. And lastly Harry brought down his violin, at which the countess smiled a little, for she thought it audacious on the first evening; but when he played one of his best pieces she smiled again, for she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> and <b>a</b> great deal of taste. After which they all retired to bed, and Gladys remarked to her maid, in the privacy of her own room, that the new tutor was a very pleasant man, and quite a relief after such a stick as Mr. Wilkinson.|$|R

Easton later said that working with Neil was a great idea, remarking [...] "They didn't just go; 'Right, just go sing Over the Rainbow or some cover', they brought in this top producer for me to work with". She says that although she didn't write the material on the album, Neil <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for hit records and would send her tapes of songs from which she would decide which ones to record; [...] "so I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> part in picking the hits, but I'm also guilty of picking {{the ones that were}} rubbish!" [...] The style of the album was a combination of pure pop (eg.“Take My Time”, “Voice on the Radio”) and sentimental ballads (“When He Shines”, “No-One Ever Knows”).|$|R
60|$|Tark, himself, he said, was the liveliest, most amusing man he {{had ever}} known, and the quickest to do things, {{whatever}} it was {{he was asked to}} do, but he was not industrious and not thrifty. The Tarks were always very poor. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> for music and was a singer of the old songs--he seemed to know them all. One of his performances was with a pair of cymbals which he had made for himself out of some old metal plates, and with these he used to play while dancing about, clashing them in time, striking them on his head, his breast, and legs. In these dances with the cymbals he would whirl and leap about in an astonishing way, standing sometimes on his hands, then on his feet, so that half the people in the village used to gather at his cottage to watch his antics on a summer evening.|$|R

50|$|A tamada {{arranges}} {{breaks from}} time to time. The thing {{is that there are}} special toasts which according to the ritual should be accompanied by a song or a verse. Almost everyone in Georgia <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear</b> to music and good voice. Songs have always accompanied the Georgians in joy and sorrow, in battle and labor. Old Georgian drinking−songs are melodious, polyphonic and rather complicated. Some of them don't need any accompaniment. The choir of men creates musical background. Modern drinking−songs are usually performed to the accompaniment of the guitar or the piano. Special drinking songs and wedding songs (if it is a wedding party) as well as chants full of humor, sung by guests {{during the course of the}} party contest. It may sound strange but sometimes even events of social, economic and political significance are discussed during the table talks, and some problems are solved peacefully. The atmosphere at the Georgian table is so friendly and candid that even the enemies are likely to make up.|$|R

500|$|The {{authenticity}} of Dunne's use of dialect was controversial {{even in his}} own lifetime. [...] Dunne's partisans claimed that it was genuine Roscommon dialect, phonetically transcribed. But Dunne never called it such, making it clear in the columns that Mr. Dooley had been in America for many years, and so his dialect would have been modified by decades of exposure to an Archey Road wherein was known every way of speaking heard from Armagh to Bantry Bay, and more besides. Dunne was not always consistent in his usages, and spells Dooley's favorite subject, [...] "polytics", [...] "polliticks", [...] "pollytics" [...] and correctly. According to Ellis, while Dunne was no philologist, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>ear,</b> and the biographer considered the Dooley pieces the outstanding use of Irish-American dialect in written form. Paul Green, though, {{in his introduction to}} the 1988 edition of Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War, averred that scholars in Ireland have stated that Dunne did not capture the dialect, and have written that the Dooley pieces were not popular there. According to Dunne's son Philip, except in a few of the early pieces, Dooley [...] "spoke always as an American, dealing with American and world issues. Eliminate the brogue and the pieces stand out as what they were: pure Americana." ...|$|R

As for women, I have always found that the one I was in love with smelled good, and the more copious her sweat the sweeter I found it."

He describes his duels and conflicts with scoundrels and officials, his entrapments and his escapes, his schemes and plots, his anguish and his sighs of pleasure.
