Harper has denied that Brodie {{was responsible for the}} leak, and launched an investigation to find the source. The Opposition, as well as <b>Democratic</b> <b>strategist</b> Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E

500|$|As September began, {{while on}} the {{campaign}} trail in Iowa, Biden confided to the Associated Press that he was [...] "counting on Iowa a lot". He hoped to come in [...] "first, second or an indistinguishable third" [...] and if not he would leave the campaign trail and return to Washington. His early statements seemed to mirror the future as he would ultimately drop out of the race after finishing lower than third in the Iowa Caucus. The results also presented a refutation of what he stated in September 2007 when he said that the campaign was [...] "gaining some traction [...]" [...] The September 2007 assessments made by University of Iowa professor Bruce Gronbeck and Drake University professor Dennis Goldford displayed more merit {{at the end of the}} race after Gronbeck stated that Biden was not gaining traction in the race and with Goldford adding that [...] " [...] talks like a senator, not a president". <b>Democratic</b> <b>strategist</b> Ron Parker argued in September that Biden still had a chance but just had to sell his case to the American people.|$|E

2500|$|As Democratic debates {{took place}} during the summer, Obama {{received}} at best mixed notices for his efforts. <b>Democratic</b> <b>strategist</b> Bob Shrum said, [...] "He slips into this tendency, which he probably learned as president of the Harvard Law Review, to overstate his premises before he states his position. In politics, you do the opposite of what you do in the Law Review—you state your position, then say your premises—if you ever get to them." [...] Commentator Eleanor Clift said that, [...] "Obama is almost too cerebral for the sound-bite world of modern politics, but that's part of his appeal." ...|$|E

[...] As anchor Ed Henry was asking Carville a question, Novak threw off his microphone and stormed off the set. Critics later charged that Novak had done so to avoid discussing recent developments in the Valerie Plame affair on-air. In response to the incident, CNN suspended Novak for one day and apologized to its viewers, calling the outburst [...] "inexcusable and unacceptable." ...|$|E

[...] Also problematic was Santorum's 2004 endorsement of his Republican Senate colleague Arlen Specter over conservative Congressman Pat Toomey in the primary for Pennsylvania's other senate seat. [...] Many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans considered the Specter endorsement to be a betrayal of their cause.|$|E
2500|$|Democratic {{consultants}} and strategists also evaluated {{the importance and}} effectiveness of the speech.

[...] She called the speech [...] "incredibly honest and personal" [...] and argued that Obama [...] "changed {{the terms of the}} debate." [...] Donna Brazile—former manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign—said that Obama {{was one of the few}} politicians who [...] "could weave not just their own personal history with American history but [...] themselves up as an example of the contradictions in this country." [...] According to Brazile, Obama had reclaimed the [...] "high road", but the question remained as to whether that road would [...] "lead to the White House or back to the United States Senate."
