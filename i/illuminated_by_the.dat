5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and those parts not <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown {{scraping}} the bottom twice. Each time she was able to pull free, and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness. They had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 01:22 the entire convoy was <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E

5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 {{engaged and}} destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did}} not engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun and may become visible when a comet {{passes through the}} inner Solar System, the dust {{reflects}} Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|The temple is D-shaped, and its {{alignment}} is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. Its {{location and}} orientation indicate that its builders understood {{the cycles of}} both {{the sun and the}} moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the winter solstice, which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform {{at the south end of}} Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.|$|E
50|$|At its top is the {{sanctuary}} of Madonna del Monte Sacro, with a tall cross which is <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> night. <b>The</b> sanctuary perhaps occupies the site an ancient temple of the Oenotrians, dedicated to a deity later identified with Hera.|$|R

25|$|The gallery {{space was}} {{furnished}} with imposing Renaissance-era furniture manufactured in Florence, Italy. The paintings lined {{the walls in}} tiers trailing many feet to <b>the</b> ceiling. Initially <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> gaslight, <b>the</b> artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to World War I.|$|R
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E
25|$|Sedona's main {{attraction}} is its array of red sandstone formations. The formations appear to glow in brilliant orange and red when <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rising or setting sun. The red rocks form a popular backdrop for many activities, ranging from spiritual pursuits {{to the hundreds}} of hiking and mountain biking trails.|$|E
25|$|The first {{demonstration}} of the full set was made {{on the night of}} May 26, 1937. An unlighted bomber was detected and then <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> searchlight. The observers included the Secretary of War, Henry A. Woodring; he was so impressed that the next day orders were given for the full development of the system.|$|E

25|$|According to Ibrahima Caba Bah, his {{children}} told stories that some evenings, after {{the extinction of}} the fires of the school reading, he used to bring together some of the students, often {{under the direction of}} Thierno Oumar Kaana, to make them recite his poems from one of his books (Maqaliida-As-Sa'aadati). He listened from his room standing under the orange tree in the courtyard, vaguely <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dying embers of the doudhal.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{itself is}} painted off-white, with {{the stained glass}} windows, red carpeting, gilding and mahogany trim of the pews providing a contrast. Corinthian columns, creating lateral arcades, provide corbeled support to groin vaults. The arcading partially encloses the balcony. A simulated clerestory level is <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> skylights supplemented by electric lighting in the original wall sconces. The walls themselves are plaster on lath with beaded wainscoting ending in a chair rail.|$|E
25|$|Tarantula Nebula {{is in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud, {{named for}} its spiderlike shape. It is also {{designated}} 30 Doradus, as it is {{visible to the naked}} eye as a slightly out-of-focus star. Larger than any nebula in the Milky Way at 1000 light-years in diameter, it is also brighter, because it is <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open star cluster NGC 2070, which has at its center the star cluster R136. The illuminating stars are supergiants.|$|E

25|$|The {{analysis}} of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues {{in the study}} of evolution. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of molecular biology; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the ribosome and organelles, the development of embryos with body plans, the vertebrate immune system) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the primates, and indeed the other mammals) are expected to be <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> data in this project.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, coccinellids usually {{begin to}} appear indoors {{in the autumn}} when they leave their summer feeding sites in fields, forests, and yards and search out places to spend the winter. Typically, when {{temperatures}} warm to the mid-60s F (around 18°C) in the late afternoon, following a period of cooler weather, they will swarm onto or into buildings <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sun. Swarms of coccinellids fly to buildings in September through November depending on location and weather conditions. Homes or other buildings near fields or woods are particularly prone to infestation.|$|E
25|$|Hand {{signals are}} {{a form of}} sign system used by divers to {{communicate}} when underwater. Hand signals are useful whenever divers can see each other, and some {{can also be used}} in poor visibility if in close proximity, when the recipient can feel the shape of the signaller's hand and thereby identify the signal being given. At night the signal can be <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> diver's light. Hand signals are the primary method of underwater communication for recreational scuba divers, and are also in general use by professional divers, usually as a secondary method.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} DSADs, these devices are purely digital Sun sensors. They {{determine}} the angles of <b>the</b> Sun <b>by</b> determining {{which of the}} light-sensitive cells in the sensor is <b>the</b> most strongly <b>illuminated.</b> <b>By</b> knowing <b>the</b> intensity of light striking neighboring pixels, {{the direction of the}} centroid of the sun can be calculated to within a few arcseconds.|$|R
25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line of sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
25|$|On one level, {{the show}} is a {{conventional}} family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and religion. At the same time, {{the show is}} distinguished by its unblinking focus {{on the topic of}} death, which it explores on multiple levels (personal, religious, and philosophical). Each episode begins with a death – the cause of which ranges from heart attack or murder to sudden infant death syndrome – and that death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode, allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and misfortunes {{in a way that is}} <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death and its aftermath. The show also utilises dark humor and surrealism running throughout.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{served in}} the Second World War, {{initially}} on the air staff within the Directorate of Organisation at the Air Ministry, and was promoted to the temporary rank of wing commander on 1 March 1940 (made permanent in April 1942). He was appointed Officer Commanding No. 219 Squadron flying Bristol Beaufighters from RAF Tangmere in February 1941 and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 13 May 1941 for showing great skill in intercepting enemy aircraft at night, destroying a raiding aircraft on his first night patrol. He was awarded a bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross on 30 May 1941 for engaging attackers at night when the aerodrome was <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> glare from {{a large number of}} incendiary bombs.|$|E
