25|$|In April 2012 the {{government}} of the evacuated city of Namie bought a whole-body dosimeter. The device was installed in a temporary housing in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, in order to monitor the <b>internal</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure and the health of the citizens of Namie. Some 50 people a day could be examined, a complete screening would take two minutes per person. Initial screenings of the whole population was planned to be finished {{at the end of the}} fiscal year 2012. In this way {{the government}} of Namie wanted to offer a long-term monitoring program to the population. Another reason for this was excessive exposure to radiation during the first days directly after the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when predictions from SPEEDI were ignored by the Fukushima Prefectural government.|$|E

30|$|Maternal {{abdominal}} lead shielding {{has been}} reported to be an effective way of reducing fetal scatter radiation [22]. Circumferential lead covering yields in a double dose reduction to the fetus in comparison with anterior shielding only [65]. The contribution to the fetal dose of secondary internally scattered radiation increases with increasing lead thickness but reaches a plateau at a certain thickness of lead. The component resulting from secondary internally scattered radiation is much smaller in magnitude than the external and primary <b>internal</b> scatter <b>radiation.</b> The primary <b>internal</b> scatter <b>radiation</b> can be seen as independent of the thickness of lead used for shielding [66]. Of course, allowing the shielding to reach the direct radiation exposure field must be carefully avoided because the automatic tube current regulation would immediately cause a tremendous increase in the applied dose.|$|R

25|$|Selective <b>internal</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy (SIRT) {{can be used}} {{to destroy}} the tumor from within (thus {{minimizing}} exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a chemotherapeutic agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy. There are currently two products available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA approved treatment for primary liver cancer (HCC) which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer but outside the US SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any non-resectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{interpret}} H 2 quasar absorption line observations of damped Lyα systems (DLAs) and sub-DLAs, we model their H 2 abundance {{as a function}} of dust-to-gas ratio, including H 2 self-shielding and dust extinction against dissociating photons. Then, we constrain the physical state of gas by using H 2 data. Using H 2 excitation data for DLA with H 2 detections, we derive a gas density 1. 5 � log n [cm − 3] � 2. 5, temperature 1. 5 � log T [K] � 3, and <b>internal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> field (in units of the Galactic value) 0. 5 � log χ � 1. 5. We then find that the observed relation between molecular fraction and dust-to-gas ratio of the sample is naturally explained by the above conditions. However, it is still possible that H 2 deficient DLAs and sub-DLAs with H 2 fractions less than ∼ 10 − 6 are in a more diffuse and warmer state. The efficient photodissociation by the <b>internal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> field explains the extremely small H 2 fraction (� 10 − 6) observed for κ � 1 / 30 (κ is the dust-to-gas ratio in units of the Galactic value); H 2 self-shielding causes a rapid increase and the large variations of H 2 abundance for κ � 1 / 30. We finally propose an independent method to estimate the star formation rates of DLAs from H 2 abundances; such rates are then critically compared with those derived from other proposed methods. The implications for the contribution of DLAs to the cosmic star formation history are briefly discussed...|$|R
