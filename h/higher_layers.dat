5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the <b>higher</b> <b>layers</b> of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the <b>higher</b> <b>layers</b> further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.|$|E
5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to <b>higher</b> <b>layers.</b> With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
25|$|The Central Coast, {{which extends}} from Cascade Head to Reedsport, while {{similar to the}} North Coast, {{possesses}} fewer sandy beaches, more sea cliffs and terraces, and {{a greater number of}} bays. Several small urban areas exist in this region. Among these are the cities of Lincoln City, Depoe Bay, Newport, Waldport, and Yachats. Because the usable lands of the region are squeezed between the mountains and the ocean, most urban areas are relatively small but are still larger than those of the South Coast region. The southernmost area of Central coast is the intermediary zone for this region and the more mountainous South Coast region. Exposed sandstone cliffs are also common along the beaches and highway. Local sandstones of the Central Coast were uplifted during the Neogene Era. <b>Higher</b> <b>layers</b> of exposed sandstone are often varying shades of orange, and are often quite soft to the touch, often being very brittle, and relatively easily eroded. Lower exposed layers, though less frequent, reveal harder sandstone deposits. Unlike the <b>higher</b> <b>layers,</b> they are often gray-brown in color and hard in comparison. This lower sandstone often breaks off in large, squared chunks.|$|E

25|$|The {{stresses}} in {{the dome}} {{were found to}} be substantially reduced by the use of successively less dense aggregate stones, such as small pots or pieces of pumice, in <b>higher</b> <b>layers</b> of the dome. Mark and Hutchison estimated that, if normal weight concrete had been used throughout, the stresses in the arch would have been some 80% greater. Hidden chambers engineered within the rotunda form a sophisticated structural system. This reduced the weight of the roof, as did the elimination of the apex by means of the oculus.|$|E
25|$|At high altitudes, {{primarily}} {{above the}} mesosphere, {{there is enough}} UV radiation from the sun of very short wavelength to cause ionization. When the ions collide with electrically neutral particles they recombine and emit photons in the process, causing airglow. The degree of ionization is sufficiently large to allow a constant emission of radiation even during the night when the upper atmosphere is in the Earth's shadow. Lower in the atmosphere all of the solar photons with energies above the ionization potential of N2 and O2 have already been absorbed by the <b>higher</b> <b>layers</b> and thus no appreciable ionization occurs.|$|E
25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by <b>higher</b> <b>layers.</b> As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E
30|$|The {{effective}} classification {{methods of}} the small target objects in the no-fly zone are of great significance to ensure safety in the no-fly zone. But, due to the differences of the color and texture for the small target objects in the sky, this may be unobvious, such as the birds, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and kites. In this paper, we introduced the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> visualizing feature extraction method based on the hybrid deep network model to obtain the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> feature through combining the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) model, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and the regression classifier model to classify {{the different types of}} the target object images. In addition, because the sample numbers of the small sample target objects in the sky may be not sufficient, we cannot obtain much more local features directly to realize the classification of the target objects based on the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> visualizing feature extraction; we introduced the transfer learning in the SAE model to gain the cross-domain <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> local visualizing features and sent the cross-domain <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> local visualizing features and the images of the target-domain small sample object images into the CNN model, to acquire the global visualizing features of the target objects. Experimental results have shown that the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> visualizing feature extraction and the transfer learning deep networks are effective for the classification of small sample target objects in the sky.|$|R

2500|$|Subsumption {{architecture}} is a methodology for developing artificial intelligence that is heavily associated with behavior based robotics. [...] This {{architecture is}} a way of decomposing complicated intelligent behavior into many [...] "simple" [...] behavior modules, which are in turn organized into layers. Each layer implements a particular goal of the software agent (i.e. system as a whole), and <b>higher</b> <b>layers</b> are increasingly more abstract. Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers, e.g. the decision to move forward by the eat-food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest obstacle-avoidance layer. Behavior need not be planned by a superior layer, rather behaviors may be triggered by sensory inputs and so are only active under circumstances where they might be appropriate.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{hierarchical}} approach to solving sensor planning for the global localization of a mobile robot. Our system consists of two subsystems: a lower <b>layer</b> and a <b>higher</b> <b>layer.</b> The lower layer uses a particle filter to evaluate the posterior probability of the localization. When the particles converge into clusters, the <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> starts particle clustering and sensor planning to generate an optimal sensing action sequence for the localization. The <b>higher</b> <b>layer</b> uses a Bayesian network for probabilistic inference. The sensor planning takes into account both localization belief and sensing cost. We conducted simulations and actual robot experiments to validate our proposed approach...|$|R
