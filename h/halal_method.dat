According to Eleanor Nesbitt, the general issue of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism is controversial within Sikhism, and contemporary Sikhs disagree. The ban on kutha meat, along with ban on any sexual relations with Muslims and a ban on smoking habit common among 18th-century Indian Muslims, states Nesbitt, {{was a part of}} Sikh Guru's efforts to socially isolate Muslims. Amritdhari Sikhs, or those baptised with the Amrit, have been strict vegetarians, abstaining from all meat and eggs. Sikhs who eat meat seek the Jhatka method of producing meat believing it to cause less suffering to the animal. The uninitiated Sikhs too are not habitual meat-eaters by choice, and beef (cow meat) has been a traditional taboo. Typically meat is not served in community free meals such as langar.|$|E

50|$|The {{manner in}} which an animal is {{slaughtered}} in Islamic rituals is considered cruel and barbaric by Hindus, as Hindus consume Jhatka meat. Jhatka is meat from an animal that has been killed instantly, such as by a single strike of a sword or axe to sever the head, as opposed to ritualistically slow slaughter (kutha) in the <b>halal</b> <b>method</b> (dhabihah). Jhatka is the method of meat production demanded by most Hindus who eat meat, as this provides a quick and painless death to the animal. Both methods use sharp knives. In the Jhatka method, a swift uninterrupted cut severs the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, vagus nerves and the spine. In the <b>Halal</b> <b>method,</b> the slaughter is done with a swift deep incision {{with a sharp knife}} on the throat, cutting the jugular veins and carotid arteries of both sides but leaving the spinal cord and nervous tissue intact, followed by a period where the blood of the animal is drained out. A prayer to God is not required in the Jhatka method with each animal commercially slaughtered, but a prayer to God (Allah) is required at the start or if there is any interruption during Halal meat production.|$|E

Moreover the scientific information on process-ing and quality of traditional buffalo meat curry from different groups of buffaloes is not available. This study was undertaken to develop processed curry from different buffalo groups and to compare its quality during storage at ambient and refrigeration temperature. Material and methods. The meat samples were collected from the longissimus dorsi muscle of the carcasses from each group of buffaloes slaughtered according to the tradi-tional <b>halal</b> <b>method.</b> Buffalo meat curry was prepared in a pressure cooker with the stan-dardized formulation. This final product was subjected to evaluation of quality and shelf life. Results. To evaluate the effect of different groups of meat samples on the quality of curry, product yield, pH, proximate composition, water activity (aw), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), calorific value, sensory attributes and microbiological as-say were determined The energy of meat curry from young buffaloes was significantly lower than the meat curry from spent animal groups. The overall acceptability of curry decreased significantly during 3 days ambient storage compared to refrigeration storage. Conclusions. Scientific processing by adopting good manufacturing practices and suitable packaging helped greatly to improve the shelf life of the ambient temperature stored buf-falo meat curry.

40|$|In Belgium and {{in several}} European countries, two cattle {{slaughtering}} protocols exist: the classical method, that encompasses a stunning step before the sticking procedure, and the <b>halal</b> <b>method,</b> combining the stunning and the sticking in one single step. The main difference {{lies in the fact}} that, in the halal protocol, a single cut with a sharp knife is practiced directly on live cattle, instead of two cutting steps with two different knives for the sticking in the classical slaughtering technique. The unique section in the halal technique results generally in the cross section of trachea and esophagus of cattle. The aim {{of this study was to}} seek if the two slaughtering techniques were similar regarding the superficial contamination of carcasses, swabbed between 2 and 4 hours after the killing step. For this purpose, classical microbiological tests (TVC and Enterobacteriaceae) and 16 S rDNA metagenetic analysis were carried out from 20 cattle carcasses (swabbing of “legal” zone – 1. 600 cm 2 – and in the neck area – 200 cm 2). The classical microbiological results revealed no significant differences between the two slaughtering practices. Statistical analysis of pyrosequencing data showed that differences in bacterial population abundance between slaughtering methods were mainly found in the “legal” swabbing zone compared to the neck area. Bacterial genera belonging to Actinobacteria (Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium) were more aundant in “Halal” samples whereas populations from the Proteobacteria (Caulobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae) and Firmicutes (Lactobacillus) were more abundand in the “classical” group. The analysis of OTU abundance of bacteria from the digestive or respiratory tract revealed no differences beteween groups. In conclusion, the slaughtering method does not influence the superficial microbiological pattern in terms of specific microbiological markers of the digestive or respiratory tract. However, precise analysis to the genus level underlines differences between methods, the legal swabbing zone being still the best sampling zone compared to the neckline. The next step will be the identification of precise contamination origin of the differences found between slaughtering methods. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this work}} was the {{comparison}} between the carcass and the meat ewes of the regional Traditional market and the Islamic religious (<b>Halal)</b> market. <b>Methods</b> Thirty and 20 {{at the end of}} career traditional market and Halal market ewes were slaughtered following the EC (European Council, 2009) animal welfare guidelines. Live weight of ewes was taken and dressing percentage of carcasses was calculated. On every carcass zoometric measurement and the evaluation trough the EU grid rules were performed. On the Musculus longissimus thoracis of 12 Traditional market carcasses and 11 Halal market carcasses the physical-chemical and nutritional analysis were performed. Consumer tests for liking meat ewe were performed in order to find consumer’s preference level for Traditional and Halal markets ewe meat. Considering as fixed factor the ewe meat market (Traditional and Halal), results were submitted to oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results The Halal market ewes have shown lower dressing percentages (42. 91 [*]±[*] 0. 82 vs 46. 42 [*]±[*] 0. 69) and lower conformation score (4. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 5 vs 7. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 4). The Halal market meat showed higher cooking loss in oven (37. 83 [*]±[*] 1. 20 vs 32. 03 [*]±[*] 1. 15  %), lesser Chroma value (18. 63 [*]±[*] 0. 70 vs 21. 84 [*]±[*] 0. 67), and lesser Hue angle value (0. 26 [*]±[*] 0. 02 vs 0. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 02). This product had also lower fat percentage (4. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 4 vs 7. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 4). The traditional market meat had higher percentage in monounsatured fatty acids (MUFA) (43. 84 [*]±[*] 1. 05 vs 38. 22 [*]±[*] 1. 10), while the Halal market meat had higher percentage in ω 3 poliunsatured fatty acids (PUFA) (5. 04 [*]±[*] 0. 42 vs 3. 60 [*]±[*] 0. 40). The consumer test showed as the ewe meat was appreciate by the consumers. Conclusions Both meat typologies have shown good nutritional characteristics. The traditional market meat had higher MUFA composition, and a better MUFA/satured fatty acids (SFA) ratio, while the Halal market meat had higher PUFA composition. These results were also supported by the PCA. The consumers preferred the traditional market meat...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent decades}} the {{availability}} of halal meat in shops, restaurants and public institutions in the UK has become a reoccurring feature of public debate. Muslims (as well as Jews) are exempt from the legal requirement to stun animals prior to slaughter and it is thus widely assumed that most halal meat in the UK is produced without stunning animals, when the reverse {{is in fact the}} case. There is a distinct lack of transparency in the UK meat industry and public understanding of these issues is not as clear-cut as it could be. Misunderstandings often emerge because halal meat is difficult to identify in the food supply chain. As meat from 'non-stunned' halal slaughter has become visible in recent decades, the commercial sensitivities associated with halal meat from stunned animals have also grown, with supermarkets now often failing to label meat as halal; this adds the confusion, both for Muslim and non-Muslim consumers alike. Not surprisingly, evidence suggests that as well as animal welfare considerations, public concern about {{the availability of}} <b>halal</b> meat and <b>methods</b> of slaughter in the UK is also linked to wider concerns about immigration and integration, as perpetuated through the media. In this paper I explore and compare these issues with developments that emerged around Jewish migration to the UK in the 19 th century, when public controversy emerged around the 'Alien Question'. During this period, Jewish migrants from Russian and Eastern Europe were seen to be responsible for unemployment, housing shortages, and the increasing cost of poverty, very similar concerns to those expressed about Muslim migrants and refugees today. Concerns about religious animal slaughter and animal welfare are consistent across these historical periods and the paper explores {{the extent to which these}} issues act as a proxy for real life problems connected to wider processes of socioeconomic development and change. Based on research on halal and kosher meat markets, and Jewish and Muslim communities (around Europe) over the last two years, I draw on a range of theoretical perspectives to illustrate the underlying complexities of the issues involved...|$|R

Three slaughter houses of Jammu district situated at Nagrota, Old Rehari and Gujjar Nagar were selected for the study. Ten butchers from each slaughter house were selected. Thirty retail meat shops were selected and from each randomly selected retail meat shop, one meat retailer was selected. Thus, a total of thirty butchers and thirty meat retailers were selected for the study. Data was collected through a well structured interview schedule. The data was coded, classified, tabulated and analyzed using the software; Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS 16. 0). The presentation of data was done to give pertinent, valid and reliable answer to the specific objectives. Frequencies, percentage, mean and standard deviation were worked out for meaningful interpretation. Transport of animal to be slaughtered was not carried out properly. Animal were fatigued and soiled with faecal material and considerations were not given to avoid undue stress that might adversely affect the safety and suitability of meat. There was no standard method of bringing the animal to the floor for slaughter. The animals were slaughtered without restraining them properly and are slaughtered in front of other animals causing great fear in them. Butchers used to bring even more than ten animals at a time and slaughter them one after other, even butchers and other workers moved freely over carcasses without caring for hygienic measures. Animals were slaughtered (by both <b>Halal</b> and Jhatka <b>method)</b> and dressed in unhygienic way. Butchers do not care for preventing the intestine from puncturing during evisceration which leads to contamination of carcass. The edible offal’s pluck (heart, lungs, trachea and esophagus) were pulled out as a unit and these were not hung on a hook instead it was place on floor, similarly paunch (stomach and intestines) were also dropped on floor. Meat retailers apart from selling meat from animals slaughtered at slaughter houses significant proportion of respondents were also slaughtering animals (mostly sheep and goat) at their own retail meat shops. Chicken were exclusively slaughtered at retail meat shops in front of the consumers. Personal hygiene was poorly maintained by meat handlers owing to their illiteracy, unawareness, lack of facilities and nature of work...|$|R
