The plan actually received {{the endorsement of the}} Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E

25|$|Vice President José Alencar (2003–11) made {{controversial}} {{remarks in}} 2009, telling {{the press that}} Brazil should <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{as a means to}} protect itself. According to Alencar, nuclear weapons were useful as a means of dissuasion, particularly {{in the case of a}} vast country with valuable natural resources such as Brazil. Additionally, Alencar linked the possession of a nuclear bomb to higher international relevance, stating that a poor country like Pakistan had its voice heard in international affairs because of its nuclear arsenal. Once his observations were mass-produced, Brasília affirmed that Alencar had expressed his own personal views, which did not reflect Brazil’s official position.|$|E

25|$|Military {{facilities}} of the United States in Spain built {{during this}} era include Naval Station Rota and Morón Air Base, {{and an important}} facility existed at Torrejón de Ardoz. Torrejón passed under Spanish control in 1988. Rota has been in use since the 1950s. Crucial to Cold War strategy, the base did <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> stationed on it for some time, and at its peak size, in the early 1980s, was home to 16,000 sailors and their families. The presence of these bases in Spain was resented by many Spaniards; there were occasional protests against them, including a demonstration during Reagan's 1985 visit to Spain.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} 1947 Soviet Aviation Day display at Tushino Airport, a {{surprise}} appearance {{was put in}} by three Boeing B-29s, followed by a fourth four-engined long-range strategic bomber. It {{was an example of}} the Tupolev Tu-4, which was a bolt-for-bolt copy of the B-29 Superfortress, three examples of which were known to have been interned in the Soviet Union after having been forced to land there during bombing raids against Japan in WWII. Since the USSR was expected to <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> sooner or later, the appearance of the Soviet Tu-4 was a shock to U.S. military planners, since it meant that the U.S. mainland might soon be vulnerable to a potential Soviet nuclear attack from the air.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, India {{signed the}} Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), stating {{that it did}} not have {{chemical}} weapons and the capacity or intent to manufacture chemical weapons. By doing this India became one of the original signatories of the CWC in 1993, and ratified it on 2 September 1996. According to India's ex-Army Chief General Sunderji, a country having the capability of making nuclear weapons does not need to have chemical weapons, since the dread of chemical weapons could be created only in those countries that do not <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Others suggested that the fact that India has found chemical weapons dispensable highlighted its confidence in the conventional weapons system at its command.|$|E

500|$|Stimson, who {{had just}} {{finished}} a series of arguments with the British {{about the need for}} an invasion of France, was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything, and spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war cooperation, Cherwell explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> after the war. Anderson then drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded [...] "in more majestic language". News arrived in London of Roosevelt's decision on 27 July, and Anderson was dispatched to Washington with the draft agreement. Churchill and Roosevelt signed {{what became known as the}} Quebec Agreement at the Quebec Conference on 19 August 1943.|$|E

Polish historian Wojciech Tomasik claimed that the Congress was an example of the Soviet Union hijacking the concept of [...] "defending peace", to justify its own policies. The aim of the Congress was to influence world public opinion, portraying the Eastern Bloc countries as supporters of peace and the Western Bloc countries as a threat to it. Dąbrowska in her memoirs stated that [...] "the Congress was not aimed at preventing the war in general, but at preventing an American-Soviet war from talking place now, at the moment in which the USSR is in the inferior position." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 9 December 2006, Olmert {{stated that}} he could not rule out the {{possibility}} of a military attack against Iran, and called for the international community to step up action against that country. He called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's repeated threats to destroy Israel [...] "absolutely criminal", and said that he expected [...] "more dramatic steps to be taken". In an interview with German TV network Sat.1 on 11 December 2006, Olmert included Israel in a list of nuclear powers, saying: [...] "Iran, openly, explicitly and publicly, threatens to wipe Israel off the map. Can you say that this is the same level, when they are aspiring to <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> as America, France, Israel and Russia?" [...] He immediately attempted to backtrack, insisting that Israel's doggedly held position of nuclear weapons ambiguity had not changed. He nonetheless came under harsh criticism from both ends of the Israeli political spectrum due to the perceived threat to Israel's policy of ambiguity regarding its nuclear status. On 2 May 2007, the Winograd Commission accused Olmert of failing to properly manage the 2006 Lebanese War, which prompted a mass rally of over 100,000 people calling for his resignation.|$|E
