5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E

5|$|The Boys in Red {{accident}} was a January 12, 2008 collision {{just outside the}} city of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, between a semi-trailer truck and a van carrying the basketball team from Bathurst High School. The accident killed seven students and {{the wife of the}} coach, and injured four other occupants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> It was the deadliest transportation accident in New Brunswick since 1989, when a logging truck tipped onto a hayride in Cormier Village, killing 13.|$|E
5|$|Wally Pfister {{gave each}} {{location}} and dream level a distinctive look {{to aid the}} audience's recognition of the narrative's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and the scenes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> are more neutral.|$|E
5|$|Ancona {{was quickly}} readied for combat when Italy {{declared}} {{war against the}} Austrian Empire in the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. The following month, she joined the Italian fleet at the Battle of Lissa. She was stationed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> of the Italian fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet. Ancona was damaged by Austrian shellfire, including one shell that started a fire. Her career was uneventful after the war, resulting from a combination of the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was eventually sold for scrapping in 1903.|$|E
50|$|<b>Van</b> 68, on <b>the</b> other hand, was {{modified}} <b>in</b> 1919 with <b>the</b> guard compartment {{shifted to the}} centre of <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> requiring removal of <b>the</b> fish compartment. <b>In</b> 1930 <b>the</b> <b>van</b> was altered {{for use as a}} railcar trailer, and <b>in</b> 1941 <b>the</b> fish compartment was restored. Finally, <b>in</b> 1953, <b>the</b> <b>van</b> was condemned.|$|R

5|$|As {{they move}} around the city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing {{in front of the}} neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b>|$|E
5|$|Castelfidardo {{participated in}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She was {{stationed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> of the Italian fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet and was not heavily engaged. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized several more times in the 1870s and 1880s. From 1900 to 1910 she served as a training ship before being broken up for scrap.|$|E

40|$|Periodic flows {{downstream}} from a centrifugal pump impeller in vaneless and vaned diffusers were measured {{by using a}} single hole yawmeter and a phase-locked sampling method. The flows were also calculated by an inviscid flow analysis using the blade-surface singularity method. <b>The</b> periodic variations <b>in</b> calculated static pressure with the impeller rotating quantitatively agree well with the measured ones. <b>The</b> flow behaviors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaned</b> diffuser are discussed, citing measured and calculated results. The potential interaction between the impeller and the diffuser blades appears more strongly than the impeller-wake interaction. The appearance of static pressure fluctuations due to <b>the</b> impeller's rotating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fully <b>vaned</b> zone {{is different from that}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semivaned zone of the diffuser. The existence of the peripheral blade surface of the impeller outlet with an outlet edge of the pressure surface causes violent pressure fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaned</b> diffuser...|$|R

5|$|Hope {{was still}} {{in command of the}} Bellerophon three months later when he was heavily engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> of Howe's fleet at the Glorious First of June, when an equally sized French fleet was {{defeated}} 200 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean. At the start of 1795, Hope joined HMS Tremendous, but within two months was requested onboard HMS Venerable by Admiral Duncan. However, while visiting aboard a Russian ship in 1796, Hope suffered a serious accidental head injury that left him an invalid for two years, consequently missing Duncan's victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E

5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial {{samples are}} yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> Arkel process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity titanium metal.|$|E
5|$|Vincent Willem van Gogh {{was born}} on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the {{predominantly}} Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. Van Gogh was given {{the name of his}} grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Gogh family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).|$|E

5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E

Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla (Abu Salim), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai (Joy Mathew). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is waiting for him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 Dirham Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, {{as well as the}} circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one would suspect the gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is also aware of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh go. It is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji (Suresh Krishna), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Martyrs– William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien– {{were members}} of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an {{organisation}} dedicated to ending British rule in Ireland. They were executed for the murder of a police officer in Manchester, England, in 1867, during an incident that became known as the Manchester Outrages. The trio {{were members of}} a group of 30–40Fenians who attacked a horse-drawn police van transporting two arrested leaders of the Brotherhood, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, to Belle Vue Gaol. Police Sergeant Charles Brett, travelling inside with the keys, was shot and killed as the attackers attempted to force the van open by blowing the lock. Kelly and Deasy were released after another prisoner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> took the keys from Brett's body and passed them to the group outside through a ventilation grill; the pair were never recaptured, despite an extensive search.|$|E
