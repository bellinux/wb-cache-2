5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inner</b> <b>tube</b> {{water polo}} is {{a style of}} water polo in which players, {{excluding}} the goalkeeper, are required to float in inner tubes. By floating in an <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> players expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to tread water. This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.|$|E

50|$|Most bicycle tires, many {{motorcycle}} tires, {{and many}} tires for large vehicles such as buses, heavy trucks, and tractors {{are designed for}} use with <b>inner</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>tubes</b> are torus-shaped balloons made from an impermeable material, such as soft, elastic synthetic rubber, to prevent air leakage. The <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> are inserted into the tire and inflated to retain air pressure.|$|R
50|$|Backup {{lights are}} {{generally}} clipped {{to the shoulder}} D-rings and held against the shoulder straps by rubber bands cut from bicycle <b>inner</b> <b>tubes.</b> Other methods are possible, but the <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> work and are easily replaced when they wear out.|$|R
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the <b>inner</b> <b>tube,</b> having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E

40|$|The Center for High Technology's {{journey to}} the {{competition}} named For Inspiration of Science and Technology, or FIRST began on Monday December 16, 1996 {{when there was a}} meeting with officials and engineers to discuss the FIRST competition. The task was to research, design, and construct a robot to take <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> from- designated places or the human player and place the <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> on a goal during a two minute period. The goal had nine branches and a place on the top for the <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> and was later described as looking like a giant coat hanger. The human player, who could either hand the robot <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> or could throw the <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> on the goal, had to stand in a certain area during the competition and could only move in a certain parameter. The playing field which was described by the rules, was a carpeted, hexagon shaped area and allowed each team to have one side between them. Around the perimeter were the stations for the robot, the robot's controller, and the other human player...|$|R

25|$|Many puzzles {{in these}} games involve {{gathering}} and using items from their inventory. Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects in unexpected ways. For example, {{by putting a}} deflated <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> on a cactus to create a slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> is stretchy. They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful, and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a piece of information from earlier in the game. There is seldom any time pressure for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.|$|E

25|$|An Armstrong Gun was {{a uniquely}} {{designed}} type of rifled breech-loading field and heavy gun designed by Sir William Armstrong and manufactured in England beginning in 1855 by the Elswick Ordnance Company and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. Such guns involved a built-up gun construction system of a wrought-iron (later of mild steel) tube surrounded by multiple wrought-iron strengthening coils shrunk over the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> {{to keep it}} under compression.|$|E
25|$|Large {{land-based}} turbines required {{high efficiency}} and increased superheat, so the marine pattern was revised to the distinctive land-based Yarrow boiler. This became asymmetrical. One wing was enlarged and received {{most of the}} gas flow. The <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> banks remained and received radiant heat from the furnace, but the gases then flowed through one of them, over a superheater bank, then through an additional third bank to increase the heat extracted.|$|E
25|$|Sub-caliber {{training}} {{in this context}} refers to attaching a smaller weapon into a bigger one to reduce wear on the actual weapon. In case of 57 55 J the gun, stripped of mounting and most other equipment, was attached into a barrel of a heavy gun. 57 55 J was located outside the actual gun and fired normal ammo; thus this does not refer to modern sabot ammunition or <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> mounts.|$|E
5000|$|The LCCs inside double-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} lead to {{an increase}} of the photoluminescence (PL) signal of the <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> up to a factor of 6 for tubes with (8,3) chirality. This behavior can be attributed to a local charge transfer from the <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> to the carbon chains, counterbalancing quenching mechanisms induced by the outer tubes.|$|R

25|$|Across the 15th and 16th centuries {{there were}} {{primarily}} {{two different types}} of manufactured cannons. The wrought iron cannon and the cast-bronze cannon. Wrought iron guns were structurally composed of two layers: an <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> of iron staves held together in a tight fit by an outer case of iron hoops. Bronze cannons on the other hand were cast in one piece similar to bells. The technique used in casting bronze cannons was so similar to the bell that the two were often looked upon as a connected enterprise. Church bells in the age of Catholic authority were viewed as idolatrous and met their end as raw metal used for casting cannons.|$|E
25|$|Measurements {{showed that}} the vortex whistle was created by a {{rotating}} asymmetric vortex which created a rotating force vector in {{the plane of the}} exit and a rotating dipole sound field. The phenomenon of swirl instability has been shown to occur in other situations. One was the flow separation on the upper side of delta-shaped airfoils of high speed aircraft (Concorde), The angle of attack of the leading edge resulted in a swirl flow that became unstable. Another is the flow within cyclone separators; the swirling flow there occurs in an annular region between two tubes. The flow reverses at the closed end of the outer tube and exits through the <b>inner</b> <b>tube.</b> Under certain conditions, the flow in the reversal region becomes unstable, resulting in a period rotating force on the outer tube.|$|E
40|$|The hollow {{inside of}} {{single-wall}} carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) provides a unique {{degree of freedom}} to investigate chemical reactions inside this confined environment and to study the tube properties. It is reviewed herein, how encapsulating fullerenes, magnetic fullerenes, $^{ 13 }$C isotope enriched fullerenes and organic solvents inside SWCNTs enables to yield unprecedented insight into their electronic, optical, and interfacial properties and to study their growth. Encapsulated C$_{ 60 }$ fullerenes are transformed to <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> by a high temperature annealing. The unique, low defect concentration of <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> makes them ideal to study the effect of diameter dependent treatments such as opening and closing of the tubes. The growth of <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> is achieved from $^{ 13 }$C enriched encapsulated organic solvents, which shows that fullerenes {{do not have a}} distinguished role and it opens new perspectives to explore the in-the-tube chemistry. Encapsulation of magnetic fullerenes, such as N@C$_{ 60 }$ and C$_{ 59 }$N is demonstrated using ESR. Growth of <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> from $^{ 13 }$C enriched fullerenes provides a unique isotope engineered heteronuclear system, where the outer tubes contain natural carbon and the inner walls are controllably $^{ 13 }$C isotope enriched. The material enables to identify the vibrational modes of <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> which otherwise strongly overlap with the outer tube modes. The $^{ 13 }$C NMR signal of the material is specific for the small diameter SWCNTs. Temperature and field dependent $^{ 13 }$C $T_ 1 $ studies show a uniform metallic-like electronic state for all <b>inner</b> <b>tubes</b> and a low energy, ~ 3 meV gap is observed that is assigned to a long sought Peierls transition.

It would start at the junction with the Cross Westchester Expressway and the New England Thruway in Rye and end at NY135 and NY25 in Syosset. Estimated to cost approximately $10 billion, it would feature three tubes: the outer tubes would have three lanes of vehicular traffic each and the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> {{would be used for}} maintenance. The proposed tunnel, which is to be operated by a private firm, is still awaiting approval to begin construction.|$|E
500|$|Since {{at least}} 1938, Jefferis had been {{toying with the}} idea of a {{demolition}} or anti-tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare. It would work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target. Then, when detonated, the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be the case. Sappers call such a device a [...] "poultice" [...] or [...] "squash head" [...] charge. Jefferis enlisted Drs Bauer and Schulman of the Colloid Science Department of Cambridge University, they experimented with lengths of bicycle <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> filled with plasticine to represent the explosive. These were fitted with wooden handles and dipped in rubber solution to make them sticky. In experiments, these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to the metal bins used to represent tanks.|$|E
