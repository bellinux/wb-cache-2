Subsequently, maximum frequency of total number of 0 -valued pixels was predicted and used to extract the measurements of scion and rootstock stem diameters. Finally, the developed integrated visual grading system was experimented with 100 scions and rootstock seedlings. The results showed that success rate of grading reached up to 98 %. This shows that selection and grading of scion and rootstock could be fully automated with this developed visual grading system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and {{evaluate}} an automatic <b>grafting</b> <b>machine</b> for passion fruit seedlings in order to reduce labor needed. This <b>grafting</b> <b>machine</b> consists of a stock topping and delivering device, a scion tapering device, a grafting device, a clip feeding device and a pneumatic control system. In addition, two fold type workbenches are attached to make the operator work easily. This study focuses on the design and manufacturing of the grafting clip feeding device. A preliminary experiment result shows that the maximum pressure between clip and seedling is 0. 086 Mpa, while the clip applies a compressive force of 6. 46 N to the seedling. This pressure makes the scion and stock contact intimately but never causes the plant bruise. The grafting performance of this machine was tested and results indicated that success ratio and ratio of survival after grafting could reach 90. 7 % and 96 %, respectively. The capacity of this machine is estimated as 209 plants per hour theoretically and 167 plants per hour practically. 本研究目的在完成一部自動式百香果嫁接機之設計與製造，以降低百香果種苗嫁接工作對人工之依賴，期望此項作業能日趨自動化。 試造完成的自動式百香果種苗嫁接機包括砧木去頂與傳送裝置、接穗楔切裝置、砧木與接穗插接固定裝置、嫁接夾整列篩選供給裝置及作業程序控制系統等。本嫁接機為個人化作業，並不需要輸送帶，而工作平台為雙邊雙層折疊式，在不需要嫁接時可收回至兩側，不佔用空間。 除上述裝置的整合外，本研究特別著重於嫁接夾及其供給裝置之設計與製造，使之適用於百香果種苗之嫁接作業。為確保百香果嫁接苗不致被嫁接夾夾傷，乃先測定百香果蔓生莖之物理性質，並以接觸理論分析嫁接夾與嫁接苗的力學情形。分析結果顯示，嫁接夾尾端產生 14 ㎜壓縮位移量時，夾頭所張開之對應寬度為 7 ㎜，並產生 6. 46 N的夾持力，若將該力視為嫁接夾對百香果種苗嫁接作業之最大夾持力，則賦予百香果嫁接苗之最大壓力值為 0. 086 MPa，並不會造成百香果蔓生莖之傷害。 自動式百香果種苗嫁接機試驗結果顯示，理論作業能量為 209 株／小時，實際作業能量為 167 株／小時，嫁接成功比例為 90. 7 ％，嫁接成活比例為 96 ％。壹、緒論 1 - 1 前言 1 - 2 研究目的 貳、文獻探討 2 - 1 種苗嫁接 2 - 2 百香果種苗之嫁接方法 2 - 3 井關GR 800 -B型種苗嫁接機 參、百香果種苗嫁接機之設計與製造 3 - 1 砧木之剪斷與傳送裝置 3 - 2 接穗之處理裝置 3 - 3 接穗與砧木之插接裝置 3 - 4 嫁接夾整列篩選供給裝置 3 - 5 嫁接苗夾持固定裝置 3 - 6 作業程序控制系統 肆、嫁接機基本性能試驗 4 - 1 嫁接機之試造 4 - 2 作業能量測試 4 - 3 嫁接作業精度檢查 伍、結果與討論 5 - 1 嫁接機嫁接試驗結果 5 - 2 作業能量 5 - 3 嫁接成功比例 陸、結論與建議 6 - 1 結論 6 - 2 建議 柒、參考文...|$|E

40|$|Two {{commercial}} nurseries {{located in}} Comunidad Valenciana region (central-eastern Spain) were sampled in 2010 {{to evaluate whether}} the grapevine nursery propagation process could {{be a source of}} black-foot disease pathogens. Samples were taken from four sources of the propagation process: pre-grafting hydration tanks, scissors used for cutting buds, omega-cut <b>grafting</b> <b>machines,</b> and peat used for callusing. DNA from these samples was extracted and multiplex nested-PCR using primers specific for >Cylindrocarpon> pauciseptatum, Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex (composed of I. alcacerensis, I. estremocensis, I. macrodidyma, I. novozelandica, I. torresensis, and two undescribed species) was used to identify the species present. Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were detected in hydration tanks, scissors, <b>grafting</b> <b>machines</b> and peat, I. macrodidyma-complex being the most frequent. Additionally, ten grafted cuttings each from five grapevine scion/rootstock combinations were collected from each nursery immediately after callusing, and again after one growing season in a nursery field. Roots of these grafted cuttings and plants were sampled to isolate the fungal pathogens. Only I. torresensis was isolated after callusing, while I. liriodendri, I. novozelandica and I. torresensis were isolated after one growing season, showing the highest incidence at this latter sampling time. Moreover, DNA was extracted from roots and analyzed as described before. Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were also detected at both sampling times. The use of the multiplex nested-PCR technique improved the detection of I. liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex from grafted cuttings and plants in both nurseries. This work shows that the grapevine nursery propagation process should be considered as a potential infection source for black-foot disease pathogens, and confirms that infections caused by Ilyonectria spp. in grapevine planting material increase markedly after one growing season in nursery fields. © 2013 KNPV.

Our {{aim was to}} analyze the effect of short pretransplant periods of pulsatile HMP on histology and renal injury in warm-ischemic kidneys. Twelve minipigs were used. WI was achieved in the right kidney by applying a vascular clamp for 45 [*]min. After nephrectomy, autotransplant was performed following one of two strategies: cold storage of the kidneys or cold storage combined with perfusion in pulsatile HMP. The graft was removed early to study renal morphology, inflammation (fibrosis), and apoptosis. Proinflammatory activity and fibrosis were less pronounced after cold storage of the kidneys with HMP than after cold storage only. The use of HMP also decreased apoptosis compared with cold storage only.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background One of {{the most}} crucial issues in liver {{transplantation}} is {{the gap between the}} increasing number of patients waiting for a transplant and the shortage of available grafts. This limitation has led many liver transplant units to include for surgery organs defined as “marginal” or “sub-optimal” due to hepatic steatosis or sourcing from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD). In turn, the marginality of these organ donors is proportional to a high incidence of liver dysfunction after transplantation due mainly to more severe ischemia-reperfusion injury events. The use of new methods of preservation of hepatic <b>grafts</b> like <b>Machine</b> Perfusion becomes necessary, especially for its ability to reduce the damage of ischaemia-reperfusion in hypothermia. This opens an interest towards the use of alternative methods in preserving hepatic <b>graft</b> as <b>Machine</b> Perfusion, able to reduce this type of insults and allow the dosage of biomarkers that can predict the extent of damage ischemia-reperfusion injury and the quality of functional recovery of the graft after transplantation. The great potential of this system in the context of organ preservation and the numerous studies in the literature led us to investigate this issue. Purpose The aim of our work was to carry out an experimental model of Machine Perfusion (MP) for the preservation of livers procured from non heart-beating donor, as a viable alternative to the traditional Cold storage (CS) at 4 °C. A further aim of our project was to identify biomarkers that can be used as predictors of postoperative graft damage. Material and methods We used 10 Landrace pigs of about 20 kg to which we performed, 60 minutes after cardiac arrest, total hepatectomy, thus harvesting the liver. The animals were divided into two groups: in the first group (Group A) 5 livers was preserved for 6 hours in MP at 20 ° C. In the second group (Group B) 5 livers was stored for 6 hours in CS. In all study groups the period of preservation was followed by reperfusion in normothermic MP (37 °) with whole oxygenated blood previously collected from the donor animal for 2 hours to assess the response to reperfusion. During the experiment blood samples and histological specimens were collected. Results Graft preservation by Machin perfusion at 20 °C is superior compared to the Cold Storage, both from biochemical (AST, ALT, LDH, lactate) and histological standpoint (necrosis and congestion). The dose of AST, ALT, LDH and lactate has proven be a reliable parameter for the assessment of organ damage and functional recovery of the graft liver. The dosage of cytokines such as IL 1, IL 6, TNF alpha showed no significance. Conclusion These experimental evidences highlight the effectiveness of a preservation with continuous perfusion at 20 ° C on a large animal model. Both from biochemical that histological standpoint, we have observed that Machine Perfusion in moderate hypothermia is beneficial in the preservation of the graft and offers the considerable advantage of being able to test, during perfusion, biomarkers that can predict hepatic graft recovery, before transplant, {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of post-transplant graft disfunction...|$|R

Donor kidneys were not transplanted due to severe atherosclerosis and poor perfusion. The liver was shipped to the transplantation center and underwent NMP with a blood-based perfusate. During machine perfusion lactates decreased, vascular flow was stable, and bile production restored, and the graft was considered suitable for transplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful and 4 months after surgery the patient is in good clinical condition with normal liver function. To date, few LTs have been performed with NMP in humans, but its preliminary results are promising.

Riley and [...] J. E. Planchon, the culprit was identified to be phylloxera, an insect that infests the roots of vines and causes fungal infections. Initially, farmers unsuccessfully attempted to contain the pest by removing and burning affected vines. When it was discovered that phylloxera was an invasive species introduced from North America, some suggested importing rootstock from the region as the North American vines were resistant to the pest. Others, opposed to the idea, argued that American rootstocks would imbue the French grapes with an undesirable taste; they instead preferred to inject the soil with expensive pesticides. Ultimately, grafting American rootstock onto French vines became prevalent throughout the region, creating new <b>grafting</b> techniques and <b>machines.</b> American rootstocks had trouble adapting to the high soil pH value of some regions in France so the final solution to the pandemic was to [...] hybridize the American and French variants.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Static {{cold storage}} is {{generally}} used to preserve kidney allografts from deceased donors. Hypothermic machine perfusion may improve outcomes after transplantation, but few sufficiently powered prospective studies have addressed this possibility. METHODS In this international randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned one kidney from 336 consecutive deceased donors to machine perfusion {{and the other}} to cold storage. All 672 recipients were followed for 1 year. The primary end point was delayed graft function (requiring dialysis in the first week after transplantation). Secondary end points were the duration of delayed graft function, delayed graft function defined by the rate of the decrease in the serum creatinine level, primary nonfunction, the serum creatinine level and clearance, acute rejection, toxicity of the calcineurin inhibitor, the length of hospital stay, and allograft and patient survival. RESULTS Machine perfusion significantly reduced the risk of delayed graft function. Delayed graft function developed in 70 patients in the machine- perfusion group versus 89 in the cold- storage group (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 57; P = 0. 01). Machine perfusion also significantly improved the rate of the decrease in the serum creatinine level and reduced the duration of delayed <b>graft</b> function. <b>Machine</b> perfusion was associated with lower serum creatinine levels during the first 2 weeks after transplantation and a reduced risk of graft failure (hazard ratio, 0. 52; P = 0. 03).

After 24 hours hypothermic CS using the University of Wisconsin solution (UW) or MP using UW-Gluconate (UW-G), liver damage (liver enzymes, perfusate flow, and hyaluronic acid clearance) and liver function (bile production, ammonia clearance, urea production, oxygen consumption, adenosine triphosphate [ATP] levels) were assessed in an isolated perfused rat liver model. Furthermore, liver biopsies were visualized by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Animals developed 30 to 60 % steatosis. Livers preserved by CS sustained significantly more damage as compared to MP.

The grafts then underwent reperfusion on a Langendorff for 60  min. Energetic metabolism was quantified at baseline, postpreservation, and postreperfusion by measuring lactate and high-energy phosphates. The contractility index (CI) was assessed both in vivo prior to cardioplegia and during reperfusion. Following reperfusion, the hearts preserved using CS exhibited higher lactate levels (56. 63  ±  23. 57 vs. 11. 25  ±  3. 92  μmol/g; P <  0. 001), increased adenosine monophosphate/adenosine triphosphate (AMP/ATP) ratio (0. 4  ±  0. 23 vs. 0. 04  ±  0. 04; P <  0. 001), and lower phosphocreatine/creatine (PCr/Cr) ratio (33. 5  ±  12. 6 vs. 55. 3  ±  5. 8; P < 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: To study graft {{function}} and ischemia/reperfusion injury of porcine kidneys after preservation {{with the new}} Groningen Machine Perfusion (GMP) system versus static cold storage (CS). Introduction: The increasing proportion of marginal and nonheart beating donors necessitates better preservation methods to maintain adequate <b>graft</b> viability. Hypothermic <b>machine</b> preservation (HMP) is a promising alternative to static CS. We have therefore developed and tested an HMP device, which is portable and actively oxygenates the perfusate via an oxygenator. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the efficacy of the GMP system in a transplantation experiment. Materials and Methods: In a porcine autotransplantation model, kidneys were retrieved and either cold stored in University of Wisconsin CS for 20 hours at 4 degrees C or subjected to HMP using University of Wisconsin machine perfusion at 4 degrees C with 2 different pressure settings: 30 / 20 mm Hg or 60 / 40 mm Hg. Results: HMP at 30 / 20 mm Hg was found to better preserve the viability of kidneys reflected by improved cortical microcirculation, less damage to the proximal tubule, less damage mediated by reactive oxygen species, less proinflammatory cytokine expression, and better functional recovery after transplantation. However, high perfusion pressures (60 / 40 mm Hg) resulted in higher expression of von Willebrand factor and monocyte chemotactic peptide- 1 in post-preservation biopsies and subsequent graft thrombosis in 2 kidneys. Conclusions: It is concluded that the GMP system improves kidney graft viability and perfusion pressures are critically important for outcome...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of review: Machine {{perfusion}} technologies {{provide an}} opportunity for improved preservation, organ assessment, and resuscitation of damaged kidneys. This review summarizes the recent advances in hypothermic and normothermic kidney machine perfusion technologies. Recent findings: Modifications to the perfusion conditions with the addition of oxygen during hypothermic machine perfusion can support a low level of metabolism, which in experimental settings improves <b>graft</b> function. Normothermic <b>machine</b> perfusion technologies are evolving in different directions including short-duration resuscitation, more prolonged periods of perfusion, and the transition between hypothermic and normothermic conditions. Clinical trials are ongoing in both hypothermic and normothermic settings. Functional parameters can be used to assess kidney quality and although normothermic machine perfusion may hold an advantage over hypothermic machine perfusion, new metabolomic, proteomic, and genomic technologies may be applied in the future to both technologies to provide more rigorous information on kidney quality. Promoting recovery by introducing an intervention during perfusion is an attractive area of research and therapies targeting the endothelium are a particular area of interest. Summary: A great deal of research is still needed to optimize and logistically place hypothermic and normothermic perfusion technologies. In the future, we may progress toward organ-tailored preservation whereby high-risk kidneys can undergo assessment and repair before transplantation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the development of the osteoblastic phenotype in human alveolar bone-derived cells grown on collagen type I-coated titanium (Ti) surface (Col-Ti) obtained by plasma deposition acrylic acid <b>grafting</b> compared with <b>machined</b> Ti (M-Ti). Osteoblastic cells were cultured until subconfluence and subcultured on Col-Ti and M-Ti for periods of up to 21 days. Cultures grown on Col-Ti and M-Ti exhibited similar cell morphology. Cell adhesion, total protein content, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were not affected by Ti surface modification in all evaluated periods. Growth analyses indicated that there were significantly more cells in cultures grown on Col-Ti at day 3. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2), osteopontin (OPN), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA expression of cells subcultured on Col-Ti was higher, whereas collagen type I (COL) was lower compared with M-Ti. Ti surface modification neither affected the osteocalcin (OC), ALP and receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression nor the calcium content extracted from mineralized matrix. These results demonstrated that Col-Ti favours cell growth during the proliferative phase (day 3) and osteoblastic differentiation, as demonstrated by changes in mRNA expression profile during the matrix mineralization phase (day 14), suggesting that this Ti surface modification may affect the processes of bone healing and remodelling.
