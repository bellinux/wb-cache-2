5|$|Hensley was {{the father}} of eight {{children}} with his first wife, Amanda. They separated in 1922. One of their children claimed that the separation occurred after an incident in which Hensley became drunk and fought a neighbor.

5|$|Claiborne {{was born}} the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas Clayborn, an {{alderman}} and lord mayor from King's Lynn, Norfolk, who made his living as a small-scale businessman involved {{in a variety of}} industries, including the salt and fish trades, and Sarah Smith, the daughter of a London brewer. The family name was spelled alternately as Cleburn, Cleyborne, or Claiborne. William Claiborne, who was baptized in 1600, was the younger of two sons. The family's business was not profitable enough to make it rich, and so Claiborne's older brother was apprenticed in London, becoming a merchant involved in <b>hosiery</b> and, eventually, the tobacco trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces <b>hosiery</b> and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|The post-patent {{negotiations}} {{were led by}} Moe Nadler. D'Amour no longer had leverage with a patent, but still demanded that Canadian Lady stop using the designs, and return the pattern templates. Moe Nadler ignored this demand and instead successfully acquired the Canadian, European, and Asian rights to the Wonderbra trademarks. This allowed the company to move forward into the 1960s with the brand intact. By the mid-1960s Canadian Lady was exporting and licensing the Wonderbra line to Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, Israel and the West Indies. In the 1970s, Canadelle acquired the remaining worldwide rights to the trademark, and licensed Giltex (a Canadian pantyhose manufacturer acquired by Sara Lee in the 1980s) to use the Wonderbra brand on <b>hosiery</b> in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} countryside, irrigated by {{the lower}} Chenab River, produces cotton, wheat, sugarcane, vegetables and fruits. The city is an industrial centre with major railway repair yards, engineering works, and mills that process sugar, flour, and oil seed.

5|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub {{with a focus on}} the Digital Creative sector. As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a <b>hosiery</b> factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario. London is also home to Diply, which is ranked among the top websites on the Internet, video game companies Big Viking Games and Digital Extremes, and Voices.com, which provides voiceover artists a platform to advertise and sell their services to those looking for voiceover work.|$|E

25|$|Nolde {{arrived on}} a {{steamship}} in 1880 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He {{was drawn to}} the German speaking communities of southeastern Pennsylvania and quickly found employment as a weaver for the Louis Kraemer Woolen Mills near Reading. Nolde soon rose {{to the top of the}} corporate ladder at Kraemer Mills, from there he was able to acquire much of the machinery that Kraemer Mills had used in their <b>hosiery</b> business. Nolde established his own <b>hosiery</b> factory in Reading in 1888, just eight years after leaving Germany. Nolde took on some partners, Jacob Lorah and George Horst, and was able to expand his <b>hosiery</b> business. His operation, Nolde and Horst Company, employed 500 workers who operated about 400 knitting machines in 1897.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Pan American (Pan Am) games, the players came from the AAU teams. The players for the 1955 team were drawn {{primarily}} from Hanes <b>Hosiery</b> Mills, Wayland College Flying Queens, the Dons, and Dowells Dolls. These four teams played each other in a tournament to help select the players for the Pan Am team. Hanes <b>Hosiery</b> came in first ahead of Wayland Baptist. This result would not be surprising, as these were the two dominant teams of the era. Hanes <b>Hosiery</b> won the AAU national championship in 1951, 1952, and 1953, beating Wayland two of those three years, and Wayland would go on to win the national championship the net four years 1954–1957. Not surprisingly, the twelve player Pan American team was dominated by these two teams, with six Wayland Baptist players and three from Hanes <b>Hosiery.</b> While Wayland provided the largest number of players, Hanes provided the captain, Lurlyne Greer Mealhouse, who would score over 18 points per game, more than twice the second highest scorer, and still the third highest scoring average in Pan American history. Greer was considered to be the best AAU player of her era.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Rieve {{expelled}} his old division, the American Federation of <b>Hosiery</b> Workers, {{from the}} TWUA. The division, which had 20,000 members, {{was a major}} backer of TWUA executive vice-president George Baldanzi. Baldanzi was strongly critical of Rieve's leadership of the union, and argued that Rieve was {{not doing enough to}} organize new members or win contract improvements. When the <b>Hosiery</b> Workers withheld dues in protest of the Rieve administration's policies, Rieve pulled the division's charter.|$|E

25|$|Rieve was {{committed}} to organizing new members in the <b>hosiery</b> industry. In November 1930, Rieve authorized a strike among <b>hosiery</b> workers in the mills around Reading, Pennsylvania. The strike collapsed after heavy employer opposition. Rieve then tried a new tactic: The union agreed to a 30 percent wage cut in the expectation that non-union mills would lower their wages below the new union level. This would trigger a massive strike, enabling the AFHW to move in and organize the workers. Roughly 3,000 workers, or {{about a third of}} the total number in the industry, struck. Rieve purposefully withheld strike aid to the workers in an attempt to increase the radicalism of the workers and raise the demand for a union. But employers were content to idle plants in the depths of the Great Depression, and the strike lingered for nearly a year. Admitting defeat, Rieve signed a new contract in September 1932.|$|E
25|$|Lustiger {{was born}} Aaron Lustiger in Paris to a Jewish family. His parents, Charles and Gisèle Lustiger, were Ashkenazi Jews from Będzin, Poland, {{who had left}} Poland around World War I.

25|$|In 1907, {{at the age}} of 15, Rieve {{joined the}} American Federation of <b>Hosiery</b> Workers (AFHW), a {{semi-autonomous}} division of the United Textile Workers of America (UTW), an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. His rise in the union was meteoric: At the age of 22, he was elected {{a vice president of the}} AFHW, became the division's president in 1929 {{at the age of}} 35, and joined the national UTW executive board in 1934.|$|E
25|$|CIO {{leaders had}} little {{confidence}} in Gorman or the UTW. Gorman had overseen the ill-fated 1934 textile strike. The UTW staff was considered incompetent, and politically behold to McMahon's relatively conservative policies. Rieve coveted {{the presidency of}} UTW, and worked to undercut Gorman at every turn—even when that meant disagreeing with actions he himself would otherwise support. Worst of all, UTW was practically bankrupt. Only the <b>hosiery</b> and dyers divisions were self-supporting, and Gorman was actually seeking a $5,000 loan from the CIO to keep the national union afloat.|$|E
25|$|Textiles form a major {{industry}} in Morocco. The European Union is Morocco's top client as regards textile and clothing, with France importing 46% of <b>hosiery,</b> 28.5% of basic textile and 27.6% of ready-to-wear clothing from Morocco, {{managing director of}} the Moroccan Export Development Center underlined. Recalling that Morocco's textile and clothing exports totaled some $3.7 billion in 2007, Saad Benabdallah ascribed this performance to the many assets that Morocco enjoys, namely, geographical proximity, flexibility, sourcing skills and the multiple opportunities offered by Free Trade Agreements with the European Union, United States and Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Louis Fles {{was born}} in Maassluis, Netherlands on October 19, 1871 to Jewish parents. His father, Jacob Levie Fles, worked as a diamond cutter, and his mother, Saartje van Blijdestein, ran a <b>hosiery</b> shop, placing young Louis {{squarely}} in the newly expanding merchant class. After his father died in 1873 his mother married a man named Swaab. Upon his mother's death in 1878, Louis was taken in and raised by his stepfather's family. As a successful business owner himself, Swaab took the young Louis into his company shortly after the boy had completed primary school.|$|E
25|$|Handloom Textiles, beedi and coir are {{important}} traditional {{industries in the}} district. About 100,000 people depend on the textile industry for their livelihood. The textile industry, which accounts for 40% of all Small Scale Industrial (SSI) units in the district, was introduced in early 19th century by the German Basel Mission. The first ready-made garment unit in Kannur and the first <b>hosiery</b> unit in Kuthuparamba were started {{around the end of}} the 19th century. The beedi industry provides employment for about 50,000 people. The Dinesh Beedi co-operative and the privately owned Sadhu Beedi are in Kannur district. The coir industry uses traditional technology and provides employment to about 11,000 workers.|$|E
25|$|Belper {{remained}} a textile and <b>hosiery</b> centre into the 20th century. Meanwhile, other companies were developing: iron founding led to Park Foundry becoming {{a leader in}} the solid-fuel central-heating market; Adshead and Ratcliffe had developed Arbolite putty for iron-framed windows; Dalton and Company, which had been producing lubricating oils, developed ways of recovering used engine oil proving useful during the Second World War. In 1938, A. B. Williamson had developed a substance for conditioning silk stockings; the introduction of nylon stockings after the Second World War seemed to make it redundant, but mechanics and fitters had discovered its usefulness in cleaning hands and it is still marketed by Deb Group as Swarfega.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, the Everett Mills {{was sold}} to the newly created Everett Mills Properties Incorporated at liquidation. The hard-won labor laws that went into effect {{as a result of}} the Bread And Roses strike made it cheaper to {{manufacture}} textiles in the unregulated Southern United States and Lawrence fell into decline. The Mill changed hands again in 1936 and was now owned by Russell T. Knight. For the next 45 years the mill building rented out parcels of real estate to smaller stores and manufacturing concerns including the Marum Knitting <b>Hosiery</b> Factory in 1938 and Cardinal Shoes in 1962 - which made 6-7,000 pairs of shoes daily. Both companies eventually outgrew their spaces and moved into their own facilities.|$|E

25|$|A stuff gag is {{very similar}} to, and works {{in the same way}} as, the ball gag. The person's mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, <b>hosiery,</b> panties, day sheers, bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person's mouth. Instead, a large part of it hangs out of the mouth, {{allowing}} the top to pull it out easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person's mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, cloth gag or tape gag.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{industrialisation}} of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started {{first with}} lace and <b>hosiery</b> workers near Nottingham and {{spread to other}} areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of Ned Ludd, a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the militia or army to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or transported for life.|$|E
25|$|Textile {{industry}} {{contributes about}} 4 per cent to the country's GDP, 14 per {{cent of the}} industrial production, and 17 per cent to export earnings. India's textile industry has transformed in recent years from a declining sector to a rapidly developing one. After freeing the industry in 2004–2005 {{from a number of}} limitations, primarily financial, the government permitted massive investment inflows, both domestic and foreign. From 2004 to 2008, total investment into the textile sector increased by 27billion dollars. Ludhiana produces 90% of woollens in India and is known as the Manchester of India. Tirupur has gained universal recognition as the leading source of <b>hosiery,</b> knitted garments, casual wear and sportswear. Expanding textile centres such as Ichalkaranji enjoy one of the highest per-capita incomes in the country. India's cotton farms, fibre and textile industry provides employment to 45million people in India, including some child labour (1%). The sector is estimated to employ around 400,000 {{children under the age of}} 18.|$|E
25|$|The era of {{manufactured}} fibers {{began with}} the development of rayon in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's <b>hosiery</b> from nylon, {{but it was not until}} the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The river near Pleasley Vale {{has been}} {{utilised}} to provide power {{since at least}} 1767, when two forges and a corn mill {{are known to have}} been operating. The forges were run by George Sitwell, and were called Nether and Upper forge. The engineered river channel made it a good site for further development, and a consortium of businessmen from Nottingham and drapers from Mansfield leased the vale and Pleasley Park in 1782, in order to construct water-powered cotton mills. The Upper Mill (now called Mill 1) was built first, {{on the site of the}} previous corn mill, and was operational by 1785. The Lower Mill (now Mill 3) was completed seven years later at a cost of £1,190, and was much bigger. A manager's house and a row of ten houses for the workers were also completed in 1792. The mills supplied cotton to the expanding East Midland <b>hosiery</b> industry. One of the original three businessmen was Henry Hollins, and by the early 18th century, the mills were run by William Hollins and Co. They were the first and one of the most successful cotton producers in the East Midlands.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and <b>hosiery.</b> For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E
25|$|Before 1800, most cloth {{was made}} in home workshops, and housewives sewed it into {{clothing}} for family use or trade with neighbors. In 1810 {{the secretary of the}} treasury estimated that two-thirds of rural household clothing, including <b>hosiery</b> and linen, was produced by households. By the 1820s, housewives bought the cloth at local stores, and continued their sewing chores. The American textile industry was established during the long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when cheap cloth imports from Britain were unavailable. Samuel Slater secretly brought in the plans for complex textile machinery from Britain, and build new factories in Rhode Island using the stolen designs. By the time the Embargo Act of 1807 cut off trade with Britain, there here were 15 cotton spinning mills in operation. These were all small operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used Arckwright water frames powered by small streams. They were all located in southeastern New England. In 1809 the number of mills had grown to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth several manufacturers resorted to the putting-out system of having the handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality. To overcome these problems the textile manufacturers began to consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 Francis Cabot Lowell of the Boston Manufacturing Company built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans for a power loom that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the Tariff of 1816, competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{produced}} {{within the}} country is of medium staple. Hence long staple cotton is imported to produce quality fabrics for export. Medium staple cotton, also called standard medium-staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about [...] Long-staple cottons have relatively longer fibre, are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics, yarns, and <b>hosiery.</b> The country's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country. Apart from use in textiles {{in the form of}} cotton lint, yarn, thread, cloth, and garments, its seeds are used for oil extraction.|$|E
