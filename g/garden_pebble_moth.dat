40|$|This {{study will}} aim to {{demonstrate}} how methods of pest control developed for conventional vegetable production can be adapted for use by organic growers. The study will concentrate on pests of umbelliferous and cruciferous crops and will be composed of 11 specific objectives outlined as follows, together with {{ways in which they}} might be achieved: 1. Adaptation of the existing carrot fly forecast to quantify how the date of crop drilling influences subsequent fly pressure. The carrot fly forecast produced at HRI Wellesbourne will be used to predict the proportion of the first generation of flies that will lay eggs on carrot crops drilled on different dates. The model will also be used to predict the timing of emergence of the subsequent fly generation within the crop. It will then be verified using data from experimental carrot plots located close to the source of the main carrot fly population at HRI; these data will be incorporated into the existing carrot fly forecast model; 2. Production of a model to quantify how crop damage can be reduced by altering the harvest date. A sub-model based on published and field data will be incorporated into the carrot fly forecast model, together with meteorological data; this model will be calibrated with experimental data collected from carrot plots at Wellesbourne; 3. Identification of times at which crops should be covered to reduce carrot fly damage. Output from the carrot fly model will be modified to identify the times at which crops should be covered and the dates after which it is safe to uncover crops for operations such as weeding; 4. Quantification of the contribution possible from host plants with various levels of resistance. Data collected at HRI Wellesbourne will be used in simple mathematical models to quantify how partial plant resistance can contribute to the reduction of carrot fly damage alone or in combination with other damage reduction techniques; 5. Verification of carrot fly control strategies. Information collected in objectives 1 - 4 will be used to produce a strategy for reducing carrot fly damage in organically grown umbelliferous crops; this will be evaluated by HDRA in commercial carrot and parsnip crops where there are high and low levels of infestation. Objectives 6 - 11 will focus on pests of cruciferous crops; 6. Adaptation of the existing pest forecasts to quantify how the judicious choice of planting and harvesting dates can be used to reduce crop damage. Existing forecasting systems for pollen beetle, cabbage root fly, cabbage aphid, diamond-back moth, small white butterfly, cabbage moth and <b>garden</b> <b>pebble</b> <b>moth</b> will be used to identify the periods when cruciferous crops are at risk from each of these pest species. Forecasts will be verified by experimental data obtained from cabbage plots; 7. Identification of crop/pest situations where application of crop covers would be advantageous. A literature review will be conducted to identify crop/pest combinations where it would be advantageous to apply covers to exclude insect pests; results from relevant field experiments will also be included; 8. Evaluation of simple methods for inspecting crops to determine {{the presence or absence of}} any given pest species. A literature review will be conducted, including results from studies involving sampling aphid and caterpillar pests within cruciferous crops; 9. Identification of critical periods during which control measures should be applied. The literature will be reviewed to indicate the best time to apply the various control measures available to organic growers. Output from models of pest activity will be modified to indicate the most appropriate timings for application of each control measure; 10. Verification of the pest control strategy arising from work conducted in objectives 7 - 10. This strategy will be underpinned by the pest forecast models and will be presented as a MORPH decision support system. The strategy will be evaluated in an organic cropping system by growing crops of cauliflower and cabbage in locations with different levels of pest infestation; and 11. Production of a user-friendly format for disseminating the information produced in the study to organic growers. Information will be provided in the form of a decision support system in MORPH, articles in grower publications, through the advisory network and at annual meetings for organic growers...|$|E

50|$|Nowadays {{the flower}} garden has been {{substituted}} by a dry <b>garden</b> of <b>pebbles,</b> {{in order not}} to affect the foundation of the palace with the watering. In Nasrid times, the floor of the quartered planting beds was slightly lower than the general level, and the visual effect was like a tapestry of flowers, as the top of the plants were cut to the same level of the courtyard, and these were carefully chosen to cover a host of color nuances.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, Margo Lewers and Gerald Lewers, {{with their}} two {{children}} Tanya and Darani, moved to Emu Plains. In 1952, Lewers and partner Gerald held a two-person exhibition at the David Jones Art Gallery, exhibiting painting and sculpture respectively. James Gleeson reviewed Lewers' painting as ambitious but requiring better development of technique. Following the initiative in landscape design and outdoor sculpture that the pair made in their new home, in 1957, Lewers and Gerald were commissioned to create a <b>garden</b> of <b>pebbles,</b> cacti and sandstone for the MLC Building in North Sydney.|$|R

60|$|By journeying {{through the}} glass {{mountain}} they had reached a delightful valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another rugged mountain showing {{on the other side}} of it, and soft and pretty green hills at the ends. It was all laid out into lovely lawns and <b>gardens,</b> with <b>pebble</b> paths leading through them and groves of beautiful and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. There were orchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our world. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their flower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the quaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld. None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had ample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.|$|R
60|$|At twilight--an unearthly sort of twilight--there came another curious picture. Thus--a wooden town shut {{in among}} low, treeless, rolling ground, a calling river that ran unseen between scarped banks; barracks of a {{detachment}} of mounted police, a little cemetery where ex-troopers rested, a painfully formal public <b>garden</b> with <b>pebble</b> paths and foot-high fir trees, {{a few lines}} of railway buildings, white women {{walking up and down}} in the bitter cold with their bonnets off, some Indians in red blanketing with buffalo horns for sale trailing along the platform, and, not ten yards from the track, a cinnamon bear and a young grizzly standing up with extended arms in their pens and begging for food. It was strange beyond anything that this bald telling can suggest--opening a door into a new world. The only commonplace thing about the spot was its name--Medicine Hat, which struck me instantly as the only possible name such a town could carry. This is that place which later became a town; but I had seen it three years before when it was even smaller and was reached by me in a freight-car, ticket unpaid for.|$|R
40|$|Mulching of {{agricultural}} fields and <b>gardens</b> with <b>pebbles</b> {{has long been}} practiced to conserve soil 	moisture in some semi-arid regions with low precipitation. Rainfall interception by the pebble mulch 	itself {{is an important part}} of the computation of the water balance for the pebble mulched fields and 	gardens. The mean equivalent diameter (MED) was used to characterize the pebble size. The maximum 	static rainfall retention in pebble mulch is based on the water penetrating into the pores of pebbles, the 	water adhering to the outside surfaces of pebbles and the water held between pebbles of the 	mulch. Equations describing the water penetrating into the pores of pebbles and the water adhering to 	the outside surface of pebbles are constructed based on the physical properties of water and the pebble 	characteristics. The model for the water between pebbles of the mulch is based on the basic equation to 	calculate the water bridge volume and the basic coordination number model. A method to calculate the 	maximum static rainfall retention in the pebble mulch is presented. Laboratory rain simulation experiments 	were performed to test the model with measured data. Paired sample t-tests showed no significant 	differences between the values calculated with the method and the measured data. The model is ready 	for testing on field mulches. </div...|$|R
