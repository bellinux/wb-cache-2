40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine foaling season effect on delivery size and on Lippizaner foals development in sucking phase. Mares mainly foal in spring months, but some of them also foal in summer and autumn months. The investigations refer to foals being delivered in the period 1 January - 30 June and 1 July to 31 December of the current year. We also studied male foals and females separately. Sixty three males and 50 females were studied in spring period whereas 14 males and 17 females in autumn months. Withers height, chest girth as well as cannon bone circumference were measured after birth and ablactation. Male foals had significantly higher withers <b>in</b> the first <b>six</b> <b>month</b> of the year and insignificantly thicker cannon bone compared to female ones. However, no significance was determined with foals being delivered <b>in</b> the second <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Male foals being delevered <b>in</b> the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> had insignificantly larger chest girth and cannon bone circumference compared to the foals being delivered <b>in</b> the second <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Significantly very higher withers height and chest girth were determined <b>in</b> the first <b>six</b> <b>month</b> with female foals. Male foals being delivered <b>in</b> the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> did have significantly very higher values for all three measures after ablactation whereas female foals being delivered <b>in</b> the second <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of the year had very significantly higher values compared to the male foals. Highly significant values in favour of male foals being delivered <b>in</b> the second <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of the year were determined by the testing.
