5|$|The golden {{everlasting}} {{has proven}} very adaptable to cultivation. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual cultivars <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many {{of these are}} still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial shrubs, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp {{species are}} parasitoids; the females deposit eggs on or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> {{arthropod}} {{on which the}} larvae then feed. Some larvae start off as parasitoids, but convert at a later stage to consuming the plant tissues that their host is feeding on. In other species, the eggs are laid directly into plant tissues and form galls, which protect the developing larvae from predators but not necessarily from other parasitic wasps. In some species, the larvae are predatory themselves; the wasp eggs are deposited in clusters of eggs laid by other insects, and these are then consumed by the developing wasp larvae.|$|E

5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

5000|$|<b>In</b> biology, <b>a</b> <b>host</b> is <b>an</b> {{organism}} that harbors a parasitic, a mutual, or a commensal symbiont, typically providing nourishment and shelter. Examples include animals playing host to [...] parasitic worms (e.g. nematodes), cells harbouring a parasitic virus, <b>a</b> bean plant <b>hosting</b> mutualistic (helpful) nitrogen-fixing bacteria.More specifically <b>in</b> botany, <b>a</b> <b>host</b> plant supplies {{food resources}} and {{acts as a}} substrate for commensalist insects or other fauna.|$|R
25|$|Once a {{virus genome}} becomes {{operational}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> cell, it then generates messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that direct {{the synthesis of}} viral proteins. Production of mRNA is initiated by proteins known as transcription factors. Several antivirals are now being designed to block attachment of transcription factors to viral DNA.|$|E
25|$|Viruses are capsid-encoding organisms {{composed}} of proteins and nucleic acids that can self-assemble after replication <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> cell using the host's replication machinery. There is a disagreement in science about whether viruses are living {{due to their}} lack of ribosomes. Comprehending the viral genome is important not only for studies in genetics but also for understanding their pathogenic properties.|$|E

50|$|There {{are close}} and often {{long-term}} relationships between symbiotic microbes and their host's immune system. The {{immune system is}} <b>a</b> <b>host</b> defense system consisting of anatomical barriers, and physiological and cellular responses, which protect the host against harmful parasites while limiting inflammation by tolerating harmless symbionts. Humans are home to 1013 to 1014 bacteria. These bacteria can have almost any kind of relationship with the host, including mutually beneficial <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host's</b> gut, or parasitic.|$|R
25|$|MHC {{molecules}} enable {{immune system}} surveillance {{of the population}} of protein molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> cell, and greater MHC diversity permits greater diversity of antigen presentation. In 1976, Yamazaki et al demonstrated a sexual selection mate choice by male mice for females of a different MHC. Similar results have been obtained with fish. Some data find lower rates of early pregnancy loss in human couples of dissimilar MHC genes.|$|E

25|$|When a {{parasitic}} female lays her egg <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> female’s nest, {{the host}} female experiences a deposition rate of two eggs per day. Host females may recognize parasitic eggs when the egg deposition pattern deviates {{from the traditional}} one egg per day pattern. The occurrence of brood parasitism {{may be influenced by}} the body size of the potential parasitic female relative to the potential host female. Parasitic females are generally larger than their host counterparts, but on average, there is no size difference between the parasite and the host.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents are}} cytotoxic {{by means of}} interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy {{can be thought of}} as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract and hair follicles. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells, hence also immunosuppression), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and alopecia (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called autoimmunity). These include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis and many others.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the {{competition}} was contested by 32 teams, and was played from October 30, 2007, to December 9 of the same year. Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino's first stage {{is similar to the}} men's competition, thus being a knockout competition, played over two legs between clubs of the same region, and disputed in three rounds, but in the second stage the eight qualified clubs are divided in two groups of four teams each, playing against each other once, and held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> city. The two best placed teams of each group qualify to the semifinals. The semifinal winners play the final while the losers play the third-place playoff. CBF determined that to be eligible to play in {{the competition}} it is necessary to be a minimum of 14 years old and a maximum of 34 years old, and half of the players of each club have to be aged between 14 and 18 years old.|$|E
25|$|When people develop visceral leishmaniasis, {{the most}} typical {{symptoms}} are fever and the {{enlargement of the}} spleen, with enlargement of the liver sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India {{does not appear in}} most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of malaria. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar is close to 100%. L. donovani itself is not usually the direct cause of death in kala-azar sufferers, however. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, and dysentery are omnipresent in the depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with AIDS, it is these opportunistic infections that are more likely to kill, flaring up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> whose immune system has been weakened by the L. donovani infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.|$|E
500|$|At Torchwood's Cardiff headquarters, Owen determines from {{an autopsy}} that the alien that {{impregnated}} Gwen is a Nostrovite, {{a race of}} carnivorous shape shifters who hunt in pairs and mate for life. He tells Jack that after fertilisation, the female transfers her eggs to the male who plants them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> body until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Later, the female kills the host to release the offspring. At the wedding venue, the female Nostrovite (Colette Brown) murders and partly devours wedding guest Mervyn. Toshiko investigates along with Rhys' best man [...] "Banana Boat" [...] (Jonathan Lewis Owen) and they are subsequently captured by the alien, who intends to feed on them later. As Gwen and Rhys prepare to say their wedding vows, Jack runs up the aisle and demands that the wedding be halted. Owen and Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) free Toshiko but the half-eaten corpse of Mervyn is discovered by his wife, a bridesmaid, who alerts the entire wedding party to the murder. The Nostrovite reveals herself and is chased away by Jack, escaping through a window.|$|E
