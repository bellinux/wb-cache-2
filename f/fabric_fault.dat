One of many digital image processing applications is texture analysis. Fabric or cloth is a flexible artificial material that is made by a network of natural or artificial fibers. <b>Fabric</b> <b>fault</b> inspection is an important process in the textile industry.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} an expert system that not only offers advice to both textile and non-textile users on <b>fabric</b> <b>faults,</b> but also assists in the diagnosis of <b>fabric</b> <b>faults.</b> The expert system integrates both object-oriented and rule-based reasoning approaches. The system {{is based on the}} premise that the design of a component should be separated from the implementation details. In short, this means that the rules that manipulate a set of objects exist separately from the same set of objects. Separation of object definitions from rules that manipulate them in the knowledge base, and separation of the object-based knowledge base from the object-based inference engine that infers conditions, means that any changes made to any one of these components do not necessarily mean that changes to the other components have to be made, and also that each of these components is autonomous. Dependencies between components in an object in the object-oriented approach, the extendibility of such systems, the inheritance properties, and reusability of objects are just some of the advantages of adopting an object-oriented approach...|$|R

In order to investigate the deformation processes responsible for earthquake nucleation we have studied ancient and exhumed Evaporites bearing normal faults cropping out in Tuscany. Within the TE formation, that is a 2. 5 km thick sequence, composed of decimetric-to-decameter scale interbeds of foliated gypsumanhydrites and brecciated dolostones, we have studied fault zone architecture and deformation processes of both small (100 m) displacement faults. Small and large scale faults display a relatively well structured internal architecture with a sharp reduction in grain-size between the damage zone (coarse grained protocatclasite) and the fault core (fine/very fine grained cataclasite). Extreme localization of slip to discrete and very thin (Y and B shear up to 10 - 100 mm) sliding surfaces is observed within the fine-grained dolomitic bearing cataclasite layers within the fault core. Fluid assisted processes have been inferred by fault fracture mesh development with crack and seal textures within dolomite-dominated damage fault zone. The deformation processes observed in the field are consistent with elastic friction behaviour, recorded by random <b>fabric</b> <b>fault</b> rocks developed within localised zones of high shear strain.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the impact of}} different communication architectures on the performability (performance + availability) of cluster-based servers. In particular, we {{use a combination of}} fault-injection experiments and analytic modeling to evaluate the performability of two popular communication protocols, TCP and VIA, as the intra-cluster communication substrate of a sophisticated Web server. Our analysis leads to several interesting conclusions, the most surprising of which is, under the same fault load, VIA-based servers deliver greater availability than TCP-based servers. If we assume higher fault rates for VIA-based servers because the underlying technology is more immature and programming model more complex, we find that packet errors or application faults would have to occur at approximately 4 times the rate in TCP-based servers before their performabilities equalize. We use our results from the study to suggest that high-performance and robust communication layers for highly available cluster-based servers should preserve message boundaries, as opposed to using byte streams, use single-copy transfers, pre-allocate channel resources, and report errors in manner consistent with the network <b>fabric’s</b> <b>fault</b> model. 1...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Concurrent error {{detection}} (CED) is {{the detection of}} errors or faults in a circuit or data path concurrent with normal operation of that circuit. The general approach for CED is to calculate a check symbol for the inputs to the circuit under operation, predict the check symbol that will result for {{the output of the}} circuit for those inputs, and compare the predicted check symbol to the one that is actually calculated for the output. If the predicted and actual check symbols are different, an error or fault has been detected. The alternative to this check symbol prediction is to use a second copy of the circuit under operation and compare the results of the two circuits. For some classes of circuits the prediction of the output check symbol can require less circuitry than a second copy of the circuit being tested. Four examples of these types of circuits are examined in this dissertation: Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), array multipliers, self-synchronous scrambler-descrambler pairs with their intervening data path, and switch <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Faults</b> in integrated circuits tend to produce unidirectional errors. Unidirectional errors are those in which all of the errors are in the same direction (e. g., 0 to 1 errors) within the block of data covered by a given check symbol. For this reason, codes that are optimized for unidirectional errors are the focus of investigation for most of the applications. In particular, the Bose-Lin codes are examined for those applications where unidirectional errors are expected to be typical. In order to examine the performance of the Bose-Lin codes in one of these applications, it was necessary to determine the theoretical performance for Bose- Lin codes for error rates beyond what had been previously studied. This analysis of Bose-Lin codes with large numbers of "burst" errors also included a further generalization of the codes...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{showing how}} far {{pre-existing}} crustal weaknesses {{left behind by}} Proterozoic mobile belts, that pass around cratonic Archean shields (Tanzania Craton to the southeast and Congo Craton to the northwest), control the geometry of the Albertine Rift. Focus is laid {{on the development of}} the Lake Albert and Lake Edward/George sub-segments and between them the greatly uplifted Rwenzori Mountains, a horst block located within the rift and whose highest peak rises to > 5000 m above mean sea level. In particular we study how the southward propagating Lake Albert sub-segment to the north interacts with the northward propagating Lake Edward/George sub-segment south of it, and how this interaction produces the structures and geometry observed in this section of the western branch of the East African Rift, especially within and around the Rwenzori horst. We simulate behaviour of the upper crust by conducting sandbox analogue experiments in which pre-cut rubber strips of varying overstep/overlap connected to a basal sheet and oriented oblique and/or orthogonal to the extension vector, are placed below the sand-pack. The points of connection present velocity discontinuities to localise deformation, while the rubber strips represent ductile domain affected by older mobile belts. From fault geometry of developing rift segments in plan view and section cuts, we study kinematics resulting from a given set of boundary conditions, and results are compared with the natural scenario. Three different basal model-configurations are used to simulate two parallel rifts that propagate towards each other and interact. Wider overstep (model SbR 3) produces an oblique transfer zone with deep grabens (max. 7. 0 km) in the adjoining segments. Smaller overlap (model SbR 4) ends in offset rift segments without oblique transfer faults to join the two, and produces moderately deep grabens (max. 4. 6 km). When overlap doubles the overstep (model SbR 5), rifts propagate sub-orthogonal to the extension direction and form shallow valleys (max. 2. 9 km). Relative ratios of overlap/overstep between rift segments dictate the kind of transition zone that develops and whether or not a block (like the Rwenzoris) is captured and rotates; hence determining the end-member geometry. Rotation direction is controlled by pre-existing <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Fault</b> orientation, fault kinematics, and block rotation (once in play) reinforce each other; and depending on the local kinematics, different parts of a captured block may rotate with variable velocities but in the same general direction.

40|$|The <b>fabric</b> of <b>fault</b> rocks (existence of foliations, matrix vs {{fragments}} ratio, etc.) {{is one of}} {{the parameters}} which influences the whole mechanic behavior of a fault, since the aseismic to the coseismic phases. In experiments driven in room humid-ity and temperature conditions on the same non cohesive fault rocks, was ob-served that fabric and frictional properties (for example the possibility of enucle-ating seismic ruptures) show an evolution with displacement. Nowadays, data on natural samples regarding the evolution of fabric with displacement are missing. It must be considered that in nature is also present, next to the mechanic role of abrasion and comminution, chemical processes like the fluids action on the rock during fragmentation (mineral dissolution, secondary mineral precipitation, etc.). In this work are studied the fabric and the clast size distribution of fault rocks sampled from the Gole Larghe Fault Zone, Adamello (Southern Alps). The sam-ples selected belong to seismogenic faults with cataclasites and pseudotachilites, which displacement grows from 0 to 9. 8 centimeters.

40|$|The White Mountains {{represent}} the westernmost {{range of the}} central northern Basin and Range province. They are situated {{to the east of}} the unextended Sierra Nevada and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone. The fault zone accommodates up to ∼ 8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Investigation of the structural and thermal history of the White Mountains indicates a two-stage Cenozoic tectonic evolution. Preextensional Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along {{the eastern side of the}} range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and currently dip up to 25 ° to the east, recording the total Cenozoic tilt of the crustal block. Apatite fission-track and (U-Th/He) thermochronological data indicate that the White Mountains underwent rapid exhumation and eastward tilting in the middle Miocene, starting at ca. 12 Ma. Geologic mapping (1 : 10, 000), fault kinematic analysis, and dating of younger volcanic sequences show that following middle Miocene east-west extension, the White Mountains have been dominated by right-lateral transtensional deformation related to the Walker Lane belt. The eruption of late Miocene and Pliocene volcanic sequences in the eastern White Mountains postdates the majority of the uplift of the range, as evidenced by infilling of paleodrainages and the presence of east-directed flow <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Fault</b> kinematic indicators from the White Mountains fault zone are characterized by apparent overprinting of dip-slip fault-motion indicators by right-lateral slickenfibers and fault striations, demonstrating that the range-bounding fault system along the western side of the White Mountains was reactivated as a dextral strike-slip fault system. At the northern and southern ends of the range, Pliocene right-lateral transtension along this northwest–southeast-trending fault systems resulted in the formation of northeast-trending pull-apart basins that truncate the mountain range and transfer strike-slip displacement eastward from the Owens Valley fault zone to the Fish Lake Valley fault zone. The inception of strike-slip faulting in Fish Lake Valley occurred at ca. 6 Ma as constrained by late Miocene volcanic units. Right-lateral faulting on the western side of the White Mountains occurred at ca. 3 Ma and is distinctly younger than the faulting in the Fish Lake Valley area, indicating a westward migration of transcurrent deformation through time...|$|R
40|$|Soft-sediment {{deformation}} involves {{complex interactions}} between discrete fracturing and diffuse bulk strain, {{described in terms}} of volume change and shear strain in a critical state mechanics framework. This study reports on a mesoscale normal fault zone, intraformational in Oligocene argillaceous sediments from the Boom Formation (Belgium), containing several metre-scale normal fault strands. They form either discrete fault planes or decimetre-wide shear zones with internal <b>fabric.</b> The <b>faults</b> have been subjected to microtectonic and petrophysical analysis. Small but significant changes occur in the porous network of the argillaceous matrix approaching a fault or shear zone, indicating compactional strain in both footwall and hanging wall. Internal compaction associated with faulting is put forward as a ductile-brittle feedback mechanism in the kinematics of intraformational fracture systems. Small differential stress induced by compaction and minor regional tectonic forces (differential uplift and tilt) and subsequent gravitational forces (downslope shear stress) induce small shear bands in nearly critically stressed weak mud. Shear banding is accompanied by layer-parallel shortening and bulk volume loss. This provides an additional extension of endogenous origin, accommodated by further deformation. This ductile-brittle feedback mechanism eventually leads to commonly observed intraformational collapse structures called polygonal fault systems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|High‐strain {{deformation}} {{within the}} Earth’s crust often occurs in localized, narrow, and sub‐parallel wall‐sided zones known as shear‐zones, which accommodate differential movement during the deformation of the lithosphere. They {{may be related}} to any tectonic regime (compression, extension, or strike–slip), varying in width from microns/millimeters (grain‐scale) to kilometers (mega‐shears). The heterogeneous character of natural deformation in shear zones produces characteristic fault rocks as mylonites and cataclasites, developed under deep‐seated (10 – 25 km deep) ductile (viscous) or shallow‐ crustal (0 – 15 km deep) brittle–ductile (frictional– viscous) deformation regimes, respectively. The analysis of brittle–ductile and ductile shear zones exhumed and/or extruded and exposed at the surface through a variety of approaches and across a range of scales is essential for unraveling deformation histories. Deciphering the kinematic significance of deformation <b>fabrics</b> within <b>fault</b> rocks and reconstructing the regional tectonics contribute profoundly to understand how localized crustal deformation occurs. In this chapter the geometric and kinematic characteristics of shear deformation fabrics associated with frontal and oblique ramps belonging to curve‐shaped thrusts are described.

Graphic struc-tural logs, compiled from a consistently acquired data set, show the distribution of structural features margin by margin, and allow comparisons to be drawn between margins. Most sediments cored in forearcs are in situ slope deposits, and bedding dips constitute a fundamental strain indicator. Histograms of bedding dips in slope deposits document a distinction between 1) actively deforming forearc regions underlain by Neogene and Quaternary accretionary wedges, and 2) less-deformed sedimentary se-quences that overlie rigid basement terranes. Structural fabrics in active-margin cores include stratal disruption and cataclastic fabrics, scaly foliation, spaced foliation, vein structure, kink bands, crenulation folds, web structure, and fissility. The distribution of structural fabrics in active-margin cores serves to distinguish between different structural regimes in forearc regions. Cores from upper-slope sites tend {{to be dominated by}} structures indicative of layer-parallel exten-sion, which may have formed during postulated bedding-parallel shear in gravity-induced downslope movement of upper sediment layers. Cores from lower-slope sites tend to be dominated by compressional structures, presumably due to overall horizontal shortening resulting from plate convergence...|$|R
40|$|The {{thickness}} {{of an active}} plate boundary fault is an important parameter for understanding the strength and spatial heterogeneity of fault behavior. We have compiled direct measurements of the {{thickness of}} subduction thrust faults from active and ancient examples observed by ocean drilling and field studies in accretionary wedges. We describe a general geometric model for subduction thrust décollements, which includes multiple simultaneously active, anastomosing fault strands tens of meters thick. The total thickness encompassing all simultaneously active strands increases to ~ 100 - 350 m at ~ 1 - 2 km below seafloor, and this thickness is maintained down {{to a depth of}} ~ 15 km. Thin sharp faults representing earthquake slip surfaces or other discrete slip events are found within and along the edges of the tens-ofmeters-thick fault strands. Although flattening, primary inherited chaotic <b>fabrics,</b> and <b>fault</b> migration through subducting sediments or the frontal prism may build mélange sections that are much thicker (to several kilometers), this thickness does not describe the active fault at any depth. These observations suggest that models should treat the subduction thrust plate boundary fault as < 1 - 20 cm thick during earthquakes, with a concentration of postseismic and interseismic creep in single to several strands 5 - 35 m thick, with lesser distributed interseismic deformation in stratally disrupted rocks surrounding the fault strands. © 2013 Geological Society of America...|$|R

In the study section, mainly consisting of thin-bedded mudstone/marl alternations with bedded chert intercalations, some lithofacies have been separated {{on the basis of}} the abundance of the calcium carbonate/clay content and the overall textural features. The deformational structures, displaying different deformational styles as folded and faulted beds, disturbed layers, clastic dikes, and slumps occur mainly in the deformed horizons that involve marl-dominated lithofacies. Small-scale water-escape structures involve beds with nodular <b>fabric.</b> Synsedimentary <b>faults</b> affect the mud-limestone dominated lithofacies, which are characterized by fault-rotating blocks producing lateral thinning. These bodies appear to have moved coherently along an overall planar surface. We relate these soft-sediment deformations to slump sheets, associatedwith down-slope sliding of sedimentary masses. The deformation mechanism and driving force for these soft-sediment deformations are due essentially to gravitational instability and dewatering. Detailing, rotational (slump) and translational (glide) slides and water-escape are the main processes causing the distinguished deformational styles. The synsedimentary extensional tectonics that affected the Upper Triassic pelagic deposits was the triggering process responsible for the instability of the seafloor inducing loss of coherence of the unconsolidated sediments on the sea bottom, developing a large number of gravity-driven slides.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of principal slip zones and {{the structures of}} their damage zones can affect earthquake nucleation, propagation, and arrest. Geometric irregularities, such as bends and segmented faults (stepovers), can modify the far-field stress state locally, {{both on and off}} principal slip surfaces, and promote or inhibit rupture though these complexities. The broad, multi-fault system of complex kinematics that is the San Gorgonio Pass region in Southern California represents a perfect area to study earthquake rupture through geometrically complex regions. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the surface, brittle deformation within the damage zone of the Mill creek fault in order to better understand the role that this fault has played in accommodating the overall right-lateral shear along the San Andreas system within the San Bernardino Mountains. This study identified three deformation events on the basis of <b>fault</b> <b>fabrics</b> and crosscutting relationships. The earliest deformation is associated with movement along the Mill Creek fault from straight segments into a restraining bend. A younger deformation event relates to the development of right-lateral oblique-normal transfer faults, which is recorded by the overprinting of epidote-mineralized faults by iron-oxide stained faults associated with the formation and movement along those faults. The youngest deformation event consists of reactivation of subsidiary faults due to shortening associated with the steep topography and mass wasting processes during rapid uplift and exhumation. The subsidiary <b>fault</b> <b>fabric</b> of the damage zone of the Mill Creek fault indicates that the trend of the maximum principal compressive stress is oriented at a relatively low angle to the fault trace. This observation contrasts to that of other faults in the San Andreas system which document large angles to the main fault. This may indicate that the Mill Creek fault operated at a higher apparent friction than the other faults. The restraining bend of the Mill Creek fault modifies the local stress state such that the maximum principal compressive stress steepens from nearly horizontal to approximately a 45 ? plunge to the NW as the bend is approached. These observations imply a significant component of 3 D deformation when compared to a similar-shaped, but relatively isolated, fault-bend along the North Branch San Gabriel fault...|$|R

No wells penetrate the rift-fill succession but from its tratigraphic context, regional thickness relationships and by analogy with onshore Karoo stratigraphy, {{the age of the}} rift is interpreted as broadly equivalent to the Karoo Supergroup. The rift is divisible into two major arms, with rift segmentation evident in the north. An angular unconformity separates a rift and post-rift sequence. This is interpreted as a Mid-Triassic hiatus related to a regional compressional events. The basement comprises the Pan-African Fold Belt along the coast, with the Damaran arm extending inland. In the Cape Cross-Walvis Bay area, the Autseib Lineament separates the Kaoko and Damaran arms. This lineament, and the adjacent basement fabrics, are shown to have strongly influenced rift geometry in this area. South of the Autseib Lineament, Damaran basement <b>fabrics</b> largely determined <b>fault</b> trends within the Namib Rift. To the north, Kaoko basement fabrics strong-ly influenced basement extensional faulting. This area was also subjected to Mid-Triassic compression. South of the Autseib Lineament, large-scale uplift was distributed across larg...|$|R
40|$|The Moresby Seamount {{detachment}} (MSD) in the Woodlark Basin (offshore Papua New Guinea) {{is a large}} active low-angle detachment excellently exposed at the seafloor, {{and cutting}} through mafic metamorphic rocks. Hydrothermal infiltration of quartz followed by that of calcite occurred during cataclastic deformation. Subsequent deformation of these a priori softer minerals leads to mylonite formation in the MSD. This study aims at {{a better understanding of}} the deformation mechanism switch from cataclastic to plastic flow. Deformation <b>fabrics</b> of the <b>fault</b> rocks were analyzed by light-optical microscopy. Rheologically critical phases were mapped to determine distributions and area proportions, and EBSD was used to measure crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Strong calcite CPOs indicate dominant dislocation creep. Quartz CPOs, however, are weak and more difficult to interpret, suggesting at least some strain accommodation by diffusion creep mechanisms. When quartz aggregates are intermixed with the polymineralic mylonite matrix diffusion creep grain boundary sliding may be dominant. The syntectonic conversion from mafic cataclasites to more siliceous and carbonaceous mylonites induced by hydrothermal processes is a critical weakening mechanism enabling the MSD to at least intermittently plastic flow at low shear stresses. This is probably a crucial process for the operation of low-angle detachments in hydrated and dominantly mafic crust...|$|R
40|$|Multichannel seismic {{reflection}} profiles {{collected from}} the intraplate deformation area in the Central Indian Ocean Basin are used to describe brittle structures produced under compressive stress. Reflectors within oceanic basement are divided into four types: north-dipping and south-dipping reverse faults that are interpreted as reactivations of structures formed at the spreading-centre as outward and inward dipping faults respectively; lower-angle, north-dipping reflectors that probably represent new faults or faults just initiating; and sub-horizontal reflectors within the uppermost crtuhsat t are interpreted as hydrothermal alteration fronts. Within the sedimentary cover upwards fault propagation shows the faults steepening from c. 40 " just above basement to near vertical and is preceded by sediment folding. A fractal analysis of faulting suggests two fault populations possibly reflecting different criteria for brittle failure. Measurements of north-south crustal shortening indicate a shortening rate of (2 +. 5 0. 9) mm a-', {{which is at the}} lower end of predictions from plate motions, but significant enough to recognize this area as a diffuse plate boundary. The formation of long-wavelength basement undulations and the reactivation on fracture zones and ridge-parallel <b>fault</b> <b>fabrics</b> are linked in a unified tectonic model driven by the high level of intraplate compressive stress in the area. There is little evidence from the seismic profiles for intraplate deformation starting before the widespread unconformity dated as 7 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Spot cores from Phase 1 {{drilling}} of {{the main}} borehole at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) were mapped to characterize the mesoscale structure and infer paleostress at depth. Cores were oriented by comparing mapped structures with image logs of the borehole. The upper core (1476 - 1484 m measured depth, MD) is a medium-grained, weakly foliated, hornblende-biotite granodiorite containing leucocratic phenocrysts and lenses. Principal structures are sub-vertical veins, shallow dipping shears, and natural fractures of unknown kinematics. The features are compatible with horizontal extension and right-lateral, normal, oblique-slip on faults striking approximately parallel to the SAF. The lower core (3055. 6 - 3067. 2 m MD) has massivebedded, pebble conglomerates and coarse to fine grained arkosic sandstones grade into siltstones. Principal structure features are conjugate shears and two minor <b>faults.</b> The fracture <b>fabric</b> is consistent with strike-slip faulting and a maximum principal compressive paleostress at ~ 80 ? to the SAF plane. This paleostress is essentially parallel to the current in situ stress measured in the main borehole and to paleostresses inferred from fracture <b>fabrics</b> in exhumed <b>faults</b> of the San Andreas system to the south. The similarity between {{the current state of}} stress and paleostress states supports the suggestion that the maximum principal compressive stress direction is, on average, at high angles to the SAF and that the fault has been weak over geologic time...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{available}} structural, stratigraphical, and AFT thermochronological data {{pointed out}} the occurrence of a strong right-lateral oblique component during the progression of rifting in the western Ross Sea. In particular, structural data in fault damage zones describe a non-coaxial, partitioned transtensional evolutionary pathway. Availability of subsidiary fault/fracture data in fault damage zones provides robust constraints {{to the state of}} stress during fault activity and, consequently, on the orientation of fracture sets characterised by the best dilational conditions. Fault-fracture patterns in damage zones are influenced by a number of parameters that include:(1) their orientation with respect to the total stress field along the shear zone, that in turn results from the interplay between the stress field produced by fault motion (kinematic stress) and the regional stress field (dynamic stress); (2) the frictional properties within the shear zone and their spatial variability; (3) the contemporary growth and interaction among multiple subsidiary fault surfaces; (4) the rock type; (5) the depth at which faulting occurs; (6) the pore fluid pressure; (7) the strain rate; (8) the structural inheritance. These parameters have been implemented in a numerical-analytical (FRAPtre) tool specifically designed to simulate fracture <b>fabrics</b> in <b>fault</b> damage zones as a function of master fault geometry and kinematics, and of the boundary stress conditions. In this contribution we use the structural architecture (subsidiary faults) in fault damage zones along the western Ross Sea shoulder to get inferences on the state of stress during rifting and on its impact on the location and orientation of dilational fractures. The western shoulder of the Ross Sea is made up by Cambrian-Ordovician granitic rocks where Cenozoic exhumed fault zones are exposed. The persistency of similar rock types all along the rift shoulder allows to neglect the role exerted by mechanical stratigraphy and structural inheritance on the fracture patterns within fault zones. Availability of mafic dyke intrusions within many fault zones provides further constraints on the best dilational fracture orientation and its evolution through time. All these features make the western shoulder of the Ross Sea the proper site for testing numerical predictions on fault zone permeability conditions during oblique rifting. Such a geodynamic framework provides promising play conditions in hydrocarbon exploration...|$|R
40|$|This study {{created a}} new tectonic model for the Arctic Alaska terrane (AAT) by {{connecting}} attributes interpreted from surface and subsurface maps. Lineaments that cross the Brooks Range and North Slope proclaim the presence of basement fault blocks trending to the northeast that locally are aligned with streams, coast and lake shorelines, submarine canyons, and periglacial features. These landforms and anomalies reflect upward propagation of long-lived transcurrent and rift <b>fault</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Facies mapping and analysis of heat-flow effects on permafrost, and data from aeromagnetic, gravity and reflection seismic surveys, support the correlation of basement faulting with geomorphic patterns. The conjugate pattern of fault blocks, seen across Paleozoic- and Mesozoic-age passive margin sequences, resembles a piano keyboard and was inherited from older rift margin and transcurrent-transfer faults. Seismic data and North Slope oil-reservoir characteristics reveal complex fault-block boundaries, and common fault reactivation and structural inversion. The rigid North American craton in the Yukon Territory directs deformation westward leading to continued crustal indention, migration of basement blocks, and thrusting of cover rocks north of the Arctic oroclinal bend. Differential south-vergent underthrusting and uplift of the basement blocks of the North Slope plate has episodically segmented and partitioned strain across the overlying weaker north-vergent cover rocks of the North Alaskan plate. These tectonic controls have influenced the structural and geomorphic evolution of the North Slope-Brooks Range foothills region, including the formation {{of oil and gas}} reservoirs and mineral deposits...|$|R
40|$|The Nason Ridge Migmatitic Gneiss of the Cascades Core is a migmatitic unit {{comprising}} concordant pelitic schist and gneiss, amphibolite, and tonalite gneiss, {{and cross}} cutting tonalite, quartz-rich granitoid, and pegmatite.  There are {{several generations of}} 'igneous' lithologies (leucosomes = tonalite, quartz-rich granitoid, and pegmatite) {{some of which are}} concordant; others clearly crosscut the strongly deformed host rocks. The host rocks are interpreted to be Chiwaukum Schist with metasedimentary (pelitic schist and some gneiss) and metavolcanic(amphibolites) origins. Metamorphic fabric in the Nason Ridge Migmatitic Gneiss is characterized by preferred orientation of platy minerals (continuous schistosity), compositional layering, mineral lineations (elongate grains and grain aggregates), and non-coaxial deformational features (asymmetric augen, grain offsets,rotated porphyroblasts, etc.). Compositional layering is characterized by quartz-plagioclase lenses and patches (mm to cm scale) and by large variations in biotite content. This composite <b>fabric</b> is <b>faulted</b> and folded by mesoscopic structures. The most strongly foliated leucosomes (gneissic tonalites) are generally concordant with the regional trend of foliation, while weakly foliated leucosomes (tonalites) and pegmatite veins crosscut host rock and tonalite gneisses. Thin melanosome layers (biotiteand amphibole schist) are developed locally around quartz - plagioclase lenses and patches. Metamorphism in the Nason Ridge Migmatitic Gneiss and the nearby Chiwaukum Schist likely peaked after intrusion of the Mt. Stuart Batholith ca. 91 - 94 Ma. Peak temperatures and pressures for the Nason Ridge Migmatitic Gneiss in the Wenatchee Ridge and Pacific Crest areas were  650 - 720 °C and 6 - 9 kbar with a pressure increase of £ 2. 0 kbar during metamorphism.  Thermodynamic modeling indicates that hydrous partial melting would begin at ca. 660 °C and is relatively pressure independent. Field and petrographic observations, mineral chemistry and thermobarometry, and bulk rock chemistry and thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria (pseudosections) applied to the Nason Ridge  235 Migmatitic Gneiss indicate {{that at least some of}} the leucosome bodies were derived by local partial melting. The clearly intrusive character and the sharp contacts between some tonalite leucosome bodies and host rock support an externally derived origin for these tonalite melts. However, some of these bodies may have originated from partial melting of the host Chiwaukum Schist and traveled a short distance before crystallization, or have been modified by deformation so as to obscure textural evidence for local derivation. Results are compatible with derivation of leucosome rocks in the Nason Ridge Migmatitic Gneiss from two non-exclusive processes: partial melting of the host rock and intrusion of externally derived tonalite melts...|$|R
40|$|High defect {{rates are}} {{associated}} with novel nanodevice-based systems owing to unconventional and self-assembly-based manufacturing processes. Furthermore, in emerging nanosystems, fault mechanisms and distributions may {{be very different from}} CMOS due to unique physical layer aspects, and emerging circuits and logic styles. Development of analytical fault models for nanosystems is necessary to explore the design of novel fault tolerance schemes that could be more effective than conventional schemes. In this paper, we first develop a detailed analytical fault model for the nanoscale application specific integrated circuits (NASIC) computing fabric and show that the probability of 0 -to- 1 faults is much higher than of 1 -to- 0 faults. We then show that in <b>fabrics</b> with unequal <b>fault</b> probabilities, using biased voting schemes, as opposed to conventional majority voting, could provide better yield. However, due to the high defect rates, voting will need to be combined with more fine-grained structural redundancy for acceptable yield. This entails degradation in performance (operating frequency) due to an increase in circuit fan-in and fan-out. We, therefore, introduce a new class of redundancy schemes called FastTrack that combine nonuniform structural redundancy with uniquely biased nanoscale voters to achieve greater yield without a commensurate loss in performance. A variety of such techniques are employed on a wire streaming processor (WISP- 0) implemented on the NASIC fabric. We show that FastTrack schemes can provide 23 % higher effective yield than conventional redundancy schemes even at 10 % defect rates along with 79 % lesser performance degradation...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{nucleation}} {{and growth of}} cataclastic fault cores from fractured damage zones in extensional and strike-slip fault zones in carbonate rocks. Analysed fault zones have similar protolith lithology and sedimentary fabric, but different geometry, kinematics, size, tectonic environment and deformation history. Orthorhombic rock lithons, a few decimetres in size, characterise the structural fabric of damage zones. Lithons derive from the intersection of a dominant fracture/cleavage set with bedding and/or joints. At the damage zone-fault core transition, orthorhombic lithons reduce in size and approach an isometric shape. Their cross-sectional aspect ratio has an average value of 1. 4. Analysed fault cores have similar rock textures, sorting and comminution degree. Particle-size distributions of fault core rocks show linear trends in log-log graphs and average fractal dimension of 2. 5. Our results on rock <b>fabrics</b> suggest that <b>fault</b> core development initiates from rock masses in damage zones, where the shape anisotropy of orthorhombic lithons favours additional fracturing at high angle to their long axes. Eventually, smaller, nearly isometric lithons generate from repeated fracturing of orthorhombic lithons. When the aspect ratio of these lithons approaches the threshold value of about 1. 4, particle rotation is favoured and cataclastic flow starts. Owing to the granular nature of the damage zone-fault core transitions in carbonate rocks, analogies with the nucleation of deformation bands in sandstones can be established. Our results may be of use to the industry for quantitative characterisation of fault zone permeability. According to the proposed model, radical changes on the permeability properties are expected during the growth of fault cores...|$|R
