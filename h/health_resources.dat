40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} is that <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres of the Eastern Cape ought to provide access to high quality, relevant and appropriate information that is evidence-based and responsive to the needs of health professionals thereby assisting health professionals accomplish their tasks. In order to provide access to quality information, the <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres are expected to provide information services within an acceptable framework of service standards. This study seeks to explore the implementation of standards in the <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres of the Eastern Cape. The study was carried out in two phases namely a literature review and a survey. The study used the quantitative method of collecting data by means of a cross-sectional survey. A self administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was piloted in the Queenstown <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre, after which appropriate changes were made before the commencement of data collection. The study was conducted in the three other <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres of the Eastern Cape, namely Umtata <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre, East London <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre and Port Elizabeth <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre. <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre managers completed the questionnaires. The overall findings of this study show that the three <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres uphold service standards. The results show that the <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres were compliant with the service standards relating to both services and management areas. The <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres were more compliant with standards relating to service areas than they were to standards relating to management areas. The results of the study furthermore demonstrate that the Umtata <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre was most compliant regarding service areas (86, 20 %) compared to the East London <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre (82, 75 %) and the Port Elizabeth <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre (72, 41 %). In regard to management areas, the results show that the Umtata <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre and East London <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> were more compliant than the Port Elizabeth <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centre. However certain aspects of their service such as availability of space, health and safety, staff performance and development, quality leadership and design and financial management need further attention. The study suggests that further research is required to objectively verify implementation of standards, to solicit health professionals’ opinions and experiences about the services provided by these <b>Health</b> <b>Resource</b> Centres and to find out if there is any connection between the quality of services provided and the quality of patient care...|$|R

This study also examines the relationship between health status, <b>health</b> care <b>resources,</b> and socioeconomic status. A panel data from “All China Data ” and China Health Statistic Yearbooks is used in this study. These data include health status, <b>health</b> care <b>resources,</b> and socioeconomic status variables at the provincial level from 1980 to 2003. Index of disparity {{was used as the}} indicator for measuring regional disparity in health and <b>health</b> care <b>resources.</b> A fixed effect model was used to estimate the relationships between health status and <b>health</b> care <b>resources</b> and their potential determinants. The results of this study show that the disparities in maternal mortality, number of beds, and number of doctors increased and then declined in most recent years. However, the values of their indexes of disparity in 2002 are still higher than their values in 1985. Therefore the disparities in health status and <b>health</b> care <b>resources</b> across the provinces increased after the economic reform.

25|$|The {{advanced}} practice nursing role {{began to}} take shape in the mid-20th century United States. Nurse anesthetists and nurse midwives were established in the 1940s, followed by psychiatric nursing in 1954. The present day concept of the APRN as a primary care provider was created in the mid-1960s, spurred on by a national shortage of medical doctors. The first formal graduate certificate program for nurse practitioners was created by Henry Silver, a physician, and Loretta Ford, a nurse, in 1965, with a vision to help balance rising healthcare costs, increase the number of healthcare providers, and correct the inefficient distribution of <b>health</b> <b>resources.</b> In 1971, The U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Elliot Richardson, made a formal recommendation in expanding the scope of the nursing practice and qualifying {{them to be able to}} serve as primary care providers. During the mid 1970s to early 1980s, the completion of a master's degree became required in order to become a certified nurse practitioner. In 2012, discussions have risen between accreditation agencies, national certifying bodies, and state boards of nursing about the possibility of making the DNP as the new minimum of education for NP certification and licensure by 2015.|$|E

Accusing the AAGN of ignoring the medical needs of rural Alberta women, {{the leaders of the}} UFWA worked to improve economic and living conditions of women farmers. Irene Parlby, the UFWA's first president, lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} provincial Department of Public Health, government-provided hospitals and doctors, and passage of a law to permit nurses to qualify as registered midwives. The AAGN leadership opposed midwife certification, arguing that nursing curricula left no room for midwife study, and thus nurses were not qualified to participate in home births. In 1919 the AAGN compromised with the UFWA, and they worked together for the passage of the Public Health Nurses Act that allowed nurses to serve as midwives in regions without doctors. Thus, Alberta's District Nursing Service, created in 1919 to coordinate the province's women's <b>health</b> <b>resources,</b> resulted chiefly from the organized, persistent political activism of UFWA members and only minimally from the actions of professional nursing groups clearly uninterested in rural Canadians' medical needs.|$|E

Allocation situations have typically been described and presented in a positive manner (i. e., who should receive medical aid).

This paper demonstrates how positive versus negative framing of the exact same <b>health</b> care <b>resource</b> allocation situation can affect the perceived fairness of allocation principles.
