5|$|The first Hugo Awards were {{presented}} at the 11th Worldcon in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories. The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them. At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as <b>independent</b> <b>events</b> and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards, and no set rules for how to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple <b>independent</b> <b>events,</b> in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E

25|$|The odds {{of being}} struck by {{lightning}} for a person over the period of 80 years have been roughly estimated as 1:10000. If the lightning strikes were <b>independent</b> <b>events,</b> the probability of being hit seven times would be 1:100007 = 1:1028. These numbers do not quite apply to Sullivan, however, who {{by the nature of}} his work was more exposed to storms than the average person. Virginia, where he lived, averages 35 to 45 thunderstorm days per year, most of which fall in June, July, and August. Between 1959 and 2000 lightning killed 58 people and injured at least 238 people in Virginia. In the United States, 3239 people were killed and 13,057 injured by lightning in the same period. Most of those were males between 20 and 40 years old caught outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Asian Kung-Fu Generation {{was first}} formed in 1996 when Masafumi Gotō, Kensuke Kita, and Takahiro Yamada met while {{attending}} a music club at Kanto Gakuin University, a private university in Yokohama, Japan. After realizing {{that they all}} shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their very own band. Masafumi Gotō became the lead vocalist and played rhythm guitar, Kensuke Kita played lead guitar and sang backup and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local Yokohama area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having collaborated with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first indie EP in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in English. The four spent {{the remainder of the}} year playing in clubs and hosting <b>independent</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{many areas}} of visual surveillance, the {{observed}} activity follows re-occurring patterns. This paper demonstrates how such patterns can be exploited to improve the detection rate of <b>independent</b> <b>event</b> detectors. We present a temporal model based on pairwise correlations between event timings, which efficiently exploits limited training data. This is combined with the response from potentially heterogeneous <b>independent</b> <b>event</b> detectors to improve the robustness of detections over extended sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system with rigorous testing on a large real-world dataset of aircraft servicing operations. We describe {{the implementation of a}} binary classifier based on local histograms of optical flow which is used as the <b>independent</b> <b>event</b> detector in our experiments. ...|$|R

2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{applications}} of the homogeneous Poisson process on the real line {{in an attempt to}} model seemingly random and <b>independent</b> <b>events</b> occurring.

[...] For example, customers arriving and being served or phone calls arriving at a phone exchange can be both studied with techniques from queueing theory. The original paper proposing the online payment system known as Bitcoin featured a mathematical model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process.|$|E
