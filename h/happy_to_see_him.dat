5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1862, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler, with {{an army of}} 5,000 men, {{occupied}} the city of New Orleans without resistance. Butler was a former Democratic party official, lawyer, and state legislator. General Butler {{was one of the}} first Major Generals of Volunteers of the Civil War appointed by Abraham Lincoln. He had gained glory as a Massachusetts state militia general who had anticipated the war and carefully prepared his six militia regiments for the conflict. At the start of hostilities he immediately marched to the relief of Washington, D.C., and despite a lack of orders had occupied and restored order to Baltimore, Maryland. As a reward Butler was made commander of Fortress Monroe, on the Virginia Peninsula. There he gained further political renown as the first to practice confiscation of fugitive slaves as contraband of war. This practice was made a later policy of war by Congress. Due to these and other astute political maneuvers, Butler had been chosen to command the army expedition to New Orleans. Because of his lack of military experience and military success, many were <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> go.|$|E
25|$|Low {{offers to}} travel to Spacetime Six to show the aliens how to return, but this {{requires}} them to repower the portal that was used. They are able to retrieve two life crystals from a machine that generates them, but Low and Brink fight over the crystals, and Brink falls to his death. During the process of opening the portal, Robbins is killed. The player has the option of reviving Robbins with a life crystal after the portal is opened; however, if they do, she immediately jumps to her death, with no crystals left to revive her a second time. With no other options, Low uses the portal to meet {{the rest of the}} aliens in Spacetime Six; with the portal open, the aliens can perceive the route home and return to Cocytus. They restore Brink and Robbins to life and cure Brink of his addiction to the crystals, though this leaves him as an elderly man. If Low left Robbins dead, she is <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> but if Low revived her, she is angry and scorns him. As promised, the aliens reconstruct a spacecraft for the humans, and representatives of the species join the humans as they return to Earth.|$|E
500|$|Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who {{had been}} {{critical}} of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: [...] "I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd...Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson...The character and storyline are pure Dredd." [...] Dredd has been recognised as a cult film since its release. Some reviewers drew comparisons between Dredd and , another action film released a few months earlier, noting that similar elements in setting, story, and characters made Dredd appear derivative.|$|E
60|$|Stripped {{not only}} of all the outward symbols of civilization, Tarzan had also reverted morally and mentally {{to the status of}} the savage beast he had been reared. Never had his civilization been more than a veneer put on for the sake of her he loved because he thought it made her <b>happier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> thus. In reality he had always held the outward evidences of {{so-called}} culture in deep contempt. Civilization meant to Tarzan of the Apes a curtailment of freedom in all its aspects--freedom of action, freedom of thought, freedom of love, freedom of hate. Clothes he abhorred--uncomfortable, hideous, confining things that reminded him somehow of bonds securing him to the life he had seen the poor creatures of London and Paris living. Clothes were the emblems of that hypocrisy for which civilization stood--a pretense that the wearers were ashamed of what the clothes covered, of the human form made in the semblance of God. Tarzan knew how silly and pathetic the lower orders of animals appeared in the clothing of civilization, for he had seen several poor creatures thus appareled in various traveling shows in Europe, and he knew, too, how silly and pathetic man appears in them since the only men he had seen in the first twenty years of his life had been, like himself, naked savages. The ape-man had a keen admiration for a well-muscled, well-proportioned body, whether lion, or antelope, or man, and it had ever been beyond him to understand how clothes could be considered more beautiful than a clear, firm, healthy skin, or coat and trousers more graceful than the gentle curves of rounded muscles playing beneath a flexible hide.|$|R
50|$|In March 2002, a {{newspaper}} article alerted Victor that a hostile takeover was threatening Julia's Martin Designs, so he dropped everything to go to Lake Forest. Julia was <b>happy</b> and surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> He {{told her that she}} looked wonderful and that he knew about the takeover bid, then offered to help. After some reminiscing, Julia told him how she and her late husband, Charles, had created their successful design business together and said that she didn't think Victor was {{the kind of person that}} could work side-by-side with his wife in business. She joked that he wasn't as controlling as when they were married, but she was young and he was older and set in his ways. She asked about his kids and his love life and was pleased that he was dating Nikki again, whom she liked. Julia told him about her daughter, Jamie, who was in college.|$|R

Happy ran away due to being laughed at because of his big ears which he wears under his top hat. Rudolph shows Happy his nose and tells him his own story of being shunned because of his nonconformity before asking <b>Happy</b> <b>to</b> let <b>him</b> <b>see</b> his ears.

Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it just makes me so <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> and I think other people will feel the same way."

[...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix who enjoyed the previous week's episode as he believed the show was back in peak, noted that the show [...] "was back to more uneven, but still funny, territory" [...] with this episode. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode [...] "worked just fine", and enjoyed Liz's disastrous appearance on Right On. He, however, did not like Jenna and Kenneth's pageant story. A contributor from The Huffington Post said the episode had a [...] "ton of hilarious moments", and that Queen Latifah [...] "was {{the highlight of the}} show". Vanity Fairs Juli Weiner enjoyed Maulik Pancholy's appearance as Jack's assistant Jonathan, writing that Jonathan is [...] "perhaps the most underutilized character on the show, and we were <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> get some screen time this episode." [...] Further in her recap, Weiner said [...] "Thank you, Jenna and Jack, for mercifully putting an end to the tension-less Kenneth's-rehiring narrative." [...] Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times deemed it a [...] "wildly clever and satiric episode" [...] that also [...] "delivered an important critique about the limitations of diversity programs." [...] Blake said that Jane Krakowski's Jenna was on fire in [...] "Let's Stay Together". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the show has always dealt with racism issues [...] "pretty well" [...] and that the issue featured here [...] "was no exception." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported that [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] was one of his favorite episodes of the season, and that it was a [...] "massively pleasing episode."

When the leader of the teen gang scares away the rest of the students, they force Greg and Rowley to eat the legendary [...] "cheese", a moldy piece of cheese that has been left {{on the grounds of the}} school for years. Rowley is the first to eat the cheese - except when it comes to Greg's turn, he claims that he's lactose intolerant and that eating cheese will kill him. The principal turns up and the teens disappear. The other students see the cheese in front of Rowley and believe he has eaten from it. Greg takes the blame and claims he ate the cheese.

50|$|The {{second section}} of the story begins 15 years after their day {{together}} in Boston. The two have not spoken this entire time. Tom is now married with children. Tom laments his desire to have written to Nancy many times, once during his engagement and another {{when he left the}} US for Europe {{for an extended period of}} time. He did, however, send her many books. Tom is traveling to East Rodney to survey land purchased by his father. When he arrives he is excited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Nancy. He attends a ball and is greeted by Nancy’s father who informs him that she has been ill with a serious form of rheumatoid arthritis for quite sometime. She is no longer capable of leaver one room in her house. She spends her days giving dance lessons and giving extra help to students from the local school who are having learning troubles. She remains the life of the town. Tom is deeply saddened by this information and travels the next day to visit her. Upon seeing her, he is immediately happy and remembers their lifelong friendship (which he thinks has not changed at all). She expresses how <b>happy</b> she is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> but does not spend a lot of time complaining of her situation.|$|R

If you can’t get a pole you want it to be your teammate so I am happy that he was able to get it done.” Jeb Burton and Brendan Gaughan failed to qualify for the race. Just before the race, BK Racing announced that Burton will drive the No. 23 car in place of teammate J. J. Yeley. Because of the driver change, Jeb Burton started the race from the rear of the field.|$|R

With time, Mirabeau would support the queen even more, going as far as to suggest that Louis XVI [...] "adjourn" [...] to Rouen or Compiègne. However, this leverage with the Assembly ended with the death of Mirabeau in April 1791, despite the attempt of several moderate leaders of the Revolution to contact the queen to establish some basis of cooperation with her.|$|E

Managing to melt his way free using his nose, Rudolph climbs up to Eon's nest where he finds <b>Happy,</b> who refuses <b>to</b> leave. Rudolph shows Happy his nose and tells him his own story of being bullied because of his nonconformity before asking <b>Happy</b> <b>to</b> let <b>him</b> <b>see</b> his ears.

With this declaration, Happy shouts out with joy, but causes Eon to awaken. Rudolph quickly tells <b>Happy</b> <b>to</b> take off his hat and leave it off for good.

2500|$|The Japanese scholar Hidetada Mukai wrote Austen {{never gave}} the precise {{wealth of the}} Bertram family, but it is {{mentioned}} that Mr. Rushworth has an annual income of £12,000 and the Bertrams live on less than that. Hidetda noted that Mansfield Park is described in the novel as a modern house, and Sir Thomas wants Maria to marry Mr. Rushworth to improve the social prestige of his family, suggesting that the Bertrams are a nouveau riche family whose income depends on the plantation in Antigua. The abolition {{of the slave trade}} in 1807 did indeed, as the abolitionists had hoped, impose serious strain on the plantations of the British West Indies as without new slaves from Africa to replace the ones who had died of yellow fever and malaria, it become more difficult to turn a profit owing to labour shortages, and Austen may have been referring to this crisis on the Caribbean plantations when Sir Thomas leaves for Antigua for two years to deal with unspecified problems on his plantation. Hidetada pointed that when Sir Thomas returns after his two-year absence in Antigua, none of his children are <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again, suggesting that Sir Thomas is an oppressive father, and that Austen made him a slave master with his plantation in Antigua as an way of indicating that. Hidetada further argued that Austen made Sir Thomas a slave master as an feminist attack on the patriarchal society of Regency England, noting that the way in which Sir Thomas treats woman, including his own daughters and as well as Price, as disposable commodities to be traded and bartered for to his own advantage is parallel with his treatment of his slaves who are exploited to support his lifestyle. Hidetada also noted that Sir Thomas talks much about his time in the West Indies, but when Price asks him about his slaves, she is greeted with [...] "dead silence", suggesting Sir Thomas cannot speak of something that he knows in his heart to be wrong.|$|E
2500|$|Jasikevičius's father Linas {{always was}} a sports lover {{and along with}} him, he {{followed}} practically everything, together they cheered for USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad {{took him to the}} first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and not once was chasing Šarūnas when he was trying to run away from the workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated {{that it would be a}} huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had a strong conversation with Šarūnas and forbade to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with the future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with which he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player in his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was [...] "talented but lazy" [...] as he was no devotee of the gym; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, once his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of kind which happens only once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: [...] "No school? So no basketball". Though, his parents were <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> venting his hyperactivity in basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company in the area. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called minus, a kind of forerunner of little game that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called [...] "horse". It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home rather than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris Kaunas player about which he was so crazy that he knew everything about every player, even the players’ shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris' victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.|$|E

On the death of his character in the episode, Kassianides said, [...] "I'm sad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> go, [...] I'm <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> someone like that get their comeuppance".
