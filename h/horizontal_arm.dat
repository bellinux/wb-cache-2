25|$|A {{radial arm}} saw has a {{circular}} saw mounted on a sliding <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm.</b> In addition to making length cuts a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Irish tales {{depict the}} Dagda {{as a figure}} of power, armed with a club. In Dorset there is a famous outline of an ithyphallic giant known as the Cerne Abbas Giant with a club cut into the chalky soil. While this was {{probably}} produced in relatively modern times (English Civil War era), it was long {{thought to be a}} representation of the Dagda. This has been called into question by recent studies which show {{that there may have been}} a representation of what looks like a large drapery hanging from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> of the figure, leading to suspicion that this figure actually represents Hercules (Heracles), with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm and carrying the club he used to kill it. In Gaul, it is speculated that the Dagda is associated with Sucellus, the striker, equipped with a hammer and cup.|$|E

2500|$|The first local flag of Tasmania {{was adopted}} by {{proclamation}} of Tasmanian colonial Governor Sir Frederick Weld on 9 November 1875. [...] The flag had a white cross on a blue field, in the canton was the Union Flag, and in the fly was five five-pointed stars of the Southern Cross. [...] The British Blue Ensign and Red Ensign (for use respectively by government vessels and by those privately owned) were to have a white cross added. At the fly end of each flag a Southern Cross was to be formed of white stars added {{above and below the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> of the cross. Two weeks later, on 23 November, those flags were officially abandoned because Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London made it clear that only a single badge could be placed at the fly end of the ensign, as set out by rule of the British Admiralty.|$|E

50|$|To use the system, the {{operator}} would first estimate the altitude {{of the target}} aircraft and then move the smaller pointer as measured against a scale on the upper <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm.</b> They would then rotate the apparatus around the vertical shaft so the target aircraft lay {{along the line of}} the upper bar, and then rotate the bar vertically until it pointed at the aircraft. The vertical pointer now pointed to a grid location on the map, which could be read off to the reporting center.|$|E
5000|$|Standard British three {{position}} lower quadrant semaphore signals, with an arm {{for each}} direction and spectacles mounted below them, were used from {{the introduction of}} time-interval working in 1855. The last signal of this type was removed from Girilambone in 1952. The Danger signal was given by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> and red light during darkness. The arm was lowered 45 degrees, with a green light for Caution, to [...] "slacken speed", and to an almost vertical position in a slotted post with a white light for All Right.|$|E
50|$|The {{meaning of}} the cameos on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arms</b> is even less clear. The use of these {{particular}} items of spolia seems intentional, but a convincing iconographic interpretation of the naked warrior with spear and helmet and the noble women {{has not yet been}} made. Since both look towards Jesus, like the Sun and the Moon, it seems possible that they are intended to amplify those images.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cross is}} a silver, red {{enameled}} Greek cross, {{similar to that}} of the Order of the Cross of Independence and the Cross of Independence of 1930.

50|$|A superlative {{example is}} the Heroes' Cross on Caraiman Peak, in the Bucegi {{mountains}} of Romania {{at an altitude of}} 2291m — the greatest construction of this sort in the world (as recognized in 2013 by the Guinness World Records). Built between 1926 and 1928 to honor the fallen heroes of the First World War, great efforts were put into its construction, the location being so high and so remote. Marie of Edinburgh, Queen of Romania, and King Ferdinand of Romania initiated and supervised its construction, supported by war veterans' associations, local businesses and many local volunteers. The Cross is 36m high, with its <b>horizontal</b> <b>arms</b> spanning 14m; it has many light bulbs covering its entire face on the Prahova Valley side, and at commissioning it had an electrical generator in its base and its light could be seen from a great distance. Nowadays it is connected to the electrical grid. Under the Communist regime, it was endangered by plans to transform it into a totally different symbol, by removing the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arms</b> and adding a red star on top.|$|R
50|$|Each {{player is}} dealt five hole cards, and then five {{community}} cards are dealt {{one at a}} time followed by a betting round, exactly as in Cincinnati. (One variant permits a discard and draw after the five hole cards are dealt, followed by the betting round). They are dealt in a cross pattern with a center card (dealt last) and four other cards to its left, right, top, and bottom. Each player plays the best five-card poker hand he can make from his five-hole cards plus the three cards from either the vertical arm or the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> of the cross.|$|E

5000|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering a bracket is any intermediate component for fixing one part to another, usually larger, part. What makes a bracket a bracket {{is that it}} is intermediate between the two and fixes the one to the other. Brackets vary widely in shape, but a prototypical bracket is the L-shaped metal piece that attaches a shelf (the smaller component) to a wall (the larger component): its vertical arm is fixed to one (usually large) element, and its <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> protrudes outwards and holds another (usually small) element. This shelf bracket is effectively the same as the architectural bracket: a vertical arm mounted on the wall, and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> projecting outwards for another element to be attached on top of it or below it. To enable the outstretched arm to support a greater weight, a bracket will often have a third arm running diagonally between the horizontal and vertical arms, or indeed the bracket may be a solid triangle. By extension almost any object that performs this function of attaching one part to another (usually larger) component is also called a bracket, even though it may not be obviously L-shaped. Common examples that are often not really L-shaped at all but attach a smaller component to a larger and are still called brackets are the components that attach a bicycle lamp to a bicycle, and the rings that attach pipes to walls.|$|E
40|$|Reading Dr Lloyd’s letter 1 in the July 2013 {{issue of}} the Journal has {{prompted}} me to write in on this topic. Removal of an intrauterine device (IUD) involves traction on the threads causing the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arms</b> of the device to come together in the nar-rower {{lower half of the}} uterus during its downward movement. It is relatively easy for the collar of hormone in an intrauterine system (IUS) to be dislodged. The combined diameter of the folded arms is marginally greater than the vertical limb of the device. Shearing could cause the hormonal collar to slip upwards on downward traction of the device during removal. This is different to a copper IUD where there is a difference in the dia-meters of the vertical limb and the folded <b>horizontal</b> <b>arms</b> of the device. Neither collar, copper nor hormone, should be retained in the uterus if conception is being considered by the woman. However, {{it is also important to}} remove them to exclude the small possibility of actinomyces infection...|$|R

50|$|The {{museum has}} also paired {{up with the}} Mechanical Engineering {{department}} at the University of Michigan to win an Editor’s Award for outstanding exhibitions at the Maker Faire in 2010 which was held at The Henry Ford in Dearborn. The students and faculty of the Mechanical Engineering department presented the inverted pendulum, much like those in a human transporter Segway, to highlight the importance of feedback controls and balance in systems. This exhibit can now {{be found at the}} museum and features a vertical pendulum that is driven by a motor {{at the end of a}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> and uses sensors to keep the pendulum in its inverted position.|$|E
5000|$|Older {{forms of}} signal {{displayed}} their different aspects by their physical position. The earliest types comprised a board that was either turned face-on and fully {{visible to the}} driver, or rotated {{so as to be}} practically invisible. While this type of signal is still in use in some countries (e.g., France and Germany), by far {{the most common form of}} mechanical signal worldwide is the semaphore signal. This comprises a pivoted arm or blade that can be inclined at different angles. A <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> is the most restrictive indication (for 'danger', 'caution', 'stop and proceed' or 'stop and stay' depending on the type of signal).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike most {{types of}} {{woodworking}} machinery, the {{radial arm saw}} has a clear genesis: it was invented by Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey. DeWalt applied for patents in 1923, which were issued in 1925 (US Patent 1,528,536). [...] DeWalt and others subsequently patented many variations on the original, but DeWalt's original design (sold under the moniker Wonder Worker) remained the most successful: a circular saw blade directly driven by an electric motor held in a yoke sliding along a <b>horizontal</b> <b>arm</b> that is some distance above a horizontal table surface. A saw which combines the sliding and compound features {{is known as a}} sliding compound miter saw or SCMS.|$|E
