Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered-extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 0.2.|$|E

In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

5|$|Density {{criteria}} {{range from}} above 3.5g/cm3 to above 7g/cm3. Atomic weight definitions {{can range from}} <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> sodium (atomic weight 22.98); <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); or more than 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same problem may occur with atomic weight based definitions.|$|E

Burned units had 37 % <b>greater</b> CI <b>than</b> unburned units (P[*]=[*] 0.037) and thinned units had 42 % <b>greater</b> CI <b>than</b> unthinned units (P[*]=[*] 0.025).
