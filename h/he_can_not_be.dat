2500|$|The {{essence of}} Iblis {{has been a}} {{discussion}} subject among scholars. Some hold him to be an angel, a Jinn or neither an angel nor a jinni, but created from fire alone. In terms of its essence, there are different criteria that are discussed. Since the command to prostrate addressed to the angels, and his stay in heaven, he occurs as an angel. On the other hand, the Quran calls him a Jinni in Surah 18:50. Some scholars prefer a metaphorical reading on this vers, thus its describing Iblis' actions ("he hid obedience from God") or read [...] "Jinni", not as creature, but as meaning [...] "one who came from Jannah" [...] (from the verbal root: [...] ).. Another criteria, based on hadithtraditions, Angels are generally created from light, and Jinn from a sort of fire, however based on traditions from Muhammed's companions, some angels are an exception and also made from fire, therefore Tabari stated, his origin from fire should not distract from accepting at least Iblis original identity as an angel. Other scholars regarding his creation from fire [...] indicates light and fire are akin, and light actually originated from fire, thus fire and light {{should not be taken}} too precise. Additionally, some scholars argue [...] if he was an angel, he couldn't disobey God's command, stating angels strictly follow God's instructions, therefore <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a real angel, while other scholars assert, angels may commit errors, for example by doubting or opposing the creation of humans.|$|E

60|$|It now {{remains to}} {{complete}} this sketch {{of the growth of}} political economy by a brief account of the writers on the Continent and in the United States, beginning with France. About the time of the founding of the London “Economist” (1844) and “The Statistical Journal” (1839) in England, there was established in Paris the “Journal des Économistes” (1842), which contains many valuable papers. On the whole, the most popular writer since J. B. Say has been Bastiat,(56) who aspired to be the French Cobden. He especially urged a new(57) view of value, which he defined as the relation established by an exchange of services; that nature’s products are gratuitous, so that man can not exact anything except for a given service. Chiefly as a foe of protection, which he regarded as qualified socialism, he has won a reputation for popular and clever writing; and he was led to believe in a general harmony of interests between industrial classes; but in general <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> said to have much influenced the course of French thought. On value, rent, and population, he is undoubtedly unsound. A writer of far greater depth than Bastiat, with uncommon industry and wide knowledge, was Michel Chevalier,(58) easily the first among modern French economists. He has led in the discussion upon the fall of gold, protection, banking, and particularly upon money; an ardent free-trader, he had influence enough to induce France to enter into the commercial treaty of 1860 with England. One of the ablest writers on special topics is Levasseur,(59) who has given us a history of the working-classes before and since the Revolution, and the best existing monograph on John Law. The most industrious and reliable of the recent writers is the well-known statistician, Maurice Block,(60) while less profound economists were J. A. Blanqui(61) and Wolowski.(62) The latter devoted himself enthusiastically to banks of issue, and bimetallism. A small group gave themselves up chiefly to studies on agriculture and land-tenures—H. Passy,(63) Laveleye, and Lavergne.(64) The latter {{is by far the most}} important, as shown by his “L’économie rurale de la France depuis 1789” (1857), which gives a means of comparing recent French agriculture with that before the Revolution, as described in Arthur Young’s “Travels in France” (1789). The best systematic treatise in French is the “Précis de la science économique” (1862), by Antoine-Élise Cherbuliez,(65) a Genevan. The French were the first to produce an alphabetical encyclopædia of economics, by Coquelin and Guillaumin, entitled the “Dictionnaire de l’économie politique” (1851-1853, third edition, 1864). Courcelle-Seneuil,(66) by his “Traité théorique et pratique d’économie politique” (second edition, 1867); and Baudrillart, by a good compendium. Joseph Garnier, Dunoyer,(67) Paul Leroy-Beaulieu,(68) Reybaud,(69) De Parieu,(70) Léon Say,(71) Boiteau, and others, have done excellent work in France, and Walras(72) in Switzerland.|$|E

Hence, Oro is in all things, and himself is all things--the time-old creed. But since evil abounds, and Oro is all things, then <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> perfectly good; wherefore, Oro's omnipresence and moral perfection seem incompatible. Furthermore, my lord those orthodox systems which ascribe to Oro almighty and universal attributes every way, those systems, I say, destroy all intellectual individualities but Oro, and resolve the universe into him. But this is a heresy; wherefore, orthodoxy and heresy are one. And thus is it, my lord, that upon these matters we Mardians all agree and disagree together, and kill each other with weapons that burst in our hands. Ah, my lord, with what mind must blessed Oro look down upon this scene! Think you he discriminates between the deist and atheist? Nay; for the Searcher of the cores of all hearts well knoweth that atheists there are none. For in things abstract, men but differ in the sounds that come from their mouths, and not in the wordless thoughts lying at the bottom of their beings. The universe is all of one mind. Though my twin-brother sware to me, by the blazing sun in heaven at noon-day, that Oro is not; yet would he belie the thing he intended to express. And who lives that blasphemes? What jargon of human sounds so puissant as to insult the unutterable majesty divine? Is Oro's honor in the keeping of Mardi?-- Oro's conscience in man's hands? Where our warrant, with Oro's sign- manual, to justify the killing, burning, and destroying, or far worse, the social persecutions we institute in his behalf? Ah! how shall these self-assumed attorneys and vicegerents be astounded, when they shall see all heaven peopled with heretics and heathens, and all hell nodding over with miters! Ah! let us Mardians quit this insanity. Let us be content with the theology in the grass and the flower, in seed- time and harvest. Be it enough for us to know that Oro indubitably is. My lord! my lord! sick with the spectacle of the madness of men, and broken with spontaneous doubts, I sometimes see but two things in all Mardi to believe:--that I myself exist, and that I can most happily, or least miserably exist, by the practice of righteousness.
