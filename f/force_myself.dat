500|$|In March 2009 the Hoodoo Gurus {{also signed}} a new {{recording}} contract with Sony Music Australia, the deal includes the band's back catalogue {{as well as}} a new album, the band's ninth and the first since the release of Mach Schau in 2004. [...] Brad Shepherd said it had the potential to be [...] "a career defining record". [...] During the process of writing the album Dave Faulkner said in reference to the eclectic mix of songs ready for the album that [...] "rather than stopping myself writing something, I just didn't artificially <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to write in any direction". [...] The album was originally scheduled for release in September 2009 but they were not happy with the final mix. Hoodoo Gurus then sent their songs off to Durango, Colorado, where Ed Stasium, who worked on the band's previous albums Kinky and Crank worked with Faulkner. Faulkner flew to the US after Hoodoo Gurus performed in Japan, their first performances there in over 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{kind of had}} to hit rock bottom. I didn't have a band. I didn't have a studio. I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, I forced myself to play the guitar. I would <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was offered}} many {{roles in the}} 1940s and {{throughout}} her retirement years but she rejected {{all but a few}} of them. In the few instances when she accepted, the slightest problem led her to drop out. Although she refused to talk to friends throughout her life about her reasons for retiring, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman four years before her death [...] "I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to go to the studio… I really wanted to live another life." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to mention}} Van Brandt's name, rather than hear it pass her lips.|$|R
60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{back to my}} own affair.|$|R
60|$|From that moment, {{whenever}} I {{felt as if}} it {{was impossible}} to take another step, I looked at Darius, and <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to forget weariness or hunger.|$|R
2500|$|The {{motivation}} of the German soldiers tumbled. [...] "Now there is disappointment, {{and it is}} huge", Thaer wrote in April 1918, [...] "This is why even assaults, even when well-prepared with artillery attacks, fizzled {{out as soon as}} our infantry reached the heavily pummeled zone". [...] Until the German army's failed Spring offensive the German army was not as badly affected by [...] "flight from the flag" [...] (desertion) as the entente armies, however. [...] Initially, during the 1918 spring offensive, German troop motivation and morale surged, only crumbling again after the offensive failed. [...] Thaer commented in his diary, [...] "personally I had to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to the conviction that the troops now operated under a crushing burden of disappointment. [...] The attacking spirit of 21 March and the days that followed which I experienced to the south of Arras 4- 6 weeks ago was no longer there. ... It is clear to every company commander and every battery commander, and indeed to every musketeer and gunner, that hope has been shattered ... For the weaker characters there are already bad consequences: [...] general overload (Allgemeine Drückebergerei) ...".|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are right. I repress {{myself and}} <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to act a part. It {{is not in}} tameness of spirit that I submit. I have a settled purpose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Teddy Bear, {{you know}} I couldn't. But I could run away, I could hide from you, I could lock myself up and <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> {{not to come}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You must {{forgive me}} for <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> upon you to-day,' he said slowly. 'But my time is very short, and I wanted {{to speak to you}} at once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think she}} has done badly for herself, so far,” I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to say. “I suppose you know that she began life by herding the village goats.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{different}} then," [...] he explained. [...] "I was scared--badly scared--but I felt I {{could do the}} thing if I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to it. Now I'm almost certain that I can't." ...|$|R
60|$|While he {{uttered the}} last words, I felt my self-possession returning. I could not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to speak, as I would fain have spoken--I could only move away, to leave him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We'll go together,' {{repeated}} Lagnier. 'You {{shall see}} how soon I will <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to be recognised as a gentleman, and you shall profit by it. It is agreed? Are we one?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is most preposterous in me thus to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon you, {{and then}} trouble {{you with my}} cares. But I had been alone so long, and I was so weary of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Secretary as {{suddenly}} brightened, and returned: 'Upon my honour I had no thought but for you. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to be constrained, lest you might misinterpret my being more natural. There. It's gone.' ...|$|R
60|$|So far I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to listen}} to him. At those last words {{the picture of the}} future that he was placing before me became too hideous to be endured. I refused to hear more.|$|R
60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|R
6000|$|Amal. Assist me, Venus, for I tremble when I am to speak, but I must <b>force</b> <b>myself.</b> [...] [Aside. Sir, I would crave but {{one short}} minute with you, And some few words.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{wonder if}} that has any special significance,” he said. “I will not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon the man, but it’s quite evident I can’t afford to stand off if he means to be friendly.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, it's not my fault. I can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to believe. If {{there is}} a God after all and he punishes me because I {{honestly}} don't believe in Him I can't help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What have I done?" [...] {{he asked}} fiercely. [...] "What have I failed to do? Why {{do you look}} as though I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> upon you? Haven't I the right? Don't you wish to see me?" ...|$|R
60|$|My voice faltered {{a little}} in spite of me. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> from the room. It was no time, then, for parting with the {{self-control}} which might yet serve me in my need before the day was out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{promise that}} you will never tell James that he owes {{anything}} to me. I couldn't bear him to think I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> on him so as to {{have a sort of}} claim. Please promise me that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Craving your pardon, madam, I have {{no wish to}} <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> on her {{presence}} thus early," [...] said. Douglas, in an indifferent tone; [...] "it might displease her, and were no way agreeable to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon you," [...] Dominey said {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "It seems strange, though, to meet right out here, far away even from the by-ways of life, just to shake hands and pass on. I am sick to death of niggers and animals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Village of Treen, October 22nd.)--The {{events of}} this one day have changed the whole future of my life. I must <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to write of them at once. Something warns me that if I delay, though only till to-morrow, I shall be {{incapable}} of relating them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I'm a coward--a {{natural born}} coward--and I {{can have a}} lot of fun <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> to face the shell and shrapnel. That's the truth; I'm not a liar. And for a long time I've been wondering--wondering--" [...] His voice died away in a murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... "The young lady," [...] said I, <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> {{to assume}} {{an air of}} pleasantry, which, I believe, became me {{extremely}} ill, [...] "would perhaps have been inclined {{to look a little}} lower on the family-tree, for the branch to which she was desirous of clinging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing in the world," [...] said I, <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> upon confession, as {{the best}} way of {{clearing}} myself out of the scrape,--"only--only I sent you a little parcel, and as you are so regular in acknowledging letters and communications, I--I thought it might have miscarried--that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir,--You will do me grievous wrong if {{you suppose}} that I {{am trying to}} <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> on your acquaintance. My object in writing is to prevent you (if I can) from misinterpreting my {{language}} and my conduct, on the only two occasions when we happen to have met.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> {{back into}} my chair. It is far into the night, and I [...] am alone, waiting, listening. If it be spirit, she will come to me; [...] and if it be woman, I shall hear her cry above the storm--unless it be [...] a demon mocking me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and I do {{not so much}} {{object to}} your saying it as to your {{thinking}} it, for you know I did not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> on your notice; {{it was you who}} sought my acquaintance and won my confidence; and that you, above all others, should think of me in this way!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to {{take part}} in conversation, {{speaking}} of this or that trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth.|$|R
60|$|This much Jacob {{must have}} {{understood}} {{as well as}} I, for when I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> backward, pushing vigorously against him, he gave way, and we thus slowly retreated until having gained such {{a distance from the}} feasting murderers that it seemed safe to rise to our feet.|$|R
60|$|My little pupil {{was away}} for the day--gone {{to play with the}} clergyman's {{children}} down in the village, and my time was my own. I was thankful, for I could not possibly have <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> into the wearisome routine of lesson hearing and teaching. Solitude was my only relief.|$|R
