The effort is organised by the Rome Coordinating Committee. [...] This process typically takes many months {{of work by}} investigators, organized into committees. The committees work by mail and telephone conferences until the final, defining meeting, which takes place in Rome, Italy. The Rome III effort encompassed 87 participants from 18 countries in 14 committees. Members were added from countries outside the more industrialized Western nations; this time there were members from China, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Hungary, and Romania. Additional working teams were created to work on issues including: gender, society, patient, and social issues; and pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. Two committees (neonate/toddler and child/adolescent), rather than one, served the pediatrics FGIDs.|$|E

Specifically, {{little is known}} about self-management approaches for elevated mood states; this study investigated self-management strategies for: (1) maintaining balance in mood, and (2) stopping progression into hypomania/mania. METHODS: To identify the common components of BD self-management, <b>Delphi</b> Consensus Consultation <b>methods</b> were combined with a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach across five study phases: (1) Qualitative dataset content analysis; (2) Academic/grey literature reviews; (3) Content analysis; (4) Two Delphi rounds (rating strategies on a 5 -point Likert scale, Very Unhelpful-Very Helpful), and; (5) Quantitative analysis and interpretation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gain {{consensus}} on a definition of Nurse-Managed Centers. To accomplish this task, <b>Delphi</b> survey <b>methods</b> were used with the participants of the Second Biennial Conference on Nurse-Managed Centers. <b>Delphi</b> <b>methods</b> entail obtaining autonomous consensus from experts through rounds of questionnaires and feedback of results. A questionnaire was developed that included 22 items obtained from the literature, past conferences, and the expertise of the authors. An additional 6 items were suggested by the conferees. Of the 168 conferees, 148 participated in the first round, 147 in the second, and 133 in the third. Fifty-three percent of the respondents were educators, 22 % administrators, and 11 % clinicians. More than 75 % of the respondents were masters prepared. After the third round, the highest-ranked items indicated that NMCs should provide direct access for clients to professional nursing, be part of a strong referral network, base services on client participation, and provide holistic treatment. A definition was formulated and associations between ranked items and selected demographic characteristics were analyzed. Although Nurse-Managed Centers (NMCs) are being planned, developed, and implemented across the country, there is some confusion about the definition of NMCs. In 1982...|$|R

This paper presents a Vague set-based {{water security}} evaluation methodology {{by building a}} Vague set similarity model. AHP and <b>Delphi</b> <b>methods</b> are used to give weights to indexes and evaluate the urban water security assurance. A western city is used as an example for the empirical study. In the nine indexes for water security evaluation, the values for socio-economic environment and pressure are 0. 24 and 0. 41 respectively, which indicates that the city has relatively large socio-economic pressures. The WSAI values of the resource index and environment pressure for water are 0. 94 and 0. 96. The relatively high figures show that water resources are fully exploited and its environment is relatively well-protected.

40|$|Empirical {{studies suggest}} that some {{computer}} users are becoming addicted to the Internet, causing academic, social and relationship problems. Symptoms of Internet overuse appear to be occurring worldwide, including Thailand, where Internet use has increased dramatically. As well, literature is emerging surrounding the outcomes of Internet overuse. However, there is debate in the literature pertaining to what constitutes IA and the consistent diagnosis criteria and/or precise clinical definitions of IA {{have not yet been}} established. This study employs three rounds of a modified <b>Delphi</b> technique <b>method</b> to obtain a consensus definition and diagnostic criteria of IA and to identify salient therapeutic strategies for minimising the harm of IA. Thirty experts in Thai society were recruited to participate in this study. Responses to the questions on each round were summarised, analysed, and salient themes identified. The consensus definition and diagnostic criteria of IA derived from the <b>Delphi</b> <b>methods</b> will be used to classify a sample of students reported Internet use as addicted or normal in a survey of 1, 200 secondary school students in Chiang Mai, Thailand as a subsequent part of this research.

Additionally the identification of potential strategies is proposed for minimising the harm which might be caused by IA among secondary students in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and subsequently to a broader audience...|$|R
30|$|Resolving {{conflicts}} {{during the}} pre-assessment and assessment phase requires deliberation among knowledge holders. The formats listed {{in this category}} provide opportunities for experts (not necessarily scientists) to assess and discuss the main characteristics of the risk under investigation. The aim of an epistemic discourse {{is to find the}} most adequate description or explanation of a phenomenon (for example, which physical impacts are to be expected by the emission of specific substances?). Formats that promise to meet these requirements are expert hearings, expert workshops, science workshops, expert panels or advisory committees, or consensus conferences as practised in the medical field. If anecdotal knowledge is needed, one can refer to focus groups, panels of volunteers, and simple surveys. More sophisticated methods of reducing complexity for difficult risk issues include <b>Delphi</b> <b>methods</b> (explained below), group Delphi, meta-analytical workshops, and scoping exercises. The most frequently used formats for resolving conflicts about complex relationships are described in the following sections.|$|R
