A negative sheet was exposed inside the camera, then lined up with a positive sheet and squeezed {{through a set of}} rollers which spread a reagent between the two layers, creating a developing film [...] "sandwich". The negative developed quickly, after which some of the unexposed silver halide grains (and the latent image it contained) were solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, the back of the camera was opened and the negative peeled away to reveal the print.|$|E

30|$|Since our {{solution}} {{is not based}} on the phase-average approach, we obtain the instantaneous time-dependent coupling between the position and velocity fluctuations. We find that the correlation between position and velocity fluctuations becomes maximized for the maximum velocity fluctuation. Near the unstable region of the trap parameters, the velocity diverges, and this is transferred to the position fluctuation through the covariance. The covariance acts as a <b>diffusion</b> <b>transfer</b> engine. Even though the phase average of covariance is zero, as also indicated in the previous studies [19, 20], the covariance itself is not zero at every instant of time, causing strong correlation between position and velocity fluctuations in the aqueous Paul trap.|$|E

30|$|In the Figure 6, {{the zero}} {{correlation}} (covariance) points (A, B, and C) {{correspond to the}} minimum σvv positions regardless of σxx. However, the maximum correlation always occurs when σvv has local maximum while σxx is near the mean (A' and B'). In other words, when the velocity fluctuations reach its local maximum, the covariance also becomes maximized, and the velocity fluctuation information is easily transferred to the position fluctuation. The fluctuation embedded in the velocity is very sensitive to the variation of the field (for a given b). Then, the information propagates to the position fluctuation through the covariance. The covariance acts as a <b>diffusion</b> <b>transfer</b> engine (its physical dimension is diffusion).|$|E
