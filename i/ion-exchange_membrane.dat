A concentrated salt solution (e. g., seawater) and a diluted salt solution (e. g., river water) are brought into contact through an alternating series of polymeric anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) and cation-exchange membranes (CEMs), which are either selective for anions or cations. Currently available <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> are not optimized for RED, whereas successful RED operation notably depends on the used <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>membranes.</b> We designed such <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> {{and for the first}} time we show the performance of tailor-made membranes in RED. More specifically, we focus on the development of AEMs because these are much more complex to prepare.

Elemental analysis, done with PIXE and EDS, showed that the membranes contained chloride, fluoride, oxygen, carbon, and possibly hydrogen.

Although primarily used for aqueous effluents desalination, electro-dialysis was recently shown to be a promising technology for industrial wastewater and co-solvent mixtures purification. The harsh working conditions imposed by these liquid effluents, including high suspended solids, require the development of more chemically and mechanically resistant membranes. In this study, commercial porous stainless steel media filters (240 μm thick) were used as a backbone to prepare hybrid <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> by casting <b>ion-exchange</b> materials within the porous metal structure. The surface of the metal reinforcements was modified by plasma treatment prior to sol-gel silane grafting to improve the interface between the metal and the ion-exchange resins. The morphology of novel hybrid materials and the interface between the metal fibers and the ion-exchange material have been characterized using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy and FTIR mapping. The thickness of the silane coating was found to lie between 1 and 2 μm while water contact angle tests performed on membrane surfaces and corrosion test behaviors revealed the formation of a thin passivating oxide layer on the material surfaces providing anchoring for the silane grafting and adequate surface energy for the proper incorporation of the ion-exchange material. The hybrid membranes desalination performance were then tested in a bench top electro-dialysis cell over a range of flow rate, current densities and salt concentration conditions to evaluate the ability of the novel hybrid materials to desalinate model streams.
