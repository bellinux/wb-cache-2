5|$|In October 2013, astronomers led by Dr. Michael Liu of the University of Hawaii {{discovered}} PSO J318.5-22, {{a solitary}} <b>free-floating</b> L dwarf estimated to possess only 6.5 times {{the mass of}} Jupiter, making it the least massive sub-brown dwarf yet discovered.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or <b>free-floating</b> planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a <b>free-floating</b> planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated <b>free-floating</b> planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E

50|$|The EURO STOXX 50 Index {{is derived}} from the 19 EURO STOXX {{regional}} Supersector indices and represents the largest super-sector leaders in the Eurozone in terms of <b>free-float</b> market capitalization.The index captures about 60% of the <b>free-float</b> market capitalization of the EURO STOXX Total Market Index (TMI), which in turn covers about 95% of the <b>free-float</b> market capitalizaion of the represented countries.|$|R
50|$|The Free float Adjustment factor {{represents}} {{the percentage of}} all issued shares that are readily available for trading. The factor is then rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%. To find the <b>free-float</b> capitalisation of a company, first find its market cap (number of shares x share price) then multiply by its <b>free-float</b> factor. <b>Free-float</b> capitalisation, therefore, does not include restricted stocks, such as those held by company insiders.|$|R
5|$|Stars form via the {{gravitational}} collapse of gas clouds, but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be <b>free-floating</b> such as Cha 110913-773444 and OTS 44, or orbiting a larger object such as 2MASS J04414489+2301513.|$|E
5|$|<b>Free-floating</b> {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E
5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a mass that falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and <b>free-floating</b> planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E

5|$|Chandralekha was in {{production}} {{for five years}} (1943–1948), with changes to its story, cast and filming which generated substantial time and cost overruns. The film ultimately cost 3million (about $600,000 in 1948), and was the most-expensive Indian film at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property, received financial assistance from The Hindu editor K. Srinivasan and sold his jewellery to complete the film. Adjusted for inflation, Chandralekha would have cost $28million in 2010. According to historian S. Muthiah, with the <b>free-floating</b> exchange rate in effect {{at the time it}} was the first film with a budget of over a million dollars made outside the United States.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become <b>free-floating,</b> and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E
5|$|The largest nearby star is Sirius, {{a bright}} main-sequence star roughly 8.6 light-years away and roughly twice the Sun's mass {{and that is}} orbited by a white dwarf, Sirius B. The nearest brown dwarfs are the binary Luhman 16 system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system Luyten 726-8 (8.7ly) and the solitary red dwarf Ross 154 (9.7ly). The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity. The closest known <b>free-floating</b> planetary-mass object to the Sun is WISE 0855−0714, an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses roughly 7 light-years away.|$|E

Usually, changes in the market capitalization and weights are implemented during quarterly review of the Index, according to the Dow Jones Indexes procedures.|$|R
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become <b>free-floating</b> planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|The second {{amendment}} to the articles of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the <b>free-floating</b> acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy. The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution's capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation. This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point {{in the evolution of}} the Fund's mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries' overall economic policies.|$|E
5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if <b>free-floating</b> blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E

25|$|If {{too much}} damage {{is present in}} mitochondria, a cell {{undergoes}} apoptosis or programmed cell death. Bcl-2 proteins are layered {{on the surface of}} the mitochondria, detect damage, and activate a class of proteins called Bax, which punch holes in the mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome C to leak out. This cytochrome C binds to Apaf-1, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1, which is <b>free-floating</b> in the cell's cytoplasm. Using energy from the ATPs in the mitochondrion, the Apaf-1 and cytochrome C bind together to form apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to and activate caspase-9, another <b>free-floating</b> protein. The caspase-9 then cleaves the proteins of the mitochondrial membrane, causing it to break down and start a chain reaction of protein denaturation and eventually phagocytosis of the cell.|$|E
