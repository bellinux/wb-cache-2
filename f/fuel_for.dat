40|$|AbstractThe three stage Indian {{nuclear power}} {{programme}} envisages efficient use of its modest uranium resources and full exploitation of its vast Thorium resources. Indian economy is on a fast growth track. The growth in population and economy is creating huge demand for energy which has to be met with environmentally benign technologies. Nuclear Energy is best suited to meet this demand without causing undue environmental impact. In view of limited resources of Uranium and vast resources of Thorium, a closed fuel cycle to fully exploit {{the potential of the}} two resources is co nsidered essential. In conformity with such a strategy, Recycle fuel fabrication technologies have been under development in India for over three decades. Some of the activities such as (i) Fabrication and development of MOX <b>fuels</b> <b>for</b> LWRs/PHWRS (ii) Fabrication of mixed carbide and mixed oxide <b>fuels</b> <b>for</b> Fast Reactors (iii) Research and development in Metallic <b>Fuels</b> <b>for</b> Fast Reactors and (iv) Development of <b>fuels</b> <b>for</b> Thorium utilization - are briefly discussed in the paper...|$|R

These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the <b>fuel</b> <b>for</b> a built-in lamp.

5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a <b>fuel</b> <b>for</b> space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
