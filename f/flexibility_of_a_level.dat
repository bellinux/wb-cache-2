40|$|The {{main issue}} in the {{development}} of tools for the design of Attitude and Orbit Control Systems (AOCS) should be to try and work out a unified environment to be used throughout the life cycle of the AOCS software, namely, the mission analysis stage, the preliminary and detailed design and simulation phases, the generation and testing of the on-board code, the development of the AOCS Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) and the post-launch data analysis activities. Such tools ought to be developed bearing in mind the principles <b>of</b> reusability, <b>flexibility</b> and modularity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that a systematic approach, based on modern object-oriented physical modelling languages such as Modelica, (see [1]-[3]) might lead to the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft simulation library the use of which would be made much more efficient by the very nature of the selected modelling approach. Note that the use of Modelica for aerospace applications has recently led to the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> library for flight dynamics (see [4]), while, surprisingly enough, no activity in the spacecraft domain has been reported yet. Modelica is a language for hierarchical, object-oriented modelling of physical systems, currently developed by the Modelica Association, which combines the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high <b>level</b> description language with an efficient development and code generation tool. The main features of Modelica can be summarized as follows ([2]) : • The language is based on equations rather than on assignments. This makes the description of physical system...|$|R

One {{of the most}} significant limitations to widespread industrial implementation of emerging bioplastics such as poly(lactic acid) and poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) is that they do not match the flexibility and impact resistance of petroleum-based plastics like poly(propylene) or high-density poly(ethylene). The basic goal of this research is to identify alternative, affordable, sustainable, biodegradable materials that can replace petroleum-based polymers in <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> industrial applications, with an emphasis on providing a solution for increasing the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> PHA to <b>a</b> <b>level</b> that makes it a superior material for bioplastic nursery-crop containers. <b>A</b> series <b>of</b> bio-based PHA/poly(amide) (PA) blends with different concentrations were mechanically melt processed using a twin-screw extruder and evaluated for physical characteristics. The effects of blending on viscoelastic properties were investigated using small-amplitude oscillatory shear flow experiments to model the physical character as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> blend composition and angular frequency. The mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the blends were investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and tensile tests. The complex viscosity of the blends increased significantly with increasing concentration of PHA and reached a maximum value for 80 wt % PHA blend. In addition, the tensile strength of the blends increased markedly as the content of PHA increased. For blends containing PA at > 50 wt %, samples failed only after a very large elongation (up to 465 %) without significant decrease in tensile strength. The particle size significantly increased and the blends became more brittle with increasing concentration of PHA. In addition, the concentration of the PA had a substantial effect on the glass relaxation temperature of the resulting blends. Our results demonstrate that the thermomechanical and rheological properties of PHA/PA blends can be tailored for specific applications, and that blends of PHA/PA can fulfill the mechanical properties required for flexible, impact-resistant bio-based nursery-crop containers.

40|$|While {{insufficient}} <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{information system}} {{to support a}} business process precludes {{the use of the}} system in certain cases, excessive <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information system can limit the usability of the system (Silver 1991), in addition to presenting an unnecessary investment. Despite <b>a</b> wealth <b>of</b> research on <b>flexibility</b> and its impacts on organizations and business processes (esp. manufacturing), the value <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information system and the price at which it comes have rarely been included into the analysis, with the result that guidelines to determine <b>an</b> appropriate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information system to support a given business process have not been developed. To support decisions regarding information system flexibility, the current paper presents an optimization model to relate business process characteristics (uncertainty, variability, and time−criticality) with two basic types <b>of</b> information system <b>flexibility</b> (built−in flexibility to use the information system and flexibility to change the information system). Based on <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> the model, we conclude that the focus of information system management should be on flexibility to change the information system in order to support processes of high uncertainty, while situations of low uncertainty tend to call for a focus on built−in flexibility to use the information system. The model also shows that very high process variability can limit the value <b>of</b> investments in <b>an</b> information system altogether, thus, improving the importance <b>of</b> careful <b>flexibility</b> and investment management, while <b>a</b> high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> time−criticality generally tends to increase the benefits <b>of</b> using <b>an</b> information system over manual processing...|$|R
