40|$|The writer {{considers}} some dozen {{papers of}} the late Professor Ivo <b>Frangeš</b> (1920 - 2003) in which he deals with the oeuvre of Marulić.

The stylis-tic freshness of his works and his lucid observations of the centrality of Marulić in the Croatian literary tradition, the connotations discovered linking him with Dante, Krleža, A. B. Šimić, Džonko Kalićević and St Bernard had a stimulating effect on a new perception of Marko Marulić.
