Populations of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> and parasitoid wasp were reared on walnut seedling in a growth chamber. The mean developmental period, daily fertility rate, and progeny sex ratio were combined to construct demographic life tables. From these tables, intrinsic natural {{rate of increase}} (rm), net reproductive rate (R 0) and mean generation time (Tc) were calculated. The net reproductive rate (female offsprings per female per generation) and intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} values were 34. 69 and 0. 278 in <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> and 53. 85 and 0. 385 in parasitoid, respectively. The mean generation time was 12. 75 days in <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> and 10. 35 days in parasitoid. Values of rw (weekly multiplication of the females) indicates that T. pallidus is able to multiply 14. 81 times per week, whereas the population of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> multiplies by only 7. 001 times in the same period. The population of parasitoids doubled within 1. 8 days while the aphid took 2. 49 days. Mean pre-imaginal period was 9. 14 ± 0. 34 days for male and 9. 16 ± 0. 12 days for female parasitoids on a mixture of different nymphal stages of host. In <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> it was 9. 30 ± 0. 10 days. The pre-imaginal periods of parasitoid decreases as the aphid host ages. Longevity of adult male and female was 6. 17 ± 0. 22 and 6. 87 ± 0. 23 days, respectively, and 12. 24 ± 0. 94 days for <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the study of nuts of <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia) arising as waste from the {{agricultural}} production {{for the removal of}} heavy metals from aqueous solutions. The suitability of the given biosorbent was verified through the determination of its adsorption capacity (equilibrium) and rate (kinetics) of adsorption of the studied metal (lead). The shells of the <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> were first activated by 0. 1 M of HCl and 0. 1 M of NaOH, while the activation by sodium hydroxide was more effective than activation by HCl. In order to identify the most suitable method of activation for the given biosorbent, biosorption of <b>European</b> <b>walnut</b> shells activated by NaOH at concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 1, 1 and 2 mol/L was further studied, and the time of activation was 5, 15, 30 and 45 min.

40|$|Growing {{populations and}} {{changing}} diets have put great pressure on food systems {{throughout the world}} and have lead to increasing agricultural intensification including the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers. Given the associated human and environmental health costs of intensification, {{the development of more}} sustainable practices is imperative. One such avenue is to make better use of natural ecosystem services, {{such as the use of}} conservation biological control to reduce reliance on pesticide. However, there are logistical and educational impediments to the more effective use of resident natural enemies through conservation biological control that need to be addressed. These include how other agricultural management practices impact biological control, and how managers can tell if it is working or when it will work. Along with pesticides, fertilizers are a defining aspect of modern agriculture, but their effect on biological control services has seldom been evaluated. The effects of plant quality on natural enemies are often overlooked developing biological control programs for insect pests in agriculture. An enhanced nutritional status of plants can fuel insect population growth because nitrogen is an important component of proteins that are known to be limiting for phytophagous insects. Additionally, nitrogen fertilizers directly and indirectly affect plant defenses. In this dissertation I used walnuts to address the effect of increased nitrogen availability to the host plant on <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> Chromaphis juglandicola and on parasitism by the specialist parasitoid Trioxys pallidus. From laboratory experiments and field sampling, nitrogen content of foliage did not change aphid population growth rate or aphid size. However, in laboratory experiments added nitrogen decreased the number of mummies produced by female parasitoids over a 24 h period, but increased the proportion and the size of female offspring. Field sampling of walnut orchards showed no relationship between the percent parasitism of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids</b> by T. pallidus and nitrogen content of foliage. Although nitrogen fertilizer and plant quality can affect biological control in other crops, it did not appear to be a problem for biological control of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids.</b> Biological control in action is often hard to visualize and even more difficult to quantify in the context of pest population management. Readily measured metrics are needed to accurately predict the effectiveness of biological control services: this would then allow managers to say, given this set of measurements, control of an insect pest can be expected today or at some point in the near future. Using <b>walnuts</b> and <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids</b> as a model system, I investigated whether activity measurements and diversity indices for the natural enemy assemblages present in walnut orchards would be good indicators of current and future biological control. While percent parasitism, predator:prey ratio, and natural enemy evenness were good indicators of current biological control, there were no good indicators of future biological control. An increase in natural enemy units, a measure of abundance weighted by the feeding or parasitism capacities of individual species, was correlated with a decrease in aphids over the season, but, as there was also a strong effect of within-season density dependence in the <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> populations, the correlation is more likely to be an artifact rather than a causal relationship. The composition of a local natural enemy assemblage depends on both the local environment, which acts as a filter, and the surrounding landscape, which serves as a regional pool of natural enemy species. When the surrounding landscape is the dominant factor, measures of landscape complexity can be used to predict the composition of the local natural enemy community. For more urbanized environments, however, local factors can be as important as landscape factors. Urban gardens are an ideal study system to address such questions as they are often spread along an urbanization gradient and yet differ considerably in local composition. For home and school gardens in the South Peninsula of the San Francisco Bay, urbanization had a non-linear effect on natural enemy richness with greater richness in both the most urban and most rural gardens. Moreover, urbanization was also positively related to natural enemy abundance on tomato plants, a key urban garden crop. In addition, the use of natural enemy exclosures showed that natural enemy richness was significantly related to the degree of suppression of aphids on fava bean plants, suggesting that increasing natural enemy richness could improve biological control. However, I found no clear elements of the local composition of gardens that could be modified to increase natural enemy richness. The best indicators and economic incentives do not ensure that farmers and gardeners will use biological control instead of pesticides if they are not comfortable with the idea. In this context, Cooperative Extension (CE) provides an effective means to accomplish the successful transfer of new research information on biological control to the farmers and gardeners who could put it into practice. While outreach from CE to large agricultural industries has been well established, urban gardeners represent a relatively new audience for the transfer of research knowledge. As many gardeners in urban and school gardens include children, education about insects and natural enemies could start with very young audiences. A combined scientific and outreach event put on by San Mateo Cooperative Extension demonstrated the significance of early education on this topic. Using pre and post-participation surveys I was able to show that children felt more positively about insects and were even more likely to eat insects after the event. Making research knowledge available and accessible to all ages involved in food production may help to increase the level of adoption of biological control in the future. Biological control is a valuable ecosystem service that could help reduce the negative impacts of the intensification of agriculture. However, more effective ways to visualize, quantify and predict the action of natural enemies are needed to make conservation biological control an essential part of the pest management tool kit for farmers and gardeners...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I expand {{upon our}} knowledge {{in regards to}} the utility of population genetic approaches to be used {{for the study of the}} evolution of introduced biological control agents and their target pests. If biological control methods are to provide sustainable pest management services then more long-term studies will be necessary, and these studies should also include the use of population genetic approaches. For existing biological control programs, post-release population genetic studies could be initiated using museum voucher specimens for baseline data. In Chapter 2, I explored what factors influence our ability to extract usable genomic material from dried museum specimens, and whether we could use non-destructive techniques for parasitic hymenoptera. I found that the age of the specimen was the most important determinant for the amplification of PCR products, with nuclear loci having a higher probability of amplification from older specimens than mitochondrial loci. With these sequence results I was able to differentiate voucher specimens of different strains of the biological control agent Trioxys pallidus and I was able to confirm the identification of an unknown parasitoid reared from the invasive light brown apple moth. For population genetic surveys to be conducted more frequently in biological control programs, some of the barriers to developing molecular markers that are variable enough for these types of surveys need to be overcome. One barrier is the time required to develop polymorphic microsatellite markers. Therefore, in Chapter 3, I developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline that searches through next-generation sequence (NGS) data and uses the raw sequencing reads to identify polymorphic loci. Using this approach I was able to rapidly develop microsatellite markers for two of my study species (T. pallidus and Chromaphis juglandicola). For both species more than 60 % of the target markers amplified and were found to be polymorphic, compared to previous approaches where the success rates were much lower (published studies often show rates between 1 and 20 %). I then examined evolutionary factors that may affect the sustainability of two classical biological control programs; 1) the biological control of <b>walnut</b> <b>aphids,</b> and 2) the biological control of invasive knotweeds. The <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> biological control program is a textbook successful biological control program, but has shown recent evidence of localized breakdowns, whereas the biological control program for invasive knotweeds is currently under review in the United States and Canada. In Chapter 4, I explored whether hybridization between introduced “strains” of T. pallidus is responsible for recent breakdowns in this control program. In that study I found low levels of hybridization – thus it is unlikely hybridization is playing an important role in these breakdowns – as well as evidence that two of the strains may actually be cryptic species; one being a specialist and another being a generalist. In Chapter 5, I explored whether the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution might help explain these localized breakdowns. In that chapter I found evidence for a geographic mosaic in the <b>walnut</b> <b>aphid</b> biological control program, and commented on how components of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution can help us predict what systems we might expect localized breakdowns to occur in. In Chapter 6, I explored whether endosymbionts might play a role in shaping the host-associations of two strains of the candidate biological control agent for invasive knotweeds. I found that while strains of the psyllid Aphalara itadori showed no barriers to hybridization of their nuclear genomes, there were curious patterns of horizontal transmission of their primary endosymbiont. I also found that one haplotype of the secondary endosymbiont Sodalis sp. dramatically changed in frequency during the hybrid crosses reared on giant knotweed. When compared with previous studies of this species, the results I observe suggest that endosymbionts may play an important role in the differing fitness levels of these two strains. In conclusion, population genetic approaches provide valuable tools for the study of post-release dynamics in biological control settings. While biological control programs promise to be useful study systems for evolutionary interactions, post-release studies will allow for that promise to come to fruition. In my future research endeavors I would like to continue to monitor the effects of hybridization and the frequency of geographic mosaics of coevolution in biological control settings. In addition, I would like to conduct post-release population genetic studies of both previous successful introductions and programs that resulted in failures. I believe these post-release studies will allow us to better determine what evolutionary factors affect the sustainability of biological control services and will allow for better management practices...|$|R

40|$|The <b>European</b> or common <b>walnut</b> {{is a large}} tree prized as a {{multipurpose}} species: {{it provides}} valuable timber and produces a high-quality edible nut. The diffusion of the species in Italy has been largely influenced by the human activity, mainly through germplasm movement, selection of genotypes most suited for wood or fruit production and adaptation induced on fruit crop reproductive materials. As a consequence, genetic variability has been reduced, so that programs aimed at its preservation appear of the utmost importance. 104 walnut plants growing in Piedmont, northwestern Italy, were investigated through genetic variation scored at RAPD loci, yielded by PCR amplification of 10 decamer primers. Among the 101 studied loci, only 53 were polymorphic, showing {{a low level of}} genetic variation within the studied material. Genetic differentiation was estimated both at individual and geographical area level. Only in few cases trees growing in the same area showed to be genetically similar, while the differentiation between areas accounted for about 10 % of the total variation, according to AMOVA. No significant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distances. The results of the study showed that also in Piedmont (such as it was already demonstrated in other parts of Italy) the distribution of common walnut is a direct consequence of the human activity. The selection of individual trees, to be used as basic materials for seed supply, should therefore be based mainly on phenotypic traits, rather than ecological features of the location: in species characterized by artificial diffusion, the adoption of Region of Provenance has a scarce significance and prominence should be given to the phenotype selection...|$|R
