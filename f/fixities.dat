5000|$|File <b>Fixity</b> is {{a digital}} {{preservation}} term {{referring to the}} property of a digital file being fixed, or unchanged. [...] <b>Fixity</b> checking {{is the process of}} verifying that a digital object has not been altered or corrupted. During transfer, a repository may run a <b>fixity</b> check to ensure a transmitted file has not been altered en route. Within the repository, <b>fixity</b> checking is used to ensure that digital files have not been affected by data rot or other digital preservation dangers. By itself, <b>fixity</b> checking does not ensure the preservation of a digital file. Instead, it allows a repository to identify which corrupted files to replace with a clean copy from the producer or from a backup.|$|R
50|$|In practice, a <b>fixity</b> {{check is}} most often {{accomplished}} by computing checksum or cryptographic hash function values for a file and comparing them to a stored value or through digital signatures. File <b>fixity</b> figures prominently in Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), the Government Printing Office's work on the Authenticity of Electronic Federal Government Publications, and <b>fixity</b> checking practices are used by a range of cultural heritage organizations.|$|R
50|$|While {{checksums}} are {{the primary}} mechanism for monitoring <b>fixity</b> at the individual file level, an important additional consideration for monitoring <b>fixity</b> is file attendance. Whereas checksums identify if a file has changed, file attendance identifies if a file in a designated collection is newly created, deleted, or moved. Tracking and reporting on file attendance is a fundamental component of digital collection management and <b>fixity.</b>|$|R

Sometimes such visions came to him; his mind, accustomed to great generalisations and yet acutely sensitive to detail, saw things far more comprehensively than the minds of most of his contemporaries. Usually the teeming sphere moved on to its predestined ends and circled with a stately swiftness on its path about the sun. Usually {{it was all a}} living progress that altered under his regard. But now fatigue a little deadened him to that incessancy of life, it seemed now just an eternal circling. He lapsed to the commoner persuasion of the great <b>fixities</b> and recurrencies of the human routine. The remoter past of wandering savagery, the inevitable changes of to-morrow were veiled, and he saw only day and night, seed-time and harvest, loving and begetting, births and deaths, walks in the summer sunlight and tales by the winter fireside, the ancient sequence of hope and acts and age perennially renewed, eddying on for ever and ever, save that now the impious hand of research was raised to overthrow this drowsy, gently humming, habitual, sunlit spinning-top of man's existence....|$|E

40|$|The {{ballistic}} {{performance of}} thin aluminium targets and influence thereon of different circumferential <b>fixity</b> conditions were studied both experimentally and by finite element simulations. A pressure gun {{was employed to}} carry out the experiments while the numerical simulations were performed on ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code using Johnson-Cook elasto-viscoplastic material model. 1 mm thick 1100 -H 12 aluminium plates of free span diameter 255 mm were normally impacted by 19 mm diameter ogive and blunt nosed projectiles. The boundary conditions of the plate were varied by varying the region of <b>fixity</b> along its circumference as 100 %, 75 %, 50 % and 25 % in experiments and the numerical simulations. Further, simulations were carried out to compare the response of the plates with 50 % and 75 % continuous <b>fixity</b> with those with two and three symmetrical intermittent regions of 25 % <b>fixity</b> respectively. The variation in the boundary condition has been found to have insignificant influence on the failure mode of the target however; it significantly affected the mechanics of target deformation and its energy absorption capacity. The ballistic limit increased with decrease in the region of <b>fixity.</b> It decreased for intermittent <b>fixity</b> in comparison with equivalent continuous <b>fixity.</b> And, it {{has been found to be}} higher for the impact with projectile having blunt nose in comparison with the one having ogive nose.

5000|$|<b>Fixity</b> is {{uncontrolled}} by a {{given situation}} and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs. <b>Fixity</b> almost always directly effects stabilization, and has little to no bearing on homogenization. The choice of discourse will provide a certain value of <b>fixity,</b> depending on the specific choice.

5000|$|The key {{to how we}} in fact [...] "go on" [...] is to {{be found}} in Margolis's major {{postulate}} of Historied Thought, Constructed World: [...] "Thinking is a History". Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical. Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being. It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories. Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and <b>fixities</b> to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions.|$|E
5000|$|Margolis {{defends the}} Protagorean dictum that [...] "man {{is the measure}} of all things", arguing that all changeless first {{principles}} must give way to consensual, though not criterial, truth claims. Since [...] "man", the measure, is himself a creature of history, no modal claims of invariance can possibly be sustained. Margolis further avers that there need be no <b>fixities</b> either de re or de dicto or de cogitatione. The world is a flux and our thought about it is also in flux. Margolis sees {{the whole history of}} Western philosophy as a struggle between the advocates of change and those who either, like Parmenides, deny that change is intelligible, or those, like Heraclitus, who find some logos or law which allegedly governs whatever changes are admitted. He has argued that cognitive privilege of the changeless lingers even in relatively pragmatic philosophy such as the work of W.V. Quine. Nonetheless, Margolis proposes possible modes of legitimation even under the ubiquity of flux. Contrary to postmodern philosophers like Richard Rorty or Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard, he argues that our lack of cognitive privilege means that the need for philosophical justification becomes more, not less, pressing.|$|E

40|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 21 st century social {{scientists}} increasingly colonized one of geographers â€™ defining territories and became more interested in issues of space and spatiality in the constitution of economies and societies. This was a welcome move, opening the way to more powerful and sophisticated conceptualizations. It also provoked a growing debate as to how best to conceptualize economies, societies and their geographies. An integral part of this debate about spatialities revolved around issues of spaces, flows and circuits and their respective capacities to provide enlightenment about contemporary economies and societies. There was (and continues to be) discussion as to whether the <b>fixities</b> of spaces or the fluidities of circuits and flows provides the most powerful analytic lenses through which to comprehend late modern economies and societies and as to how best to think about relations between circuits, flows and spaces. For some, spaces â€“ albeit more complicated and multi-scalar spaces â€“ remain the key component (for example, see Hirst and Thompson, 1995). For others the world is now unambiguously one dominated by flows. <b>Fixities</b> no longer matter, or matter less, in a world of flows and (hyper) mobilities (for example, Castells, 1996; Urry, 2000) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{work within}} mobilities studies has {{pointed to the}} ways in which {{mobility}} shapes people's identities and everyday lives. Mobility is also inherently geographical in nature, not only in the sense that movements of people and objects transcend space but that the ubiquity of mobility within society raises important questions about the <b>fixities</b> of place. Much of the recent geographical scholarship on mobilities has focused on the city, with â€˜the urbanâ€™ constructed as the archetypal space of hyper-mobility. Less attention has been given to mobilities in the context of rural spaces and places. In this paper, we suggest that mobility represents an equally important constituent of rural lifestyles and rural places. Our contention is that the stabilities of rurality, associated with senses of belonging, tradition and stasis, are both reliant on and undermined by rather complex forms of mobility. We draw on empirical materials from a recent community study in rural Wales to reveal the nature of these mobilities, including the diverse range of movements of people to, from and through rural places, the difficulties associated with practising everyday mobilities in rural settings, the increasing significance of virtual forms of mobility associated with the roll-out of digital technologies across rural spaces, and the complicated relationship between rural mobilities, immobilities and <b>fixities...</b>|$|E
