5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, we never entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our {{imagination}} participates with theirs in the tragedy.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the effects of}} repeated stimulus presentations on the event-related potential (ERP) of <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> rats. Both species were presented {{with a total of}} 100 auditory stimuli, divided into four blocks of 25 stimuli. By means of wavelet denoising, single-trial ERPs were established in both <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> rats. The auditory ERPs were characterized by the presence of two positive and two negative waves in both <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> rats, albeit with different latencies in the two species (P 1, N 1, P 2, and N 2). The results showed decreased amplitudes within blocks for the N 1, P 2, and N 2 components in <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> for the N 1 and P 2 components in rats. Decreased amplitudes across blocks were found for the N 2 component in <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> for the P 2 and N 2 components in rats. In both <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> rats, response decrements within a block were thus most prominent for the early ERP components, whereas the changes across blocks were most prominent for the later components. These results suggest a correspondence of the ERP correlates of elemental stimulus processing between <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> rats. It is further suggested that the observed amplitude reductions may reflect habituation and/or recovery cycle processes. 1066...|$|R
