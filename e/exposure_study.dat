In 2000 we conducted six 1 -day <b>exposure</b> <b>studies</b> where spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats were exposed to filtered air or CAPs (≤ 2. 5 μm, 1, 138 – 1, 765 μg/m 3) for 4 hr (analyzed 1 – 3 hr afterward). In seven 2 -day <b>exposure</b> <b>studies</b> in 2001, SH and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to filtered air or CAP (≤ 2. 5 μm, 144 – 2, 758 μg/m 3) for 4 hr/day × 2 days (analyzed 1 day afterward). Despite consistent and high CAP concentrations in the 1 -day <b>exposure</b> <b>studies,</b> no biologic effects were noted. The exposure concentrations varied among the seven 2 -day <b>exposure</b> <b>studies.</b> Except in the first study when CAP concentration was highest, lavageable total cells and macrophages decreased and neutrophils increased in WKY rats. SH rats demonstrated a consistent increase of lavage fluid γ -glutamyltransferase activity and plasma fibrinogen. Inspiratory and expiratory times increased in SH but not in WKY rats. Significant correlations were found between CAP mass (microgram per cubic meter) and sulfate, organic carbon, or zinc. No biologic effects correlated with CAP mass. Despite low chamber mass {{in the last six}} of seven 2 -day <b>exposure</b> <b>studies,</b> the levels of zinc, copper, and aluminum were enriched severalfold, and organic carbon was increased to some extent when expressed per milligram of CAP.

5000|$|Because HBCD has 16 {{possible}} stereo-isomers {{with different}} biological activities, the substance poses a difficult problem for manufacture and regulation.The HBCD commercial mixture {{is composed of}} three main diastereomers denoted as alpha (α-HBCD), beta (β-HBCD) and gamma (γ-HBCD) with traces of others. A series of four published in vivo mice studies were conducted between several federal and academic institutions to characterize the toxicokinetic profiles of individual HBCD stereoisomers. The predominant diastereomer in the HBCD mixture, γ-HBCD, undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism, fecal and urinary elimination, and biological conversion to other diastereomers with a short biological half-life of 1-4 days. After oral exposure to the γ-HBCD diastereomer, β-HBCD was detected in the liver and brain, and α-HBCD and β-HBCD was detected in the fat and feces [...] with multiple novel metabolites identified - monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecane, monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, and dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecadiene. In contrast, α-HBCD is more biologically persistent, resistant to metabolism, bioaccumulates in lipid-rich tissues after a 10-day repeated <b>exposure</b> <b>study,</b> and has a longer biological half-life of up to 21 days; only α-HBCD was detected in the liver, brain, fat and feces with no stereoisomerization to γ-HBCD or β-HBCD and low trace levels of four different hydroxylated metabolites were identified. Developing mice had higher HBCD tissue levels than adult mice after exposure to either α-HBCD or γ-HBCD indicating the potential for increased susceptibility of the developing young to HBCD effects. The reported toxicokinetic differences of individual HBCD diastereoisomers {{have important implications for}} the extrapolation of toxicological studies of the commercial HBCD mixture to the assessment of human risk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Epidemiologic {{studies have}} {{established}} {{an association between}} exposures to air pollution particles and human mortality and morbidity at concentrations of particles currently found in major metropolitan areas. The adverse effects of pollution particles are most prominent in susceptible subjects, including the elderly and patients with cardiopulmonary diseases. Controlled human <b>exposure</b> <b>studies</b> {{have been used to}} confirm the causal relationship between pollution particle exposure and adverse health effects. Earlier studies enrolled mostly young healthy subjects and have largely confirmed the capability of particles to cause adverse health effects shown in epidemiological studies. In the last few years, more studies involving susceptible populations have been published. These recent studies in susceptible populations, however, have shown that the adverse responses to particles appear diminished in these susceptible subjects compared to those in healthy subjects. The present paper reviewed and compared control human <b>exposure</b> <b>studies</b> to particles and sought to explain the "unexpected" response to particle exposure in these susceptible populations and make recommendations for future studies. We found that the causes for the discrepant results are likely multifactorial. Factors such as medications, the disease itself, genetic susceptibility, subject selection bias that is intrinsic to many controlled <b>exposure</b> <b>studies</b> and nonspecificity of study endpoints may explain part of the results. Future controlled <b>exposure</b> <b>studies</b> should select endpoints that are more closely related to the pathogenesis of the disease and reflect the severity of particle-induced health effects in the specific populations under investigation. Future studies should also attempt to control for medications and genetic susceptibility. Using a different study design, such as exposing subjects to filtered air and ambient levels of particles, and assessing the improvement in biological endpoints during filtered air exposure, may allow the inclusion of higher risk patients who are likely the main contributors to the increased particle-induced health effects in epidemiological studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and the indication of {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) {{in the treatment}} of exposure of orbital implants. Design: Retrospective and observational case series. Methods: We reviewed 41 patients (41 eyes) suffering exposure of orbital implants from Jan. 2000 to June 2006. The study group patients with mild exposure received combined treatment with bFGF and antibiotic drops, and while the control group patients with mild exposure were treated with antibiotic drops only. The study group patients with moderate and severe exposure received combined treatment with bFGF and antibiotic drops, and after 2 months they were subjected to amniotic membrane transplantation, while the control group patients with moderate and severe exposure underwent amniotic membrane transplantation after using antibiotic drops. Observation of the growth of conjunctival epithelium and comparison of the healing rate of the two groups. Results: The healing rates of the mild, moderate and severe <b>exposure</b> <b>study</b> group were 100 % and 92. 3 %. The healing rates of the mild, moderate and severe exposure control group were 55. 6 % and 66. 7 % respectively. The difference of the healing rates of the mild <b>exposure</b> <b>study</b> group and the control group was significant (P= 0. 033). And the difference of the healing rates of the moderate and severe <b>exposure</b> <b>study</b> group and the control group was not significant (P= 0. 167). Conclusion: bFGF may promote obviously the healing of orbital implant exposure, particularly it can be the first choice for the treatment of mild degree exposure.

Analysis of L-abrine was added to an existing method for quantifying ricinine as a marker for ricin exposure in human urine and analytically validated. Accuracy and reproducibility were enhanced by including a newly synthesized 13 C 12 H 3 -L-abrine internal standard. One-milliliter urine samples were processed using solid-phase extraction prior to a 6 -min high-performance liquid chromatography separation. Protonated molecular ions were formed via electrospray ionization in a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer and quantified via multiple reaction monitoring. Method validation included the characterization of two enriched urine pools, which were used as quality control materials.
