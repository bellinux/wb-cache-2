The XRD {{patterns of}} the composite obtained in 0 (curve a) and 0.02 M HClO 4 (curve b) {{can be indexed to}} α-MnO 2 crystal structures [34]. Meanwhile, different XRD peaks are observed in Figure[*] 5 B (curves c and d), indicating the <b>heat-treated</b> <b>product</b> obtained in 0.1 M HClO 4 is Mn 2 O 3 and the <b>heat-treated</b> <b>product</b> obtained in 0.05 M HClO 4 are MnO 2 and Mn 2 O 3. The results show that for as-prepared samples, Mn 2 O 3 phase is increasing with acid concentration. It is reported that the phase of manganese oxides is changing with temperature, and MnO 2 may transform to suboxide Mn 2 O 3 at 500 °C to 900 °C [33, 35 – 38]. The reductive matters such as CH 3 OH, CH 4, and CO were studied as reductions for the phase transforming of MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3, and the mechanism was also suggested [34, 39]. Therefore, we assume that the reductive matters generated during PANI decomposition procedure assists the transformation of MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3. Additionally, the aggravating degree of phase transforming of the heat-treated samples could be attributed to the increasing proportion of PANI in the composites. All the above results indicate that the MnO 2 generated in the polymerization of PANI process at low-acid concentration has a great effect on the formation of the hollow structure at higher acid concentrations as an intermediate.|$|E

In this study we examined by using molecular techniques and mating tests whether this species can undergo a sexual cycle and form ascospores. The population structure of this species was examined by analyzing the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) and ITS 2 and the 5. 8 S rRNA gene, as well as partial β-tubulin, actin, and calmodulin gene sequences. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. variotii is a highly variable species. Partition homogeneity tests revealed that P. variotii has a recombining population structure. In addition to sequence analyses, mating experiments indicated that P. variotii is able to form ascomata and ascospores in culture in a heterothallic manner.

40|$|Fatty amines (hexadecyl-amine) can be esterified to lactose via Schiff-base {{formation}} {{at temperatures}} of 60 ° C. Extending {{the time of}} the reaction results in a darker colored product due to the Maillard reaction. Due to the amphiphilic properties of the lactose-amines, the emulsion stabilization characteristics were investigated. In this study, synthesis of lactose-amines was done at four different heating and cooling cycles from 4 to 24 hours. Lactose-amines processed for 24 hours and 12 hours of constant heating and cooling cycles are named as 24 H and 12 H, respectively. Lactose-amines 4 H and 8 H were processed for 4 and 8 hours of constant heating at 60 °C. The 24 H and 12 H samples were white in color as they were exposed to heat for short time (due to the cooling cycle) i. e. 2 - 2. 5 and 1. 5 hours, respectively, as compare to 4 H and 8 H (i. e. 4 hours and 8 hours, respectively). It was assumed that white colored compounds are early intermediates of Maillard browning reactions known as Amadori. The light brown color of the 4 hours <b>heat-treated</b> <b>product</b> might contain intermediate products of the Maillard browning reaction. The dark brown colored after 8 hours of constant heating might have advanced Maillard products and polymers. Each lactose-amine sample was used as emulsifiers in oil-in-water (20 : 80 ratio of oil: water) emulsion at four different concentrations (0. 01 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, and 1 %). Negative controls consisted of hexadecyl-amine and lactose at the same concentrations as stated above, as well as an oil-in-water control. The positive control was an emulsion containing 2 % whey protein (WP). Emulsions were formed with a microfluidizer 110 S at a pressure of 6, 900 psi. Emulsion stability was monitored by measuring the oil droplet sizes of each emulsion on day 0 and destabilization kinetics on day 1 and 5. The oil droplet size distribution and destabilization kinetics of the emulsions prepared with lactose-amines (4 H, 8 H, 12 H, and 24 H) at 0. 01 % of concentration were closer towards the negative controls (lactose, fatty-amine, and o/w). At 1 % concentration, emulsions prepared with all types of lactose-amines had smaller droplet size similar to WPC 80. Destabilization kinetic profiles of the emulsions show that 1 % lactose-amines produced more stabilized emulsions as compared to WPC 80 with respect to time. Emulsions of 4 H and 24 H were following the similar trend of droplet size distribution and destabilization rate as of WPC 80. Lactose-amines 8 H and 12 H emulsions were showing more destabilization and bigger oil droplet size as compared to 4 H, 24 H, and WPC 80. Droplet size distribution at day 0 and destabilization kinetics from day 0 to day 5 showed that the types of lactose-amines and their increasing concentrations have great influence on the stability of emulsions.

The interaction between a specific food composition and the heat process applied results in the development of complex oxidation and glycation reactions, which give rise to a mixture of flavoured compounds and possible neoformed contaminants (NFC). Recommendations by the European Commission aim at monitoring the content of major NFC, such as acrylamide and furan, in a list of food products commercialized in Europe. On the other hand, the Commission for European Normalization (CEN) has created recently a new workgroup (WG 13) responsible for normalization of analytical method for NFC assessment. The European collective research ICARE was carried out to identify the possible health consequences of the ingestion of <b>heat-treated</b> <b>products,</b> characterize the reaction kinetics leading to NFC and evaluate some mitigation procedures proposed by the CIAA toolbox, and finally develop a simple, rapid and non destructive control method based on fluorescence acquisition on the crushed food products and chemometric analysis of the spectral information. This paper summarizes the objectives and essential results obtained in the scope of the project, highlighting the need for evaluating the distribution of NFC in food products commercialized in Europe, as well as the impact of the food formula/recipe and process on Maillard derived NFC food levels. The potential of the Fluoralys sensor regarding its ability to control food contamination with NFC is presented. A decrease in NFC concentration of heat processed food should allow significantly limiting the exposure of populations to NFC and consequently the potential related health risk. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|A novel polyborosilazane (PBSZ) {{precursor}} was synthesized by {{the reaction}} of copolysilazane (CPSZ) with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB). The resultant PBSZs were characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. It was found that both, BH and NH bonds of DMAB, react with CPSZ leading to boron containing copolysilazanes. The polyborosilazanes were pyrolyzed at 900 °C in argon and the precursor-to-ceramic transformation was studied by TG-MS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The modification of CPSZ with DMAB enhances the cross-linking of the resulting PBSZ, which increases the final ceramic yield from 57. 8 % to 77. 5 - 80. 0 %. Finally, the ceramics obtained at 900 °C were subsequently annealed at different temperatures ranging from 1200 to 1800 °C.

The highest content of acrylamide (46 μg/kg) was detected in the Slovak sample of prune originated in Nitra region. High acrylamide content, in the range from 23 to 45 μg/kg, was observed in prunes from South America. In the rest of analysed <b>heat-treated</b> plum <b>products</b> such as plum juice, plum compote or baby food with plum puree, acrylamide was not detected due to moderate conditions during thermal processing: temperature below 120 °C and a shorter time of thermal exposure.

40|$|Several {{scientific}} papers {{suggest that}} microbial transglutaminase (mTG) {{is capable of}} reducing the salt content of cured and/or <b>heat-treated</b> meat <b>products</b> (ham, frankfurters, meat ball). These scientific results are not widely known in Hungary, {{and as a result}} of this, only little experience was gathered in our meat industry. According to this lack of knowledge, our aim was to lower the curing salt to a still microbiological safe level using mTG by frankfurters, one of the most well-known heat treated meat products in Hungary. The observed technofunctional properties suggest to use mTG enzyme preparation at 0. 5 % concentration. This enzyme dosage can reduce the average 1. 8 % salt content to 1. 6 % and it also may contribute to extended shelf life of popular frankfurters. Our sensorial analysis revealed that the panellists have not found a loss in quality between 1. 4 % and 1. 6 % salt...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a one-step, real-time, loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification (RealAmp) assay was developed, for {{the highly}} specific detection of pork DNA. For the assay, the mtDNA of cytochrome b (cytb) gene was amplified at 63 C using SYBR Green I for 45 min with a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) System that measured the fluorescent signal at one-minute intervals. As little as 1 pg of template DNA could be detected, without any cross-reactivity with non-target species. Meat mixtures, heat-treated at 100 C for 15 min, prepared by mixing pork meat with beef at different ratios (0. 01 % 10 %) were tested, and the RealAmp assays allowed {{the detection of}} as little as 0. 01 % pork in the meat mixtures. Thus, this work showed that RealAmp {{could be used for}} specific identification and sensitive quantification of meat species, even for <b>heat-treated</b> meat <b>products...</b>|$|R

Upon cancellation of state standards after 1992 {{it was possible}} to register an increase in distribution of products into shopping networks under the same name but with different ingredients. An analysis of the content of basic ingredients and of the sensory quality was carried out on selected samples of <b>heat-treated</b> meat <b>products</b> (20 products, 17 producers) bought in various types of shops. The contents of basic ingredients (water, fat, salt, proteins, collagen) were measured in a laboratory {{with the help of the}} NIRFLEX N 500 instrument, and no results of measurement at the level of conclusiveness (p < 0. 05) were statistically evidenced. The best evaluation was granted by the assessors (6 persons) to the sample of the "Junior" group from producer "Fleischwaren Berger" from the Billa supermarket, while the worst evaluation belonged to the sample of the "Chicken Junior" group from producer "Schneider Masokombinát Plzeň" from the Albert supermarket...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study focused}} on {{counting}} Staphylococcus spp. in curd cheeses “requeijão” and “especialidade láctea type requeijão” sold in Brazil, assessing the presence of mecA gene in obtained isolates and establishing antimicrobial resistance profile of the mecA gene positive isolates. To this, a set of 200 samples of these dairy products were evaluated. Low counts of Staphylococcus spp. were observed in these dairy products. All the isolates were determined as coagulase-negative strains using coagulase test and PCR. However, two isolates (3. 70 %) were carriers of mecA gene {{and they can be}} considered as risk for public health. These isolates presented resistance to penicillin, oxacillin and erythromycin. In conclusion, low counts of Staphylococcus were detected in curd cheese “requeijão” and “especialidade láctea type requeijão” sold in Brazil. However, coagulase-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. was detected in these dairy products. This is the first report of the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. in <b>heat-treated</b> dairy <b>products</b> in Brazil. Results served as a warning to public sanitary authorities to control multidrug-resistant strains in veterinary and human medicine...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} meat {{products}} labeled "ham". Cooked ham {{belongs to the}} <b>heat-treated</b> meat <b>products</b> which make up the largest share of this group in the Czech Republic. Quality of the pork ham for hams must be high. It is important to control the correct technological process - the choice of raw material, its processing, salting, tenderizers, massaging, heat treatment and cooling. The content of the pure muscle proteins and their chemical and mechanical activation are very important. Prague ham is the most famous Czech product from this area whose {{the beginnings of the}} production falling until to the 60 s of the 19 th century. Currently Czech association processors of meat require incorporate of Prague ham between traditional Czech specialties. A lot of laboratory methods are used for the quality control of the final product - physicochemical, sensory and instrumental. Sensory evaluation is the oldest and unconditional way of quality control. Instrumental evaluation becomes part of the sensory evaluation in last years. Physicochemical methods provide the most objective evaluation of the results...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} (HP) processing {{has been}} emerging rapidly as a novel technique for non-thermal preservation of foods. Application of HP processing for shelf life extension {{of orange juice}} was the principal objective of the current research. To accomplish this objective, and to establish a scientific basis for HP processing of orange juice, a systemic approach was used which included the evaluation of: (a) HP inactivation kinetics of pectin methyl esterase (PME, the key enzyme in orange juice implicated with respect to quality changes), (b) destruction of spoilage microorganisms and changes in product quality, (c) HP process verification and finally, (d) storage studies on HP treated orange juice. In preliminary studies, the effect of HP treatment on indigenous microorganisms, texture and color of selected {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} were evaluated. Results showed that HP had a significant effect on the destruction of microorganisms. Product texture and color were mildly affected, often resembling the appearance of mildly <b>heat-treated</b> <b>products.</b> Pressure induced inactivation kinetics of pectin methyl esterase (PME) was investigated at pH 3. 7 and 3. 2 in freshly squeezed single strength (12. 6 °Brix) and concentrated (10 [...] 40 ° Brix) orange juice. Results showed a biphasic nature of pressure induced inactivation of PME in both juices. The first phase consisted of rapid change in inactivation of enzyme, designated as instantaneous pressure kill (IPK), due to pulse pressurization, followed by gradual inactivation of enzyme, characterized by a first order rate of inactivation during pressure hold-time. Combination treatment involving pressure cycle, pressure level and pressure hold-time was then evaluated for inactivation of PME using a response surface methodology. Overall, pressure pulse had a lower effect on inactivation of PME compared to other factors. Pressure destruction kinetics of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Saccharomyces cerevisiae the spoilage organisms in orange juice, were then investigated. Pressure destruction kinetics followed the same dual effect behavior, as observed with PME inactivation. IPK effect increased with pressure cycles and was more pronounced with S. cerevisiae that Leu. mesenteroides. Storage studies of HP treated single strength and concentrated orange juice were conducted at selected temperatures (4, 10 and 20 °C). Results showed that treated juice was microbiologically stable from a few days to several weeks depending on type of juice, storage temperature and processing conditions.
