The vehicular exhaust <b>jet</b> <b>plume</b> condition behind the studied ground vehicle dominates the flow pattern and pollutant dispersion at lower vehicle speed and low idling conditions.

A simplified axisymmetric nozzle geometry, representative of the nozzle on the NASA Dryden NF- 15 B Lift and Nozzle Change Effects on Tail Shock (LaNCETS) research airplane, was considered. The highly underexpanded nozzle flow is found to provide significantly more reduction in the tail shock strength in the sonic boom N-wave pressure signature than perfectly expanded and overexpanded nozzle flows. A tail shock train in the sonic boom signature, similar to what was observed in the LaNCETS flight data, is observed for the highly underexpanded nozzle flow. The CFD results provide {{a detailed description of the}} nozzle flow physics involved in the LaNCETS nozzle at different nozzle expansion conditions and help in interpreting LaNCETS flight data as well as in the eventual CFD analysis of a full LaNCETS aircraft. The current study also provided important information on proper modeling of the LaNCETS aircraft nozzle. The primary objective of the current CFD research effort was to support the LaNCETS flight research data analysis effort by studying the detailed nozzle exhaust <b>jet</b> <b>plume</b> s imperfect expansion effects on the sonic boom signature of a supersonic aircraft. Figure 1 illustrates the primary flow physics present in the interaction between the exhaust <b>jet</b> <b>plume</b> shock and the sonic boom coming off of an axisymmetric body in supersonic flight.
