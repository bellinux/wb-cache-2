25|$|The <b>historic</b> <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> is the {{junction}} of Bonnygate and the Crossgate. This is where the town's mercat cross, is located with the original shaft being supported by a unicorn. It dates from 1683. To the east is St Catherine Street, home to the burgh chambers and county buildings, both designed by Robert Hutchison. The Category B listed burgh chambers built around 1815 and 1818 contain a three story bow street corner and a domic entrance. The adjacent Category B listed county buildings built between 1812 and 1817 are unique in Fife as the only example replicating the style of buildings in the New Town of Edinburgh. The Category B-listed corn exchange tower can be seen across the town skyline.|$|E

30|$|Spectacularising {{forms of}} urban {{planning}} and architecture also trigger processes of gentrification transform space and buildings into useful objects for intense media and ideological activity, simulacra devoid of content and therefore pure images subjected to superficial perception, as arises, for example, with <b>historic</b> <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> but also, generally speaking, with the historic, cultural and landscape patrimony, which become {{the objects of}} more or less decontextualised consumption, or like an object whose true context is the world of planetary circulation (Augé 2003).|$|R

Many of the street names have also remained unchanged for centuries and there are some more unusual names, such as Butcher Row, Longden Coleham, Dogpole, Mardol, Frankwell, Roushill, Grope Lane, Gullet Passage, Murivance, the Dana, Portobello, Bear Steps, Shoplatch and Bellstone.|$|E
500|$|International tourism {{has also}} increased, {{with the arrival}} of transatlantic liners and the revenue they {{introduce}} to the town. 2012 saw 3,000 cruise passengers from six cruise vessels disembark at Milford, and the Port Authority expected 5,000 in 2013. The waterway transports 25% of Britain's requirement for motor fuel, and the port handled 53 million tonnes of shipping in 2008, making it the largest port in Wales, and the sixth largest in the UK. There are two major commercial centres: Charles Street in the <b>historic</b> <b>town</b> <b>centre,</b> and the Havens Head Retail Park located {{at the foot of the}} docks area. [...] In 2012, it was announced that the Milford waterway was declared an Enterprise Zone by the coalition government, due to its importance to the energy sector. [...] In 2014, plans by Milford Haven Port Authority were unveiled, which propose a transformation of the docks area into a residential and commercial destination, including hotel accommodation. In 2017 Milford Haven Port Authority launched Milford Waterway, which included a re-branding of the marina and aims to encourage hotel, commercial and leisure developments to the area. [...] In November 2014 it was announced that Milford Haven Refinery, a major employer in the area, would be converted into a 'storage and distribution facility' with a loss of over 300 jobs.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the Maeslantkering {{was a part of}} the Europoortkering project which, in turn, was the final stage of the Delta Works. The main objective of this Europoortkering-project was improving the safety against flooding of the Rotterdam harbour, of which the Europoort is an important part, and the surrounding towns and agricultural areas. This had to be carried out by the reinforcement of existing dikes as far as 50 kilometres inland. During the 1980s it became clear that this project would take at least 30 years and would cost a huge amount of money. It would also mean that <b>historic</b> <b>town</b> <b>centres,</b> sometimes built more than four centuries ago, had to be broken down and rebuilt behind renewed, larger dikes.|$|R

5000|$|Analytically, if not architecturally, the new County Hall is {{in keeping}} with the town's architecture, its design history is as provincial as its more {{classical}} predecessors. While its design is a bold conception freely using works by such architects as Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and De Stijil and it has similarities to Paul Rudolph's School of Art and Architecture at Yale completed in 1963. However, as early as 1904 Auguste Perret designed a block of flats in the Rue Franklin, Paris which has similar angles, bayed windows and canted recesses to County Hall in Aylesbury, [...] and these flats too were constructed of concrete. With its Brutalist roots in the 1940s, and earlier, Aylesbury's County Hall was, like its classical predecessor, already dated by the time of its 1966 completion: by then architecture was moving on to the cleaner and straighter lines and sheets of plate glass advocated by such architects as Mies van der Rohe. County Hall though does possess identity and boldness of design, and an architectural abrasiveness accentuated by the heavy contrasts of glass and dominating concrete. Though never at the cutting thrust and pioneering end of modern architecture, as its patrons required, the new County Hall is now {{as much a part of}} the landscape, in its way it is as much part of the provincial architecture as any of its older neighbours. It prevents the town appearing as a time capsule, and represents the reality of a busy, functioning industrial town as opposed to a museum piece which some other <b>historic</b> <b>town</b> <b>centres</b> have become.|$|R
50|$|George {{married a}} widow with two sons in January 1856 {{and had two}} sons of his own, born in 1858 and 1860. For many years, the family lived in the <b>historic</b> walled <b>town</b> <b>centre</b> of Boulogne, in Rue du Puits d'Amour (1861-mid-1870s) and Rue de la Balance (until c.1881). In 1871, two works for piano and {{orchestra}} were performed in Boulogne, but his largest works were two scores, both performed in September 1878 {{on the occasion of}} the laying of the foundation stone to the new deep-sea harbour of Boulogne. One was the one-act comic opera Le Lutin de Galway and the other the cantata Le Port en eau profonde for baritone, chorus and orchestra. Although both works were well received by the press they were not taken up again in the following years. Seeking more artistic success may therefore have been one of the reasons why he moved back to Paris around 1881.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWarmia is a {{historical}} region in north-eastern Poland, which – together with the neighbouring region of Mazury – is called the Land of a Thousand Lakes. The conquest of this territory by the Teutonic Order, {{which took place in}} the 13 th century, gave rise to the foundation of 12 towns in Warmia. The towns were planned in line with the medieval urban patterns, featuring chessboard-like layout of a grid of streets, a central marketplace with a town hall in the middle, and compact blocks of townhouses. The problems related to the revitalization of small towns in Warmia are mostly associated with their historic centres, which manifest their identity. The complexity of elements of which such historic urban centres are composed (spatial factors, such as urbanistic and architectural ones, related to the conservation of historic buildings and structures, economic and social aspects) necessitates such transformations that will lead to a better exposure and functional revitalization of the old town in comparison to other parts of a city. The aim of our study has been to find out how the image and functions performed of old towns can be improved. The changes involve certain urbanistic and architectural transformations as well as economic and social revitalization. The key to success is to develop revitalization programmes for individual historic districts in the towns of Warmia. The research has enabled us to draw conclusions in regard to including numerous aspects and connections between spatial factors and functions of old towns. Revitalization efforts should focus on the elimination of sources of threat, improvement of the technical condition and aesthetic values of the space (urbanistic patterns and layouts, architecture of urban complexes) and the betterment of living standards and conditions for local residents. Having achieved this, we will re-focus on the status of <b>historic</b> <b>town</b> <b>centres,</b> on their essential role in the contemporary life of towns, and on the need to preserve the heritage of whole Warmia...|$|R
