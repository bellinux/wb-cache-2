500|$|Soon after {{heading north}} on the [...] journey back to base camp, Crean's party lost the trail back to the Beardmore Glacier, and were faced with a long detour around a large icefall. With food {{supplies}} short, and needing to reach their next supply depot, the group {{made the decision to}} slide on their sledge, uncontrolled, down the icefall. The three men slid , dodging crevasses up to [...] wide, and ending their descent by overturning on an ice ridge. Evans later wrote: [...] "How we ever escaped entirely uninjured <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> to explain".|$|E
2500|$|... {{order to}} meet the {{qualifications}} to vote must have paid a tax. How you can escape the conclusion that makes a requirement with respect to an Indian as a qualification to exercise the elective franchise and does not make that requirement with respect to the member of any race <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after {{reports of}} the slaying spread, {{blockades}} were set up several miles northeast and southwest on Highway 67 East. Sheriff Davis called in officers from the entire area {{to help in the}} investigation; some of which included two agents from the FBI, Captain Gonzaullas and other Rangers, Sheriff Presley and his deputies, Sheriff Jim Sanderson from Little River County, Arkansas State Police, local police, and many others. In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. On the dining room table was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the [...] "virtual river of blood", stated that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> why she did not bleed to death." [...] There were only two bullet holes in the window, leading Sheriff Davis to believe an automatic rifle was used. Investigators declared that after the killer shot Virgil, he waited patiently outside the window to shoot the wife.|$|E
60|$|As Sam {{would have}} said, {{she seemed to}} be speaking; words {{appeared}} to be fluttering from her; but her meaning <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Just fooling with a fiddle, eigh?" [...] said George Harringay. [...] "Well I {{thought it}} <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> So {{much of your}} fine music is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lenore, I'll bet {{he tells}} us somethin' in a minute," [...] said Anderson to her. [...] "These new claptraps <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> I'm no mechanic." ...|$|R
2500|$|Unionists criticised the decision. Martin Smyth said, [...] "We {{are told}} that the two {{communities}} have to live together. We had a classic illustration of a name that brought the two communities together â€“ Londonderry. 'London' indicates the British tradition and 'Derry' the Irish tradition. But the Government decided {{to do away with}} 'London' {{in the name of the}} Council." [...] William Ross said, [...] "Derry has never been used as the name of the city or of the island of Londonderry except as a shortened version of a longer name. The name was Derry Columbkille for centuries. It was Londonderry for centuries. Before that it was Derry Calgach [...] Those who sought the change sought it for no good reason. Their aim was to open a door. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> how the name Derry city council will be separated from the concept of Londonderry city in the public mind. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the Republican elements in Londonderry city will ignore the name as they have always done. They now have a lever to put up Derry city right across the board. [...] People in Northern Ireland see it as an anti-British move by the most extreme Republican movements in Londonderry and the rest of Northern Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{major issue}} {{contemporary}} critics had with Leskov's prose {{was what they}} perceived to be an [...] "overabundance of colours"; the grotesque expressiveness of the language he used. This view was shared by some of his colleagues. Leo Tolstoy who rated Leskov very high still thought he was [...] "too over the top" [...] in his linguistic experiments. In a December 3, 1890, letter, writing {{of the short story}} [...] "The Hour of God's Will", he remarked: [...] "This fairytale is excellent, {{but it would have been}} much better if not for this overabundance of talent." [...] Leskov was unrepentant. [...] "To write in a simple manner as Lev Nikolayevich does, <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> Such a gift is not mine... take me as I am, for I've gotten used to polishing my stuff and simply cannot work in any other way," [...] he wrote to Chertkov in one of his 1888 letters. [...] "My clergymen talk like clergymen do, and my muzhiks talk like muzhiks talk in real life... this folkish, vulgar and intricate language is not of my invention, I've listened for years to Russian people talking... and I can say that in my books they talk like they do in real life, not in literary fashion," [...] he insisted later, speaking to biographer Anatoly Faresov.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, {{the working}} of that man's mind <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me....</b> Marry him {{to save my}} ranch? I wouldn't marry him to save my life!" ...|$|E
60|$|But I was {{ignorant of}} this: and the {{disclosure}} by which I found myself suddenly confronted {{was more than}} I could support. For the moment, speech <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Geoffrey, [...] "I daresay {{that they}} are very nice; but, you see, they <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> A poor man cannot afford so much for a pair of guns." ...|$|R
60|$|I was too sorrowful {{to discuss}} the question, which would {{possibly}} have <b>been</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> under any circumstances; and Mr. Omer took me back into the parlour, breathing with some difficulty on the way.|$|R
60|$|The {{weather is}} a thing that <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> altogether. I never can {{understand}} it. The barometer is useless: it is as misleading as the newspaper forecast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I try to be--I try hard, Bertha; {{but just}} at present it <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> I cannot {{stand by and}} see you going--" [...] and he stopped abruptly.|$|E
6000|$|... "O'Grady," [...] Terence said, [...] "I {{wish you}} would carve this hare for me, I {{have no idea how}} it ought to be cut. I can manage a chicken, or a duck, but this <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'None whatever, sir. She is a {{good and}} good-looking girl. On most {{important}} points we are thoroughly agreed. She won a prize essay on Bacon's authorship of Shakespeare's plays. Of course Shakespeare could not have written them--a thoroughly uneducated man, who never could have passed the fourth standard. But look at the plays! There are things in them that, with all our modern advantages, <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> I admit they <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "To <b>be,</b> and to do, and to suffer,"' declaimed Mr. Warren, apparently {{under the impression that}} this is part of Hamlet's soliloquy--'Shakespeare could never have written that. Where did he learn grammar?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{white man}} always turns out his toes, lad, an Indian walks straight-footed. There are other {{differences}} that a red-skin would see at once, but which <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me,</b> for I {{have never done}} any tracking work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Monsieur,' I said, `you must pardon me. I am elderly, and the ~fumisteries~ of {{the young}} men <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> I go by common sense, or, at the largest, by that {{extension}} of applied common sense called science.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, sir, that <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> altogether; but if {{you will}} tell me where the landing would {{probably}} be effected, I could go on from that spot and indicate the various risings and falls of the ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] {{continued}} Utterson, [...] "and the fractures, too, are rusty." [...] The two {{men looked}} at each other with a scare. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me,</b> Poole," [...] said the lawyer. [...] "Let us go back to the cabinet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Jenny. [...] "He {{certainly}} does {{like to use}} his voice. They tell me that some folks call him Bullbat, though why they should call him either Bat or Hawk <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> I suppose you know his cousin, Whip-poor-will." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{went to the}} House together. It {{happened}} to be an Irish afternoon, {{and as soon as}} I had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out, I gathered there were grievances in the air, but how many of them <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|The problem <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> and I {{gave it up}} {{with the}} {{reflection}} that either this threatened attack was a mere feint to delay us, or that behind it was something mysterious, such as a determination to prevent us at all hazards from discovering the secrets of that mountain stronghold.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} words are very empty, Jack, to express such a {{gratitude}} as mine," [...] I answered. [...] "Twice you have saved me from death, you have paid my debts, {{and have been}} stanch to us both in our troubles. And--" [...] The effort <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me,</b> and I glanced appealingly at Dolly.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{distinction}} is too fine for me, Doctor," [...] Forster said, {{as he turned}} to go off to his post by the parapet. [...] "I understand pluck and I understand cowardice, but this mysterious mixture you speak of <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> Kent says Shakespeare {{will never}} be my line, and I believe him. I should think you'd be {{satisfied}} with 'Masks and Faces,' for you know Mabel gets her husband safely back in the end," [...] answered Christie, watching the effect of her words.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Possibly. I {{intend to}} be neither--nor a good Pagan either. My dear sir, let us drop the subject. It <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> If I can be as good a brute animal as my dog there--it being first {{demonstrated}} that {{it is good to}} be good--I shall be very well content.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I will, Macumazahn," [...] she murmured, whereon I {{collapsed}} into silence, feeling that things <b>were</b> getting <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|The how of {{the matter}} <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> But he who has naught can {{dispense}} the world in largess; and I, who had naught, gave Kim captaincy of the palace guards. The best {{of it is that}} I did fulfil my promise. Kim did come to command the Tiger Hunters, although it brought him to a sad end.|$|R
60|$|Mr Abney, as he {{had every}} excuse for doing, grunted with amazement. I {{achieved}} the ringing laugh of amused innocence. It <b>was</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> to fathom Sam's mind. He could not suppose that any credence would be given to his wild assertion. It {{seemed to me that}} disappointment had caused him momentarily to lose his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go to No. 10, Kingsbury Crescent, Bayswater. Ask for Mrs. Dosett {{and tell}} her what you've come about. When she knows that you are well off she will not turn a deaf ear to you. What the girl may do it <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> to say. She is very peculiar." ...|$|E
60|$|How Charles Davis survives in that wet, freezing, paint-scabbed room of iron in the 'midship-house {{is beyond}} me--just as it <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> that the wretched sailors in the wretched {{forecastle}} do not {{lie down in}} their bunks and die, or, at least, refuse to answer {{the call of the}} watches.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{truth and}} the falsity of this whole strange {{business}} <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me,</b> but this I know: {{if you are not}} the king today I pray God that the other may not find his way to Lustadt before noon tomorrow, for by then a brave man will sit upon the throne of Lutha, your majesty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One would {{suppose that}} England {{was in trouble}} over it already, up to her neck, Sophia Crawford," [...] said Susan. [...] "But your ways of {{thinking}} <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> and always <b>were.</b> It is my opinion that the British Navy will settle Germany in a jiffy {{and that we are}} all getting worked up over nothing." ...|$|R
50|$|I don't {{have great}} range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The {{classics}} <b>are</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>me...</b> I <b>am</b> a mediocre director except when a play or film touches {{a part of}} my life's experience... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} {{silent for a}} moment. So far as I was concerned, speech <b>was</b> {{altogether}} <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> Lady Angela, too, seemed to find something disconcerting in Ray's searching gaze.|$|R
