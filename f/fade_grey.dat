2500|$|On 24 June 1863, Domett's Government {{agreed to}} Cameron's battle plans.

Hopes of the politicians for peace <b>faded.</b> <b>Grey's</b> [...] "dream of racial amalgamation, Māori education and missionary endeavour" [...] faded.

60|$|It was {{the once}} hopeful Godfrey who was standing, {{with his hands}} in his side-pockets and his back to the fire, in the dark wainscoted parlour, one late November {{afternoon}} in that fifteenth year of Silas Marner's life at Raveloe. The <b>fading</b> <b>grey</b> light fell dimly on the walls decorated with guns, whips, and foxes' brushes, on coats and hats flung on the chairs, on tankards sending forth a scent of flat ale, and on a half-choked fire, with pipes propped up in the chimney-corners: signs of a domestic life destitute of any hallowing charm, with which the look of gloomy vexation on Godfrey's blond face was in sad accordance. He seemed to be waiting and listening for some one's approach, and presently the sound of a heavy step, with an accompanying whistle, was heard across the large empty entrance-hall.|$|R

One letter detailed what she wore when leaving the ship: two dressing gowns [...] "for warmth", a muff, and her [...] "motor hat". (A <b>faded</b> <b>grey</b> silk kimono with typical Fortuny style black cord edging, for some time {{thought to have been}} worn by her that night, is now understood to have belonged to her daughter Esme, Countess of Halsbury, as its distinctive print dates the item to post World War I.)

50|$|Much darker in {{character}} {{than the previous}} episodes, this episode is primarily in black and white, with Nabi's trademark green scarf, Doki's blushing cheeks and trademark pink bow, and the numerous intermarriage protest signs portrayed in gray-scale. As the episode progresses, Nabi's scarf gradually fades in color; when he breaks off the relationship with Doki, his scarf has completely <b>faded</b> to <b>grey.</b> In this use of colour imagery, the influence of SamBakZa's new sponsors {{and the increase in}} their technical ability can be seen.
