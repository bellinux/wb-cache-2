40|$|Seventy-six {{electrochemical}} cell (ECC) ozonesondes were flown at South Pole, Antarctica, during 1987 in a continuing program to document year-round changes in Antarctica ozone that are dynamically and photochemically induced. Dobson spectrophotometer total ozone observations were also made. For the twilight months of March and September when <b>Dobson</b> instrument <b>observations</b> cannot {{be made at}} South Pole, total ozone amounts were deduced from the ECC ozonesonde soundings. ECC sonde total ozone data obtained during the polar night (April to August), supplemented the sparse total ozone data obtained from <b>Dobson</b> instrument moon <b>observations.</b> Similar ozone profile and total ozone observations were made at South Pole in 1986...|$|R
40|$|More than 2000 ozone {{soundings}} and a {{large number}} of <b>Dobson</b> <b>observations</b> have been performed since 1967 in a unique procedure. The achieved very homogeneous data sets were used to evaluate significant long-term trends both in the troposphere and the stratosphere. The trend amounts to about plus 2 percent per year in the troposphere and to about minus 0. 5 percent per year in the stratosphere. Extremely low ozone records obtained during winter 1991 / 92 are discussed {{in the light of the}} long term series. The winter mean of the ozone column is the lowest one of the series. The ozone deficit occurred mainly in the lower stratosphere. One cause may be the Pinatubo cloud. Even compared with the extreme winter mean following the El Chichon eruption the ozone content was lower. Additionally ozone was reduced by dynamical effects due to unusual weather situations...|$|R
40|$|A SAOZ (System d'Analyse et d'Observations Zenithales) u. v. -visible {{spectrometer}} {{was installed}} at Faraday, Antarctica, in 1990, {{with a view}} to gaining year-round measurements of column ozone. Observations have been validated by comparison with the Faraday Dobson. Agreement between the two instruments is good, with SAOZ measuring 3 ± 2 % lower than the Dobson over the comparison period. Both instruments show the same small-scale variation in column ozone. However, there is a notable seasonal signal in the ratio of (SAOZ column ozone) /(Dobson column ozone) which calls into question the validity of the SAOZ winter column ozone measurements made when the solar elevation is too low for making <b>Dobson</b> <b>observations.</b> The problem appears to lie with the calculated air-mass factors (AMFs) used in deriving vertical columns from the SAOZ slant columns. New SAOZ data were derived using empirical AMFs. The qualitative behaviour of winter column ozone is the same for both sets of AMFs, showing an increase to mid-winter, followed by a decrease to the spring minimum, although smaller mid-winter columns are calculated when using empirical AMFs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} comparison {{results of}} the total column ozone (TCO) data product over 13 southern tropical and subtropical sites recorded from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) onboard the EU-METSAT (European organization for the exploitation of METeorological SATellite) MetOp (Meteorological Operational satellite program) satellite. TCO monthly averages obtained from IASI between June 2008 and December 2012 are compared with collocated TCO measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the OMI/Aura satellite and the Dobson and SAOZ (Système d'Analyse par Observation Zénithale) ground-based instruments. The results show that IASI displays a positive bias with an average less than 2 % with respect to OMI and <b>Dobson</b> <b>observations,</b> but exhibits a negative bias compared to SAOZ over Bauru with a bias around 2. 63 %. There is a good agreement between IASI and the other instruments, especially from 15 • S southward where a correlation coefficient higher than 0. 87 is found. IASI exhibits a seasonal dependence, with an upward trend in autumn and a downward trend during spring, especially before September 2010. After September 2010, the autumn seasonal bias is considerably reduced due to changes made to the retrieval algorithm of the IASI level 2 (L 2) product. The L 2 product released after August (L 2 O 3 version 5 (v 5)) matches TCO from the other instruments better compared to version 4 (v 4), which was released between June 2008 and August 2010. IASI bias error recorded from September 2010 {{is estimated to be}} at 1. 5 % with respect to OMI and less than ± 1 % with respect to the other ground-based instruments. Thus, the improvement made by O 3 L 2 version 5 (v 5) product compared with version 4 (v 4), allows IASI TCO products to be used with confidence to study the distribution and interannual variability of total ozone in the southern tropics and subtropics.

40|$|The two Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument (GOME- 2) sensors {{operated}} in tandem are flying onboard EUMETSAT’s MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites, launched in October 2006 and September 2012 respectively. Here we present the operational GOME- 2 /MetOp-A (GOME- 2 A) and GOME- 2 /MetOp-B (GOME- 2 B) total ozone products {{provided by the}} EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Ozone and Atmospheric Chemistry Monitoring (O 3 M-SAF). These products are generated using the retrieval algorithm GOME Data Processor (GDP) version 4. 7, {{the latest version of}} the GDP 4. x algorithm, which was also employed for the generation of Level 2 total ozone and other trace gas products from GOME/ERS- 2 and SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT. The enhancements in GDP 4. 7, including the application of Brion-Daumont-Malicet ozone absorption cross-sections, are presented here. On a global scale, GOME- 2 B has the same high accuracy as the corresponding GOME- 2 A products. There is an excellent agreement between the ozone total columns from the two sensors, with GOME- 2 B values slightly lower with a mean difference of only 0. 55 ± 0. 29 %. First global validation results for 6 months of GOME- 2 B total ozone measurements using Brewer and Dobson measurements as references are also presented. On average the GOME- 2 B total ozone data obtained with GDP 4. 7 slightly overestimate <b>Dobson</b> <b>observations</b> by about 2. 0 ± 1. 0 % and Brewer observations by about 1. 0 ± 0. 8 %. It is concluded that the total ozone columns (TOCs) provided by GOME- 2 A and GOME- 2 B are consistent and may be used simultaneously without introducing trends or other systematic effects. GOME- 2 A total ozone data have been used operationally in the Copernicus atmospheric service project MACC-II (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate - Interim Implementation) near-real-time (NRT) system since October 2013. The magnitude of the bias correction needed for assimilating GOME- 2 A ozone is reduced (to about - 6 DU in the global mean) when the GOME- 2 ozone retrieval algorithm changed to GDP 4. 7...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} an approach for post-processing of the Dobson spectrophotometers' total ozone columns (TOCs) in order to compensate for their known stratospheric effective temperature (T eff) dependency and its resulting effect on the usage of the Dobson TOCs for satellite TOCs' validation. The <b>Dobson</b> <b>observations</b> employed are those routinely submitted to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre (WOUDC) of the World Meteorological Organization, whereas the effective temperatures have been extracted from two sources: the European Space Agency, ESA, Ozone Climate Change Initiative, Ozone-CCI, GODFIT version 3 (GOME-type Direct FITting) algorithm applied to the GOME 2 /MetopA, GOME 2 A, observations {{as well as the}} one derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) outputs. Both temperature sources are evaluated utilizing co-located ozonesonde measurements also retrieved from the WOUDC database. Both GODFIT_v 3 and ECMWF T eff s are found to be unbiased against the ozonesonde observations and to agree with high correlation coefficients, especially for latitudes characterized by high seasonal variability in T eff. The validation analysis shows that, when applying the GODFIT_v 3 effective temperatures in order to post-process the Dobson TOC, the mean difference between Dobson and GOME 2 A GODFIT_v 3 TOCs moves from 0. 63 [*]±[*] 0. 66 to 0. 26 [*]±[*] 0. 46  % in the Northern Hemisphere and from 1. 25 [*]±[*] 1. 20 to 0. 80 [*]±[*] 0. 71  % in the Southern Hemisphere. The existing solar zenith angle dependency of the differences has been smoothed out, with near-zero dependency up to the 60 – 65 ° bin and the highest deviation decreasing from 2. 38 [*]±[*] 6. 6 to 1. 37 [*]±[*] 6. 4  % for the 80 – 85 ° bin. We conclude that the global-scale validation of satellite TOCs against collocated Dobson measurements benefits from a post-correction using suitably estimated T eff s...|$|R
40|$|Ozone {{trends for}} 1979 - 1991, {{determined}} from <b>Dobson</b> spectrophotometer <b>observations</b> made at eight {{stations in the}} United States, are augmented with trend data from four foreign cooperative stations operated by NOAA/CMDL. Results are based on provisional data archived routinely throughout the years at the World Ozone Data Center in Toronto, Canada, with calibration corrections applied {{to some of the}} data. Trends through 1990 exhibit values of minus 0. 3 percent to minus 0. 5 percent yr(exp - 1) at mid-to-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. With the addition of 1991 data, however, the trends become less negative, indicating that ozone increased {{in many parts of the}} world during 1991. Stations located within the plus or minus 20 deg N-S latitude band exhibit no ozone trends. Early 1992 data show decreased ozone values at some of the stations.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{standard}} retrieval Umkehr method to estimate the vertical distribution of ozone was updated using a statistical approach to the mathematical inversion scheme. The vertical ozone profile covariance matrix {{was used as a}} priori information for the inverse problem. A new method of the ozonesonde data organization according to air mass types helped to improve the covariance matrix quality. A retrieval method was developed using eigenvector technique. An optimal vertical ozone profile resolution was determined from the mathematical inversion scheme analysis based on the same technique. The sun radiation transfer was accounted for multiple scattering and atmospheric sphericity in this calculation. The retrievals using actual Umkehr <b>Dobson</b> spectrophotometer <b>observations</b> were also performed to provide the comparison of the standard and updated methods with concurrent ozone sound data at Boulder U. S. The comparison has revealed that the present method has some advantages in both resolution and accuracy, as compared to the standard one, especially for the atmospheric layers below ozone maximum...|$|R
40|$|The most {{long-lived}} satellite set {{of ozone}} observations, to date, is that {{derived from the}} Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) ozone sensor on Nimbus 4 and extends from April 1970 through 1976. Unfortunately, this experiment suffered spacecraft power limitations which limited the spatial and temporal coverage and also appears to have suffered from long-term drifts which {{may be associated with}} changes in the instrument characteristics or the incident solar flux. Techniques have been developed to account for these problems, and this paper presents results of the BUV total ozone variations and compares them with those from ground-based observations, specifically the computations of Angell and Korshover (1978). After adjustments for the spatial gaps and comparison with concurrent <b>Dobson</b> ground-based <b>observations,</b> no significant trend was found in the BUV data over the years 1970 - 74.

40|$|The ozone {{multi-sensor}} reanalysis (MSR) is a multi-decadal {{ozone column}} data record constructed using all available ozone column satellite data sets, surface Brewer and <b>Dobson</b> <b>observations</b> and a data assimilation technique with detailed error modelling. The {{result is a}} high-resolution time series of 6 -hourly global ozone column fields and forecast error fields {{that may be used}} for ozone trend analyses as well as detailed case studies. The ozone MSR is produced in two steps. First, the latest reprocessed versions of all available ozone column satellite data sets are collected and then are corrected for biases as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA), viewing zenith angle (VZA), time (trend), and stratospheric temperature using surface observations of the ozone column from Brewer and Dobson spectrophotometers from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Subsequently the de-biased satellite observations are assimilated within the ozone chemistry and data assimilation model TMDAM. The MSR 2 (MSR version 2) reanalysis upgrade described in this paper consists of an ozone record for the 43 -year period 1970 – 2012. The chemistry transport model and data assimilation system have been adapted to improve the resolution, error modelling and processing speed. Backscatter ultraviolet (BUV) satellite observations have been included for the period 1970 – 1977. The total record is extended by 13 years compared to the first version of the ozone multi sensor reanalysis, the MSR 1. The latest total ozone retrievals of 15 satellite instruments are used: BUV-Nimbus 4, TOMS-Nimbus 7, TOMS-EP, SBUV- 7, - 9, - 11, - 14, - 16, - 17, - 18, - 19, GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI and GOME- 2. The resolution of the model runs, assimilation and output is increased from 2 ° × 3 ° to 1 ° × 1 °. The analysis is driven by 3 -hourly meteorology from the ERA-Interim reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) starting from 1979, and ERA- 40 before that date. The chemistry parameterization has been updated. The performance of the MSR 2 analysis is studied with the help of observation-minus-forecast (OmF) departures from the data assimilation, by comparisons with the individual station observations and with ozone sondes. The OmF statistics show that the mean bias of the MSR 2 analyses is less than 1 % with respect to de-biased satellite observations after 1979...|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{ultraviolet}} (UV) {{and visible}} irradiance has been monitored at the South Pole with a SUV- 100 spectro-radiometer since 1991. A new data version labeled “Version 2 ” {{has recently been}} produced, which has a higher accuracy than the original released “Version 0 ”. We have established a UV climatology for the South Pole based on the new data set, focusing {{on the effects of}} cloudiness, total column ozone, and volcanic aerosols. In addition, total column ozone was calculated from the spectral UV measurements for solar zenith angles (SZA) up to 87 ° using a recently developed algorithm. This new total ozone data set can complement <b>Dobson</b> ozone <b>observations</b> to validate satellite total ozone data. At the South Pole, NASA/TOMS Version 7 overpass data exceed SUV- 100 total ozone measurements by 5 - 8 %. In contrast, TOMS Version 8 data agree on average to within 2 % with SUV- 100 measurements, and the ratio of the two data sets shows virtually no dependence on SZA and the ozone amount. The good agreement confirms that the well-documented bias of TOMS Version 7 data at high austral latitudes was successfully reduced with the release of Version 8. A similar comparison between SUV- 100, Dobson, and TOMS ozone measurements was performed for the NSF/OPP network site at Arrival Heights (78 °S), and results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Meteorological {{observations}} at Syowa Base in 5 th expedition {{were maintained}} {{in the year}} 1960 - 1962. Among scientific disciplines importance {{was attached to the}} meteorological section consisting of 4 members, to take various types of observation. General and characteristic features in meteorological observations are summarized in the following. A. Surface observation: 3 -hourly observations were made throughout the wintering period, 4 observations were transmitted to Mother Station (Mawson), twice daily. In addition to the specified observations, radiation, sunshine and ground temperature were also observed by continuous selfrecording instrument respectively. The special features of this year is that, compared with the appearance of the annual minimum temperature normally in September in the Antarctic, the minimum occurred in July and it is shown that the average temperature in September was 5. 5 ℃ higher than the normal value. B. Upper air observation: One time (12 Z) daily rawinsonde observations were made throughout the year except a few cases of only radiosonde observation. Twice daily (00 and 12 Z) rawinsonde observations were made during World Meteorological Interval of Post-IGY (July 16 -July 25). All observations were transmitted to Mother Station every day. Equipments used : D- 55 A type Automatic Direction Finder (Similar type with GMD- 1 A) JMA-RSII Rawinsonde, 1680 Mc JMA-SIII Radiosonde, 27 Mc 800 g Balloon (Latex) CaH_ 2 Cans for Hydrogen gas to fill balloons. Monthly average temperatures and heights were shown in respective figures. In September, combined with the surface temperature, the strong warm-air inflow throughout the troposphere below 300 mb could be seen. A rapid warming in the stratosphere in spring was also clearly observed. Wind rose at some selected pressure levels were shown in Figs. 7 - 10. In general, the wind is strong in winter, especially in the stratosphere and NE-ly and SW-ly winds are predominant in the troposphere, SW-ly or W-ly in the stratosphere. The E-ly winds were also observed above 30 mb in summer. C. Ozone observation: i) Total ozone <b>observation</b> <b>Dobson</b> ozone spectrophotometer was used for this observation. Table 3 shows the results of only direct sunlight observation with reliable AD wave length setting. Comparison is made in Figs. 11 and 12 between Syowa Base, Little America and Halley Bay. Total ozone amount can be said to increase in spring from November to December over the Antarctic and the maximum seems to appear in summer. The 10 -days average values of Syowa Base and Halley Bay show to be in good similarity in spite of different year. It may also be noted that a good correlation exists between rapid increase of ozone amount and temperature of 50 mb in late November. ii) Surface ozone observation The density of surface ozone was measured on days without drifting snow from the end of February 1961. Based on Ehmert method, the equipment developed by Mr. KAWAMURA, Meteorological Research Institute, was used. It may be seen that the density increase in autumn and reaches its maximum value about 40 μg/m^ 3 in early June in polar night season, then decreases rapidly until the sun comes back and indicates minimum in early summer. It should be noted that there is 6 months 2 ̆ 7 phase difference between the surface ozone amount and the total ozone amount. D. Special observation: Snow accumulation Toward ENE-ly direction from the base, 6 snow stakes were erected and snow accumulation was observed several times every month. The result is shown in Table 4 in which the annual accumulation was 121 cm. Average density of snow was 0. 474 and the equivalent amount of water was 574 m/m...|$|R
