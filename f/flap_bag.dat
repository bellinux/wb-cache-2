40|$|Gastroschisis is a {{congenital}} defect of the abdominal wall involving evisceration of abdominal contents. Initial surgical treatment of this condition {{depends on the}} size of the defect, size of the abdominal cavity and amount of bowel exposed. Various techniques described are primary closure, use of the skin <b>flap</b> and silo <b>bag</b> application, followed by fascial closure. Here we present a case wherein even after 7 days of silo bag application, fascial closure was not possible, and a composite mesh was used to cover the bowel until further repair could be attempted...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, Herb {{served as}} an {{electrical}} engineer for the Navy Department in Washington, DC. Jan and Herb spent their spare time exploring the rocks surrounding Washington DC, most notably Carderock where they began climbing in 1942. They climbed and named lots of the routes at Carderock, including Herbie’s Horror, Jan's Face, Spider Walk and Ronnie’s Leap, which was named after their dog. Herbie’s Horror, first climbed by Herb, {{was one of the}} first 5.9 routes in the eastern United States. They also made the first documented ascents of the routes Conn's East and Conn's West at Seneca Rocks, following the pitons left by the mountain troops who trained there. In a letter to the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club Mountaineering Section the Conns describe a visit to Seneca with Don Hubbard: [...] "Don and the two of us climbed the south peak on a gorgeous moonlit evening, carrying sleeping bags, and spent the night on the narrow summit ridge. Don woke up in the night to see the lower half of Jan’s <b>bag</b> <b>flapping</b> over the edge. But Jan was safely curled up in the top half, still anchored to a piton in the rock." [...] In 1944 they started publishing [...] "Up Rope" [...] magazine, which became the official newsletter of the Mountaineering Section of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC).|$|R
