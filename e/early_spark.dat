The scale will have to be reduced; all save the very broadest aspects of things will have to be left out; none save the highest ranges and the streams of most copious volume will find a place in that map. Small as is the scale and many as are its omissions, yet if a man has intelligently followed the very shortest course of universal history, it will be the fault of his teacher if he has not acquired an impressive conception, which will never be effaced, of the destinies of man upon the earth; of the mighty confluence of forces working on from age to age, which have their meeting in every one of us here to-night; of the order in which each state of society has followed its foregoer, according to great and changeless laws 'embracing all things and all times;' of the thousand faithful hands that have one after another, each in their several degrees, orders, and capacities, trimmed the silver lamp of knowledge and kept its sacred flame bright from generation to generation and age to age, now in one land and now in another, from its <b>early</b> <b>spark</b> among far-off dim Chaldeans down to Goethe and Faraday and Darwin and all the other good workers of our own day.|$|E

40|$|LPG作為車用替代燃料，除了能使能源的使用更加多元化之外，因其具有較汽油引擎更低的排氣污染特性，在環保意識高漲的今日，愈加受到重視。本文主要可分為三大部分：第一部份主要討論汽車引擎改用LPG燃料系統對性能及排放廢氣之影響，根據實驗顯示，混合器口徑對引擎性能影響很大。而在適當的混合器匹配下，引擎使用LPG燃料系統的馬力輸出約比汽油引擎小了 6 ~ 7 ﹪左右，廢氣污染的多寡主要取決於空燃比，LPG燃後廢氣之THC及OFP較汽油低。此外LPG引擎較一般汽油引擎更提前的點火角是必要的，但太過提前會使引擎啟動困難、性能下降。 第二部分主要對LPG廢氣中HC的成分作分析，由採樣分析結果得知，LPG廢氣之HC一部份由未燃氣所組成，與汽油燃後廢氣作碳數分布比較，得知汽油燃燒後成分碳數分布較廣，而LPG主要集中於低碳部分。在臭氧生成物方面，乙烯及丙烯為LPG燃後成分中主要提供者。 第三部份為LPG動態模式之發展，由結果得知空燃比的延遲主要由混合器後進氣道以及進氣歧管的延遲所構成。To use Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) as an {{alternative}} fuel is a excellent method to wildly utilize the world energy source. As the LPG vehicles have lower emissions than the gasoline vehicles,people who care about environment are concerned on this characteristic. This paper presents three major parts: The first is the discussions {{of the effects of}} LPG engine performance and emission. According to the results of our experiments,the throttle size of mixer strongly influences the engine performance. Based on the prosperity mixer,the LPG engine presents 6 ~ 7 ﹪power less than the gasoline engine power,Air-to-Fuel ratio strongly effects the emission,the total hydrocarbon and total OFP of the LPG emission is less than that of gasoline. Otherwise,it is necessary to have an <b>early</b> <b>spark</b> angle on LPG engine,but the more early angle will cause the difficulty of engine start. The second part is concerned on the HC components of the LPG emission,according to our analysis of emission samples,unburned LPG {{is an important part of}} the LPG HC emission. Using carbon numbers to compare with gosoline emission,we find that gosoline HC components distribute widely,but LPG emission components focus on low carbon number components. Ethylene and Propene present the major parts of the emission Ozone forming potential. The third part is establishing the model of LPG engine fuel system,and compare with the real engine state. We find that fuel system has almost no effect on LPG system characteristics,A/F total delay is caused by the mixture manifold delay and the intake manifold delay. 第一章 緒論 1. 1. 前言………………………………………………………… 1 - 1 1. 2. 文獻回顧…………………………………………………… 1 - 3 1. 3. 研究目的…………………………………………………… 1 - 5 第二章 LPG系統與實驗設備 2. 1.

5000|$|A {{continuous}} wave or {{continuous wave}}form (CW) is an electromagnetic wave of constant amplitude and frequency; almost always a sine wave, that for mathematical analysis {{is considered to}} be of infinite duration.

Information is carried in the varying duration of the on and off periods of the signal, for example by Morse code in early radio.

The reported word count latency (in this paper) was on a sub-second range. The difference (to [9]) may be explained with a different data set, and version of Spark (v 0.9 vs. v 1.3. 1).

However, when both algorithms were executed without a database, latency dropped lower than 1  s.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, before modern AM or FM radio {{transmission}} was developed, radio transmitters communicated information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was switched off and on by the operator with a telegraph key, producing pulses of radio waves, to spell out text messages in Morse code. Around 1905 the first continuous wave radio transmitters began to replace the <b>earlier</b> <b>spark</b> transmitters. The Morse code signal of the spark transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves called damped waves which repeated at an audio rate, so they were audible as a buzz or tone in a receivers earphones. In contrast the new continuous wave transmitters produced a signal consisting of pulses of continuous waves, unmodulated sinusoidal carrier waves, which were inaudible in the earphones. [...] So to receive this new modulation method, the receiver had to produce a tone during the pulses of carrier.|$|R
