40|$|Raising {{awareness}} {{of the importance of}} environment for human health resulted in several initiatives such as European Environment and Health Process and Environment for Europe Process. However, they {{should not be confused with}} the <b>environmental</b> health <b>acquis</b> requirements deriving from a large number of EU Directives or Council Regulations in which important aspects of protection of environment and human health are incorporated. In 2003 the European Commission adopted the European Environment and Health Strategy, which soon was followed by EU European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004 - 2010 as an additional complementary system to the existing EU Directives. On the other hand, National Environmental Health Action Plans were developed on the basis of the Environment and Health Action Plan for Europe within the European Environment and Health Process, as a tool to assist individual country in evaluating and improving the environmental health management system, but with no legal binding at all. By reviewing the existing legal framework and policy documents, as well as by investigating available instruments and capacity for the implementation and evaluation of environmental health policy in Croatia, the actual »diagnosis and prognosis« of Croatian environmental health was assessed in this paper. As an EU accession country, Croatian first priority is to fully harmonize its legislation with all EU directives concerning environmental health, as a prerequisite for establishing relevant and highly operational system of environmental health characterized by high level of mutisectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation at different levels...|$|R
40|$|To date soil is {{not subject}} to a {{comprehensive}} and coherent set of rules in the European Union. The protection and sustainable use of soil is scattered in different Community policies contributing in various degrees to mainly indirect protection of soil, for example through environmental policies on waste, water, chemicals, industrial pollution prevention, nature protection and biodiversity, nitrates and pesticides, sewage sludge, forestry strategy, climate change adaptation and mitigation, or biofuels. At national level the situation varies a lot from one Member State to the other. Only a few Member States have specific and comprehensive legislation on soil protection, very often national soil legislation is limited to soil contamination and soil sealing. The others rely on provisions on soil protection in the <b>environmental</b> legal <b>acquis.</b> On the basis of non-harmonised national inventories, local soil contamination in the EEA- 33 [1] plus the 6 cooperating countries has recently been estimated at 2. 5 million potentially contaminated sites. About one third of an estimated total of 342 000 contaminated sites in the EEA- 33 plus the 6 cooperating countries have already been identified and about 15 % of these have been remediated. Soil contamination is very often perceived as a burden by policy and decision makers and as a threat by citizens. For local authorities the remediation effort is often heavy in terms of costs and complexity. However Italy has a number of success stories clearly demonstrating that this challenge can be tackled with determination in cooperation with local partners and city authorities to offer new development opportunities. The remediation of contaminated sites offers clearly a significant potential for green growth and jobs, which are at the centre of the action of the European Commission. With brownfield remediation in south-west Sardinia, Italy presents an innovative approach for the assessment and management of contaminated soils. It allowed the redevelopment of a big portion of the Portoscuso municipality achieving also a high level of stakeholders involvement in the process of risk assessment of groundwater and soil contamination. Porto Marghera (Venice) is another good example of brownfield remediation that limits the loss of land thanks to the engagement of public, private and research institutions. JRC.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explore the process of formal and practical transposition of European Union waste management acquis (selected directives). The discussion focuses on the experience of Bulgaria as a former candidate country and a new EU Member State in adopting and applying EU waste legislation. The research analyses the policy adjustments undertaken by Bulgaria towards complying with EU environmental and waste rules {{and the extent to which}} these adjustments have translated into actual change in the Bulgarian waste sector. Drawing on the specificities and the pace of the EU-driven transposition process before and after accession, the research considers the quality and type of change that Bulgarian waste policy has undergone since the country’s engagement with the European Union. Further to examining the intensity of the Europeanization dynamics in this case, the discussion identifies and explains the workings of other endogenous factors intervening in the Europeanization process. Alongside the domestic variables proposed and tested in existing academic work, this research puts forward for examination a test variable reflecting the existence of policy interactions at EU level, which once ‘domesticated’ in the national arena, can have significant implications for implementation performance and policy change. This research posits that policy interactions, featuring as a ‘domesticated’ variable, have to be considered in the context of EU adaptational pressures and in conjunction with the workings of domestic variables. Therefore, this research contributes to existing theory by analysing the effects of EU policy interactions in the domestic arena as part of the overall Europeanization dynamics. At an empirical level the research addresses the gap in existing studies of the processes of Europeanization and implementation of EU <b>environmental</b> and waste <b>acquis</b> in the EU new Member States and ex-candidate countries. More specifically, the thesis contributes to research on Bulgaria and on Bulgarian environmental and waste reforms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the development}} of environmental governance in Kosovo, environmental laws, regulations, processes, and their conformity with the EU <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis.</b> Kosovo, like {{other countries in the}} Balkans trying to join the EU, will, in the process of accession, have to ensure that its legislation conforms to the Copenhagen accession criteria. While Kosovo authorities have progressed in the process of legal harmonization, there has been little progress in executing the legal framework in terms of institutional design, necessary processes and policy developments. The key question posed in this paper is whether the environmental governance approach in Kosovo, in line with EU accession process, represents an appropriate framework for dealing with the country‟s environmental problems. The current Kosovo legal framework, institutional set-up, and current practice will be evaluated against conformity with the EU acquis. The implementation of EU <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis</b> in Kosovo is to be seen as an important opportunity to create environmental governance and stable processes of assessing environmental impact and increasing environmental policy integration...|$|E
40|$|Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) is {{a country}} in {{transition}} but is determined to pursue accession to the European Union (EU). One requirement for joining the EU is compliance with the EU <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis,</b> although BH is currently lacking adequate experience and the required research. Therefore, it is advisable to quantify {{the costs and benefits}} of meeting the EU <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis</b> to the fullest possible extent, even though comparing costs and benefits may not be the only relevant criterion for decision making. Because the EU's ExternE methodology for estimating the external costs of air quality has been used in numerous studies aimed at formulating environmental, transport and energy policies, BH has consulted this methodology to help make decisions about restricting emissions from major combustion sources. Therefore, with the help of the EcoSenseWeb software, which fully complies with the ExternE methodology, this study was developed to examine the current situation resulting from electricity generation at a fossil fuel power plant and the units that are to be built in BH and to review the SO 2 emission limit for new thermal plants in BH.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{qualitative}} {{dimension of}} the service companies ’ activities also refers to their impact over the environment. This aspect is meant {{to contribute to a}} sustainable economic growth, based on high economic performances, but also on obeying the environment protection and preservation requirements. Offering services in harmony with the sustainable development principles requires the companies to be concerned with monitoring and controlling the impact of their activities over the environment by adopting an adequate system of eco-management. Through a comparative approach, the article underlines the characteristics of two of the most used environmental management systems, promoted by the European Union’s legislation, ISO 14001 and EMAS, which must be adopted by the service companies in Romania in order to be compatible with the <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis</b> ’ regulations.

40|$|In {{institutional}} terms, the European Union (EU) {{is considerably}} ‘thicker’ {{than it was}} thirty years ago, with many new layers of decision-making procedure and myriad new actors, including almost twice as many Member States. Conventional wisdom suggests that policy systems in which policy development depends upon securing agreement among a concurrent majority of actors, are generally slow and collectively sub-optimal. However, a longitudinal analysis of the time taken to adopt environmental proposals in the period 1967 - 1997 reveals that the policy process has become slightly faster not slower.

Lithuania is oneof twelve EU associate members in Central andEastern Europe {{that is currently}} preparing foraccession by approximating their legislationwith that of the EU. The costs of fifteen EUdirectives are considered and details are givenon four directives. Necessary investments maytotal Euro 1500 million by 2015 and the presentvalue of all annualized costs is expected to beabout Euro 2200 million. In 2015, annualized costsare estimated to be approximately Euro 500 million,but these costs {{are only part of}} the totalcosts of approximation. Non-environmentalcosts are not considered. Assuming a modestlyambitious average annual growth of GDP of 2. 0 %per year implies that approximation with thefifteen directives analyzed will cost roughly 3. 5 % of GDP in 2015. This level of additional commitment to environmentalprotection is itself much higher than the 2. 0 %of GDP being spent on average by OECD countriesand suggests the possibility of a substantialeconomic burden on the Lithuanian economy. Public budgets and households are expected tocarry a substantial portion of this cost,because many directives are the responsibilityof national and local governments. Making theright choices that are expected to be part ofapproximation with the <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis</b> is likely to benefit from carefulcomparisons of costs and willingness to pay forthe environmental benefits of approximation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the economic and}} policy context for environmental investments in the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe. This context is created by macroeconomic constraints, the unfinished process of transition and the requirements of membership. The task of this paperback book is to identify these constraints and point to policy options for decision-makers {{on both sides of}} the enlargement process. Experts originally estimated the investment cost for the CEECs to achieve compliance with the <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis</b> at around 3 - 4 % of GDP over 20 years. The Commission now assumes they need to spend between 2 and 3 % of GDP “in the coming years”. But, as Wolfgang Hager explains in detail in the book, these are largely crude investment costs and do not include operational and financial follow-on costs which may be borne by the public budget. Commonly accepted prudential limits on public spending for the CEEC economies suggest a maximum expenditure on the environment – investment, financial charges and operational costs added together – of around 2. 5 % of GDP per annum. This translates into a mathematical necessity for transition periods expressed in decades rather than years. The study argues that there are policy options available to substantially reduce the gap between the desirable and the possible. The present impasse results in part from a planning and forecast exercise that is based on multiplying quantities, taken as given, with equipment and operating costs, taken as given. This study seeks to demonstrate that the main constraint is budgetary rather than macroeconomic and that the full scope for off-budget investments therefore needs to be exploited. The author also finds there is a large scope for policies directed at improving efficiency: achieving the greatest environmental benefit from a given amount of resources...|$|E

It consists of two parts: 1) "Implementation of REACH in the New Member States – Part one: overview of the chemical and specialty chemical sector in the New Member States", and 2) "Implementation of REACH in the New Member States – Part two: Business case studies in selected New Member States". The first report gives a general overview of the chemical sector in all New Member States and provides key macroeconomic data for {{the description of the}} chemical sector as a whole in each of the countries. This includes the sectors development, major developments including trade with EU- 15 and non-EU countries, and a description of sub-sectors according to NACE categories. Furthermore, the first report describes the impact on the chemical industry through the implementation of the Chemicals Acquis and the Accession to the EU, and derives the implications for the adoption of REACH in the New Member States. Finally, the report outlines REACH Impact studies which are available in the New Member States. The second report analyses the ability of specialty chemicals companies in selected countries to implement REACH. This ability is examined on the basis of techno-economic case studies. From the economic aspect, the impact on costs and prices is analysed, substance withdrawal, administrative impact, capacity needs and the competitiveness on European and international markets. From the technological point of view the impact of REACH on innovation, replacement of substances and process adaptation is looked at. The strategic analysis looked at alternatives to cope with REACH (such as the import of components, relocation to non-EU countries etc.), the potential of companies to adapt to the changing legal framework (including the implementation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis)</b> and the relative importance of REACH as one amongst different drivers for change.

40|$|Abstract After {{decades of}} pushing for {{deregulation}} and regulatory reform in its Member States, has the European Union itself become a locus for policy dismantling – i. e. {{leading to a}} weakening of its policies? This thesis offers a first systematic study of policy dismantling at EU level. It focuses on environmental policies, {{an area in which}} EU action has repeatedly been criticised by politicians for harming competitiveness and not respecting national sovereignty. It combines for the first time insights from comparative politics studies of dismantling with EU governance literature, to offer a theoretical framework specially configured to explaining dismantling at EU level. It investigates which EU environmental policies have been targeted for policy dismantling, by whom, why and how, from the early 1990 s {{to the end of the}} second Barroso Commission in 2014. It reveals how the EU has changed, from a driver of policy dismantling in its Member States to a locus of dismantling in its own right. Dismantling attempts (from the reduction of administrative burdens to the repatriation of competences) have been made by key EU actors – which for some, such as the European Commission, goes against the conventional wisdom in EU studies. These attempts have been justified in terms of criticisms of the EU’s legislative outputs – subsidiarity and proportionality – and of European integration itself. But they have not resulted in significant policy dismantling. Dismantling has been the least frequent outcome of legislative reform amongst the many pieces of legislation earmarked for dismantling. This pattern indicates the resilience – until now – of the EU’s “green state” (Klyza and Sousa, 2013), but dismantling attempts have markedly changed the way the EU legislates on environmental issues and further hindered policy expansion. This thesis contributes to the renaissance of dismantling studies in comparative politics by revealing how dismantling strategies and effects at EU level differ from the existing literature which focuses almost exclusively on nation states. Looking at the EU from a policy dismantling perspective, this thesis also questions foundational assumptions in EU studies – on what drives EU actors, on where the EU is headed. Finally it offers a different reading of the history of EU environmental policy, stressing the role that contestation in general, and dismantling in particular, have played in shaping the <b>environmental</b> <b>acquis...</b>|$|E
