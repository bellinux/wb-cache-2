25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the Panel system was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type senders stored <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> on rotary selector switches. The senders employed translators {{to convert the}} <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel senders were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster call completion.|$|E

For 2-byte blocks, 4 known plaintexts suffice.|$|R
50|$|The {{register}} equipment {{received the}} <b>dialled</b> <b>digits</b> and could process and store 100 nine digit numbers. This capacity was not fully exploited at Highgate Wood although the register {{and most of}} the control equipment was potentially capable of dealing with the traffic from a large metropolitan exchange.|$|R
25|$|Crossbar offices {{used more}} shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit {{receiver}} (part of an element called an Originating Register) would {{be connected to}} a call {{just long enough to}} collect the subscriber's <b>dialed</b> <b>digits.</b> Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later crossbar systems had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, automatic number identification had been retrofitted to nearly all step-by-step and crossbar switches in the Bell System.|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange automatically senses an off-hook {{condition of the}} telephone when the user removes the handset from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides dial tone {{at that time to}} indicate to the user that the exchange is ready to receive <b>dialed</b> <b>digits.</b> The pulses or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange.|$|E
25|$|The Panel switch {{was named}} for its tall panels covered with 500 rows of terminals. Each panel had an {{electric}} motor to drive usually sixty selectors by electromagnetically controlled clutches. The selector was similar in effect to a stepping switch though it moved continuously over the contacts. Each selector had five brushes, each of which could select from 100 terminals arranged in groups. Pulses were sent {{in the opposite direction}} than in the preexisting Strowger switches, i.e. from the selector to the register which had received the <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> from the caller, a signaling method that became known as revertive pulsing.|$|E

50|$|Within the {{telecommunication}} industry, a NAD will {{be connected}} to a user's telephone. When the user dials a number, the NAD will 'listen' to the <b>dialled</b> <b>digits</b> and reroute the call through a network that will provide the best rates for the destination of the call. The NAD {{is often referred to}} as a dialler, predictive dialler or least cost routing dialler.|$|R
25|$|In {{the most}} areas of North America, {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan communities {{consisted of a}} combination of digits and letters, starting in the 1920s until the 1960s. Letters were translated to <b>dialed</b> <b>digits,</b> a mapping that was displayed directly on the telephone dial. Each of the digits 2 to 9, and sometimes 0, corresponded to a group of typically three letters. The leading two or three letters of a telephone number indicated the exchange name, for example, EDgewood and IVanhoe, and were followed by 5 or 4 digits. The limitations that these system presented in terms of usable names that were easy to distinguish and spell, and the need for a comprehensive numbering plan that enabled direct-distance dialing, led to the introduction of all-number dialing in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{stepping}} switches {{were arranged}} in banks, {{the first stage}} of which was a linefinder. If one of up to a hundred subscriber lines had the receiver lifted [...] "off hook", a linefinder connected the subscriber's line to a free first selector, which returned the subscriber a dial tone to show that it was ready to receive <b>dialed</b> <b>digits.</b> The subscriber's dial pulsed at about 10 pulses per second, although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration.|$|E

5000|$|The Registers were [...] "owned" [...] by the MCUs {{and each}} MCU had {{a maximum of}} 36 Registers. The MCU was {{responsible}} for looking after all of its Registers and deciding from the dialled information where the call {{was going to be}} routed. The local exchange numbering system would be available to the MCU via threadings in the cyclic store so the MCU would be able to read this information and in this way all exchanges could be configured as required. If a call was identified by the MCU as being own exchange, usually by the first digit, then the MCU would tell the Register to come back when the complete number had been dialled. If the first <b>dialled</b> <b>digit</b> was a zero then this would normally be routed straight to the Group Switching Centre. However, if the exchange had an Alternative Available Route say 0296 then the MCU would have to wait until enough routing digits had been received to make a routing decision. Again this AAR information was stored in the cyclic stores. Once the MCU had decided the routing, it sent a command to the Interrogator/Markers to set up the required path and also told the Register what <b>dialled</b> <b>digits</b> to forward on. Then the MCU would {{move on to the next}} task. Once the connection had been established, the Supervisory Processing Unit (SPU) took care of the path and all the call metering tasks. The MCUs had core memory to hold the <b>dialled</b> <b>digits</b> from all the Registers and also had other storage to manipulate call set-up information. There were three scan rates: 156ms for subscribers, 36ms for Registers, Outgoing Junctions and Routing Translations, and 12ms for Incoming Junctions. The last of these was obviously the quickest scan, to ensure that no incoming digits were lost from the incoming junctions. (A junction in BT terminology was not a junction in the ordinary sense of the word, but was the name given to a pair of wires connecting a call between a 'satellite' telephone exchange and the main exchange.) ...|$|R
50|$|When {{released}} at the finger stop, the wheel returns to its home position by spring action {{at a speed}} regulated by a governor device. During this return rotation, the dial interrupts the direct electrical current of the telephone line (local loop) a specific number of times for each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each <b>dialed</b> <b>digit.</b> Each of the ten digits is encoded in sequences of up to ten pulses so the method is sometimes called decadic dialling.|$|R

50|$|A {{dial tone}} is a {{telephony}} signal sent by a telephone exchange or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) to a terminating device, such as a telephone, when an off-hook condition is detected. It indicates that the exchange is working and is ready to initiate a telephone call. The tone stops when the first <b>dialed</b> <b>digit</b> is recognized. If no digits are forthcoming, the permanent signal procedure is invoked, often eliciting a special information tone and an intercept message, followed by the off-hook tone, requiring the caller to hang up and redial.|$|R

5000|$|Wink Start - {{when the}} {{originator}} goes off hook, {{the other end}} transmits a short (140-290ms) off-hook signal and returns to on-hook. The originator detects the wink and then sends the <b>dialed</b> <b>digits.</b> The other end goes permanently off-hook (seized) when the call is answered.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{mechanisms}} used by signaling methods prior to SS7 (battery reversal, multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these older methods could not communicate much signaling information. Usually only the <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> were signaled, and merely during call setup. For charged calls, <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> and charge number digits were outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate {{significant amounts of}} information when setting up a call, during the call, {{and at the end}} of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, calling name and number display, call screening, malicious caller identification, busy callback.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{telephone}} based wireless {{system for}} the remote operation of the home appliances is proposed. The telephone, acting as a remote controller, generates a DTMF signal corre-sponding to each <b>dialed</b> <b>digit</b> which is converted to a BCD code by the Telephone interface circuit. This is given as input to the transmitter module which is then used to control various home appliances through a receiver module. Data processing stages of the transmitter and receiver modules have been implemented using digital components, thereby avoiding possible use of con-ventional devices like monostable multivibrators. Due to the fully digital nature, the proposed design is less complex and hence the implementation is cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Challenges to random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> {{have been}} documented, but the {{reliability}} of random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> outcomes from telephone number calling, household identification, and enumeration has never been addressed, despite its potential to bias population representativeness by affecting completeness of coverage. The authors explored interobserver reliability of calls to numbers generated by random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> for a 1990 – 1996 population-based case-control study in San Francisco, California, area women, using data from a quality control effort in which 122 of 4, 890 random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> numbers were assigned to a second interviewer for recontacting within 4 months. The 34 numbers discrepant {{between the first and}} second calls did not differ from the 88 unchanged outcomes, and reliability was good (kappa = 0. 65, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 55, 0. 75). Eligibility (an adult woman in the household) was confirmed for nine of 11 eligible households. However, six of 29 households originally ineligible because of gender were eligible on recontact, and eligible residences rose from 24 % to 39 % between the two calls, although the two groups of eligible women did not differ in age or race. This underenumeration of women by random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> confirms prior observations, although interviewer differences or changes in respondents or household composition {{between the first and second}} calls may have contributed. Recontact of gender-ineligible households may improve completeness of random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> coverage for female populations.

5000|$|The term [...] "seamless services" [...] {{sometimes}} means service equivalence across any termination point, {{fixed or}} mobile, so for example, dialing plans are identical and {{no change in}} <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> is needed on a desk phone versus a mobile.

50|$|Because the {{operator}} only needed {{the last four}} digits of the phone number to complete the call, the first three <b>dialed</b> <b>digits</b> were not sent to the manual office. However, for two reasons, PCI always sends five-digit numbers rather than four (and the caller may need to dial eight digits rather than seven).|$|E
40|$|Random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> is used {{frequently}} in epidemiologic case-control studies to select population-based controls, even when both cases and controls are interviewed face-to-face. However, concerns persist {{about the potential}} biases of random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing,</b> particularly given its generally lower response rates. In an Atlanta, Georgia, case-control study of breast cancer among women aged 20 – 54 years, {{all of whom were}} interviewed face-to-face, two statistically independent control groups were compared: those obtained through random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> (n = 652) and those obtained through area probability sampling (n = 640). The household screening rate was significantly higher for the area sample, by 5. 5 %. Interview response rates were comparable. The telephone sample estimated a significantly larger percentage (by approximately 7 %) of households to have no age-eligible women. Both control groups, appropriately weighted, had characteristics similar to US Census demographic characteristics for Atlanta women, except that respondents in both control groups were more educated and more likely to be married. The authors conclude that households contacted through random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> are somewhat less likely to participate in the household screening process, and if they are cooperative, some households may not disclose that age-eligible women reside therein. Investigators need to develop improved methods for screening and enumerating household members in random <b>digit</b> <b>dialing</b> surveys that target a specific subpopulation, such as women.
