Thus, the Petersen graph has crossing number 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at most once, so the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.|$|E

25|$|Julia Robinson and Yuri Matiyasevich {{showed that}} every Diophantine set has {{dimension}} no greater than 13. Later, Matiyasevich sharpened their methods {{to show that}} 9 unknowns suffice. Although {{it may well be}} that this result <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> possible, there has been no further progress. So, in particular, there is no algorithm for testing Diophantine equations with 9 or fewer unknowns for solvability in natural numbers. For the case of rational integer solutions (as Hilbert had originally posed it), the 4 squares trick shows that there is no algorithm for equations with no more than 36 unknowns. But Zhi Wei Sun showed that the problem for integers is unsolvable even for equations with no more than 11 unknowns.|$|E
25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{characteristics of the}} American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes {{it one of the}} most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.|$|E

His mother is a very cranky, tired woman with too many children. Neglected by his own family, Calvin joyfully enters the lives of the Murry family, starting in Chapter Two. He also loves Meg Murry. He shows some signs of being able to communicate telepathically, the same power Charles Wallace seems to have, a technique referred to in later books as kything. He also feels as if he has been hiding his true self all his life, and likes the Murry family much more than his own, which is characterized by abuse and dysfunctional dynamics. Calvin also supported Meg through the adventure.|$|E

He noted a hidden sense of despair on the song, not immediately apparent on first listen. The song also contains parallels to Ocean's own musical career, where Ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship: [...] "the main track, the single, often <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> choice." [...] While singles are generally regarded as an album's best song, Ocean remarks that sometimes the most obvious decision holds more subtly. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard mused that Ocean took {{on the role of}} a [...] "captain" [...] on the track, prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities; [...] "Why see the world, when you got the beach?"
