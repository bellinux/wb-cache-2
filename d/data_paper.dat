5000|$|Data {{papers are}} “scholarly {{publication}} of a searchable metadata document describing a particular on-line accessible dataset, {{or a group of}} datasets, published in accordance to the standard academic practices”.Their final aim being to provide “information on the what, where, why, how and who of the data”.The intent of a <b>data</b> <b>paper</b> is to offer descriptive information on the related dataset(s) focusing on data collection, distinguishing features, access and potential reuse rather than on data processing and analysis. Because data papers are considered academic publications no different than other types of papers they allow scientists sharing data to receive credit in currency recognizable within the academic system, thus [...] "making data sharing count". This provides not only an additional incentive to share data, but also through the peer review process, increases the quality of metadata and thus reusability of the shared data.|$|E

30|$|Interoperability between {{datasets}} is {{a problem}} that is especially common when we talk about connected data, but it is also found in other areas. In our analysis, 13 papers cited and described problems with interoperability (see Table  11). Among the problems, paper [W 5] describes there being a large number of entities which have unique access URIs. In addition, the study reports that different RDF graphs are constructed using different vocabularies, which also reflects on a semantic problem of the <b>data.</b> <b>Paper</b> [W 3] adds that securing the data format and the compliance of its structure to heterogeneous sources is a major challenge within the Linked Data universe, as is providing the integration of this data with multiple providers [W 2] [W 17] [W 22]. As a solution to this whole context of problems related to interoperability between connected <b>data,</b> <b>paper</b> [W 36] suggests that the data provider must create a common architecture that can be applied to other data platforms, thus allowing the data to be linked. Out of the context of connected <b>data,</b> <b>paper</b> [W 16] shows that interoperability issues also exist on accessing open data on the Web.|$|E

40|$|The new {{scientific}} landscape requires fuller and wider access to scientific infor­mation and research data {{as an important}} means to accelerate innovation and im­prove transparency of the scientific process. In this emerging environment, the new publication model of data journals will {{play a key role}} by establishing high standards for dataset publication and promoting the deserved credit and recognition to au­thors. Biomedical Data Journal (BMDJ) is an open access journal aiming to facilitate the presentation, validation, use, and re-use of datasets with focus on publishing biomedical datasets that can serve as a source for simulation and computational modelling of diseases and biological processes. The rise of computational science could lead to exciting developments in the field of biomedical research. BMDJ has the ambition to pave the way in this direction through meeting the existing need for high-quality, well structured, open-access, biomedical datasets.

The conditional mean and variance properties are discussed and model extensions to include, e. g., explanatory variables are offered. Least squares and generalized method of moment estimators are presented. In a small Monte Carlo study a feasible least squares estimator comes out as the best choice. Empirically we find support for the use of long-lag moving average models in a Swedish stock series. There is evidence of asymmetric effects of news about prices on the number of transactions.
