500|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} is classified into two distinctive groups, [...] of wet patana (Sinhalese for [...] "montane grasslands") and [...] of subtropical montane evergreen forests. Nearly 750 species of plants belonging to 20 families have been recorded from the park. The forest canopy reaches the height of [...] and features Calophyllum walkeri, forming communities with varieties of Myrtaceae species such as Syzygium rotundifolium, and S. sclerophyllum, and Lauraceae members including Litsea, Cinnamomum, and Actinodaphne speciosa. The undergrowth layer is characterised [...] by Strobilanthes spp. The thickness of the Strobilanthes vegetation hinders {{the development of a}} <b>herb</b> <b>layer.</b> Dwarf bamboo species such Indocalamus and Ochlandra also found in the undergrowth layer. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa bushes specially grow in forest margin and near the mountain peaks. Species such as Gordonia and Rhododendron arboreum have spread to Sri Lanka, along the Western Ghats of South India from the Himalayas and are now common. Nearly 54 woody plant species have been recorded from the park, of which 27 (50%) are endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|E
2500|$|Optimal meadow vole habitat {{consists}} of moist, dense grassland with {{substantial amounts of}} plant litter. [...] Habitat selection is largely influenced by relative ground cover of grasses and forbs; soil temperature, moisture, sodium, potassium, and pH levels; humidity; and interspecific competition. Meadow voles are most commonly associated with sites having high soil moisture. [...] They are often restricted to the wetter microsites when they occur in sympatry with prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) or montane voles. [...] In an Iowa prairie restoration project, meadow voles experienced an initial population increase during the initial stage of vegetation succession (old field dominated by foxtail grass (Setaria spp.), red clover (Trifolium pratense), annual ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and thistles Cirsium spp.). However, populations reached their peak abundance during the perennial grass stage of succession from old field to tallgrass prairie. Meadow vole habitat devoid of tree cover and grasses dominated the <b>herb</b> <b>layer.</b> [...] with low tolerance for habitat variation (i. e., a species that is intolerant of variations in habitat, is restricted to few habitats, and/or uses habitats less evenly than tolerant species).|$|E

A dense shrub layer which {{is dominated by}} holly and rowan occurs in the ungrazed areas.

2500|$|Yew is {{a native}} {{evergreen}} tree that grows best in the high humidity of mild oceanic climates, which makes Killarney a very suitable location. The soil in the wood is mostly thin and in many places the trees are rooted to fissures in the bare limestone. Yew has an extensive horizontal root system. In the Killarney woods, the roots spread out over the rock surface and penetrate deeply into fissures in the limestone. The wood has a low canopy of 6–14 m (20–46ft). Yew's extreme tolerance of the dense shade its canopy creates has allowed it to out compete other species to create the pure yew woodland present today. This dense shade prevents flowering plants from establishing themselves in these woods and prevents the <b>herb</b> <b>layer</b> from developing. Bryophytes are however abundant and thrive in the humid and cool conditions. In {{some parts of the}} wood there are continuous dense blankets of moss that can be up to [...] deep. The moss species present are primarily Thamnium alopecurum with Eurhynchium striatum and Thuidium tamariscinum.|$|E

Another five species were known from only one other South Carolina location. Many of these rare species were plentiful at the site, and remain prominent there today.

40|$|Canopy gap {{formation}} {{is a major}} factor contributing to maintenance of overstory species diversity and stand structure in forests and may be integral to development of understory shrub and <b>herb</b> <b>layers</b> as well. Acknowledgement of gap formation as a fundamental feature of natural forests has led to consideration of gaps as an option in forest management regimes.

Patterns in understory vegetation community composition in and around 0. 1 and 0. 4 ha gaps created as a part of the DMS treatment were investigated. The primary goal of this research was to investigate the potential role of canopy gap creation in fostering heterogeneity in understory vegetation communities, and to examine the extent of gap influence on the surrounding thinned forest matrix.

40|$|The {{physical}} structure of vegetation {{is an important}} predictor of habitat for wildlife species. The coastal forests of the Redwood region are highly productive, supporting structurally-diverse forest habitats. The major elements of structural diversity in these forests include trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, which together create three-dimensional complexity. In the forests of the northern Redwood region, dense, continuous shrub layers were common understory structural elements in mature forests (Sawyer and others 2000). However, within the last 60 to 80 years, most of these forests have been logged and subsequently managed on short rotations (for example, 60 years) to maximize the production of wood. This {{has resulted in a}} reduction in the complexity of shrub and <b>herb</b> <b>layers</b> in these forests due to a combination of detrimental factors (for example, mechanical damage, burning, herbiciding, competition for light with densely stocked stands, fragmentation by roads).

40|$|More than 60 % of {{the total}} area of tree {{plantations}} in China is in subtropical, and over 70 % of subtropical plantations consist of pure stands of coniferous species. Because of the poor ecosystem services provided by pure coniferous plantations and the ecological instability of these stands, a movement is under way to promote indigenous broadleaf plantation cultivation as a promising alternative. However, {{little is known about}} the carbon (C) stocks in indigenous broadleaf plantations and their dependence on stand age. Thus, we studied above- and below-ground biomass and C stocks in a chronosequence of Mytilaria laosensis plantations in subtropical China; stands were 7, 10, 18, 23, 29 and 33 years old. Our assessments included tree, shrub, <b>herb</b> and litter <b>layers.</b> We used plot-level inventories and destructive tree sampling to determine vegetation C stocks. We also measured soil C stocks by analyses of soil profiles to 100 cm depth. C stocks in the tree layer dominated the above-ground ecosystem C pool across the chronosequence. C stocks increased with age from 7 to 29 years and plateaued thereafter due to a reduction in tree growth rates. Minor C stocks were found in the shrub and <b>herb</b> <b>layers</b> of all six plantations and their temporal fluctuations were relatively small. C stocks in the litter and soil layers increased with stand age. Total above-ground ecosystem C also increased with stand age.

40|$|Vertical {{structure}} in plant communities is well recognized, but questions remain about {{the response of}} different stratal layers in a plant community to resource use. This study provides a quantitative approach to compare the relationships of nine edaphic factors and species distributions in shrub and <b>herb</b> <b>layers,</b> respectively, in an and valley of the upper Minjiang River, Sichuan Province, China. Classification (TWINSPAN) determined three groups of shrubs and four groups of herbs. Ordination (both DCA and DCCA) found a correlation among species and edaphic variables. Borcard's method [Borcard, D., Legendre, P., Drapeau, P., 1992. Partialling out the spatial component of ecological variation.
