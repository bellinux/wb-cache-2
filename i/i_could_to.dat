He {{had decided not to}} {{continue}} in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, [...] "Relegation was a failure and I felt I couldn’t quit then. I felt I had to do everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> put things right, if I was given the chance.

500|$|In early 1865, {{at the age}} of 13, Edgardo {{became a}} novice in the Canons Regular of the Lateran, adding the Pope's name to his own to become Pio Edgardo Mortara. He wrote {{repeatedly}} to his family, he recalled, [...] "dealing with religion and doing what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> convince them of the truth of the Catholic faith," [...] but received no reply until May 1867—his parents, who were now living in Florence, wrote that they still loved him dearly, but saw nothing of their son in the letters they had received. In July 1870, just before Edgardo turned 19, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn for good after the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Italian troops captured the city on 20 September 1870.|$|E
500|$|Motoki {{studied the}} art of encoffinment {{first-hand}} from a mortician, and assisted in an encoffining ceremony; he later stated that the experience imbued him with [...] "a sense of mission... to try to use as much human warmth as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> restore [...] to a lifelike presence for presentation to her family". Motoki then drilled himself by practising on his talent manager until {{he felt he had}} mastered the procedure, one whose intricate, delicate movements he compared to those of the Japanese tea ceremony. Takita attended funeral ceremonies to understand the feelings of bereaved families, while Yamazaki never participated in the encoffinment training. [...] Motoki also learned how to play a cello for the earlier parts of the film.|$|E

500|$|Taylor's {{high-profile}} {{verbal and}} physical clashes with Huff were well-noted. [...] "He was always hooting his mouth {{off on the}} field," [...] Huff said of Taylor. [...] "He'd tell me, 'Yeah, you're just a big talker.' He brought the best out in you. He was an unusual player, a great player, but an agitator ... I did everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> that sonofabitch." [...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after watching the game on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963. His offer was turned down, however.|$|E
500|$|Ricky Lee and Doug {{departed}} in June 1992 due {{to creative}} differences. According to Richard, Ricky Lee's tenure as lead vocalist was [...] "a bad time" [...] {{for the band}} given his opposition to Richard's opinions, although Richard was still surprised to hear of the brothers' departure, and said, [...] "I tried everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> get them to stay." [...] Ricky Lee, meanwhile, said that he [...] "was a country singer more than anything" [...] and wanted to eliminate most of the band's hard rock sounds. He and Doug then founded Brother Phelps, which had a more mainstream country sound than The Kentucky Headhunters did. Brother Phelps released two albums for Asylum Records and charted in the country top 40 with [...] "Let Go" [...] and [...] "Were You Really Livin'," [...] which peaked at number 6 and 28 respectively.|$|E

Carter confirmed to Gillian Reagan of Business Insider that in his research, he tried to gather information from multiple viewpoints. He said, [...] "I'm reaching out to everyone I possibly can to get every side of the story." [...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E

500|$|Questlove was the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of}} the Soulquarians' {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis {{about his role in}} recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating [...] "I tried to do all in my power that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You'd just come into [...] A Room, you don't even know who has a session, but you call me: 'Who's down there?' 'Common's in there today'. So you come down, you order some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it's, 'Let's play something'. And I say, 'Who wants this ?' And it would be, 'I want it!' 'No, I want it!'". Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E
500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated {{that she had}} no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, {{with the exception of the}} anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of American forces and of the [...] "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, [...] "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." [...] She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: [...] "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." [...] Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: [...] "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> expose the lies and help end the war." ...|$|E
500|$|The next month, Humphrey's rival Robert Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in Los Angeles, {{prompting}} the Vice-President {{to return to his}} home in Minnesota and [...] "think about the next stage." [...] Shaken by the event, Humphrey took off two weeks from campaigning. He met with President Johnson, and the two talked about [...] "everything" [...] during a three-hour meeting. The assassination all but guaranteed Humphrey the nomination. He commented that he [...] "was doing everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> win the nomination...but God knows I didn't want it that way." [...] A large number of Kennedy delegates switched to Humphrey, but he lost money from Republican donors concerned about a Kennedy nomination, and popular opinion polls shifted in favor of Senator McCarthy. In fact, Humphrey was booed before 50,000 people on June 24 at the Lincoln Memorial as he was introduced at a Solidarity March for civil rights. Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson described the response as ironic, given that Humphrey was booed at the 1948 Democratic National Convention after advocating a civil rights plank. He tried to defend his record against the liberal detractors, but often encountered anti-war protesters and hostile crowds while campaigning. At the end of June, Republican Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon assessed the race, arguing that Humphrey would be the party's nominee for president but criticized him for being too closely aligned with Johnson's policies. Humphrey asked for Johnson's permission to deviate from the administration's position on the war for a plan that included a bombing halt and drawback of forces, but Johnson refused, explaining that it would disrupt the peace process and endanger American soldiers. He relayed to Humphrey that the blood of his son-in-law who was serving in Vietnam, would be on his hands if he announced the new position.|$|E

2500|$|Managed by Newt Joseph, {{the team}} also {{included}} Byron [...] "Mex" [...] Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer and here I was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> get the ball {{up to the plate}} and get it over, maybe even for a strike.

For example, he deemed John Clarke, another Wilson appointee to the court, to be [...] "too liberal" [...] and refused to speak with him. Clarke made an early decision to leave the Court, and McReynolds's antipathy was a factor given by Clarke. However, another possible reason was his hope of an appointment by President Wilson as his representative to the nascent League of Nations, and writing to the President that {{he felt it was}} his [...] "duty to devote what might remain to me of life and health and strength to doing what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> cultivate public opinion in our country to having our government take some share in the effort which many other nations are making to devise some rational substitute for irrational war".
