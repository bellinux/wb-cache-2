5|$|After the {{university}} moved to Hamilton in 1930, {{the university}} petitioned Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh for {{a coat of}} arms.

In 1997 the Board of Governors introduced a simplified shield design, which recognized the tradition of McMaster’s heraldry while <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> print and electronic reproduction. The university's arms and badge was registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 October 2006.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{literature}} on role accumulation, researchers have also developed the concept of work-family enrichment. Greenhaus and Powell (2006) defined work-family enrichment as {{the degree to which}} the experiences in one role <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life in <b>the</b> other main life role. Enrichment involves a process whereby one role provides resources that <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> one’s experiences in another role. According to Greenhaus and Powell (2006) work-to-family enrichment occurs when work experiences <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> one’s family life, and family-to-work enrichment (the focus of the present study) occurs when family experiences <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> one’s work life.|$|R

The following year was consumed by another yellow fever outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, St. Joseph's, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.|$|E
5|$|Following Sledd's resignation, he and {{his family}} {{returned}} to Atlanta and stayed in the home of his wife's parents. Within a few weeks, he was appointed minister of the First Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, a position he held for the remainder of 1909 and the first half of 1910. Sledd was subsequently invited to return to Southern University as its president, serving from 1910 to 1914. While president of Southern University, he implemented a new pre-college preparatory school and a four-year course of Bible study, and focused his personal efforts on restoring the school's finances and <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> its instruction.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> light industrial goods. Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have a majority in the Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had a majority in the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E
5|$|The Princess {{production}} {{department of the}} Thanhouser Company started in 1913. It would have a film released on every Friday. Early Princess productions were mostly comedies that performed well, but the company's dramas were often unfavorable. The early Princess productions were marked by their poor scenarios that were illogically written or consisted of uninteresting material. Princess produced films out of a studio in New Rochelle from 1913 until 1915, when the production brand was changed and renamed Falstaff. The production and release of Across the Way occurred before Edwin Thanhouser returned and took personal interest in <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the productions at the New Rochelle studio. The new brand, Falstaff, would soon replace the Princess productions.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{staff at}} Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, {{as well as}} Russian, Korean and Mandarin {{for a number of}} titles. In 2016, Final Fantasy XV became the first major title from the company to release in Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Minor titles are occasionally localized from English to European languages. Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the original development teams, as was the case for Dragon Quest VII. Square also did not initially have a localization department, though a number of localizers such as Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis in the early 1990s. Moriyama described the work at the time as leaving very little leeway for polishing text due to the limitations of the ROM sizes. She also commented Hironobu Sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for the English version at that time. Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII, however, the company looked into <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> its translated products-the game was widely criticized for its rushed English translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. To that end, Square tasked Richard Honeywood, originally a programmer, with creating a dedicated localization team in the Tokyo headquarters. His first major project was Xenogears. While there were only two members at first, including Honeywood, the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007, and over 70 in 2015. The success of Final Fantasy VII also {{led to the creation of}} a London-based European office in 1998, which would handle marketing and quality assurance for the PAL market.|$|E
