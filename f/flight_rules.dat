5|$|Visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> on {{the river}} {{corridors}} by Manhattan {{have been subject to}} considerable debate since the 2006 New York City plane crash, in which New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle crashed into an apartment building while flying using visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> on the East River. This was the first aircraft collision over the Hudson River since 1976.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules)</b> are in effect and where IFR (instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules)</b> are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard for flying. Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the NTSB {{recommended}} that ATC controllers and supervisors be briefed {{in the circumstances}} of this accident; that a Special <b>Flight</b> <b>Rules</b> Area (SFRA) be established for the location requiring special training for pilots transiting the area; and that helicopters be required to operate at lower altitudes than airplanes in the corridor to minimize the speed differences.|$|E

LifeLine's fleet consists of one MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 and five Eurocopter EC 145 twin-engine helicopters {{with an average}} cruise speed of 150 miles per hour. Every aircraft is equipped with Garmin GNS530 Nav/Com/GPS systems, TAWS/TCAS, weather radar, night vision goggles, and satellite phone capabilities. LifeLine is also an instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (IFR) program which expands their response capabilities by enabling them to complete missions in weather conditions below visual <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (VFR) minimums.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted using a piloted, motion-base simulator to determine wake vortex hazard criteria for {{two classes of}} jet transport aircraft. A light business jet and a large multiengine jet transport were represented respectively. The hazard boundaries were determined {{in terms of the}} maximum bank angle due to the vortex encounter. Upsets as small as 7 deg in bank angle were considered to be hazardous at breakout altitude (200 ft (61. 0 m)) for Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (IFR) and at 50 ft (15. 2 m) for Visual <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (VFR) for both aircraft classes. Proximity to the ground was the primary reason for a hazardous rating. This was reflected in the reduction in the maximum bank angle at the hazard boundary and in more consistent ratings as altitude was decreased...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there is}} a long term plan to {{construct}} a third parallel runway. Designated 13-31, it will be located north of the cargo facilities, as well as Merle Haggard Drive. The runway is planned to be 8000 ft long and 150 ft wide. It will be widely spaced, which will allow for simultaneous Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (IFR).|$|R
5|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{reproduction}} of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind and fog are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time air traffic control (ATC) directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules),</b> which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules),</b> which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive flight instruments. External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane.|$|E
5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in the day, an FAA {{specialist}} {{had informed}} the crew {{that it would}} be illegal to land at night in Aspen under instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b> In addition, the crew were aware that due to noise abatement restrictions, their jet aircraft was required to land at Aspen by the 18:58 MST night curfew. Following the delayed departure from LAX, their estimated arrival time was 18:46 MST, twelve minutes before the curfew took effect.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1970 s, {{years before the}} Space Shuttle flew its maiden voyage, it was {{understood}} low liquid hydrogen (LH 2) Net Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP) at the inlet to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) could have adverse effects on engine operation. A number of failures within both the External Tank (ET) and the Orbiter Main Propulsion System (MPS) {{could result in a}} low LH 2 NPSP condition, which at extremely low levels can result in cavitation of SSME turbomachinery. Operational workarounds were developed {{to take advantage of the}} onboard crew s ability to manually throttle down the SSMEs (via the Pilot s Speedbrake/Throttle Controller), which alleviated the low LH 2 NPSP condition. Manually throttling the SSME to a lower power level resulted in an increase in NPSP, mainly due to the reduction in frictional flow losses while at the lower throttle setting. Early in the Space Shuttle Program s history, the relevant <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> for the Booster flight controller in Mission Control did not distinguish between ET and Orbiter MPS failures and the same crew action was taken for both. However, after a review of all Booster operational techniques following the Challenger disaster in the late 1980 s, it was determined manually throttling the SSME to a lower power was only effective for Orbiter MPS failures and the <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> was updated to reflect this change. The <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> and associated crew actions initially called for a single throttle step to minimum power level when a low threshold for NPSP was met. As engineers refined their understanding of the NPSP requirements for the SSME (through a robust testing program), the operational techniques evolved to take advantage of the additional capabilities. This paper will examine the evolution of the <b>Flight</b> <b>rule</b> and associated procedure and how increases in knowledge about the SSME and the Space Shuttle vehicle as a whole have helped shape their development. What once was a single throttle step when NPSP decreased to a certain low threshold has now become three throttle steps, each occurring at a lower NPSP threshold. Additionally the procedure, which for early Space Shuttle missions required a Return-to-Launch-Site abort, now results in a nominal Main Engine Cut Off and no loss of mission objectives...|$|R
50|$|For {{the pilots}} flying in {{accordance}} with visual <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> (VFR), it is significant to perform correct decision making for the weather as they have {{to stay within the}} specific VFR weather requirements. The pilot must make a ‘go’ or ‘no-go’ decision as to if he or she will embark on a flight and if they will continue on the flight when the weather deteriorates.|$|R
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Properly {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} able to fly through snowstorms under Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rules.</b> Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise {{the safety of the}} aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} received {{instructions to}} taxi to Runway 31L at 9:54 AM EST, and clearance {{to proceed to}} Los Angeles non-stop under instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (IFR) at 10:02 AM EST. Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 AM EST. Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions, the aircraft initiated a left turn to a heading of 290. In {{the course of the}} turn, at 1,600 feet, the Boeing banked too far, flipped past 90 degrees, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive.|$|E

40|$|Flying qualities {{criteria}} for Single Pilot Instrument <b>Flight</b> <b>Rule</b> (SPIFR) operations were investigated. The ARA aircraft was modified and adapted for SPIFR operations. Aircraft configurations to be flight-tested were chosen and matched on the ARA in-flight simulator, implementing {{modern control theory}} algorithms. Mission planning and experimental matrix design were completed. Microprocessor software for the onboard data acquisition system was debugged and flight-tested. Flight-path reconstruction procedure and the associated FORTRAN program were developed. Algorithms associated with the statistical analysis of flight test results and the SPIFR flying qualities criteria deduction are discussed...|$|R
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US Armed Forces to agree to both {{reduce the number of}} military aircraft operating under visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> in civilian air corridors, and to require military aircraft to contact civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{recently}} released new <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{a dream of}} imaging technology enthusiasts becomes reality: Visual guidance (VFR) of landing aircraft in adverse weather is no longer restricted by {{the performance of the}} human eye (measured as runway visual range, RVR). Based on the output of imaging sensors it is now allowed to continue the approach beyond the classical minimum decision altitude (MDA) or decision height (DH) down to about 100 ft whenever at DH or MDA the runway can be clearly identified within the sensor image. This rule change in aircraft operation will allow to conduct bad weather landings to non-ILS- equipped airfields and without an expensive on-board ILS installation. However, after this “quantum leap in <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> making” new questions are coming up: “How to inform the pilot what the imaging sensor just sees?” Usually, a (quite expensive) Head Up Display (HUD) is required to show the output of the sensed image, which is presented in a raster scan overlay onto the existing stroke vector image. Is this “direct overlay method”, which “blocks” the transparency of the HUD, really {{the best way to do}} this, or are there other options to make-up enhanced visual aircraft guidance concepts and systems? The following contribution tries to give some hints for answering these questions and proposes a more transparent EVS display format. A new method for extracting the aircraft position relative to the runway in real-time from the on-board imaging sources is presented. Finally, some experimental results from flight trials during the US-American SE-Vision project, where the described method has been implemented and tested, are explained...|$|R
