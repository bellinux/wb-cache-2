40|$|For a {{specific}} range of building and occupancy types, this report examines {{the effectiveness of}} automatic sprinkler systems installed in New Zealand and Australia. The {{aim of the research}} is to quantify the likelihood of a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire</b> occurring in sprinklered buildings. By deriving an annual probability of occurrence this can be compared with the accepted exceedance probabilities that exist for other limit state design actions for the design of steel structures. Comprehensive data collated for the entire history of sprinkler installations in New Zealand and Australia is analysed to obtain conditional probabilities that confirm the effectiveness of sprinklers to control fires. These probabilities correspond to the likelihood of <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire</b> occurring being classified as an extremely unlikely event. Passive fire protection is normally provided to protect a structure against a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire.</b> It is therefore suggested that certain types of structural steel frames in sprinklered buildings do not require passive fire protection to meet performance requirements of the Building Code. The performance of steel frames without fire protection when exposed to fire following earthquake is assessed in a probabilistic framework. The likelihood of damage to the steel frame is not very different for the scenario of fire without earthquake. This report also examines other aspects that affect sprinkler reliability, such as town main water supply, system isolation due to internal alterations and booster pump reliability. Most of these items do not have a major effect on sprinkler reliability. Current literature describing the performance of steel framed multi-level buildings when subjected to fully developed fires is reviewed. The favourable behaviour of these real frames in natural fires confirms that the consequences are not usually serious if steel members without passive fire protection are exposed to severe fires...|$|E

40|$|A {{full-scale}} fire experiment {{has been}} conducted on a typical Australian passenger train. In this experiment a train fire was allowed to become fully developed involving all combustible materials within the train. This paper focuses {{on the results of}} the <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire.</b> The experiment was conducted outside rather than in a tunnel. Measurements included temperatures, vent flows, heat flux and gas analysis. Observations were recorded. It was found that ceiling and upper wall linings are more critical for fire spread than seats and lower wall linings. The ignition source consisted of 1 kg of crumpled newspaper, the equivalent of a Saturday Melbourne newspaper, located on the floor, beneath a seat {{in one corner of the}} carriage interior. The <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire</b> went to flashover 140 s after ignition and spread inside the vehicle very rapidly, spreading to have involved all fitted materials by 175 s. This highlighted the very short evacuation time available for such an event. From 150 s large plumes of flame flowed out the side doors and a very high production of smoke was observed. After flashover the peak heat release rate was ventilation controlled. From this it is concluded that many common methods of estimating train fire heat release rate are not valid and that further research into ventilation of train fires is required. This experiment provides unique full scale data for a flashover fire on a furnished suburban rail carriage...|$|E

40|$|In general, {{because of}} the {{unpredictable}} nature of fire and the various uncertainties related, for example, to material properties at elevated temperature, the reliability of structural fire design can be justifiably questioned. In this project, a typical structural steel design for fire condition is assessed for its reliability. The assessment consists of estimating the probability of failure of structural steel elements exposed {{to a wide range}} of <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fires.</b> A number of scenarios to account for different passive protection systems and the variability in properties of related parameters are modelled. The main tool of analysis is Monte Carlo simulation using a software named @RISK. The estimated probabilities of failure or reliability indices are measured against acceptable or target values so that definite conclusion with regards to safe or unsafe design can be made. The target probability of failure and the reliability index are also worked out in this project. The overall results show that applying reliability assessment to structural fire design is of great value in pointing out shortcomings in the design and in enhancing the performance assessment of real structures...|$|R

Particular significance is attributed to fuel soot propensity (fuel soot yield) which is an intrinsic fuel property. This parameter controls the intensity of radiative heat exchange in the compartment, and its influence on flashover time is of paramount importance.

40|$|Fire design {{stakeholders}} such as architects, regulators, fire service, etc., {{often have}} different opinions about which {{passive fire protection}} approach is the most appropriate one in meeting structural fire performance objectives. There are many options for protecting steel buildings in a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire,</b> but there {{is the need to}} identify a strategy that could satisfy at best the different and sometimes conflictual stakeholder desires, thereby reducing design uncertainties. This paper proposes a three-stage approach to address this issue: (i) stakeholder engagement, to identify and extract stakeholder desires; (ii) decision analysis, and; (iii) risk-based parametric study. The paper focuses, in particular on the first two stages. The first stage describes the process of identification and extraction of stakeholder desires in steel structural fire design from literature and structured interviews through a stakeholder engagement plan. The second stage of the decision-making process is demonstrated using a simple stakeholder goal-rating and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). In particular, the use of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to manage the multiplicity of stakeholder desires towards common decision-criteria, manage possible inconsistent goal-rating, and to rank the different proposed passive fire protection options...|$|E

40|$|Design of {{multi-storey}} steel framed {{office and}} other commercial buildings for fire resistance {{has traditionally been}} undertaken {{on the premise that}} the building will suffer partial or total collapse unless the beams and columns are insulated from temperature rise under <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire</b> conditions. Since 1990, a growing body of evidence has shown that there is a substantial inelastic reserve of strength available from a typical composite steel beam/concrete floor slab system with uninsulated beams. An intensive research effort is underway in a number of countries {{to determine the extent of}} this reserve of strength and the mechanisms involved in its delivery. This research involves experimental testing and advanced finite element (FE) modelling. It is leading on to design procedure development to take account of the inelastic reserve of strength available from this type of building system. The most detailed experimental testing programme undertaken took place in 1995 and 1996 on an eight storey steel framed building at the former Cardington Large Building Test Facility in the UK.

40|$|Structural fire {{engineering}} {{has long}} {{relied on a}} prescriptive approach based on isolated member behavior under continuously heating standard fire. By definition, this approach does not allow comprehending the effects of interaction between members of a complete structure nor the effects of real fire exposure. Yet, such effects can have a significant influence on the response of real buildings to fire. Notably, when a structure has survived a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire,</b> the cooling phase that inevitably follows generates effects that may endanger the structure stability. This has been attested by real structural collapses and poses a specific threat to firefighters. However, the behavior of structures under natural fire and the causes of failure during cooling are still not well understood. This research investigates the response of steel-framed structures to natural fires with the aim to analyze the possible collapse mechanisms during cooling. Numerical simulations by nonlinear finite element method are conducted for different fire scenarios and structural designs. The simulations model the thermo-mechanical behavior of the frames accounting for the interaction between members during the entire fire duration until burnout. Different collapse mechanisms during cooling are highlighted and discussed, including connection failure and progressive collapse under localized fire. In the latter case, collapse of members not directly affected by the fire occurs during the cooling phase. These mechanisms result from a complex combination of several factors, such as the recovery of thermal elongation, the recovery of stiffness, and the prior development of permanent strains in the heated members. The results show that steel-framed structures are subject to collapse during the cooling phase of natural fires. Therefore, natural fires with heating-cooling sequences represent a loading case {{that should be considered}} in structural fire analyses and could lead to specific design provisions to prevent the occurrence of collapse during cooling.

40|$|Generally rail tunnels are not {{the cause}} of {{accidents}} except when the loss of their structures' integrity is the cause.

All over the world, important accidents have occurred, with or without victims and they widely justify the research projects such as EUREKA FIRETUN 499 (1) or MEMORIAL TUNNEL (2). Concerning rail tunnels, fires are frequently rolling-stocks fires. Many studies have been conducted on coach fires but few results are published on locomotive fires and their consequences (3).

Gas temperature is an important parameter to consider when designing the fire resistance of a tunnel structure.

The maximum possible excess gas temperature was set as 1350 °C, independent of the tunnel structure and local combustion conditions. As {{a result of this}} research, two models have been developed to better estimate possible excess maximum gas temperatures for large tunnel fires in tunnels with differing lining materials and structure types (e. g. rock, concrete). These have been validated using both model- and full-scale tests. Comparisons of predicted and measured temperatures show that both models correlate well with the test data. However, Model I is better and more optimal, {{due to the fact that}} it is more conservative and easier to use.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis under the title "Thermal models for fire safety – calculation of flame spread on surfaces and heating of structures" consist of two parts: flame spread on combustible surfaces and calculation of heating of structures. This work consists {{of the development of}} thermal models for Fire Safety purposes. The main objective of the present thesis work is to produce new information for fire safety related to the development of models for flame spread on surfaces and to develop engineering calculation methods in heating of structures. In the context of Fire Safety, the word "fire" means accidental unwanted fires. The primary goal in Fire Safety is to protect life and property. The research field is relatively young and multi-disciplinary. The growth rate of a fire depends on how fast the flame will spread and involve more burning surfaces. In an enclosure, the burning rate is enhanced due to feedback effects but it is still the increasing area of the fire that affect the flame size. In <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire,</b> as in enclosures, the availablilty of air limits the rate of heat release. Fire growth rate and the rate of heat release depend highly on how rapidly the initialized fire propagates on surfaces. Thus, it is the flame spread that controls the rate of heat release in large or open spaces. This shows the importance of modeling flame spread, due to its direct impact on fire safety. This first part of the work discusses upward surface flame spread on a combustible solid surface. The flame spread is a process of a moving flame in the vicinity of a pyrolysing region on the surface which acts as a fuel source. The flame itself results from the combustion in the atmosphere of the pyrolysed gases leaving the surface. The oxygen and fuel concentrations together with the heat transfer phenomena between the flame and the solid phase affect strongly the process. Flame spread models of various levels of complexity are developed. A novel thermal pyrolysis upward flame spread model is also developed to predict the fire growth of combustible charring wall linings. Heat release rate in fires is of primary importance. When a structure is present, a part of the calorific energy dissipated in the fire is fed back to the structure via thermal radiation and convection with consequence of raising its temperature. As the performance of structures decrease with the increasing of temperature, knowledge of temperature distribution within the structure it is important to estimate the safe-escape time for occupants, safe-operational time for firemen and fire resistance. It is therefore essential to model heat transfer in structures. In {{the second part of the}} thesis heating of structures and temperature calculations in solids are addressed. Efficient engineering temperature calculation algorithms for various fire heated structures are developed. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A fire in {{important}} cable tunnels inside power plants {{would lead to}} stoppage in production {{that could lead to}} big financial losses for the owners of the plant, which makes short restoration time very important. With the consequences of stoppage in mind, more focus has been directed to issues regarding fire protection of cable tunnels in the power plants. The purpose of this report is to provide a more comprehensive material to the ongoing investigations within Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB regarding fire protection within their power plants. It will also be used as material for future issues regarding insurance and new projects within Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB. The room that will serve as typical case for this investigation is a cable tunnel inside Harsprånget power plant. The cable tunnel is initially situated approximately 80 meters below ground level in direct connection with the power plant and contains 2 - 7 cable trays with a varied amount of cables on each tray. The cable tunnel then runs {{all the way up to}} ground level. One problem is that the cable tunnel system is more or less open through its whole geometry, which in case of fire in the lower regions could make the whole tunnel system filled with smoke. When adding the fact that the plant is unmanned for the most part, and it’s calculated to take at least 40 minutes before personnel has arrived at the scene in case of fire or other accident. All this makes a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>fire</b> very hard to handle. Calculations have been made regarding fire load and maximum heat release rate, and it has been stated that the cable tunnel has a high fire load from the many cable trays, which make oxygen the limiting factor. The cable tunnels closed space and the fact that it´s made of stone and concrete makes the inflow of oxygen very limited. The narrow, complicated geometry is expected to make it impossible for the fire to use all oxygen in the further regions of the tunnel system. This was later verified by simulations made with Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Different solutions for the fire protection have been analyzed to achieve a proper fire protection for the cable tunnel, and the use of an extinguishing system with water mist in combination with fire sections of the cable tunnel has been suggested to be the most effective solution for the fire protection. The use of fire sections contributes to create a more controllable volume for the extinguishing system. It will also erase the problem with the smoke filled cable tunnel system, which leads to an easier restoration. After consulting with experts within extinguishing system it has been stated that sections of 100 meters are suitable to handle for the system. Final set-up of the fire sections will vary depending on which plant referred to. Thanks to the high pressure within water mist systems vertical sections won´t be a problem. The set-up of the extinguishing system has finally ended up in two different protection levels, an increased protection level and a normal protection level. With the increased protection level the extinguishing system activates within a whole section using a fire detection system, the extinguishing system actives when a fire is indicated and the fire will be extinguished in an early stage. With the normal protection level the extinguishing system activates using heat sensitive bulbs that break at a certain temperature. This activation method needs some temperature build up (for example 57 or 68 °C bulbs can be used), and by that time the fire has already started. Affected cables have a higher risk of losing their functionality and needing replacing. Validerat; 20140131 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

At NBS, Babrauskas developed the cone calorimeter which incorporated the new {{oxygen consumption}} calorimetry and moved it through adoption as an ASTM test method.

It is of note that Babrauskas in his study of <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> compartment <b>fires</b> as part of his thesis work at UC Berkeley had recognized the constancy of the heat release per unit oxygen consumed (Babrauskas 1976).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} into the use of advanced finite element analysis {{as part of a}} performance based structural fire engineering design for a multi-storey steel framed building in New Zealand. The building is a multi-storey steel framed building with long span cellular beams supporting composite concrete floor slabs. As part of the building design, the secondary steel beams and composite columns of the structure are proposed to be unprotected. A series of advanced finite element analysis using the SAFIR finite element programis carried out to test the robustness of structure without passive fire protection for the secondary beams and composite columns. The numerical modelling features thermal modelling of the structural elements and 3 D structural modelling of the heated elements to test the behaviour of the long span beams under realistic compartment fires. The analysis utilizes non-linear temperature dependent materials to consider realistic behaviour of the structural response under a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> compartment <b>fire,</b> including the rapid thermal loading during flashover and the cooling phase of the fire. The analysis is able to consider the different realistic structural responses {{during the course of the}} fire including contraction during the cooling phase and lateral buckling of the cellular beams in fire. This paper shows how such an analysis can be applied by consulting engineers on a realistic building design to demonstrate a robust design for a steel framed building with unprotected structural elements whilst providing savings with reduced amount of fire protection to the structure...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the present study is to explore and {{validate}} the efficiency and accuracy of the predictive capability of CFD models for <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> natural <b>fires</b> in large compartments. The FDS CFD software was used to simulate three large-scale fire tests. The fire tests (nine in total) had been carried out in 1993 at Cardington UK, in collaboration with BRE/FRS and CORUS (British Steel at that time). The main parameters of the three chosen large-scale fire tests are the compartment's dimensions, the fire load, the ventilation opening, and the ignition type. The duration of the fire tests, starting from the ignition until the extinction of the fire, was between 70 - 120 min and the fire source was wooden cribs. The simulations were in full time and full scale. The FDS model solves numerically the well known Navier-Stokes equations with emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires. It uses a mixture fraction combustion model assuming that combustion is mixing controlled, and that the reaction of fuel and oxygen is infinitely fast. Turbulence is treated by means of the Smagorinsky form of Large Eddy Simulation, while thermal radiation is computed using a finite volume technique. Despite the assumptions made and the complex phenomena involved, the correlation between the computational and experimental results was in very good agreement. The fire spread was modelled accurately and the difference for the peak temperatures was 5 %- 20 %. However the results are sensitive to some input parameters and so each fire scenario should be treated individually for a robust and accurate solution...|$|R

40|$|Use of the temperature-dependent, thermophysical {{material}} properties, shape geometry, {{and fundamental}} heat transfer and structural principles, {{in combination with}} available fire test data, can enable several distinct levels of engineering/calculation methods of fire resistance. The simpler computational methods, {{such as those in}} ASCE/SFPE 29 - 99, 1 are semi-empirically based on standard fire test results. They provide an efficient and generally conservative way to provide fire resistance ratings for members and assemblies that do not directly match listed assemblies to meet prescriptive code requirements. Higher order fire simulations and structural analyses can also be used as performance-based design alternatives to achieve a more accurate solution to overall fire safety. Substantial fire-induced damage is expected after a severe (<b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> or postflashover) <b>fire</b> exposure, not only to the building contents and finish but also to the structural elements. It is not uncommon for well-designed, ductile, and properly functioning fire-resistive framing systems to experience visible distortions, cracking, permanent damage, and deflections in floor, walls, or columns than can be on the order of 12 to 24 inches (300 to 600 mm), or more, without collapse. In the following sections, several computational approaches to the determination of the fire resistance of building construction are summarized, independent of any requirements of a particular building code or design standard. These can be considered generally applicable to any structural material. The specific provisions of the governing building code and design standard(s) for a given project must be consulted for any engineering applications...|$|R
