60|$|Friday, November 9th.--Rain, as yesterday, till 10 o'clock, {{when we took}} a boat to row {{down the}} lake. The day improved,--clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains. In the large bay under Place Fell, three {{fishermen}} were dragging a net,--picturesque group beneath the high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft: not hovering like the kite, for {{that is not the}} habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward perseverance, and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters were agitated; and the iron tone of the raven's voice, which strikes upon the ear at all times as the more dolorous from its regularity, was in fine keeping with the wild scene before our eyes. This carnivorous fowl is a great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes; I recollect frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from the church-yard gates of H----, for which a reward of so much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer.--The fishermen drew their net ashore, and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They were all of the kind called skellies, a sort of fresh-water herring, shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm weather. This species is not found, I believe, in any other of these lakes; nor, as far as I know, is the chevin, that spiritless fish, (though I am loth to call it so, for it was a prime favourite with Isaac Walton,) which must frequent Ullswater, as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river Eamont. Here are no pike, and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes, and of inferior quality; but the <b>grey</b> <b>trout</b> attains a very large size, sometimes weighing above twenty pounds. This lordly creature seems to know that 'retiredness is a piece of majesty;' for it is scarcely ever caught, or even seen, except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning season, and runs up into the streams, where it is too often destroyed in disregard of {{the law of the land}} and of Nature.|$|E

Other names for it include mackinaw, lake char (or charr), touladi, togue, and <b>grey</b> <b>trout.</b> In Lake Superior, {{it can also}} be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.|$|E
