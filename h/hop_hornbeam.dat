40|$|Background and Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} measuring wood and leaf mass {{above the ground}} level of <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> shrubs (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.). An {{important part of the}} study describes the development of models for quick and reliable estimation of biomass in forest ecosystems. Materials and Methods: The research was done and samples collected on seaside slopes of Velebit, the area of the Obrovac forestry, on experimental subplots 1 and 2, Jesenice management unit, department 41. Biomass of wood and leaves was measured separately as weight and volume. Independable estimators were the diameter of the sprout, the height of the sprout and the diameter of the crown. The weight of wood and leaves was measured in kg, volume in m 3, diameter of the sprout in cm, height of the sprout and crown diameter in m. General linear modelling was used {{for the development of the}} model. Results: The volume of wood in shrubs varied from 18. 07 to 65. 22 m 3 /ha, the volume of leaves from 5. 75 to 13. 70 m 3 /ha. The volume depends on the degradation stage of the shrub, that is the dimensions of the units composing it, their number in the area, entity and the manner of grouping, and the intrinsic value of site. The results show that wood and leaf mass in <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> shrubs are in particularly strong linear dependence on diameter of the sprout, height of the sprout and crown diameter. Linear regression coefficient between the volume, as well as the weight of the wood and the diameter of the sprout,was 0. 920 at 30 cm height above the ground level, and 0. 898 between the volume, as well as the weight of the leaves and the crown of the sprout. Conclusions: The biomass above the ground level in <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> shrubs can at best be estimated by univariate regression analysis on the basis of sprout diameter, although this regression model yields nearly equal results if based on the height of the sprout and the diameter of the crown. Multivariate regression models do not give much better results than the univariate model, especially by the diameter of the sprout as the best independable estimator, where the values are nearly equal...|$|E

40|$|Unusual and {{extensive}} dieback of European <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> (Ostrya carpinifolia) {{has been observed}} in western Slovenia and northern Italy in recent years, when extreme drought and higher temperatures were recorded. A preliminary study identified Botryosphaeria dothidea as a potential causative agent of the dieback. Further characterization of intra- and interspecies diversity of Botryosphaeriaceae collected from O. carpinifolia and other tree species in the affected area was achieved based on anamorph morphology, sequence data from the ITS rDNA and EF 1 -α, PCR–RFLP analysis and AFLP profiles. The majority of the isolates analyzed were identified as B. dothidea, and in vitro pathogenicity tests re-confirmed the fungus {{to be an important}} cause of the disease. Insight into the B. dothidea population, diversity based on AFLP markers indicates that the dieback observed in O. carpinifolia is probably associated with a heterogenous population of B. dothidea, which emerged from a latent state in response to changed climate conditions. Isolates with Dothiorella-like conidia were also identified during the survey, but these were collected more rarely and appear to represent undescribed species.

Iako su već istraživane (Rac 1995) u fitocenološkom smislu je izostala cjelovita analiza i usporedba s ostalim područjima Hrvatske. Zajednica je predstavljena s deset snimaka načinjenih u očuvanijim i suvislijim kompleksima na približno 250 ha njezina rasprostranjenja i nadmorskim visinama od 700 do 900 m. Ukupno su registrirane 84 vrste, prosječno po snimci 41, a njihova sociološka pripadnost relativno je složena, što su pokazala i prijašnja istraživanja na Biokovu (Trinajstić 1983, 1987). U odnosu na biokovske sastojine zabilježene su 54 nove vrste, a izostaje 46, među njima Pulmonaria visianii i Lonicera alpigena izdvojene kao svojstvene vrste asocijacije. U sloju drveća dominira Abies alba, podstojno i Ostrya carpinifolia, a u sloju grmlja pridolaze 34 vrste, bujnošću dominiraju one termofilne svojstvene za red Quercetalia pubescentis.

Only five relevés {{have been published in}} scientific literature. Since the floral composition has not been analyzed and compared in more detail, the studied phytocoenosis is insufficiently known. Phytocoenological research was conducted following the classical principles of the Braun-Blanquet School (1964). Forests of fir with <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> were presented on the basis of ten relevés from the Vinodol area and five from Biokovo. Plant nomenclature was adjusted according to Ehrendorfer (1973), while plant-sociological affiliation and biological form of the species were based on the work generally used for this purpose. Phytocoenological research into the stands of the community Ostryo-Abietetum in Vinodol showed syntaxonomic affiliation in the sense of Marinček et al. (1993) in accordance with international syntaxonomic rules (Weber et al. 2000). A total of 84 species were registered in ten phytocoenological relevés. On average, there were 41 species per relevé. Abies alba prevails in the dominant layer, Ostrya carpinifolia in the intermediate layer and thermophilic species of the order Quercetalia pubescentis in the shrub layer. The layer of herbaceous vegetation is dominated by the species of the order Fagetalia and the alliance Aremonio-Fagion and by the thermophilic species Sesleria autumnalis. The forest phytocoenosis of fir with <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> occurs over approximately 250 ha in the study area (Racić 2001). Compared to past phytocoenological relevés of this community in Croatia, 54 new species have been registered. Those of mesophilic character and beech forests prevail, which completes the knowledge of the phytocoenosis Ostryo-Abietetum. In relation to the stands on Biokovo, 46 species of predominantly thermophilic character are absent, including Lonicera alpigena and Pulmonaria visianii, which were initially classified as characteristic species of the association. The species Hepatica nobilis, with frequent presence of sessile oak in the tree layer, occurs abundantly in Vinodol stands.

40|$|The Mediterranean area in Croatia is characterised by geomorphological, relief, climatic, pedological and vegetational synecological factors. Apart from {{autochthonous}} (climatozonal) species, a {{large number}} of alochthonous (foreign) species were introduced for the purpose of carrying out ameliorative operations in degraded sites and meeting the horticultural and landscape objectives. Unfortunately, unfamiliarity with biological-ecological properties of foreign species gave rise to a number of mistakes in terms of the choice of species. Horticulturally, the introduced species frequently failed to fulfil the desired aesthetic and composition effects. However, there were also situations in which the newly introduced species adapted exceptionally well to the new conditions and developed far beyond expectations, suppressing the autochthonous vegetation from its original areas. Wherever possible, autochthonous vegetation should be favoured over aloththonous vegetation because the former is already well adapted to the environmental and habitat conditions. The possibilities and quality of autochthonous species as elements of urban vegetation in the Mediterranean are still insufficiently utilised. The auto-chthonous floral elements have, apart from their decorative-aesthetic values (the qualities shared with the alochthonous species), a historical-traditional value. For this reason old plantations of autochthonous species in urban areas should be replaced with the same (or similar) autochthonous ones. The Croatian insular, coastal and hinterland areas are inhabited by {{a large number}} of mainly evergreen autochthonous species. The warmer eu-Mediterranean belt is characterised by the following interesting species: holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), laurustinus (Viburnum tinus L.), privet (Phillyrea latifolia L., Phillyrea media L.), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis L.), common myrtle (Myrtus communis L.), Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus L.), cyprus (Cupressus sempervirens L.), juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus L.), Juniperus macrocarpa Sibth.

In the area, partially deforested in 2006, cattle, sheep and goats were introduced in the summer of 2007. A monitoring programme for plant populations was performed focusing on four target species typical of the karst dry grasslands: Rock Knapweed Centaurea rupestris, Green-winged Orchid Orchis morio, Toothed Orchid Orchis tridentata and Mountain Pasqueflower Pulsatilla montana. Three exotic invasive species, detrimental to grazing, were also included: Tree of Heaven Ailanthus altissima, Narrow-leaved Ragwort Senecio inaequidens and Common Ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia. For each species, the GPS position was taken both for individuals and large groups of plants; a count of the individuals present at each measured point was performed too. In order to verify the process of re-colonization by species of calcareous dry grasslands, phytosociological relevés were carried out in areas previously occupied by Black Pine (Pinus nigra) plantations, woods with Downy Oak (Quercus pubescens) and <b>Hop</b> <b>Hornbeam</b> (Ostrya carpinifolia) and thermophilous scrub of Common Juniper (Juniperus communis), documented from vegetation maps made in 2005. For each vegetation type 6 permanent plots were selected, in which phytosociological relevés were carried out to. The study shows that in the areas of the original karst dry grassland more widely distributed species typical of the habitat remain. In overgrazed areas the grassy turf is discontinuous, segetal terophytic species of the class Stellarietea mediae entering into the gaps. Cover of the Musk Thistle (Carduus nutans) has increased significantly, as spiny species are not palatable to animals. The occasional presence of neophytes such as Daisy Fleabane (Erigeron annuus) and Canadian Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) was also found. In undergrazed areas, however, the natural processes of succession and scrubbing over are taking place. In the areas formerly occupied by pine plantations and woods with Quercus pubescens and Ostrya carpinifolia, Autumn Moor Grass (Sesleria autumnalis) and Rock Tor-grass (Brachypodium rupestre) are still able to become covered by a compact herbaceous sward.

In this paper we used the intermediate-complexity multi-species model TreeMig to examine whether different realisations of future climate influences with the same temporal mean and the same interannual variability cause fundamental differences in simulated migration. We assume that the impact of interannual climate variability becomes most apparent in situations which critically influence regeneration and survival. Such situations arise, for example, when species' sensitivities to climate, competition and spatial fragmentation interact. We therefore developed an illustrative and realistic simulation setup representing this situation. We simulated the northwards migration of the sub-Mediterranean tree species Ostrya carpinifolia Scop. (European <b>Hop</b> <b>Hornbeam)</b> through the highly fragmented and climatically heterogeneous landscape of the Swiss Alps. Situations critically influencing regeneration and survival can lead to low species' abundances. Before investigating effects of interannual climate variability, we therefore tested whether the continuous representation of species' cell populations in TreeMig, which allows for infinitesimal population densities, can have side effects on simulated migration. Specifically, we tested for effects of minimum density thresholds, i. e. thresholds below which a species is treated as absent. We found that small threshold s in the magnitude of one individual per km(2) cell have a considerable impact on simulated migration, and can even impede migration in situations critical for regeneration and survival. To test for effects of interannual climate variability, we compared simulation results from multiple repetitions driven by different annual climate time series generated stochastically from the same probability distribution. Results from these repetitions were additionally compared to results from simulations driven by cyclically repeated climate and steadily applied mean climate, respectively. These comparisons were conducted for different species parameter sets within the plausible parameter range of O. carpinifolia to account for potential interactions between species' sensitivities and the environment. Simulated tree species' migration was highly dependent on the species parameters applied and markedly influenced by interannual climate variability. Notable divergence in species' spread resulted amongst multiple realisations of annual climate time series stochastically sampled from the same probability distribution. We conclude that uncertainty associated with interannual climate variability has to be accounted for. Single realisations can be insufficient and mean value simulations as well as averages of output results can be too simplistic to reflect possible outcomes of tree species' migration.

40|$|Sopotski slap smješten je oko 3 km sjeveroistočno od sela Sošice u Parku prirode Žumberak – Samoborsko gorje. Strmo se obrušava niz 40 metara kaskada uz stari mlin i sastavni je dio toka Kupčine. Područje Sopotskog slapa i gornjeg toka Kupčine do sada nisu bili floristički i vegetacijski sustavno istraživani. Terenska istraživanja vršena su tijekom 2009. i 2010. godine. Ovim preliminarnim istraživanjem zabilježene su ukupno 204 biljne svojte od kojih su, prema IUCN kategorizaciji, dvije kritično ugrožene vrste (CR) – Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. i Tofieldia calyculata (L.) Wahlenb., jedna ugrožena vrsta (EN) – Eriophorum latifolium, i pet osjetljivih svojti (VU) – Carex panicea L., Ophrys fuciflora Haller, O. insectifera L., Orchis purpurea Huds., Helleborus niger L. subsp. macranthus (Freyn) Schiffner i jedna gotovo ugrožena vrsta (NT) – Cephalanthera damasonium (Mill.) Druce. Na istraživanom području dokumentirana su i dva tipa ugroženih staništa: elementi vegetacije niskog, bazofilnog creta suhoperke (Eriophoro-Caricetum paniceae Horvat 1964), te (polu) suhi kontinentalni travnjaci razreda Festuco-Brometea Br. -Bl. et R. Tx. 1943 (as. Seslerietum kalnikensis Horvat 1942), stanište bogato različitim značajnim vrstama otvorenih staništa, naročito kaćunima. Oba staništa su ugrožena zaraštavanjem i nedostatkom ekstenzivne ispaše i u odmaklom su stadiju sukcesije prema šumskim zajednicama što vodi nestanku mnogih, a posebno navedenih ugroženih vrsta s ovog područja. The Sopot {{waterfall}} is {{the biggest}} waterfall in the Nature park Žumberak - Samoborsko gorje, situated about 3 km NW from the village Sošice. So far, there were no methodical investigations of flora or vegetation {{in the area around}} the Sopot waterfall and along the upper flow of the brook Kupčina. The initial research was carried out in the summer and autumn of the year 2009 and in the spring and early summer of the year 2010. Plant species found on the research area were recorded during every field trip and the herbarium samples were taken for later identification of some plant taxa. For better recommendations how to protect different habitats the study area was divided into 3 subareas; subarea 1 - the waterfall area, subarea 2 – the area of the brook Kupčina, which flows through small canyon and subarea 3 – the area of upper flow of the brook Kupcina, located in small dale, where few water streams appear and form more or less unitary stream of the brook Kupcina. In our preliminary study we recorded in total 204 plant species, out of which according to IUCN categorization, two critically endangered (CR) : Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. and Tofieldia calyculata (L.) Wahlenb., one endangered (EN) : Eriophorum latifolium Hoppe, one near threatened (NT) : Cephalanthera damasonium (Mill.) Druce and four vulnerable (VU) : Carex panicea L., Helleborus niger L. subsp. macranthus (Freyn) Schiffner, Ophrys fuciflora Haller and Ophrys insectifera L. In the researched area 44 species were protected and 15 strictly protected by the Croatian law. The research showed that subarea 1 has a different type of habitat than subareas 2 and 3. The subarea 1 is covered with beech and <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> forest (Ostryo-Fagetum M. Wraber ex Trinajstic 1972) and we assume that it should be left to spontaneous natural development, because it does not show any signs of endangerments. On the subareas 2 and 3 we recorded two endangered habitats: elements of flat, basophilous, rich fen with bog cotton (Eriophoro-Caricetum paniceae Horvat 1964) and (semi) dry continental grasslands from Festuco-Brometea Br. -Bl. et R. Tx. 1943 (as. Seslerietum kalnikensis Horvat 1942) class, which are the habitats rich with many significant species of open habitats, especially with orchids. Both habitats are endangered by overgrowing and lack of extensive pasture and they are in advanced stage of succession towards wood associations, why we consider {{that it is necessary to}} try to stop the succession in progress. At first it would be necessary to remove the woody vegetation which endangers the rich fen and grassland vegetation beside the brook, and later on, it is important to periodically organize mowing or intensive pasture in that area...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{fires in}} the Alps can have severe impacts on {{mountain}} forests reducing their protection capacity against rock falls and avalanches and increasing flood runoff, mud and debris flows (Moody and Martin 2001, Robichaud et al. 2007). Due to climate change, several {{studies have shown that}} the impact of forest {{fires in the}} Alpine environment will increase in the coming decades (Elkin et al. 2013, Lorz et al. 2010, Wastl et al. 2012). A key issue in modern forest fire management is the accurate mapping of forest fuels in order to determine spatial fire hazard, plan mitigation efforts, and active fire management (Krasnow et al. 2009). Several surface fuel description systems are currently used by land management agencies in the USA, Europe, Canada and Australia, and most of these systems have the same categories, components and description variables (Sandberg et al. 2001, Scott and Burgan 2005). A generalized description of fuels based upon average fuel properties is called a “fuel model”. A fuel model is a set of fuelbed inputs (e. g. load, bulk density, fuel particle size, heat content and moisture of extinction) used by a specific software for predicting the fire behaviour (e. g. FARSITE). Standard fuel models were developed in the USA by Anderson (1982) and more recently by Scott and Burgan (2005). Standard fuel models that fit the main local vegetation characteristics can be used as input for fire spread modelling and in combination with custom fuel models when available (Duguy et al. 2007, Arca et al. 2009, Jahdi et al. 2015). However, the Standard or custom fuel models have seldom been applied in the Alps. In this study we tested the possibility of defining some custom fuel models for the Eastern Italian Alps, which might allow a more reliable fire behaviour prediction when fire simulator systems are used. The custom fuel models definition was done by means of three steps: In the first step we studied local fire regime and fire behaviour and we tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. In the second step fuel properties were measured in the field and analyzed. In the third step we made three fuel model sets based on three different approaches (Forest type association, Prometheus classification, Cluster classification). Then, using FARSITE (Finney 2004), we simulated ten fires that occurred in the Veneto Region from 2003 to 2013. Every fire was simulated using the three custom model sets and the Standard fuel models (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005). Lastly, the fuel model set having the higher accuracy was adjusted in order to improve its performance in simulating real fire behaviour. In the Veneto Region, there was a decreasing number of fires per year from 1981 to 2004 and a much more evident decrease in the annual burned area. Fires in both mountain areas and the lowlands usually behave as surface fires and the burned area is seldom larger than ten hectares. We tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. The power-law distribution of burned areas seems to confirm that suppression efficiency has been improved because the exponent of the power-law distribution was much higher in the last decade than in the previous two. In mountain areas fuel load paralleled what is reported in the literature for similar forests, but in the lowlands fuel load appeared much higher, probably because those forests are affected by phytosanitary problems that cause a higher amount of deadwood. We found significant differences in fuel load among vegetation types (chestnut, <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> forests, conifer plantations and shrubland), The most significant difference was litter load (p< 0. 001 in the lowlands; p= 0. 0015 in mountain areas). Significant differences were also found between forest managements (coppiced, high forest, unmanaged). Mainly shrubs load (p< 0. 0018 in the lowlands) and herbs (p= 0. 0029 in mountain areas). The fuel distribution in size classes was never normal but, as commonly reported in the literature, it followed a logarithmic or a power-law trend. The tests on fire behaviour fuel models showed that Prometheus and Cluster fuel model sets led to inaccurate fire behaviour predictions. Standard fuel models (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005) generally performed well and Forest type fuel models were the best in predicting fire behaviour, despite a frequent underestimation of flame height and rate of spread. By using a calibration process, we modified the Forest type fuel models and improved the performance in FARSITE. The resulting Calibrated fuel models could be suggested for further fire behaviour applications in the Eastern Italian Alps. ...|$|E
40|$|Slope {{instability}} and {{erosion of the}} soil by water and wind are major environmental hazards. Although they {{are the result of}} natural geomorphological processes, they are both affected by and have consequences for human activity, often incurring economic and social damage. In nature, vegetation is one factor maintaining equilibrium in the landscape between the destructive forces of landscape {{instability and}} the constructive or regenerative forces of stability. The risk of slope failures and erosion is enhanced when the vegetation cover is removed. The question is whether the situation can be repaired if the vegetation cover is restored. The use of vegetation for slope stabilization and erosion control can be referred to as bioengineering. Biotechnical engineering refers to techniques where vegetation is combined with inert structures such as crib walls, so combining the structural benefits both the vegetative, usually Salix species, and non vegetative components. In Europe (especially in Germany, Switzerland and Austria) and in USA, pioneers have been using bioengineering and biotechnical engineering techniques for many decades. In Italy, the bioengineering has spread from the Südtirol by Dr. Schiechtl and in the last twenty years {{in the rest of the}} country. In particular, areas of Tuscany coast, hills and mountains ones have undergone major events of hydrogeological instability. In fact, this study regards the area of Cardoso valley in Alta Versilia. In this area, more of 200 bioengineering works were realized since 1996. A survey of these works has revealed that Salix species were not survived and often substituted by other species. Therefore, the first goal of research was to identify the most frequent species found in this area and suitable for areas of Mediterranean environments. Another goal was to assess a protocol of propagation in cold greenhouse, available in the field, and the biotechnical characteristics or the plants in a bioengineering work. For the purpose, a small forest nursery was designed in Retignano and a simple palisade was realized in Pontemazzori, where three wood species plants (Ostrya carpinifolia, Fraxinus excelsior, Alnus glutinosa) were compared to Salix sp. plants. Increasing of biotechnical characteristics such as root volume, root:shoot volume or weight ratio, adventitious roots from stem nodes, tensile strength of roots, were investigated using Azospirillum brasilense Sp 245. This bacterium is a well-known PGPR (plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria) and has been considered in order to evaluate the effects on the nursery propagation, and especially to test the ability of the inoculated bacterium to improve rooting parameters for some wood species, which do not easily root by means of conventional techniques. Nursery trials, field trials, growth observations of the wood plants were performed along four years, from 2010 to 2014. The nursery trials were executed in a cold greenhouse (propagation) and in an unconventional nursery; cuttings were collected from trees in the wood and plant material furnished by the nurseries as well. All willow cuttings rooted with and without treatment; on the contrary the other species cuttings produced sometimes, only a callus at the base (ash and hornbeam) or few roots (alder). IBA and bacterium treatments did not increase enough the rooting potential of plants so to make valid their use in nurseries. The starch analyses of plant material revealed that willow cuttings had a greater content of this compound, while the cuttings of the other species showed much lower content of starch, in particular ash and hornbeam. Nursery trials in pot showed that the root systems of the treated plants had grown more, but no cells of Azospirillum brasilense were found inside the examined tissues, suggesting that the observed inoculation effects did not depend on the penetration of the bacterial cells inside the plants. Physiological and growth measures (chlorophyll index, fresh and dry weight of epigeous and hypogeal portions, shoot growth) confirmed a positive influence, whether in pots or in field, showing that the growth of roots was in general higher in inoculated plants and plant mortality decreased. The stomatal conductance of the leaves of the treated plants was lower than the control, suggesting an increased resistance of the treated plants to drought stress. In the bioengineering work of Pontemazzori, the excavation by airspade confirmed that willow cuttings developed many roots from the underground nodes; plants of common alder, ash and <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> produced few and smaller roots from nodes, maybe due to the power of the main root system. Therefore, the shoots of these plants showed a lower number but a higher length when treated with the bacterium, significantly in alder. Uprooting resistance was lowest in saplings of Alnus sp. and Salix sp., intermediate in Ostrya carpinifolia, and highest in Fraxinus sp.; there was the evidence that Azospirillum brasilense Sp 245 treatment increased that resistance in willow and ash plants. In conclusion, some of the species tested, like Fraxinus sp. and Alnus sp., could substitute the willow cuttings in bioengineering works in Mediterranean contests, but using only rooted plant. Therefore the possibility that Azospirillum brasilense Sp 245 treatment could induce greater or more rapid development of the root system and systemic resistance to abiotic stresses in plants could be of great importance, whether in nursery propagation or better in bioengineering works...|$|E
40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating soil {{degradation}} processes. In temperate climate regions, soil erosion rarely assumes excessive proportions. In the management of forest soil, the potential erosion threat drastically increases with an increase in climate aridity. Water erosion is particularly favored by parent materials of low water permeability and by soils derived from such materials. In theMediterranean and sub-Mediterranean area of Croatia, these are primarily flysch, marl and Werfen schists. These materials show good physical weathering properties, thus providing a rich source of erosion material. As a rule, the soil formed from such parentmaterial is of silty-clayey to clayey texture, and has a relatively low infiltration capacity. The soil unprotected by vegetation (burned sites) manifests particularly devastating forms of water-induced erosion. In the past 50 years, flysch terrains of Istria have been subjected to a series of technical, biological and biological- technical treatments aimed at preventing water erosion and recovering the eroded soils. An experimental (research) site was set up in Abrami near Buzet for the purpose of monitoring erosion processes and rehabilitation effects of different biological-technical and biological methods of eroded area recovery. The effects of the treatments on soil properties in the research site are in the form of progressive pedogenetic processes. Asynergy of the effects of recovery methods and different natural conditions (relief, vegetation) in the experimental site is particularly well reflected in erosion indicators, such as the production of erosion sediment (erosion production), and to a lesser extent, the surface flow index. For this reason, research in this work focuses primarily on soil properties and erosion production dynamics. From the geological-lithological aspect, the research site of Abrami is made up of Eocene flysch composed of alternate layers of light grey marl and dark lime sandstone, i. e. thinner or thicker interbeds of sandy limestone. The climate is sub-Mediterranean. The mean annual temperature is 12 °C and the mean annual precipitation is 975 mm. The natural potential vegetation in the localities is represented by the community of <b>hop</b> <b>hornbeam</b> and autumn moor grass. Established in 1956 on the slope exposed to highly pronounced erosion processes, the research site has an area of 23. 46 ha. Aseries of technical and biological erosion recovery measures had been undertaken in the site by 1963 for the purpose of investigating their applicability in practice. Technical activities included the construction of step-like terraces, of the bench terrace type (»gradoni«), and contour rustic walls. Avariety of plant material was planted and seeds of different plant species were sown in the area (Table 1). Several control plots were also established in parts of the Abrami site, where either no treatment was applied or the seedlings were planted into the planting holes. Six plots intended for the measurement of erosion sediment production were established in 1969, followed by research into the quantitative erosion indicators, which started in 1970 (Table 1). After an interruption in 1977, measurements were resumed in 1997 and 1998 (two plots) and in 1999 (three plots). Erosion indicators have continuously been measured since 2000; however, measurements in plot I (plot I was omitted from this research due to its specific features) have been performed by means of terrestrial photogrammetry. The seventh plot was established in 2004, and has been the subject of measurements since 2005. This work encompasses measurement data from 2005, 2006 and 2007. The research includes plots II, III, IV,V, aswell asVI and VII. The soil and organic residues were sampled in the immediate surroundings of the erosion-measuring plots. Next to the plots in which no technical recovery measures were undertaken, a pedological profile was opened and the soil was sampled by horizons. Some smaller plots of 50 x 50 cm were used to sample the forest floor in 3 points next to the plots (near the top, in the middle of the slope and near the bottom). Undisturbed soil from the depth of 0 - 5 cm was cylinder-sampled in these smaller plots. The soil profiles next to the terraced plots were not sampled. The forest floor was sampled in small 50 x 50 cm plots, particularly those established on the slopes and on the top of the bench terraces. After the removal of the forest floor, the soil in the small plots was sampled with a probe (disturbed soil) to a 10 cmdepth, and with a cylinder (undisturbed soil) to a 5 cmdepth. The granulometric soil composition was determined according to HRN ISO 11277 : 2004, the pH according to HRN ISO 10390 : 2005, the CaCO 3 content according to HRN ISO 10693 : 2004, organic carbon (TOC) according to HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, porosity according to HR ISO 11508 and 11272 2004, water retention capacity according to HRN ISO 11461 : 2001, air capacity according to HRN ISO 11580 and 11272 : 2004, and soil water permeability according to HRN ISO 17312 : 2005. Measurements of erosion parameters were based on the cumulative measurement of runoff and erosion sediment for each particular rain event (in some cases several rain events were measured cumulatively). Water with eroded particles was determined in the field by measuring water levels in retention basins and/or tubs. The total quantity of erosion sediment in the collected waterwas determined according to theHRNISO 4365 standard. Rain events were registered in the site itself with a pluviograph within the meteorological station of Abrami. In converting the erosion production mass into volume, the average erosion sediment density was assumed to be 1. 2 Mg m- 3. Statistical analyses (descriptive statistics, correlations, t-test) were performed with STATISTICA 7. 1 software. Research into soil physiography in the site did not show any significant differences between the samples, regardless of sampling depths (the pHinwater suspension is between 7. 7 and 7. 9),which indicates long-term erosion impacts, that is, the homogeneity of the material. The soil in plot II does not have a developed humus-accumulative horizon. It is a strongly skeletal eutric regosol with a discontinued layer of the forest floor (the layer contains 1, 531 kg ha– 1 of dry organic matter). The soil in the surface 0. 5 cmismoderately porous (48. 4 %), with moderatewater capacity (37 %) and low water permeability (Table 2). In plots II and III (one immediately next to the other) the soil is eutric cambisol, with a depth of č 90 cm. The depth of the humus-accumulative horizon is only 2 – 4 cm,which reflects the erosion impact in the past. The slightly-to-moderately porous soil has relatively low water permeability (Table 2). In plot V the soil is eroded eutric cambisol with a discontinued A-horizon. This is shallower and texturally lighter soil than the soil in plots III andVII. In terms of granulometric composition, the soil is silty loam. Water permeability is very fast in the surface 5 cm. In plots IV and VI, the soil in the surface 10 cm is of silty-clayey texture, both on the slopes and the terraces. On the terraces of these plots the soil ismore compacted and the forest floor accumulation is higher, but water permeability is lower than on the slopes of the bench terraces. The annual precipitation amount ranged from 908 mm in 2005, over 979 mm in 2006, to 1. 167 mm in 2007. During 2005, the least precipitation occurred in the first annual quarter (< 100 mm), while in the other 3 quarters the amount of precipitation was very similar. During 2006 and 2007, precipitation amounts by quarters were almost identical: most rainfall occurred in the 1 st, followed by the 3 rd quarter, and the least occurred in the 4 th quarter (Fig. 5). Measurements of surface runoff and erosion production show that the most severe erosion occurred in plot II (Fig. 5). In the early 1970 s, the annual erosion production in this plot amounted to over 500 m 3 km- 2, while during the three-year measurement period it came to between 47. 9 and 65. 3 m 3 km- 2. More than half of the erosion production took place in the 3 rd annual quarter. Of other plots, distinct production is manifested by plot V and plot VII (Fig. 5 and 6). In the three remaining plots, the annual erosion production is considerably lower and does not exceed 0. 5 m 3 km- 2. There is no significant difference in the dynamics of annual production, except that erosion extremes occurred in plot IV in 2007, which coincides with the extremes in plots II and V. The lowest surface runoff coefficient was identified in plot III and the highest in plot II. Themean annual runoff coefficient in plot II ranges between 0. 052 and 0. 076, and the maximal comes to as much as 0. 397. This suggests a very low infiltration capacity of precipitation water. Namely, in this plot the soil is shallow regosol of silty texture (72 % of silt) and of very poor water permeability capacity (k= 0. 04 m/day). Erosion production in plots IV andVI is very low (Fig. 5). Overall biomass production in plot VI is lower than in plot IV, while the quantity of forest floor is similar to that in plot II. On the other hand, better developed trees of black pine and a very dense layer of ground vegetation in plot IV are responsible for higher leaf litter quantities: 3, 312 kg ha- 1 on the slopes of the bench terraces and 4, 144 kg ha- 1 on the terraces. It was found that erosion production was lower in the plots with higher organic matter content (in the forest floor and the mineral part of the soil). All these point to a series of mutual impacts, which synergistically determine the rate and intensity of erosion in these plots. This is explained by lower erosion sediment production in Plot IV in comparison with plots V and VI, although the terrain in plot IV has a much steeper slope. On the other hand, it is evident that, compared to plot V in which only biological recovery measures were applied, the application of technical recovery measures in plots IV and VI resulted in a much earlier reduction of erosion intensities. According to the results of research, the application of biological-technical recovery measures increases soil permeability and the soil organic matter content in proportion to the steepness of the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the higher the content is. In this climatic region, the most erodible period occurs in the 3 rd quarter of the year. Erosion production in the terrain recovered with biological-technical measures is very low, regardless of the distribution and intensity of precipitation; on the other hand, biological recovery itself, without any technical measures, results in much weaker erosion control...|$|E
40|$|Vodna erozija tla jedan je od najrazornijih procesa degradacije zemljišta. U gospodarenju šumskim zemljištemmoguća opasnost od erozije uvelike se povećava s povećanjem aridnosti klime. Vodnoj eroziji osobito pogoduju slabo vodopropusni supstrati i tlo koje iz njih nastaje, kao što je fliš. Flišna erodirana zemljišta dosta su rasprostranjena u Istri, gdje smo i proveli ovo istraživanje. Na poligonu za istraživanje erozije Abrami (kod Buzeta) na 6 pokusnih ploha istražili smo svojstva tla i tijekom 3 godine (2005., 2006. i 2007.) mjerili količinu oborine i produkciju erozijskoga nanosa. Na dvjema plohama prije 50 godina provedena je biološko-tehnička sanacija erozije, na jednoj su provedene biološke mjere, dvije su bile kontrolne (jedna na blagom nagibu i s autohtonom degradiranom šumskom vegetacijom, a druga, jako erodirana, na strmom nagibu). Jedna ploha na blagom nagibu uspostavljena je 2004. godine – iskrčena je sva drvenasta vegetacija. Godišnja je količina oborine bila između 908 mmu 2005. godini, preko 979 mmu 2006. godini do 1 167 mmu 2007. Više od polovice erozijske produkcije odvija se u 3. kvartalu godine. Istraživanja su pokazala da se biološkotehnič kom sanacijom povećava vodopropusnost tla i sadržaj organske tvari u tlu, to više što je strmije zemljište. Pokazalo se da je na zemljištu saniranom biološko-tehničkim mjerama vrlo niska erozijska produkcija, bez obzira na raspored i intenzitet oborine, a sama biološka sanacija, bez tehničkih mjera, rezultira značajno slabijim utjecajem na suzbijanje erozije.

Undisturbed soil from the depth of 0 - 5 cm was cylinder-sampled in these smaller plots. The soil profiles next to the terraced plots were not sampled. The forest floor was sampled in small 50 x 50 cm plots, particularly those established on the slopes and on the top of the bench terraces. After the removal of the forest floor, the soil in the small plots was sampled with a probe (disturbed soil) to a 10 cmdepth, and with a cylinder (undisturbed soil) to a 5 cmdepth. The granulometric soil composition was determined according to HRN ISO 11277 : 2004, the pH according to HRN ISO 10390 : 2005, the CaCO 3 content according to HRN ISO 10693 : 2004, organic carbon (TOC) according to HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, porosity according to HR ISO 11508 and 11272 2004, water retention capacity according to HRN ISO 11461 : 2001, air capacity according to HRN ISO 11580 and 11272 : 2004, and soil water permeability according to HRN ISO 17312 : 2005. Measurements of erosion parameters were based on the cumulative measurement of runoff and erosion sediment for each particular rain event (in some cases several rain events were measured cumulatively). Water with eroded particles was determined in the field by measuring water levels in retention basins and/or tubs. The total quantity of erosion sediment in the collected waterwas determined according to theHRNISO 4365 standard. Rain events were registered in the site itself with a pluviograph within the meteorological station of Abrami. In converting the erosion production mass into volume, the average erosion sediment density was assumed to be 1. 2 Mg m- 3. Statistical analyses (descriptive statistics, correlations, t-test) were performed with STATISTICA 7. 1 software. Research into soil physiography in the site did not show any significant differences between the samples, regardless of sampling depths (the pHinwater suspension is between 7. 7 and 7. 9),which indicates long-term erosion impacts, that is, the homogeneity of the material. The soil in plot II does not have a developed humus-accumulative horizon. It is a strongly skeletal eutric regosol with a discontinued layer of the forest floor (the layer contains 1, 531 kg ha– 1 of dry organic matter). The soil in the surface 0. 5 cmismoderately porous (48. 4 %), with moderatewater capacity (37 %) and low water permeability (Table 2). In plots II and III (one immediately next to the other) the soil is eutric cambisol, with a depth of č 90 cm. The depth of the humus-accumulative horizon is only 2 – 4 cm,which reflects the erosion impact in the past. The slightly-to-moderately porous soil has relatively low water permeability (Table 2). In plot V the soil is eroded eutric cambisol with a discontinued A-horizon. This is shallower and texturally lighter soil than the soil in plots III andVII. In terms of granulometric composition, the soil is silty loam. Water permeability is very fast in the surface 5 cm. In plots IV and VI, the soil in the surface 10 cm is of silty-clayey texture, both on the slopes and the terraces. On the terraces of these plots the soil ismore compacted and the forest floor accumulation is higher, but water permeability is lower than on the slopes of the bench terraces. The annual precipitation amount ranged from 908 mm in 2005, over 979 mm in 2006, to 1. 167 mm in 2007. During 2005, the least precipitation occurred in the first annual quarter (< 100 mm), while in the other 3 quarters the amount of precipitation was very similar. During 2006 and 2007, precipitation amounts by quarters were almost identical: most rainfall occurred in the 1 st, followed by the 3 rd quarter, and the least occurred in the 4 th quarter (Fig. 5). Measurements of surface runoff and erosion production show that the most severe erosion occurred in plot II (Fig. 5). In the early 1970 s, the annual erosion production in this plot amounted to over 500 m 3 km- 2, while during the three-year measurement period it came to between 47. 9 and 65. 3 m 3 km- 2. More than half of the erosion production took place in the 3 rd annual quarter. Of other plots, distinct production is manifested by plot V and plot VII (Fig. 5 and 6). In the three remaining plots, the annual erosion production is considerably lower and does not exceed 0. 5 m 3 km- 2. There is no significant difference in the dynamics of annual production, except that erosion extremes occurred in plot IV in 2007, which coincides with the extremes in plots II and V. The lowest surface runoff coefficient was identified in plot III and the highest in plot II. Themean annual runoff coefficient in plot II ranges between 0. 052 and 0. 076, and the maximal comes to as much as 0. 397. This suggests a very low infiltration capacity of precipitation water. Namely, in this plot the soil is shallow regosol of silty texture (72 % of silt) and of very poor water permeability capacity (k= 0. 04 m/day). Erosion production in plots IV andVI is very low (Fig. 5). Overall biomass production in plot VI is lower than in plot IV, while the quantity of forest floor is similar to that in plot II. On the other hand, better developed trees of black pine and a very dense layer of ground vegetation in plot IV are responsible for higher leaf litter quantities: 3, 312 kg ha- 1 on the slopes of the bench terraces and 4, 144 kg ha- 1 on the terraces. It was found that erosion production was lower in the plots with higher organic matter content (in the forest floor and the mineral part of the soil). All these point to a series of mutual impacts, which synergistically determine the rate and intensity of erosion in these plots. This is explained by lower erosion sediment production in Plot IV in comparison with plots V and VI, although the terrain in plot IV has a much steeper slope. On the other hand, it is evident that, compared to plot V in which only biological recovery measures were applied, the application of technical recovery measures in plots IV and VI resulted in a much earlier reduction of erosion intensities. According to the results of research, the application of biological-technical recovery measures increases soil permeability and the soil organic matter content in proportion to the steepness of the terrain. The steeper the terrain, the higher the content is. In this climatic region, the most erodible period occurs in the 3 rd quarter of the year. Erosion production in the terrain recovered with biological-technical measures is very low, regardless of the distribution and intensity of precipitation; on the other hand, biological recovery itself, without any technical measures, results in much weaker erosion control...|$|E
