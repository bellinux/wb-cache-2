The main characteristics of this database are: large mixed speech corpus size (? 100 speakers), English spoken by foreigners, mainly digits with some free speech, collected through <b>international</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines,</b> and more than eight sessions per speaker. 1. INTRODUCTION We present in this paper {{an overview of the}} POLYCOST database dedicated to speaker recognition applications and assessments[1]. This database has been recorded {{within the framework of the}} European COST 250 action [6] entitled "Speaker Recognition in Telephony" which has started in 1995 and will finish in 1998 1. Speaker recognition research to date has focused primarily on wide-band speech. However, many applications, such as information services, merchandise ordering or financial transaction require the use of telephone speech. In Europe now, some speaker recognition dedicated database [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A Remote Monitoring System (RMS) {{field trial}} has been {{conducted}} with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on highly enriched uranium materials in a vault at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant. The RMS included a variety of Sandia, Oak Ridge, and Aquila sensor technologies which provide containment seals, video monitoring, radiation asset measurements, and container identification data to the on-site DAS (Data Acquisition System) by way of radio-frequency and Echelon LonWorks networks. The accumulated safeguards information was transmitted to the IAEA via satellite (COMSAT/RSI) and <b>international</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines.</b> The technologies tested in the remote monitoring environment are the RadCouple, RadSiP, and SmartShelf sensors from the ORSENS (Oak Ridge Sensors for Enhancing Nuclear Safeguards) technologies; the AIMS (Authenticated Item Monitoring System) motion sensor (AMS), AIMS fiber-optic seal (AFOS), ICAM (Image Compression and Authentication Module) video surveillance system, DAS (Data Acquisition System), and DIRS (Data and Image Review Station) from Sandia; and the AssetLAN identification tag, VACOSS-S seal, and Gemini digital surveillance system from Aquila. The field trial was conducted from October 1996 through May 1997. Tests were conducted during the monthly IAEA Interim Inventory Verification (IIV) inspections for evaluation of the equipment. Experience gained through the field trials will allow the technologies {{to be applied to}} various monitoring scenarios...|$|R
40|$|A remote {{monitoring}} system (RMS) field trial {{will be conducted}} for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on highly enriched uranium materials in a vault at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant. Remote monitoring technologies are being evaluated to verify their capability to enhance the effectiveness and timeliness of IAEA safeguards in storage facilities while reducing the costs of inspections and burdens on the operator. Phase one of the field trial, which involved proving the satellite transmission of sensor data and safeguards images from a video camera activated by seals and motion sensors installed in the vault, was completed in September 1995. Phase two involves formal testing of the RMS {{as a tool for}} use by the IAEA during their tasks of monitoring the storage of nuclear material. The field trial to be completed during early 1997 includes access and item monitoring of nuclear materials in two storage trays. The RMS includes a variety of Sandia, Oak Ridge, and Aquila sensor technologies that provide video monitoring, radiation attribute measurements, and container identification to the on-site data acquisition system (DAS) by way of radio-frequency and Echelon LONWorks networks. The accumulated safeguards information will be transmitted to the IAEA via satellite (COMSAT/RSI) and <b>international</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Haiti {{does not}} appear to be the most fertile ground for Internet growth. It is a poor nation with a low {{literacy}} rate, difficult terrain, and few working <b>telephone</b> <b>lines</b> outside the capital city. Despite these impediments, resourceful entrepreneurs have sought to offer and expand Internet services, and have sometimes explored unconventional technical approaches. Haiti now has four commercial Internet service providers (ISPs), and Internet services are available in five Haitian cities. This paper will provide a brief description of today 2 ̆ 7 s Haitian Internet sector. The Haitian experience demonstrates that the shortest path to Internet infrastructure in developing countries may be radically different from the paths taken in wealthier nations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{differences}} in sociodemographic characteristics associated with health in individuals {{with and without}} a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> METHODS: Data from the ISA-Capital 2003 (2003 Health Survey), a study performed {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, were analyzed. Residents who had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were compared to those who reported not having a <b>telephone</b> <b>line,</b> according to sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and health service use variables. Bias associated with noncoverage of the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> was estimated, decreasing after the use of post-stratifi cation adjustments. RESULTS: Of all the 1, 878 interviewees aged more than 18 years, 80. 1 % had a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> By comparing groups, the main sociodemographic differences among individuals who did not have a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> were the following: younger age, greater proportion of black and mixed individuals, smaller proportion of married interviewees, and greater proportion of unemployed individuals with a lower level of education. Residents without a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> had fewer health tests performed and smoked and drank more. In addition, this group took less medication, considered themselves to be in worse health conditions and used the SUS (National Health System) more frequently. When excluding the population without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> from the analysis, estimates of dental consultations, alcoholism, drug use and SUS use to have a Papanicolaou test performed were those showing the highest bias. After post-stratifi cation adjustment, there was a decrease in the bias of estimates for the variables associated with ownership of a residential <b>telephone</b> <b>line.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The exclusion of residents without a <b>telephone</b> <b>line</b> {{was one of the main}} limitations to the studies performed in this way. However, the use of statistical techniques of post-stratifi cation adjustment enables a reduction in non-coverage bias...|$|R
50|$|The first {{telephone}} exchanges in Belgium were opened in 1878. A company {{was formed in}} Brussels in 1879, and others followed. Competition was recognised as unsatisfactory, and the various companies were encouraged to amalgamate. The Compagnie Belge du Téléphone Bell (the Bell Telephone Company of Belgium) was formed in 1882, as the Belgian subsidiary of the <b>International</b> Bell <b>Telephone</b> Company of New York. By the end of 1886, the Belgian division had a total 6,900 kilometers of <b>telephone</b> <b>lines,</b> and 3,532 subscribers in seven cities, including Brussels, Antwerp, Charleroi, Ghent, Verviers, and Liège.|$|R
