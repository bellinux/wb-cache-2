It is not {{the intent of this}} paper to examine the structure, business processes, efficiency or economic prospects of the BCMA. The intent is to develop a series of suggestions that target areas of physician dissatisfaction and assist the BCMA in fulfilling its mandate. The Professional Satisfaction Index (PSI) survey instrument was developed and sent to BC physicians. The PSI survey was designed as an aid to the BCMA and is exploratory in nature. The results have not been tested for reliability and validity. While preliminary results suggest that physician dissatisfaction is real, any conclusions drawn from the survey should be judged according to its unproven status. Any use of this instrument in its current form outside its stated context is not recommended...|$|E
40|$|Fee-for-service (FFS) {{payment system}} {{has been criticized for}} {{affecting}} quality of care, contributing to the fragmentation of health care, and for rising costs of health care systems. Alternative payment plans (APP) have been introduced as options to the traditional FFS. Despite a link between payment methods and behaviour of physicians has been established, {{there is a lack of}} evidence about the impact of payment systems on well-being (motivation and daily distress) of physicians. This dissertation explored the impact of APP on physicians’ perceptions of professional equity and daily distress. The following questions guided this dissertation: 1) Does professional equity perceived by physicians vary among practitioners paid by FFS, APP, or blended alternatives? 2) Is the payment method associated with daily distress of medical practitioners? and 3) Are levels of professional equity, daily distress, and career satisfaction of physicians different by gender and payment methods? In 2011, Physicians practicing in the Saskatoon Health Region, the largest health authority of Saskatchewan, Canada, completed a questionnaire evaluating their perceptions of professional equity and daily distress. In total, 382 (48. 1 %) physicians participated in the study. Response bias was tested and found to be negligible. The study identified that physicians paid by APP perceived higher professional equity (<b>fair</b> <b>economic</b> <b>rewards</b> and appropriate recognition) in comparison to those paid by FFS. Particularly, family practitioners (FPs) paid by APP perceived higher professional equity than those FPs paid by FFS. The payment method was identified as a factor associated with distress; lower levels of daily distress were predicted among physicians paid by APP who see high proportions of patients with complex conditions. Notwithstanding, female physicians had poorer well-being indicators and the impact of APP on professional equity was only distinguished among males. A potential unequal impact of APP must be recognized between female and male physicians.

40|$|The way {{physicians}} {{are paid for}} the provision of care is a relevant aspect of health care systems. Fee-for-service (FFS) payment system has been criticized for affecting quality of care, contributing to the fragmentation of health care, and for rising costs of health care systems. Alternative payment plans (APP) have been introduced as options to the traditional FFS payment scheme. Despite the link between payment methods and behavior of physicians that has been established; {{there is a lack of}} evidence about the impact of payment systems on wellness of physicians, specifically on their perception of professional equity and daily distress of physicians. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of APP on physicians’ perceptions of professional equity and daily distress. The following questions guided this dissertation: 1) Does professional equity perceived by physicians vary among practitioners paid by FFS, APP, or blended alternatives? 2) Is the payment method associated with daily distress of medical practitioners? and 3) Are levels of professional equity, daily distress, and career satisfaction of physicians different by gender and payment methods? In 2011, a cross-sectional study was conducted with physicians practicing in the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR), the largest health authority of Saskatchewan, Canada. Physicians completed a questionnaire evaluating their perceptions of professional equity and daily distress. Analyses of variances (ANOVA) were performed to assess differences in professional equity (overall and by its fulfillment, financial, and recognition dimensions) and daily distress among physicians paid by FFS, APP, and blended schemes. As multivariable analyses, a linear regression was used to test the interaction between specialty and payment methods on the perception of professional equity, controlling for the number of patients, gender, and age group. A mixed linear regression model was built to predict daily distress, testing demographics, workload, complexity of patients, payment method, career satisfaction, and practice profile; the random component of the model considered the influence of geographic area of practice. Also, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to evaluate differences among professional equity, daily distress, and career satisfaction by payment method and gender. In total, 382 (48. 1 %) physicians participated in the study. Response bias was tested and found to be negligible (Appendix F). The ANOVA identified that physicians paid by APP perceived higher professional equity than those paid by FFS (p= 0. 005), as well as higher levels of income (p= 0. 03) and recognition (p= 0. 001) equity than those with FFS. In the multivariable analyses, a higher level of professional equity was predicted among family practitioners (FPs) paid by APP and blended schemes in comparison to those paid by FFS. Additionally, the payment method was a predictor of daily distress when adjusted by other factors. Lower levels of distress were found among physicians who had more than 75 % of patients with complex conditions and were paid by APP compared to those paid by FFS and blended methods. The MANOVA identified that female physicians had poorer wellness indicators than male practitioners. Multiple comparisons identified higher levels of equity among male physicians paid by APP than those with FFS, although this benefit was not observed among female ones. In conclusion, physicians paid by APP perceived higher professional equity (<b>fair</b> <b>economic</b> <b>rewards</b> and appropriate recognition) in comparison to those paid by FFS. Particularly, FPs paid by APP perceived higher professional equity than those FPs paid by FFS. Additionally, the payment method was identified as an associated factor with distress; lower levels of daily distress were predicted among physicians paid by APP who see high proportions of patients with complex conditions. Notwithstanding, female physicians had poorer wellness indicators and the impact of APP on professional equity was only distinguished among males.

40|$|We {{argue that}} women's {{previously}} documented unresponsiveness to sexual primes when making economic decisions {{may be a}} consequence of the specific types of primes that have been used (i. e., visual primes). In three studies we show that presenting women with tactile sexual cues does influence their decisions about <b>economic</b> <b>rewards.</b> Similar to the effect found in men, the first study demonstrates that touching a pair of boxer shorts leads to a craving for monetary rewards in women. In the second study it is shown that touching a pair of boxers makes women less loss averse for both money and food. The third study explicitly focuses on the relative effectiveness of tactile versus visual sexual cues in altering women's economic decisions, and reveals that women's willingness-to-pay for <b>economic</b> <b>rewards</b> increases only when the sexual cue is tactile.

40|$|When {{people are}} morally convicted {{regarding}} a specific issue, these convictions exert a powerful {{influence on their}} attitudes and behavior. In the current research we examined whether there are boundary conditions {{to the influence of}} this effect. Specifically, whether in the context of salient <b>economic</b> <b>rewards,</b> moral convictions may become weaker predictors of attitudes regarding resource use. Focusing on the issue of mining we gathered large-scale samples across three different continents (Australia, Chile, and China). We found that moral convictions against mining were related to a reduced acceptance of mining in each country, while perceived <b>economic</b> <b>rewards</b> from mining increased acceptance. These two motivations interacted, however, such that when perceived economic benefit from mining was high, the influence of moral conviction was weaker. The results highlight the importance of understanding the roles of both moral conviction and financial gain in motivating attitudes towards resource use. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

The study uses 400 firm-year data, involving 50 companies,purposively selected {{over the period}} 2006 - 2009. The data were sourced from the annual audited reports andaccounts of the companies, obtained from the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The study uses correlation and grangercausality econometric techniques to analyze the data, after carrying out diagnostic tests such as unit roots andcointegration tests. The study found that relative economic value added (WETREL) was stationary (?² = 176. 425,p< 0. 01) at level and relative employees’ <b>economic</b> <b>rewards</b> (SENREL) stationary (?² = 317. 882, p< 0. 01) at firstdifference, using the Philips-Perron Fisher asymptotic chi-square criterion while both WETREL was stationary(Z=- 9. 8012, p< 0. 01) and SENREL stationary (Z=- 7. 2612, p< 0. 01) at first difference, using Philips-Perron ChoiZ-statistics criterion. Also, {{there was at least}} one cointegrating equation between SENREL and WETREL of thecompanies, indicating a long-run equilibrium relationship between the two variables. In addition, WETREL(?²= 7. 623, p< 0. 01) significantly Granger causes SENREL and SENREL (?²= 3. 744, p< 0. 05) also significantlyGranger causes WETREL. Thus, a bi-directional causality existed between the variables, indicating that thedirection of the causality runs two ways, from WETREL to SENREL, and vice versa.
