5|$|The Catholic Church was the <b>dominant</b> <b>influence</b> on Western {{civilisation}} from Late Antiquity to {{the dawn}} of the modern age. It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music. Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Titian, Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the Church.|$|E
5|$|After Hancock's {{father died}} in 1744, John was sent {{to live with his}} uncle and aunt, Thomas Hancock and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock. Thomas Hancock was the {{proprietor}} of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish. Thomas Hancock's highly successful business made him one of Boston's richest and best-known residents. He and Lydia, along with several servants and slaves, lived in Hancock Manor on Beacon Hill. The couple, who did not have any children of their own, became the <b>dominant</b> <b>influence</b> on John's life.|$|E
5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation. The Church {{eventually became}} the <b>dominant</b> <b>influence</b> in Western civilisation {{into the modern}} age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E

5|$|His father Nobile Carlo Buonaparte was an attorney, and {{was named}} Corsica's {{representative}} {{to the court of}} Louis XVI in 1777. The <b>dominant</b> <b>influence</b> of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Letizia Ramolino, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child. Napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years.|$|E
5|$|Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} al-Ma'mun, continuing his predecessor's support for Mu'tazilism, a theological doctrine that attempted to tread a middle way between secular monarchy and the theocratic nature of rulership espoused by the Alids and the various sects of Shi'ism. Mu'tazilis espoused {{the view that the}} Quran was created and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided imām to interpret according to the changing circumstances. While revering Ali, they avoided taking a position on the righteousness of the opposing sides in the conflict between Ali and his opponents. Mu'tazilism was officially adopted by al-Ma'mun in 827, and in 833, shortly before his death, al-Ma'mun made its doctrines compulsory, with the establishment of an inquisition, the miḥna. During his brother's reign, al-Mu'tasim played {{an active role in the}} enforcement of the miḥna in the western provinces, and continued on the same course after his accession: the chief advocate of Mu'tazilism, the head qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, was perhaps the <b>dominant</b> <b>influence</b> at the caliphal court throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign.|$|E
5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (perhaps {{as a result}} of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the <b>dominant</b> <b>influence</b> in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 14th century, French kings {{sought to}} expand their {{influence}} {{at the expense of}} the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376), won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France. The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the <b>dominant</b> <b>influence.</b> The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346.|$|E

A number of methods of attraction, for example, word of mouth, recruitment agencies or internet recruitment, could be utilised {{in the process of}} filling these vacancies, and Human Resources practitioners have to make decisions on which method to adopt. Using a statistical technique called Correspondence Analysis, this research intended to explore the criteria that inform the decision of which method to adopt. The purpose of this was to determine if there is an overriding set of <b>dominant</b> <b>influences</b> on Human Resources practitioners‟ perceptions of methods of attraction, which could ultimately guide Human Resources practitioners in their decision processes. Furthermore, the research served to determine whether there were any material differences in perceptions of performances of the methods of attraction on any identified criteria and <b>dominant</b> <b>influences.</b> Utilising a sample of 35 Human Resources practitioners, from a variety of industries, it was possible to illustrate that there are two <b>dominant</b> <b>influences</b> on Human Resources practitioners‟ perceptions of methods of attraction. The results also highlight that perceptions of methods of attraction do differ significantly according to Human Resource practitioners on their effectiveness relative to these two influences, and demonstrate which methods of attraction perform best or worst on the criteria included in the researc...|$|R

40|$|Innovation is an {{important}} element of strategic management (2003), and most product innovations involve cross-functional teams (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1994) who have some difficulty in developing a shared understanding of a particular innovation problem, which can often be characterised as a complex ill-structured problem (described as a task). This study uses an action research approach (Eden and Huxham, 1996) to explore how to develop a shared vocabulary and understanding of a task and then how to direct its growth and development. From a review of relevant literature, five <b>dominant</b> <b>influencing</b> factors emerged that impact on a team's capability to manage the task. These <b>dominant</b> <b>influencing</b> factors are the teams: shared cognition, creative processes, task relevant knowledge development, team role development and task tracking. These were used as the building blocks in an architectural innovation. The researchers experience in innovation projects in industry and with MBA students on smaller project re-enforced this literature review. An iterative action research process involving 160 interviews was then used to develop a new framework that positively impacted on these five <b>dominant</b> <b>influencing</b> factors in seven organisations. The seven companies selected were all at the early stage of exploring an ill-structured innovative opportunity, which formed the basis of the tasks for the various teams. These varied in their nature but all required architectural knowledge development in cross functional teams ranging from four to seven people. The framework uses as its building blocks existing established models and approaches from different discipline...|$|R
