5|$|Kamohoali'i is {{the best}} known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of Pele, and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii. He was able to assume all human and fish forms. A summit cliff on the crater of Kilauea {{is one of his}} most sacred spots. At one point he had a heiau (temple or shrine) {{dedicated}} to him on <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of Molokai. Kamohoali'i was an ancestral god, not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself. In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} where {{soccer is}} portrayed as the most boring sport imaginable was intended to show that soccer was more boring on television than live, but both Michels and Groening enjoy the game. The referee at the game is a caricature of the janitor at Film Roman, who supplied director Pete Michels with <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> of soccer information he needed to design the episode. Pelé also makes an appearance at the match, although he is voiced by Hank Azaria.|$|E
5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department had no interest in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E

It becomes worse for Lucille when another secret from her mother is about to shock her when she meets her conniving and two-faced half-sister Alex and half-brother Sebastian.|$|R
5|$|The fitting {{shop was}} {{designed}} to manufacture 40 locomotives {{a year and a}} total of 300 were produced in the next eight years. The first locomotive, given its trial in May 1854, was named Lady Elgin, after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time, the Earl of Elgin. For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey's specifications. These were all stamped and coded, loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail {{to the site of the}} bridge for assembly. The central tube of the bridge contained over 10,000 pieces of iron, perforated by holes for half a million rivets, and when it was assembled <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> and hole was true.|$|E
5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Egypt was already well developed before Ibn Tulun's arrival, {{with a number}} of departments (dīwāns) responsible for the collection of the land tax, the supervision of the post, the public granaries (dīwān al-ahrāʿ), the Nile Delta lands (dīwān asfal al-arḍ), and possibly a privy purse (dīwān al-khaṣṣ) for the governor's personal use. A chancery (dīwān al-inshāʾ) possibly also already existed, or else was established under Ibn Tulun, when he remodelled the Egyptian administration after the Abbasid central government. Most of the officials employed by Ibn Tulun were like him trained in the caliphal court at Samarra. Ibn Tulun's chancellor was the capable Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Abd al-Kan (died 891), while other important positions in the administration were held by the four Banu al-Muhajir brothers and Ibn al-Daya. Al-Balawi also reports several anecdotes about Ibn Tulun's extensive use of spies and his own ability to uncover spies sent against him, and claims that the chancery was established so that Ibn Tulun could check up on <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> of correspondence with the caliphal court.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the broad}} {{public support for}} the bill, some federal {{departmental}} staff initially opposed the bill suggesting it could cost up to $384 million to upgrade all of Canada's lighthouses to heritage standards. Supporters of the bill called these numbers inflated, pointing out that it assumes that <b>every</b> <b>pieces</b> of navigational equipment in the country, including hundreds of steel towers and floating buoys, would be designated whereas even the strongest proponents only anticipate the nomination of a select number of landmark lighthouses. They also noted that the bill leaves control of the number of designations, and any associated, costs, with the minister.|$|R

25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, {{it is helpful to}} understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> where he employs them.|$|E
25|$|In August 1913, Jupiters trials almost ended {{before they}} began. While {{underway}} off the coaling station in Tiburon, California {{in preparation for}} its shakedown cruise, Jupiter took evasive action to avoid an accidental collision with a passing submarine. During the sudden maneuver, a fuse on the main electrical panel blew, shutting down <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> of machinery on the ship, including its steering. With only four minutes before the ship would run aground, Robinson restored power; Jupiter got underway with 30 seconds to spare.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things about the fantastical creatures carved of wood is that <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> is removable, it's how you can tell you have a piece carved by one of the original great carvers. The later carvers didn't learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. Those pieces have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.|$|E
