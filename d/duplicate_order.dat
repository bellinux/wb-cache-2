40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Defense must give great emphasis to {{the supply chain}} of Class IV (lumber) resources to sustain successful operations worldwide because this {{is critical to the}} success of forward units. The rapid buildup of resources and capabilities in a forward location is dependent upon the timely arrival and accumulation of forces. Lumber is the medium that allows for this transition, from arrival to prolonged sustainment. Missions come in many shapes and forms; however, the one sustainable item that links them all together is lumber. Through a statistical sampling and data analytics, this research has identified that there is a <b>duplicate</b> <b>ordering</b> problem prevalent within the Defense Logistics Agency’s ordering system. The problem becomes more prevalent given variables such as unit ordering, time of order, quantity of orders, and days between each <b>order.</b> These <b>duplicates</b> can lead to congestion through the supply chain management system. Further, this <b>duplicate</b> <b>ordering</b> problem can lead to unnecessary costs associated with holding and shipping lumber as well as the lumber itself. Due to lumber’s unique dimensions and weight, the cost with shipping it are much larger than other traditional DLA products. Identifying the frequent occurrence of <b>duplicate</b> <b>orders</b> can in turn provide the next step in finding a solution to the problem. Captain, United States Arm...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} {{and evaluate}} {{a method that}} uses electronic medical record (EMR) data to measure the effects of computer system downtime on clinical processes associated with pathology testing and results reporting. Materials and methods: A matched case-control design {{was used to examine}} the effects of five downtime events over 11 -months, ranging from 5 to 300 min. Four indicator tests representing different laboratory workflows were selected to measure delays and errors: potassium, haemoglobon, troponin and activated partial thromboplastin time. Tests exposed to a downtime were matched to tests during unaffected control periods by test type, time of day and day of week. Measures included clinician read time (CRT), laboratory turnaround time (LTAT), and rates of missed reads, futile searches, <b>duplicate</b> <b>orders,</b> and missing test results. Results: The effects of downtime varied with the type of IT problem. When clinicians could not logon to a results reporting system for 17 -min, the CRT for potassium and haemoglobon tests was five (10. 3 vs. 2. 0 days) and six times (13. 4 vs. 2. 1 days) longer than control (p= 0. 01 - 0. 04; p= 0. 0001 - 0. 003). Clinician follow-up of tests was also delayed by another downtime involving a power outage with a small effect. In contrast, laboratory processing of troponin tests was unaffected by network services and routing problems. Errors including missed reads, futile searches, <b>duplicate</b> <b>orders</b> and missing test results could not be examined because the sample size of affected tests was not sufficient for statistical testing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using routinely collected EMR data with a matched case-control design to measure the effects of downtime on clinical processes. Even brief system downtimes may impact patient care. The methodology has potential to be applied to other clinical processes with established workflows where tasks are pre-defined such as medications management. 8 page(s...|$|R

This paper considered the question, what impact do Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems have on medication errors in the hospital inpatient environment? Previous reviews have examined evidence of the impact of CPOE on medication errors, but have come to ambiguous conclusions as to the impact of CPOE and decision support systems (DSS). Forty-three papers were identified. Thirty-one demonstrated a significant reduction in prescribing error rates for all or some drug types; decreases in minor errors were most often reported. Several studies reported increases in the rate of <b>duplicate</b> <b>orders</b> and failures to remove contraindicated drugs, often attributed to inappropriate design or to an inability to operate the system properly. The evidence on the effectiveness of CPOE to reduce errors in medication administration is compelling though it is limited by modest study sample sizes and designs. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous reviews have {{examined}} {{evidence of the}} impact of CPOE on medication errors, but have used highly variable definitions of "error". We attempted to answer a very focused question, namely, what evidence exists that CPOE systems reduce prescribing errors among hospital inpatients? We identified 13 papers (reporting 12 studies) published between 1998 and 2007. Nine demonstrated a significant reduction in prescribing error rates for all or some drug types. Few studies examined changes in error severity, but minor errors were most often reported as decreasing. Several studies reported increases in the rate of <b>duplicate</b> <b>orders</b> and failures to discontinue drugs, often attributed to inappropriate selection from a dropdown menu or to an inability to view all active medication orders concurrently. The evidence-base reporting the effectiveness of CPOE to reduce prescribing errors is not compelling and is limited by modest study sample sizes and designs. Future studies should include larger samples including multiple sites, controlled study designs, and standardized error and severity reporting. The role of decision support in minimizing severe prescribing error rates also requires investigation. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} flow {{of goods}} into hospitals is disrupted {{by the presence of}} time critical (urgent) items in the chain encouraging sub-optimal vehicle fleet operations. Furthermore, the fast delivery of such items can often become stalled by the transition between the external and internal supply chains, leading to <b>duplicate</b> <b>ordering.</b> These issues result in increased volumes of hospital-related traffic and a delay in the delivery of care to patients. An unattended electronic locker bank, comprising individual lockable boxes to which different urgent items can be delivered is proposed as a potential solution with the aims of: separating urgent and non-urgent goods in the chain, thereby enabling consolidation of non-urgent consignments; and, bypassing the traditional route of supply. The feasibility of this concept was tested in the context of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London using a database of consignment movements to assess physical requirements of the locker bank, using a hill climbing optimization technique; and, qualitatively using interviews with key members of staff. Results of the quantitative analysis indicated that a locker bank measuring 3. 33 m (10. 93 ft.) in length, 1. 7 m (5. 58 ft.) height and 0. 8 m (2. 62 ft.) depth, comprising of 11 partitions would be required to accommodate 100 % of all urgent consignments passing into the hospital during a typical week. Staff perceptions of the locker bank concept were largely positive suggesting the locker box could improve the speed and quality of healthcare delivered to patient...|$|R

40|$|Time-referenced, or temporal, data occur pervasively in most {{real-world}} databases. Recent {{advances in}} temporal query languages show that such applications may benefit substantially from a {{database management system}} (DBMS) with built-in temporal support. The potential benefits are several: application code is simplified and more easily maintainable, thereby increasing programmer productivity, and more data processing can {{be left to the}} DBMS, potentially leading to better performance. In contrast, the built-in temporal support offered by current database products is limited to predefined, time-related data types, e. g., the Informix TimeSeries DataBlade and the Oracle TimeSeries cartridge, and extensibility facilities that enable the user to define new, e. g., temporal, data types. However, temporal support is needed that goes beyond data types and extends the query language itself, as well as integrates temporal operations into the query optimization and processing framework. This Ph. D. thesis presents an algebraic foundation for temporal query representation, optimization, and processing, as well as an implementation of the foundation in a layered architecture. The foundation includes an algebra for temporal query representation, a comprehensive set of transformation rules, and a query plan enumeration algorithm. The algebra enhances existing relational algebras based on multisets by integrating the handling of order and adding temporal support, and the transformation rules are divided into different types according to how they deal with <b>duplicates,</b> <b>order,</b> and time periods. By capturing duplicate removal and retention and order preservation for all queries, as well as coalescing for temporal queries, the foundation formalizes and generalizes existing approaches.

50|$|On the Northern side, Grant {{had almost}} {{constant}} telegraphic communication with Halleck in Washington, {{which gave him}} a relatively good measure of strategic control over Union armies in other theaters of the war. Within the eastern theater, Grant could communicate with Sigel in the Valley and Butler on the Virginia Peninsula via his telegraph connections to Washington.Grant’s communications with the Army of the Potomac and the initially separate IX Corps were affected more by the awkward Union command relationship than the technical means of communication. For the most part, Grant and Meade both relied heavily on couriers with some flag signaling. Initially, Grant, with his small staff and few aides, attempted to issue only broad orders to Meade and allow the army commander to execute tactical control. At the same time, Grant had to issue orders directly to the IX Corps (at least until late May) to coordinate Burnside’s moves with the Army of the Potomac. On several occasions, Grant bypassed Meade and confusing or <b>duplicate</b> <b>orders</b> resulted.Lee also relied heavily on couriers at the tactical level, and his streamlined command structure minimized confusion over orders. Lee did use flag signals, especially {{at the beginning of}} the campaign at Clark’s Mountain. The Union forces occasionally intercepted these signals, but they gained only a minor advantage from this. At a higher level, Lee had solid telegraph contact with his political leadership in Richmond.
