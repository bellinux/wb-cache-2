40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an auto-recognition method for pointer-type meter based on computer vision. Two calibrated cameras {{are located in}} the right and left sides of the meter to capture the meter displayed images. In each displayed image, the fast Hough transform method is used to locate the approximate pointer area and then the least squares fitting method is used to determine the precise line that represents the <b>pointer</b> <b>indicator.</b> Two precise lines obtained from both right and left displayed images are reconstructed in three-dimensional space according to the epipolar constraint. The line reconstructed is then projected into the target plane to determine the true indication of the meter. Experiments show that the proposed method works very well for the dial pointer identification. The maximum uncertainty in the determination of the pointer’s indication is less than the human eye can discriminate.

50|$|A dial is {{generally}} a flat surface, circular or rectangular, with numbers or similar markings on it, used for displaying the setting or output of a timepiece, radio, clock, watch, or measuring instrument. There are many instruments used in scientific and industrial applications that use dials with <b>pointers</b> as <b>indicators</b> {{of a specific}} physical property. Typical examples include pressure and vacuum gauges, fluid-level gauges (for fuel, engine oil, and so on), voltmeters and ammeters, thermometers and hygrometers, speedometers and tachometers, and indicators (distance amplifying instruments).|$|R
40|$|A set of test {{structures}} for {{in situ stress}} measurement is presented. The test structures were realized by means of surface micromachining, adopting photoresist as a sacrificial layer and electroplated gold as a structural layer. Initially array of buckling type test structures cantilevers, fixed- fixed beams, Guckel rings and diamond were used to find out critical buckling beam. Later on rotational type <b>pointer,</b> double <b>indicator</b> and long-short beam strain sensor were analyzed to find out stress. Stress measurement techniques using micromachined structures are compared with the wafer curvature technique. Analytical calculations of the fabricated structures were performed for plated gold for which the value of residual stress has been found between 100 and 150 MPa. ...|$|R
5000|$|In early vessels, {{from the}} 19th century until about 1950, the device usually {{consisted}} of a round dial about nine inches (~20 centimetres) in diameter with a knob at the center attached {{to one or more}} handles, and an <b>indicator</b> <b>pointer</b> {{on the face of the}} dial. There would also be a revolutions per minute indicator, worked by a hand crank. Modern E.O.T.s on vessels which still use them use electronic light and sound signals.|$|R
50|$|Bourdon tubes measure gauge pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the <b>pointer</b> and <b>indicator</b> card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a proposed acceleration-type take-off indicator were observed during take-off runs of a large jet airplane. The instrument performed its function satisfactorily. It showed an essentially constant reading, which agreed closely with the predicted value, throughout the take-off except for about the first 135 feet of the ground roll during which the starting windup of the <b>indicator</b> <b>pointer</b> occurred. Although oscillating longitudinal accelerations at the instrument location were as much as +/- 50 percent of the steady-state acceleration, the instrument showed only small excursions from the mean reading equivalent to not more than +/- 5 percent of the mean reading and {{was considered to be}} satisfactorily readable...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{familiarity}} bred by the routine use of indicators in public services, many commentators are vague about what indicators mean {{and how they}} should be used. Several confuse indicators with measurement. This paper argues that precise and accurate measurement is often inappropriate {{to the use of}} indicators, and that we need to accept a degree of uncertainty. A good indicator should be understood as a pointer, not a measure. It should be accessible, robust and accompanied by other <b>pointers.</b> By treating <b>indicators</b> as measures, summary indices conceal key issues, hide the values and concepts which are implicit in the exercise, and are vulnerable to mathematical accident. Using multiple indicators is sounder in principle, in methodological terms, and in practical application...|$|R
5000|$|The Post Instrument was {{introduced}} {{in an era when}} sound locating was still common, and some techniques for measuring the angle by sound were developed. This basically consisted of moving the horizontal slider until the <b>indicator</b> <b>pointer</b> was over the [...] "sound line", a circle on the map representing a [...] distance around the post. The operator would then rotate the sights horizontally and vertically to try to point the sights in the direction they estimated the sound to be coming from. Instead of using the map, the operator instead called the horizontal and vertical angles to their operations room. The horizontal angle could be read off a scale around {{the outer edge of the}} map, but the vertical angle was instead measured by dropping the last three zeros of the altitude measurement, so if the sights were over the 14,000 foot marker, they would call in [...] "angle 14".|$|R
40|$|Although {{the moving}} scale, fixed <b>pointer,</b> type of <b>indicator</b> is {{undesirable}} for normal use, occasions sometimes arise {{when it is}} appropriate, or its use is unavoidable. In one situation of this nature a dial required markings that would designate a quadrant {{on one side of}} 0 as North, and the other side as Soutb. Another dial required marhings on one side of 0 as Plus, and the other side as Minus. In the absence o f specific information covering this problem, an experiment was designed which would supply the necessary information. A naive population of 40 randomly selected, male, senior high school students was used. Results showed that {{the right side of the}} moving scale should be marked N or f and the left side S or-. Peripheral znfor-mation disclosed correlation between score obtained and scholastic performance. INTRODUCTION the dial should be turned. Ignoring Rule 3 A considerable amount of research has been conducted to determine the best design for mechanical indicators. Their size, shape, scal...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of terminology dictionaries including Galician {{as a working}} language has undergone significant development since 1980. Recent Galician terminographic work, generated within the linguistic normalization process, has been analyzed in publications in which this fact is related to language planning (e. g. Rodríguez Río 1996; Galanes 2003). Meanwhile, theoretical changes have occurred in terminology science, especially since Cabré 1999 a, incorporating a social and communicative perspective into the treatment of terminological units. These innovations are being reflected in current applied work on terminology, {{especially with regard to}} how the relationship between terms and concepts is formulated (synonymy, polysemy, etc.), variation in terms and concepts, and the choice of sources of terminology, which are now corpus-based. The time has come for a re-evaluation of Galician terminography work in the light of these new developments, taking into account the new communicative perspective and aiming at interlingual mediation, with special attention to the quality of dictionaries. For this purpose, we have designed an evaluation system based on international <b>indicators</b> (<b>Pointer</b> 1995), communicatively oriented methods and the latest international standards (ISO) on terminographic work. The results findings of this study will affect the design of such work in the future...|$|R
