The biochemical synthesis of medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> is poorly understood but likely involves acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferases. Here, we characterize the enzyme ethanol hexanoyl transferase 1 (Eht 1) from the brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|Fatty acid {{ethyl esters}} are {{secondary}} metabolites produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{and many other}} fungi.

Information about the metabolic pathways and enzymology of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> biosynthesis, however, is very limited. In this work, we have investigated the role of a three-member S. cerevisiae gene family with moderately divergent sequences (YBR 177 c/EHT 1, YPL 095 c/EEB 1, and YMR 210 w). We demonstrate that two family members encode an acyl-coenzymeA:ethanol O-acyltransferase, an enzyme required for the synthesis of medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters. Deletion of either one or both of these genes resulted in severely reduced medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> production. Purified glutathione S-transferase-tagged Eht 1 and Eeb 1 proteins both exhibited acyl-coenzymeA:ethanol O-acyltransferase activity in vitro, as well as esterase activity. Overexpression of Eht 1 and Eeb 1 did not enhance medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> content, which is probably due to the bifunctional synthesis and hydrolysis activity. Molecular modeling of Eht 1 and Eeb 1 revealed the presence of a alpha/beta-hydrolase fold, which is generally present in the substrate-binding site of esterase enzymes. Hence, our results identify Eht 1 and Eeb 1 as novel acyl-coenzymeA:ethanol O-acyltransferases/esterases, whereas the third family member, Ymr 210 w, does not seem {{to play an important role}} in medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> formation. status: publishe...|$|E

Fractionation of grapes represents a convenient and robust method to simplify the grape matrix to enhance our {{understanding of}} the grape contribution to volatile compound production during yeast fermentation. In this study, acetone extracts of both Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon grape berries were fractionated and model wines produced by spiking aliquots of these grape fractions into model grape juice must and fermented. Non-targeted SPME-GCMS analyses of the wines showed that several medium chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> were more abundant in wines made by fermenting model musts spiked with certain fractions. Further fractionation of the non-polar fractions and fermentation of model must after addition of these fractions led to the identification of a mixture of polyunsaturated triacylglycerides that, when added to fermenting model must, increase the concentration of medium chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> in wines. Dosage-response fermentation studies with commercially-available trilinolein revealed that the concentration of medium chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> can be increased by the addition of this triacylglyceride to model musts.

Because of the {{importance}} of alcohol-induced heart muscle disease and the obscurity of its pathogenesis, this study was undertaken to determine whether <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters,</b> myocardial metabolites of ethanol recently described in our laboratory to be synthesized in cell-free extracts of rabbit myocardium, accumulate in hearts of human subjects exposed to ethanol in vivo. Lipid extracts were prepared from left ventricular samples obtained at necropsy from six subjects who had been exposed to ethanol acutely or chronically. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> were present in each extract in concentrations ranging from 9 to 115 JUM. In contrast, they were consistently absent from analogous samples obtained from hearts of abstainers (n = 5).

Moreover, both the major human <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> synthase and bovine liver glutathione transferase catalyze the formation of fatty acid ethyl esters (Vmax 105 and 98 nmol per hr per mg, respectively).

40|$|Background: Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) is {{a leading}} preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disability in North America. The stigma associated with alcohol use and abuse during pregnancy {{makes it difficult to}} obtain information on prenatal alcohol use through self-reporting. We assessed the incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure in Prince Edward Island to facilitate future public health initiatives addressing FASD. Methods: Prenatal alcohol exposure was examined via population-based collection of meconium and analysis of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> (FAEEs). <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> are nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol that are produced in the fetus. Meconium FAEE concentrations of 2. 0 nmol/g or greater are indicative of frequent prenatal alcohol exposure during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy. Samples were collected from 1307 neonates between Nov. 8, 2010, and Nov. 8, 2011, in hospitals in PEI, or from those born to mothers who resided in PEI but gave birth in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

For instance, the ester yield was 98  mol % at 70  °C compared to 88  mol % at 20  °C. This observation is in line with previous findings in our group that the maximum (equilibrium) conversion for the synthesis of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> (FAEE) from jatropha oil increased from 93  mol % at 50  °C to 98  mol % at 70  °C. This indicates that the equilibrium position of the trans-esterification reactions shifts to the right at higher temperatures, implying that the trans-esterification reaction is slightly endothermic.|$|E

The experiments were carried out in a microreactor at the reaction temperature {{in the range of}} 330 °C to 370 °C, with a pressure of 200 bar and an oil to ethyl acetate molar ratio of 1 : 50. Results showed that the residence time and temperature had a positive effect on FAEE and biodiesel yield, with the high FAEE yield of 63. 6 % and biodiesel yield of 78. 3 %...|$|E

The method involves extraction of free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> by SPE using C- 18 bonded phase columns, derivatization of free <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and related <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> with diazomethane, and GC analysis using an SP- 2340 capillary column.

Stigmadiens content, a {{parameter}} {{closely related}} to the presence of refined oils rather than a quality marker, was also considered as genuineness index. All the analyses were carried out according to the EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 (Annex II, III, IX, XVII, XX). For the determination of free acidity and peroxide index, the Slovenian lab used IOC method (ISO 660 : 2009 and ISO 3960 : 2010, respectively).|$|R

D. thesis aims to gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of non-catalytic and catalytic supercritical fluid (SCF) transesterification between ethanol and rapeseed oil to produce biodiesel mainly consisting of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> (FAEE) for future reactor scale-up and process design. Another goal was to develop a new analytical approach employ high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with the potential for in-line reaction monitoring to determine the compositions of liquid products such as FAEEs, triglyceride (TG), diglyceride (DG) and monoglyceride (MG...|$|R
