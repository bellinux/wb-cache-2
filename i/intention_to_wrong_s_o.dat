40|$|It {{is usually}} thought that {{wrongful}} acts of threat-involving coercion are wrong because they involve {{a violation of}} the freedom or autonomy of the targets of those acts. I argue here that this cannot possibly be right, and that in fact the wrongness of wrongful coercion has nothing at all to do with the effect such actions have on their targets. This negative thesis is supported by pointing out that what we say about the ethics of threatening (and thus the ethics of coercion) constrains what we can say about the ethics of warning and offering. Importantly, our favoured explanation of the wrongness of certain kinds of threatening should not commit us <b>to</b> condemning as <b>wrong</b> parallel cases of warning and offering. My positive project is to show how this can be done. I defend the claim that wrongful coercion is nothing more than the issuing of a conditional threat <b>to</b> do <b>wrong,</b> and that an agent's issuing of a conditional threat <b>to</b> do <b>wrong</b> is wrong because it constitutes motivation for that agent to adopt the announced <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> do <b>wrong.</b> The idea of explaining the wrongness of wrongful coercion in this way has gone unnoticed because we have thus far been mistaken about what a threat is. In this essay I present my moral analysis of coercion only after presenting a careful descriptive analysis of threats. On my view, it is essential to a threat that the announced intention is one that the agent does not possess before announcing it. This analysis makes it possible to elucidate the descriptive differences between threats, warnings and offers, which sets up the later project of elucidating the moral differences between them.

60|$|The matchless villainy {{of making}} men suffer for crimes {{of which they}} may {{eventually}} be acquitted is consistent with our entire system of laws--a system so complicated and contradictory that a judge simply does as he pleases, subject only to the custom of giving for his action reasons that at his option {{may or may not}} be derived from the statute. He may sternly affirm that he sits there to interpret the law as he finds it, not to make it accord with his personal notions of right and justice. Or he may declare that it could never have been the Legislature's <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> do <b>wrong,</b> and so, shielded by the useful phrase contra bonos mores, pronounce that illegal which he chooses to consider inexpedient. Or he may be guided by either of any two inconsistent precedents, as best suits his purpose. Or he may throw aside both statute and precedent, disregard good morals, and justify the judgment that he wishes to deliver by what other lawyers have written in books, and still others, without anybody's authority, have chosen to accept as a part of the law. I have in mind judges whom I have observed to do all these things in a single term of court, and could mention one who has done them all in a single decision, and that not a very long one. The amazing feature of the matter is that all these methods are lawful--made so, not by legislative enactment, but by the judges.

However, this might lead <b>to</b> <b>wrong</b> assumptions, such as considering peer aggression and bullying as similar social behaviors, or as equally affected by the social context.

40|$|While shared {{decision}} making (SDM) and adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are important, some believe they are incompatible. This study explored the mutual influence between physicians' <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> engage in SDM and their <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> follow CPGs. Embedded within a clustered randomized trial {{to assess the impact}} of training physicians in SDM about using antibiotics to treat acute respiratory tract infections, this study evaluated physicians' <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> both engage in SDM and follow CPGs. A self-administered questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior evaluated both behavioral intentions and their respective determinants (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control) at study entry and exit. We used path analysis to explore the relationships between the intentions. We conducted statistical analyses using the maximum likelihood method and the variance-covariance matrix. Goodness of fit indices encompassed the chi-square statistic, the comparative fit index and the root mean square error of approximation. We analyzed 244 responses at entry and 236 at exit. In the control group, at entry we observed that physicians' <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> engage in SDM (r =  0, t =  0. 03) did not affect their <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> follow CPGs; however, their <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> follow CPGs (r = - 0. 31 t = - 2. 82) did negatively influence their <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> engage in SDM. At exit, neither behavioral intention influenced the other. In the experimental group, at entry neither behavioral intention influenced the other; at exit, the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> engage in SDM still did not influence the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use CPGs, although the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> follow CPGs (r = - 0. 15 t = - 2. 02) slightly negatively influenced the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> engage in SDM, but this was not clinically significant.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> {{drop out}} is a concern for higher {{education}} institutions as well for their students. Students with the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out may eventually drop out and contribute towards the already high dropout rates, which are causing economic damage. Students leaving their institution have vast financial consequences for their institution, as institutions obtain grants from the government according to their success rates. Although previous {{research has been conducted}} on students’ <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out, it is limited, especially when looking at possible predictors that are specific to the South African context. This study contributes towards the gap in research regarding the possible predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. The objectives of this study were to 1) conceptualise the possible predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out according to the literature; 2) determine if self-evaluation traits (self-esteem and self-efficacy) are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out; 3) determine if student burnout and student engagement are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out; 4) determine if social support (social support from parents and general social support) are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out; and 5) determine if career decision-making difficulties are significant predictors of student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. A non-probability quota sample (N = 782) was used to investigate possible predictors of career student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out in a sample of university students. Student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out was measured by one item consisting of two categories: I have no <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out (n = 501), and I have an <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out (n = 280). These two groups were enclosed as a dependent variable in the logistic regression. The variables included in the final model predicted between 13 % (Cox and Snell) and 18 % (Nagelkerke) of the variance in <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. The {{results of this study suggest}} that self-esteem had an influence on student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. Furthermore, it was found that cynicism and dedication have a significant relationship with student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. Lastly, lack of information about ways to obtain information also indicated a significant relationship with student <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out. Thus, it may be concluded that self-esteem, burnout and engagement and lack of information about ways of obtaining information have an influence on students’ <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> drop out.

There is also strong positive association between perceived usefulness and behavioral <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> use ICT in the tourism. This shows that users are more interested to integrate ICT in their tourism activities when they think that such technologies will be helpful.

This appears to be the main means by which religion increases fertility. For example, as of 1963, Catholic couples generally had <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> have more children than Jewish couples, who in turn, tended to have more children than Protestant couples. Among Catholics, increased religiosity is associated with the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> have more children, while on the other hand, increased religiousness among Protestants is associated with the <b>intention</b> <b>to</b> have fewer children.|$|R
