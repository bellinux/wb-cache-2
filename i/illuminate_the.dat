Initial tests to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> bridge took place on 19 August 2008, and the project was officially launched after successful testing.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E

5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types.

5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
5|$|Created in 1894 as {{a result}} of {{legislation}} requiring each parish to have its own council, the council presently consists of 13 members and is responsible for a variety aspects of parish life: the general upkeep and maintenance of two recreation grounds, the village green, War Memorial, Community Centre, parish allotments, and (in part) the churchyard. The council also funds floodlights to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> church. A magazine, the Ditton Gazette, is published on a quarterly basis and is circulated among the households of the parish. In February 2006, the council was awarded Quality Parish Council status.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, {{research}} {{has continued to}} <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur.

The species {{has been shown to be}} capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E

5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} of the knowledge of Maya writing {{has been a long}} and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> content.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> crane at night.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E

5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E

Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and they continue to flee.|$|E
