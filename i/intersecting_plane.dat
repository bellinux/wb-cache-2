For example, consider that at Mach 1.3 the angle of the Mach cone formed off the body of the aircraft will be at about μ = arcsin(1/M) = 50.3° (where μ is the angle of the Mach cone, or simply Mach angle, and M is the Mach number). In this case the [...] "perfect shape" [...] is biased rearward; therefore, aircraft designed for high speed cruise usually have wings towards the rear.

When applying the transonic area rule, the condition that the plane defining the cross-section meets the longitudinal axis at the Mach angle μ no longer prescribes a unique plane for μ other than the 90° given by M = 1.

40|$|The iso-planar (Cartesian) {{tool path}} {{generation}} method {{has been used}} for several decades. However, it suffers an inherent drawback: in the region where the direction of the surface normal is close to that of the parallel intersecting planes, the <b>intersecting</b> <b>plane</b> intervals have to be reduced because of the influence of surface slopes. This causes redundant tool paths in the associated flatter regions and results in lower machining efficiency. This paper presents an algorithm that overcomes the disadvantage of the iso-planar method while keeping its advantages of robustness and simplicity. In this algorithm, the concept of isophote is applied to partition the surface into different regions. In each region the tool path side steps are adaptive to the surface features. Therefore redundant tool paths are avoided. By applying the region-by-region or global-local machining strategy, the machining efficiency is increased...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the partial-wave {{expansion}} method {{is applied to}} describe the difference-frequency pressure generated in a nonlinear scattering of two acoustic waves with an arbitrary wavefront {{by means of a}} rigid sphere. Particularly, the difference-frequency generation is analyzed in the nonlinear scattering with a spherical scatterer involving two <b>intersecting</b> <b>plane</b> waves in the following configurations: collinear, crossing at right angles, and counter-propagating. For the sake simplicity, the plane waves are assumed to be spatially located in a spherical region which diameter is smaller than the difference-frequency wavelength. Such arrangements can be experimentally accomplished in vibro-acoustography and nonlinear acoustic tomography techniques. It turns out to be that when the sphere radius is of the order of the primary wavelengths, and the downshift ratio (i. e. the ratio between the fundamental frequency and the difference-frequency) is larger than five, difference-frequency generation is mostly due to a nonlinear interaction between the primary scattered waves. The exception to this is the collinear scattering for which the nonlinear interaction of the primary incident waves is also relevant. In addition, the difference-frequency scattered pressure in all scattering configurations decays as r^- 1 r and 1 /r, whereas r is the radial distance from the scatterer to the observation point.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} problem of joint {{registration}} and deformation analysis of endometrial tissue using 3 D MRI and 2 D Trans-vaginal Ultrasound (TVUS) measurements. In addition to the different imaging techniques involved in the two modalities, this problem is complicated due to: (1) different patient pose during MRI and TVUS observations, (2) the 3 D nature of MRI and 2 D nature of TVUS measurements, (3) the unknown <b>intersecting</b> <b>plane</b> for TVUS in MRI volume, and (4) the potential deformation of endometrial tissue during TVUS measurement process. Focusing on {{the shape of the}} tissue, we use expert manual segmentation of its boundaries in the two modalities and apply, with modification, recent developments in shape analysis of parametric surfaces to this problem. First, we extend the 2 D TVUS curves to generalized cylindrical surfaces through replication, and then we compare them with MRI surfaces using elastic shape analysis. This shape analysis provides a simultaneous registration (optimal re-parameterization) and deformation (geodesic) between any two parametrized surfaces. Specifically, it provides optimal curves on MRI surfaces that match with the original TVUS curves. This framework results in an accurate quantification and localization of the deformable endometrial cells for radiologists, and growth characterization for gynecologists and obstetricians.

40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} (SPD) {{has been the}} subject of intensive investigations in recent years because of the unique physical and mechanical properties of ultrafine grained (UFG) materials fabricated by this technique. Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is the most frequently used SPD technique due to its efficiency in grain refinement. The deformation mechanism during the ECAP process is very complicated and it has always been assumed to be a simple shear along the <b>intersecting</b> <b>plane</b> of two ECAP channels in most published literatures. A number of experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that the simple shear based theory could not accurately predict the microstructure development, plastic strain (or strain rate) distributions and texture evolutions. Even though many studies have contributed to understanding of the deformation mechanism of the ECAP process, some research areas have still not been fully explored, such as texture modelling. Up to now, few texture simulations in the literatures have been carried out based on the real full-scale ECAP process and most of them were conducted using the simple shear theory. Therefore, a systematic study on modeling of texture evolution of the real ECAP process and investigation of the effects of the ECAP parameters on texture evolution are essential. In the present study, a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model has been developed to offer a systematic understanding of the deformation behavior and texture evolutions of single crystals, bicrystals and a polycrystal during the full scale ECAP processes. The developed CPFEM model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} (SPD) techniques have attracted significant {{attention in the}} last two decades due to its capacity of producing bulk ultra-fine grained (UFG) or nanostructured materials, by imposing very high plastic strain. Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP), or equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE), is one of the most widely used SPD techniques. During ECAP, a sample is pressed through a die which consists of two channels with equal cross-section intersecting at an angle varying from 60 degrees to 150 degrees. Since the cross-section geometry of the sample remains nearly unchanged, the materials can be deformed to a very high strain by repeating the process. The deformation mechanism of ECAP is very complicated and it is dependent on the die geometry and material properties. It has been assumed as simple shear on the <b>intersecting</b> <b>plane</b> of two channels at ideal conditions, such as frictionless, perfectly plastic material and very sharp outer corner. However, from the view of texture evolutions, many experimental results have revealed the deviation from the ideal simple shear. Therefore, an insight into the deformation mechanism and orientation changes in the real ECAP case is still essential. In the present work, a comprehensive study based on the crystal plasticity finite element model (CPFEM) has been conducted to investigate the stress state, plastic strain, required load and crystallographic orientation development history of aluminum single crystals subjected to ECAP. The influence factors such as ECAP die geometry, frictional conditions and initial crystallographic orientations have been studied in detail. 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
