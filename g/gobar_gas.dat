50|$|In 1948, {{the state}} of Dhrangadhra was made part of the Jhalawad {{district}} in Saurashtra. In 1956 it became part of Gujarat. Dhrangadhra also contains the <b>Gobar</b> <b>gas</b> plant, which is located at Navalgadh village.|$|E
50|$|The {{other way}} to reduce {{pressure}} on the forest is through building <b>gobar</b> (<b>gas</b> plants). An {{increasing number of people}} are building bio-gas plants. However, the Appiko activists are more interested in those people who are from poorer sections - who cannot afford gas plants - so they emphasize chulhas.|$|E
50|$|The {{school is}} set in a 2 acre {{farmland}} adjacent to the Mananthavady Road in Mysore city. There are five innovative learning areas, one auditorium, one science laboratory and one small library. There are separate dormitories for boys and girls. A modern kitchen equipped with <b>Gobar</b> <b>gas,</b> Astra stove and LPG gas makes hygienic and nutritious food for the children and the volunteer-teachers.|$|E
50|$|It {{is located}} in Mary's Corner, behind the Sacred Heart Girl's Higher Secondary School. The Campus houses six buildings: Britto Building, Don Bosco Hall, Main Building, Office, Anbu Illam and Old Hostel Building. It has a big {{football}} ground, two basketball courts, a volleyball court and a Kho-kho Ground. The campus has been operating its own eco-friendly <b>Gobar</b> <b>gas</b> plant ever since its inception. The campus also includes the St. Antony's Church and burial ground. The Annai Auditorium was constructed during 1995-96.|$|E
50|$|The {{council has}} planned clean and {{beautiful}} malkapur campaign for 2013-14 under Sujal Nirajal campaign, Maharashtra Govt. irrigation {{and health and}} hygiene department gives grants to the people constructs toilet, but weaker sections cannot take benefit from it. The council itself implemented its own scheme to grants 10,000/- rs for weaker sections, peasants and farmers. As 40% farmers in the town/ city carry animal husbandry so to develop the campaign of bio-gas and <b>gobar</b> <b>gas,</b> the council itself is ready to give grants of 10,000/- rs to the farmer.|$|E
5000|$|The goshala (cow {{protection}} centre) shelters around 25 cows (both milk yielding and dry cows). The milk {{is consumed}} by {{the residents of the}} Orphan Home and the Old Age Home and excess is sold in nearby villages, with the marginal generated income being utilised for meeting the expenses of the institution. A <b>Gobar</b> <b>gas</b> Plant has been constructed which meets 90% of the fuel needs of the Old Age Home. Organic manure is produced by vermin compost method. The manure is used in the kitchen garden maintained at Sevalaya and also marketed.|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of producing methane gas from cow-dung and other wastes {{and using it}} as fuel for various, purposes has received considerable attention in India during the last decade. In {{the light of the}} growing energy shortage that the country faces <b>gobar</b> <b>gas</b> is being cited as having great potential for answering the energy needs of rural areas. In this climate it is relevant to explore the desirability of <b>gobar</b> <b>gas</b> technology from the village perspective since, after all, it is the farmer in 2 ̆ 7 the countryside who, ultimately decides whether or not to invest in a <b>gobar</b> <b>gas</b> plant. This paper, based on the responses of residents of a village in Satara district called 2 ̆ 7 Sugao 2 ̆ 7, attempts some general statements regarding the constraints on the adoption of <b>gobar</b> <b>gas</b> technology in rural areas. Its findings are that social, spatial, cultural and attitudinal criteria are as important as technical ones in the assimilation (or rejection) of new technolog...|$|E
30|$|Cow dung is {{the major}} source of biogas or <b>gobar</b> <b>gas</b> {{production}} in India. The total population of female cows in India is 190.90 million out of which 151 million are indigenous whilst 39 million are crossbreed (Livestock Census 2012). Cow dung generated from 3 – 5  cattle/day can run a simple 8 – 10  m 3 biogas plant which is able to produce 1.5 – 2  m 3 biogas per day which is sufficient for the family 6 – 8 persons, can cook meal for 2 or 3 times or may light two lamps for 3  h or run a refrigerator for all day and can also operate a 3 -KW motor generator for 1  h (Werner et al. 1989). A 1 -m 3 biogas plant has produced 28.78  l/kg (0.028  m 3) and 32.76  l/kg (0.032  m 3) of biogas respectively when daily feed with 22  kg of dung/m 3 which is mixed with equal amount of water with 9 – 10  % of total solids. The maximum production of biogas from that plant is 39.00  l/kg (0.039  m 3) and 40.04  l/kg (0.04  m 3) respectively when operated at the temperature of 23.5  °C (Kalia and Singh 2004). On the other hand, farmer also gains 13.87 metric tons of organic fertiliser per year from the biogas plant. This co-production of biofertiliser also allow farmer to recover the initial investment for setting up of a biogas plant (Sharma 2011).|$|E
40|$|Diversification of fuel {{sources is}} {{imperative}} to address the energy security, climate change, and sustainable development issues; therefore, {{it is essential to}} address the energy crisis through the extensive utilization of abundant renewable energy resources, such as biomass energy, solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy. Improving energy services for poor households in developing countries {{remains one of the most}} pressing challenges facing the development community. Earlier studies suggest in South Asia the households are likely to follow the energy ladder comprising fuels like dung, crop residue, firewood, kerosene, <b>gobar</b> <b>gas,</b> LPG, and electricity for cooking purposes. Evidence suggests that while it is possible to observe such transition in urban and semi-urban areas, the change is very slow in rural areas. In rural Pakistan, the access to commercial energy resources is limited, the majority of the households still heavily rely on traditional methods of using wood, animal waste and crop waste for domestic fuel needs. Efficiencies of use are very low and most of the potential is wasted because of non-scientific conventional technologies. Consequently there is an obligatory need to develop modern bio-energy technologies since renewable resources may serve to supplement the long-term energy needs of Pakistan to a significant level. Though the bio-resource base of Pakistan is substantial, its contribution to useful energy is low. In this paper we called attention to issues and challenges in biomass utilization for energy in Pakistan in context of sustainable development. This paper has identified areas in Pakistan where there is considerable scope to modernize biomass energy production delivery systems to provide varied energy carriers such as electricity, industrial and domestic fuel and gases. Barriers are examined over the whole biomass energy spectrum and policy issue and institutional roles and responsibilities are discussed.
