40|$|During avian {{embryonic}} development, terminal erythroid differentiation {{occurs in}} the circulation. Some of the key events, such as the induction of erythroid 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -BPG), carbonic anhydrase (CAII), and pyrimidine 5 '-nucleotidase (P 5 N) synthesis are oxygen dependent (Baumann R, Haller EA, Schöning U, and Weber M, Dev Biol 116 : 548 - 551, 1986; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S</b> and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 280 : R 870 -R 878, 2001; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Carey C, Martin K, and Baumann R, J Exp Biol 202 : 2787 - 2795, 1999; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Glombitza S, Götz R, and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 982 -R 989, 1996; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Hille R, Götz R, and Baumann R, Blood 91 : 3052 - 3058, 1998; Million D, Zillner P, and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 261 : R 1188 -R 1196, 1991) in an indirect way: hypoxia stimulates the release of norepinephrine (NE) /adenosine into the circulation (Dragon et al., J Exp Biol 202 : 2787 - 2795, 1999; Dragon et al., Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 982 -R 989, 1996). This leads via erythroid beta-adrenergic/adenosine A(2) receptor activation to a cAMP signal inducing several proteins in a transcription-dependent manner (Dragon et al., Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 982 -R 989, 1996; Dragon et al., Blood 91 : 3052 - 3058, 1998; Glombitza <b>S,</b> <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Berghammer M, Pannermayr M, and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 973 -R 981, 1996). To understand how the cAMP-dependent processes are initiated, we screened an erythroid cDNA library for cAMP-regulated genes. We detected three genes that were strongly upregulated (> 5 -fold) by cAMP in definitive and primitive red blood cells. They are homologous to the mammalian Tob, Ifr 1, and Fos proteins. In addition, the genes are induced in the intact embryo during short-term hypoxia. Because the genes are regulators of proliferation and differentiation in other cell types, we suggest that cAMP might promote general differentiating processes in erythroid cells, thereby allowing adaptive modulation of the latest steps of erythroid differentiation during developmental hypoxia...|$|R

The present study aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to local ambient temperature and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>blood</b> pressure in China. Methods: We analyzed the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data of 71, 763 children from 2010 Chinese National Survey on Students 2 ̆ 7 Construction and Health (CHNSCH), and local annual average ambient temperature, relative humidity, air pollutants data from China Meteorological Administration and Ministry of Environment Protection of China.

Results: The results showed that decrease of ambient temperature was negatively associated with increase of both SBP and DBP in Chinese children while adjusting for individual characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, air pollutants and relative humidity.
