500|$|Whether one of {{the three}} texts was the {{standard}} version, from which the other two were originally translated, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> has remained controversial. Letronne attempted to show in 1841 that the Greek version, the product of the Egyptian government under the Macedonian Ptolemies, was the original. Among recent authors, John Ray has stated that [...] "the hieroglyphs were the most important of the scripts on the stone: they were there for the gods to read, and the more learned of their priesthood". Philippe Derchain and Heinz Josef Thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously, while Stephen Quirke sees in the decree [...] "an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions". Richard Parkinson points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life. The fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why its decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected, especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E

500|$|Why Sibelius {{should have}} failed to prepare The Wood Nymph for {{publication}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> has perplexed scholars. On the advice of Ferruccio Busoni, Sibelius in 1895 offered The Wood Nymph to the Russian music publisher Mitrofan Belyayev {{but it was not}} published. Murtomäki has suggested that Sibelius, despite having been fond of The Wood Nymph, was [...] "unsure about the true value" [...] of his output from the 1890s, an ambivalence that is perhaps best illustrated by the piecemeal publication history of, and multiple revisions to, the four Lemminkäinen legends (appearing in the composer's 1911 diary under a list of works to be rewritten, The Wood Nymph, too, seems to have been scheduled by Sibelius for a reexamination, albeit one that never came to pass). Scholars have offered a number of explanations as to why Sibelius may have [...] "turned his back" [...] on his early compositions. Perhaps, as master, he looked back on the works of his youth as technically [...] "inferior" [...] to his mature output; or, as evolving artist, he sought distance from passionate, nationalistic exclamations as he developed his own, unique musical style and aimed to transition from [...] "local hero" [...] to [...] "international composer"; or, as elder statesman, he feared he might have [...] "revealed himself too much" [...] in early [...] "confessional" [...] works, such as En saga, Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island, and The Wood Nymph. In the absence of any new information from Sibelius's papers, however, the reason why The Wood Nymph was never published ultimately [...] "appears doomed to remain a subject of speculation".|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} {{released}} as a single, [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] received a mixed response by reviewers when commenting on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Melbourne based webzine [...] reviewer Andrew Weaver {{comments on the}} song's musical layering, coupling the song with [...] "Wishing on the Same Moon" [...] and comments that the layering in the two songs gives the music [...] "genuine depth of sound and taking the veteran group to new places". CitySearch Sydney also made reference to the likeness to [...] "Wishing on the Same Moon", but notes that what sets the two songs apart is [...] "a serviceable fade-out cacophony of keys and guitar". Music journalist Chris Leonard of UK magazine Rock Louder praises the live performance of the song while Powderfinger performed in Glasgow on 11 December 2007. J. Watson of [...] comments that the song, when performed live at The Sydney Opera House Forecourt for charity on 31 October 2007, was [...] "another highlight of the evening". Fellow reviewer from Fasterlouder, ShahXerxes, comments on the song's [...] "sparse Pink Floyd-esque sound which echoes through [...] "Who Really Cares", as clever a rock ballad as the band have ever written." [...] Andrew Ramadge of Mess + Noise echoed the comments of similarities to Pink Floyd, and also Neil Young, stating [...] "where psych-gospel organ and wailing guitar billow around Fanning’s vocals like a lost track from Dark Side of the Moon". Though most of the critical response has been positive, the song has also received criticism from UK reviewer Matthias Scherer of Noize Makes Enemies. Scherer notes that the song's title [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> [...] "should have been asked before recording, not during", though this comment refers both to the song itself, and the whole album of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence.|$|E

2500|$|After Indian {{independence}} {{and until the}} end of the Cold War, the relationship between the US and India was cold and often thorny. This was due to the closeness of the US towards India's arch-rival Pakistan during the War, with Pakistan joining the US-led Western Bloc in 1954. India's policy of being not aligned with either the US or the Soviet Union, but maintaining close ties with the latter, also impacted relations. American officials perceived India's policy of non-alignment negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position. Grady told the State Department in December 1947 that he had informed Nehru [...] "that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> cannot be straddled and that India should get on the democratic side immediately.|$|E
2500|$|What we {{are left}} with is an {{incomplete}} picture of de Hory, a complex but secretive man unable to shed his outlaw image, an adept role player, charismatic as many con-men tend to be, and whose notions of morality conformed to the exigencies (being a refugee, stateless, and subject to the vagaries of an artist’s life) he believed threatened his survival. De Hory expressed regret for his illicit career, taking advantage of others, though his rationalizations assuaged his sense of guilt, characterizing his criminality as an optionless necessity, survival by the only means he knew – his artistic skill. He famously asked, “Who would prefer a bad original to a good fake?” It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> goes beyond taking ownership of his law-breaking past. His underlying implication is a broader. Whenever authorship or authenticity of an artwork is in question, that reevaluation process forces us to reexamine how we define art, and by extension, our values as a society – an unintended result of their crimes that keeps us honest.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, {{opened the}} test cocks on the tubes.
