5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> imperial orders to evacuate; fought its way down to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946.

5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936.

40|$|This paper derives a joint Lagrande Multiplier (LM) test which {{simultaneously}} {{tests for}} the absence of spatial lag dependence and random individual effects in a panel data regression model. It turns out that this LM statistic is the sum of two standard LM statistics.

This paper also derives two conditional LM tests. The first one tests for the absence of random individual effects without <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> possible presence of spatial lag dependence.

5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are <b>ignored,</b> <b>the</b> first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers <b>ignored</b> <b>the</b> evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E
