5|$|ABA Games is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic {{games in the}} genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and are set <b>in</b> <b>random</b> rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.|$|E
5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are <b>in</b> <b>random</b> orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically {{in at least one}} dimension.|$|E

5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up <b>in</b> <b>random</b> directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned <b>in</b> <b>random</b> directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization.

5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through.

Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings.

From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden ground floors.

5|$|Chrono Trigger {{features}} standard role-playing {{video game}} gameplay. The player controls the protagonist {{and his companions}} in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Triggers gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing <b>in</b> <b>random</b> encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.|$|E

Such results, some old and some new, are derived from two general theorems that cover structures decomposed into elementary “components” in either the labelled or the unlabelled case, when the generating function of components has a singularity of a logarithmic type.

For example, if {{a group of people}} ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player character can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and Five Finger Fillet; and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.|$|E

In City 17, an Eastern European city, Civil Protection units are seen frequently, often conducting random searches of apartment blocks, interrogating human citizens and engaging <b>in</b> <b>random</b> police brutality. The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control. The citizens themselves are all clad in blue uniforms and live in designated apartment blocks. Citizens are shown to be moved around to different cities or locales at the Combine's will, using passenger trains. Vortigaunts, alien creatures from the original Half-Life, are also shown to have been enslaved, and are observed in various jobs such as janitors. According to , the Combine are draining the Earth's oceans, minerals and resources to be used on other Combine worlds; both the water levels along the coast of City 17 and later coastal levels are also greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity <b>in</b> <b>random</b> directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by the computer, {{in a series of}} predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different engine size classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc engine size. Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up <b>in</b> <b>random</b> order. Every race is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, the positions of the computer-controlled teams are immediately locked in and they are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they will get a trophy ranging from bronze to gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E
