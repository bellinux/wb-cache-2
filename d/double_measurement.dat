40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{manufacturing}} defects, our interest is the calculation methodologies {{that are used to}} quantify these defects. The manufacturing defects can be divided into two categories: machining defects and positioning defects. A <b>double</b> <b>measurement</b> method is principally used to quantify separately machining and positioning defect. The first measurement is operated inside a machine tool just after the final cutting step. The second measurement is realised outside of the machine tool (e. g. on a coordinate measuring machine - CMM).

40|$|International audienceIn noise control, {{identification}} of the source velocity field remains a major problem open to investigation. Consequently, methods such as nearfield acoustical holography (NAH), principal source projection, the inverse frequency response function and hybrid NAH have been developed. However, these methods require free field conditions that are often difficult to achieve in practice. This article presents an alternative method known as inverse patch transfer functions, designed to identify source velocities and developed {{in the framework of}} the European SILENCE project. This method is based on the definition of a virtual cavity, the <b>double</b> <b>measurement</b> of the pressure and particle velocity fields on the aperture surfaces of this volume, divided into elementary areas called patches and the inversion of impedances matrices, numerically computed from a modal basis obtained by FEM. Theoretically, the method is applicable to sources with complex 3 D geometries and measurements can be carried out in a non-anechoic environment even in the presence of other stationary sources outside the virtual cavity.

There was a 44 per cent median increase in the modulus of elasticity from compression No. 1 to compression No. 10.

40|$|We {{describe}} a current-mode circuit for Gabor-type image filtering {{which uses a}} differential representation where positive (on) and negative (off) signals are encoded using separate channels. Previous current-mode implementations represented positive and negative signals as variations around a constant bias at every pixel. However, this bias current has several disadvantages. First, variations in it introduce significant additive fixed pattern noise to the output. Second, it dissipates power even with zero input. Third, if the output is encoded using the Address Event Representation, the bias current sets up a quiescent firing rate which loads the bus. The architecture proposed here alleviates these problems since a zero signal is encoded as nearly zero current in both channels. On the other hand, the transistor count and the address space are <b>doubled.</b> <b>Measurements</b> from a 1 by 25 pixel array with a cell size of 64 μm by 540 μm was fabricated in the AMI 1. 5 μm process available through MOSIS.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to contribute}} to the explanation of internal inter-group conflict, more narrowly of the conflict between majority and minority communal groups. It develops arguments that suggest the importance of inter-group economic inequality in bringing about inter-group hostility, and works toward providing empirical support for this causal connection by primarily relying on a large-N cross-national research design. This design culminates in multivariate regression models. Because of data availability issues, the task of addressing multiple potential determinants of the inter-group conflict advocated in the literature has been implemented by involving three datasets, of which two serve group-level analyses and one confines itself to the country level. The datasets are compilations of previous scholarly work, mainly based on the Ethnic Power Relations, Minorities at Risk (MAR), and Quality of Government data, with the addition of some new measurements, such as the main explanatory variable, economic inequality. Findings from all three datasets support the impact of horizontal economic inequality on inter-group hostility, measured either as group grievance or violent conflict. This <b>double</b> <b>measurement</b> of the inter-group conflict, as grievance and as violence, answers an intuition that not all low-to-medium strength hostility is doomed to develop into violent conflict. In fortunate conditions, the issues can be solved, or compromises may be reached without turning to violence. A large number of variables in the regression models operationalize constellations that influence the evolution of conflicts toward either peaceful solutions or armed collision. In general, the models provide support for previous expectations promoted in the literature regarding the beneficial impact of democracy and political equality of the groups, but also for the adverse impact of the opportunities for insurrection. Some institutional variables have been defined in ways that they allow for distinguishing between the outcomes of two brands of policies recommended for heterogeneous societies, as advised by Lijphart and Horowitz. Further benefits from the project include the construction of an almost complete list of communal groups worldwide, with 860 groups, which usefully contextualizes MAR’s selection of 282 minority groups. Data also allowed for comparing the causes of communal and social conflicts...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the results of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in terms of intra-AAA pressure and clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: 0. 014 -inch guide-wire-mounted tip-pressure sensors were used for direct intra-aneurysm sac pressure measurement (DISP) through translumbar puncture of the AAA. Mean Pressure Index was calculated (MPI) {{as the percentage of}} mean intra-aneurysm pressure relative to the simultaneous mean intra-aortic pressure. The pressure sensor was evaluated in vitro, in an aneurysm model, showing good agreement with model output (2 mm Hg). Measurements within aneurysm thrombus agreed well with the simultaneous ones from the model’s lumen (1 mm Hg). Intra-observer variability of DISP in 15 patients undergoing <b>double</b> <b>measurement,</b> by separate punctures of the AAA, showed MPI median variability of 0 % (r=. 962, p<. 0001). Median MPI in patients with shrinking (n= 11), unchanged (n= 10) and expanding (n= 9) aneurysms without endoleaks at least 1 year after EVAR was 19 %, 30 % and 59 %, respectively. Pulse pressure was also higher in expanding compared to the shrinking AAAs (10 vs 2 mm Hg, p<. 0001). Seven of the 10 patients with unchanged AAAs underwent further imaging follow-up after DISP; 2 expanded (MPIs 47 % - 63 %), 4 shrank (MPI 21 %- 30 %) and 1 continued unchanged (MPI 14 %). Type II endoleaks (6 patients, 7 DISP) seemed to be a varied entity with different degrees of AAA pressurization, even in the same patient at different occasions (range MPI 22 %- 92 %). Successful endoleak embolization resulted in pressure reduction. Between 1998 and 2001, 168 consecutive patients with non-ruptured AAAs were treated by EVAR (n= 117) and open repair (OR) due to anatomical restrictions for EVAR (group A, n= 40) or young age with long life-expectancy (n= 11). Thirty-day mortality in EVAR (n= 117), OR group A and B was 2. 6 %, 15 % and 0 %, respectively. EVAR patients had higher ASA classifications (p<. 0001). Late survival was not different between the groups and late reinterventions, mainly endovascular, were more frequent in EVAR. CONCLUSIONS: DISP is a reliable and reproducible technique for measuring intra-AAA pressure. It may become an important tool for EVAR evaluation by detecting EVAR outcomes early. High pressure is associated with AAA expansion, while low pressure with shrinkage. EVAR provides good results for AAA treatment even with the inclusion of high risk patients. The wide application of EVAR may affect the results of OR, since this tends to be performed in older patients with severe comorbidity and challenging anatomy. OR continues to the first-option for low-risk young patients...|$|E
