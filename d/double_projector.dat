50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Reuben Berkley Benjamin, and filed its first patent for an {{electric}} lamp socket in 1898. The company went on to manufacture various other electrical products. One of Benjamin's most notable products was their series of non-contact fire alarm horns, introduced in the early 1920s. They were available in flush-mount, single, and <b>double</b> <b>projector</b> versions, in either red or gray. These horns were mainly used by IBM, and later SimplexGrinnell up until the 1960s. In 1958, Benjamin was bought out by Thomas Industries, Inc.|$|E
40|$|Visiting {{the outer}} space freely was the human {{imagination}} until recently. Virtual environments of the remote sensing satellites {{will be the}} {{way for people to}} “visit ” the space to study remote sensing satellites ’ motion and interrelationships. This paper assembles a scalable, immersive virtual environment system called the Virtual Remote Sensing Satellite Simulation System (V-RSS) that allows users to visualize objects and physical phenomena in near-earth space and provides a brief sketch of the design thinking of such system. The software architecture of the V-RSS is designed incorporate the various simulation, analysis and visualization elements of the system into a single, integrated environment. The system employs a VR system with <b>double</b> <b>projector</b> to build immense 3 -D environment and applied to some actual space projects and they demonstrate the efficacy of the concept and the processing. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{joint project}} between the Interdept. Research Center of the University of Padova (CIRGEO) and Dr. Richard. M. Levy, {{teaching}} Professor at the Faculty of Environmental Design of the University of Calgary (Canada), has been undertaken aimed to {{the generation of}} a full 3 D model of an historical building and the surrounding environment, based on a terrestrial laser scanning survey. The main goal of this project {{is to provide a}} 3 D representation where two different contents are merged together: the object’s geometry on one hand and a set of related historical and cultural information on the other hand. Indeed, through suitable VR authoring tools, like the Virtools Dev. software, it is now possible to build VR environments around laser scanning-based 3 D models, which allow the user with a certain level of interaction with the model itself. This solution opens interesting perspectives towards the use of 3 D models as a mean to promote the national Cultural Heritage content among remote people: portable cave systems, comprising of <b>double</b> <b>projector</b> devices, stereo 3 D converter and a wide screen display, could be profitable employed to this end. In this paper we report the first results of our VR project, i. e. creating a TLS-based 3 D model of the church of Pozzoveggiani, an ancient historical building located 15 km south of Padua (Italy). The second stage of the work, i [...] e. the generation of an interactive VR environment based on such 3 D model is still in progress at current date. Therefore we will focus here on different issues related to the generation of a fully closed model of a complex structure, a situation frequently found in the Cultural Heritage field...|$|E
