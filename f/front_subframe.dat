25|$|One notable {{change was}} the <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> {{assembly}} — {{as compared with}} Ford, Chrysler and AMC, in whose cars the entire front suspension was integrated with the bodyshell, a separate subframe housing the powertrain and front suspension (similar to the front part of the frame of GM's full-size, full-framed vehicles) replaced the earlier style. Although the <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> design was unique for the Nova, the Camaro introduced a year earlier {{was the first to}} incorporate such a design; the redesigned Nova was pushed a year ahead to 1968 instead of 1969. The sales brochure claimed 15 powertrain choices for coupes and a dozen for sedans. Options included power brakes and steering, Four-Season or Comfort-Car air conditioning, rear shoulder belts, and head restraints. There were a few Chevrolet Novas built with the 194 ci (3.1 L), the same motor that had been used in the previous generations of the Chevy II. Sales of the 1968 Chevy Nova fell by half. In 1969 Chevrolet dropped the Chevy II portion of its compact car's name; it was now known simply as the Chevrolet Nova.|$|E
2500|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} MacPherson struts, with six-cylinder cars using an aluminium <b>front</b> <b>subframe.</b> Aluminium {{is used for}} the steering knuckles, outer strut tube and the spring pads, resulting in a weight saving of [...] V8 models also use aluminium in the steering box and several suspension links, to compensate for the heavier steel subframe.|$|E
2500|$|The {{editors of}} The Motor opined the [...] "more you study both the general layout and the detail {{features}} of the Pacer, the more convinced you become that the men who dreamed it up and decided to make it actually do drive around in crowded cities and consequently realise from their own experience that the traditional big barges are less and less easy to navigate through our streets." [...] Car and Driver road testers noted the Pacer's [...] "smooth and quiet ride can probably {{be attributed to a}} <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> that isolates the passenger capsule from engine, suspension and steering loads" [...] making the car [...] "eminently stable and controllable, with its rack-and-pinion steering and wide track." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{approximate}} alloying {{composition of}} 531 tubing is 1.5% Mn, 0.25% Mo, 0.35% C, and {{is similar to}} the old British BS970 En 16/18 steel (EN 16 is similar to grade BS970 605M36). Its mechanical properties and response to heat treatment are broadly similar to the AISI 4130 standard alloy steel, also used for bicycle frames, motorcycles, as well as aviation and motor-sport. This material was used to form the <b>front</b> <b>subframes</b> on the Jaguar E-Type of the 1960s.|$|R

Reynolds 531 remains {{for many years}} {{at the forefront of}} alloy steel tubing technology and is used to form the <b>front</b> <b>subframes</b> on the Jaguar E-Type during the 1960s. Before the introduction of more exotic materials such as aluminium, titanium or composites, Reynolds is considered the dominant maker of high end materials for bicycle frames. According to the company, 27 winners of the Tour de France have won riding on Reynolds tubing.|$|R

2500|$|Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several {{features}} {{are unique to}} the hybrid. In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, brakes, and air conditioning that are fully operational once {{the internal combustion engine}} is deactivated. The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both. A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout. The hybrid drivetrain has also necessitated a redesigned <b>front</b> <b>subframe,</b> along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings. This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk. Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27cd, an [...] "Eco" [...] operating mode for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM). Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including [...] "Hybrid" [...] badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted [...] "Hybrid Synergy Drive" [...] logo.|$|E
2500|$|A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback {{was used}} in the 1992 movie Wayne's World, and again in the 1993 movie Wayne's World 2. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and {{aftermarket}} chrome-plated steel wheels in the rear. It featured a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior, as well as a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the overhead light in the headliner. The car is used throughout both movies, however, the car is seen the most in the first Wayne's World movie in the introductory scene, where Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) inserts a cassette tape into the stereo of the Pacer, and Wayne, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), and his friends rock out and head bang to [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] by Queen. Modifications to the movie car included interior camera mounts, tow hooks welded to the <b>front</b> <b>subframe,</b> and the removal of the HVAC system. The rear wheel wells were modified to accommodate aftermarket speaker boxes, the aforementioned licorice dispenser was added, and an additional cup holder was added to the Pacer's dashboard. The car used an AMC 258 c.i. six-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission.|$|E

50|$|Another {{technique}} used to increase isolation {{is to use}} an isolated subframe. This splits the system with an additional mass/spring/damper system. This doubles the high frequency attenuation rolloff, {{at the cost of}} introducing additional low frequency modes which may cause the low frequency behaviour to deteriorate. This is commonly used in the rear suspensions of cars with Independent Rear Suspension (IRS), and in the <b>front</b> <b>subframes</b> of some cars. The graph (see illustration) shows the force into the body for a subframe that is rigidly bolted to the body compared with the red curve that shows a compliantly mounted subframe. Above 42 Hz the compliantly mounted subframe is superior, but below that frequency the bolted in subframe is better.|$|R
5000|$|The GTM Rossa is a Mini based 2+2 kit car by GTM Cars. [...] The car {{was based}} on two <b>front</b> mini <b>subframes,</b> with the {{steering}} being locked on the rear subframe. The Mark 1 car was produced from 1987 to 1990, and the Mark 2 car was produced beginning in 1990.|$|R

50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Endeavor is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’s PS platform. It uses RISE unibody {{structure}} that employs extensive reinforcement for additional passenger {{protection in the}} event of a collision. Robust <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> members are connected with a dash panel crossmember and a strong, front steel crossmember to help create a rigid, boxed <b>front</b> <b>subframe</b> area. Reinforced side sill members also help disperse energy {{in the event of}} a collision. High-strength steel crossmembers across the floor also help absorb side impact energy and help protect occupants. Extensive use of energy absorbing materials appear on the interior and headliner and are used to cover the inside of the front center and rear pillars and help reduce the possibility of injury during a collision.|$|E

50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Galant is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’ PS platform. It uses a {{straight}} frame-rail RISE design body that absorbs and disperses {{energy in the}} event of a collision and offers improved structural rigidity to prevent longitudinal twisting. It features integrated, energy absorbing crumple zones and strategically applied reinforcements at key body points and steel side impact door beams. Every opening in the body, including doors, boot and engine compartment, is reinforced to help resist the bending and twisting forces. The body employs higher tensile strength steel panels to reduce body weight and increase body rigidity.
