5|$|<b>Fluorocarbon</b> gases are {{generally}} greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 20,000 {{times that of}} carbon dioxide. Organofluorine compounds persist in the environment due {{to the strength of}} the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants synthesize organofluorine poisons that deter herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial <b>fluorocarbon</b> production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and <b>fluorocarbon</b> based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
50|$|Perfluorocyclohexane or Dodecafluorocyclohexane is a {{chemical}} which {{belongs to the}} class of <b>Fluorocarbons,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} perfluorocarbons or PFCs. <b>Fluorocarbons</b> and their derivatives are useful fluoropolymers, refrigerants, solvents, and anesthetics.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{of the destruction of}} ozone by <b>fluorocarbons</b> is described and models for predicting future levels of stratospheric ozone are discussed. Measurement of various stratospheric constituents, particularly ozone, <b>fluorocarbons,</b> and other chlorine compounds, is also considered. Industrial and governmental activities in this area are described...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fluorocarbons</b> {{are also}} lipophobic/oleophobic in {{addition}} to being hydrophobic.|$|R
5|$|The Montreal Protocol, {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. <b>Fluorocarbon</b> gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E
25|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} are <b>fluorocarbon</b> derivatives, as {{they are}} closely structurally related to fluorocarbons. However, they also possess new atoms such as nitrogen, iodine, or ionic groups, such as perfluorinated carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|A {{fluoropolymer}} is a <b>fluorocarbon</b> based polymer {{with multiple}} strong carbon–fluorine bonds. It {{is characterized by}} a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. Fluoropolymers were discovered in 1938 by Dr. Roy Plunkett when he accidentally polymerized tetrafluoroethylene to form polytetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
40|$|Application of gas-solid {{chromatography}} techiques to {{the separation of}} low molecular weight <b>fluorocarbons</b> incorporates a number of advantages over previous analysis techniques. These advantages include isothermal operation up to 200 [deg], elimination of substrate bleed, stability of the base line, minimum retention times and convenience. The relative retention volumes with respect to perfluoroethane {{of a number of}} low molecular weight <b>fluorocarbons</b> as a function of column support material and operating conditios are reported. The separation of a number of important species which are formed during the thermal oxidation of low molecular weight <b>fluorocarbons</b> are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene film {{capacitors}} {{are made}} with a dielectric of the synthetic fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a hydrophobic solid <b>fluorocarbon.</b> They are manufactured both as metallized and as film/foil types, although poor adherence to the film makes metallization difficult. PTFE is often known by the DuPont trademark Teflon.|$|E
25|$|PTFE is a <b>fluorocarbon</b> solid, {{as it is}} a high-molecular-weight {{compound}} consisting wholly {{of carbon}} and fluorine. PTFE is hydrophobic: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated London dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid.|$|E
25|$|TCE is {{also used}} in the {{manufacture}} of a range of <b>fluorocarbon</b> refrigerants such as 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane more commonly known as HFC 134a. TCE was also used in industrial refrigeration applications due to its high heat transfer capabilities and its low temperature specification. Many industrial refrigeration applications used TCE up to the 1990s in applications such as car testing facilities.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, fluorosurfactants are not {{amphiphilic}} or detergents because <b>fluorocarbons</b> are not lipophilic.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s {{there was}} a lot of {{interest}} in <b>fluorocarbons</b> as anesthetics. The research did not come to anything, but a lot of effort was expended on the vital issue of flammability, and showed that the tested <b>fluorocarbons</b> were not flammable in air in any proportion, though most are in neat oxygen and neat nitrous oxide (gases of importance in anesthesiology).|$|R

25|$|Tetrafluoromethane, {{also known}} as carbon tetrafluoride, is the {{simplest}} <b>fluorocarbon</b> (CF4). It has a very high bond strength {{due to the nature}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or halomethane. Because of the multiple carbon–fluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in tetrafluoromethane has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon–fluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. Tetrafluoromethane is a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. <b>Fluorocarbon</b> anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or <b>fluorocarbon,</b> may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E

500|$|Glide waxes {{enhance the}} speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then {{polishing}} the ski bottom. [...] Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost. [...] Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on paraffin are common for recreational use. [...] Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and <b>fluorocarbon</b> overlays. [...] Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or block form, fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross-country ski races.|$|E

2500|$|Formally, {{fluorocarbons}} only contain {{carbon and}} fluorine. [...] Sometimes {{they are called}} perfluorocarbons. They can be gases, liquids, waxes, or solids, depending upon their molecular weight. The simplest <b>fluorocarbon</b> is the gas tetrafluoromethane (CF4). Liquids include perfluorooctane and perfluorodecalin. [...] While fluorocarbons with single bonds are stable, unsaturated fluorocarbons are more reactive, especially those with triple bonds.Fluorocarbons are more chemically and thermally stable than hydrocarbons, reflecting the relative inertness of the C-F bond. They are also relatively lipophobic. [...] Because of the reduced intermolecular van der Waals interactions, fluorocarbon-based compounds are sometimes used as lubricants or are highly volatile. <b>Fluorocarbon</b> liquids have medical applications as oxygen carriers.|$|E

Partial and complete A-V block and even cardiac arrest have been induced by epinephrine challenge in the FC sensitized heart. Potassium chloride alone restores the rhythmicity but not the normal contractility of the heart in such a situation. Addition of glucose will, however, completely restore the normal function of the heart which is sensitized by dichlorodifluoromethane.

2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, {{researchers}} addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the novel use of a surfactant that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax. Hertel also developed the first <b>fluorocarbon</b> product and the first spring-time wax that repels and makes the running surface slick for spring time alpine ski and snowboard. This technology was introduced to the market in 1986 by Hertel Wax. [...] In 1990, Hertel filed for a U.S. patent on a [...] "ski wax for use with sintered-base snow skis", containing paraffin, a hardener wax, roughly 1% per-fluoroether diol, and 2% SDS surfactant. In the 1990s, Swix chief chemist Leif Torgersen found a glide wax additive to repel pollen and other snow impurities—a problem with soft grip waxes during distance races—in the form of a <b>fluorocarbon</b> that could be ironed into the ski base. The solution was based on the work of Enrico Traverso at , who had developed a <b>fluorocarbon</b> powder with a melting temperature just a few degrees below that of sintered polyethylene, patented in Italy as a [...] "ski lubricant comprising paraffinic wax and hydrocarbon compounds containing a perfluorocarbon segment".|$|E

This increases the risk of inhalation. 1,2 difluoroethane is toxic to humans through several mechanisms. First, because it has a high density, it can displace oxygen in the lungs causing suffocation. In addition, inhaled <b>fluorocarbons</b> causes the myocardium to become more sensitive to catecholamines, which results in deadly cardiac arrhythmias.|$|R
