500|$|Fionna and Cake {{are helping}} Prince Gumball {{decorate}} for the Biennial Gumball Ball when Gumball asks Fionna {{if she would}} like to go to <b>it</b> <b>tonight</b> with him. Their conversation is interrupted when the Ice Queen breaks into the castle and tries to kidnap Gumball. Fionna and Cake start to fight her before she mysteriously disappears. Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue over whether or not Gumball asked Fionna on a date. Cake decides to come along to help Fionna out. At the Castle Gardens, the two are met by Gumball and his steed Lord Monochromicorn. The group then flies through the air while Gumball serenades Fionna with the song [...] "Oh, Fionna" [...] and eventually asks her to be his girlfriend. When Fionna and Cake get to the ball, Prince Gumball takes Fionna to his room (decorated with candles and rose petals) and locks the door. She becomes flustered and backs away when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant icicle on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Dark Swan” was a {{tremendous}} premiere for Once Upon A Time, because it played with {{the structure of the}} series to breathe new life into it. Instead of a flashback, we get a flash forward that future flashbacks will illuminate. We'll see how Emma comes to lose her goodness, and how her humanity might be reclaimed. If nothing else, we'll get to see evil Jennifer Morrison, which I'm more than stoked to witness, with what little we got of <b>it</b> <b>tonight.</b> In short, Once Upon A Time is back, and I couldn't be happier." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} the pardon was granted, the Washington Post {{revealed}} that Trump had asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions months before if the government could drop its case against Arpaio. On August 13, 2017, Trump told Fox News that he was [...] "seriously considering a pardon" [...] for Arpaio. Days after being criticized for his comments following the Charlottesville rally, Trump {{announced that he would}} be holding a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. [...] The Mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, repeatedly called for the rally to be postponed in light of Charlottesville, and stated that Trump should apologize having [...] "inflamed racial tension across the country {{as a result of this}} failure of moral leadership." [...] Stanton specifically urged that Arpaio not be granted a pardon and stated that an announcement at the rally would make it [...] "clear that [...] true intent is to inflame emotions and further divide our nation." [...] During the rally, Trump asked rhetorically whether [...] "Sheriff Joe [...] convicted for doing his job" [...] and declared that Arpaio [...] "should have had a jury"; these comments were greeted with strong approval by the attendees. [...] The rally's tone was described as [...] "angry" [...] (NPR's Domenico Montanaro described it as [...] "incendiary," [...] stating that Trump had [...] "ripped at cultural divides [...] played to white grievance"), but he stopped short of issuing the pardon; Trump made his intention clear, however, stating that [...] "I'll make a prediction. I think [...] going to be just fine ... But I won't do <b>it</b> <b>tonight</b> because I don't want to cause any controversy." ...|$|E
