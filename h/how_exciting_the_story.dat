In The Daily Telegraph, Roger Perkins was more blunt, remarking that the [...] "relentless pace and breathless dislocation" [...] of the plot hid [...] "character development that's as deep as dental veneer but equally shiny". Matt Thorne summed up the issue in opining that [...] "The problem with a thriller which begins with a technology journalist talking to an experimental artist is that, no matter <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>the</b> events later become, it's hard to care." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pound for pound is {{a ranking}} used in combat sports, such as boxing or mixed martial arts, {{of who the}} better fighters are {{regardless}} of size (i.e., regardless of weight class). As these fighters do not compete directly, judging the best fighter pound for pound is subjective, and ratings vary. They may {{be based on a}} range of criteria including [...] "quality of opposition", factors such as <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>the</b> fighter is or how famous they are, or be an attempt to determine who would win if all those ranked were the same size. In boxing, the term was historically associated with fighters such as Benny Leonard and Sugar Ray Robinson who were widely considered to be the most skilled fighters of their day, to distinguish them from the generally more popular (and better compensated) heavyweight champions. Since 1990, The Ring magazine has maintained a pound for pound rank of fighters. [...] ESPN.com has a list for mixed martial artists. In December 2013, Ronda Rousey became the first woman to appear on the top 10 of a mixed-gender major publication.|$|R

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} a novel form of business analytics, respecting {{the quality of}} the data available (allowing incompleteness in the data set), as well as engaging with the uncertainty in the considered outcome variable (inclusive of Don’t Know (DK) responses). The analysis employs the NCaRBS technique, based on the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, to investigate the relationship between Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) characteristics and whether they intended to undertake future innovation. The allowed outcome response for intended innovation was either, Yes, No and DK, all of which are considered pertinent responses in this analysis. An additional consequence of the use of the NCaRBS technique is the ability to analyse an incomplete data set, with missing values in the characteristic variables considered, without the need to manage their presence. From a soft computing perspective, this study demonstrates just <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>the</b> business analytics field of study can be in terms of pushing the bounds of the ability to handle real ‘incomplete’ business data which has real, and sometimes uncertain, outcomes. Further, the findings also inform how different notions of ignorance in evidence are accounted for in such analysis...|$|R

50|$|Procaccino {{was born}} in Bisaccia, Italy. When he was nine years old, his family emigrated to the United States. He {{graduated}} from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx in 1931. Despite family poverty, he attended City College of New York and Fordham Law School, becoming a lawyer later in the 1930s. In the early 1940s, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia heard him address a war-bond rally in Italian, and seeing <b>how</b> <b>excited</b> <b>the</b> crowd was, told him he should be in politics and arranged for an appointment to a $3,500-a-year post with the city's legal department. When La Guardia's administration ended, Procaccino became a party worker for Tammany Hall and was eventually given a minor judgeship. In 1965, the New York Democrats supported Procaccino, a candidate from the Bronx of Italian ethnicity, for comptroller, along with a Jewish mayoral candidate, Abe Beame of Brooklyn, and an Irish-American from Queens, Frank O'Connor, for city council president. Procaccino and O'Connor were elected, but Beame was defeated by the Republican and Liberal Party of New York joint nominee, John V. Lindsay, {{a member of the}} United States House of Representatives and a then ally of fellow New York liberal Republicans Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and United States Senator Jacob K.

One of the oldest—and least useful—paper topics that used to plague many high school and freshman English classes is “How I Spent My Summer Vacation. ” I must admit, however, that my remarks today grow {{out of one of the}} things I did during my summer vacation. At the end of July, I attended a seminar that brought 15 college presidents together for freewheeling discussions based on classic texts in the liberal arts. Along with several of our spouses we chewed over readings that ranged from Plato and Alexis DeTocqueville to Virginia Woolf and Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as more recent articles on education and society.

40|$|Purpose: Guest lecturers (GLs) are {{a popular}} {{mechanism}} for transferring insights from industry into supply chain programmes. With {{a scarcity of}} capable supply chain (SC) talent in today's labour market, there is real value in executives contributing to SC programmes at schools and universities. By guest lecturing they can “light the fire” in students about <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>the</b> field and practice are and how much potential there is in considering a career in SC management. Students on SC programmes can be shown {{part of the way}} towards modern SC practice for which there is a real need for more talent. However, {{it may be difficult to}} ensure GL effectiveness; it is neither the executive's job nor his/her profession and academics often find it hard to recruit GLs. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the hands-on experience of GLs and academics from multiple backgrounds, this paper develops both a framework that can help ensure effective use of the GL, and 11 specific tips and suggestions for recruiting and using GLs in SC programmes. Findings: It was found that there are more creative ways to use GLs in programmes than typically considered, as well as a wider recruitment of different types of GL than those most commonly sought after and most hard to recruit. Originality/value: This paper aims to assist educators in curriculum development and to help to ensure that, when executives offer up scarce time and experience, they maximise the impact of their service...|$|R
5000|$|Corrida de toros, or Bullfighting, in Venezuela {{is thought}} to be the least popular out of the five Latin American countries. Also, bullfighting is {{considered}} to be more of an art form that the Spanish colonist brought with them, but is still a sport. The modern sport started in the 19th century with the Spaniards arrival. The industry started from the city of San Cristóbal. The first bullrings were built of wood and didn't have many seats, but they eventually grew to the modern [...] "large bullring," [...] such as the Nuevo de Caracas that was built in 1968. The industry now has 55 bullrings, more than twenty-five breeding farms for bullfighting bulls, and two schools to teach how to fight the bulls. Festivals were normally held in honor of the patron saint or Virgin. Two of the most important festivals held are the Feria de San Cristóbal and The Feria de Sol (Festival of the Sun). These festivals have one week where each night there is an event with about four or five matadors, the [...] "bullfighters," [...] and an equal number of bulls. Even though these are two big events, bullfighting happens in these two places all year long. The quality of a bullfight, and <b>how</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>the</b> event is, is based upon the strength and power of the bull plus the skill of the matador. Bullfighting is legal in Venezuela because there is no national or state animal protection legislation that prevents animal cruelty.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} nonlinear dynamics of third-harmonic generation (ω→ 3 ω) via Kerr (χ(3)) nonlinearities in a resonant cavity with resonances at both ω and 3 ω. Such a doubly resonant cavity greatly reduces the required power for efficient harmonic generation, {{by a factor of}} ∼V∕Q(2), where V is the modal volume and Q is the lifetime, and can even exhibit 100 % harmonic conversion efficiency at a critical input power. However, we show that it also exhibits a rich variety of nonlinear dynamics, such as multistable solutions and long-period limit cycles. We describe how to compensate for self- and cross-phase modulation (which otherwise shifts the cavity frequencies out of resonance), and <b>how</b> to <b>excite</b> <b>the</b> different stable solutions (and especially the high-efficiency solutions) by specially modulated input pulses.
