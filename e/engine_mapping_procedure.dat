40|$|After {{undergoing}} a study about current <b>engine</b> modelling and <b>mapping</b> approaches {{as well as}} the engine modelling requirements for different applications, a major problem found to be present is the extensive and time consuming <b>mapping</b> <b>procedure</b> that every <b>engine</b> has to go through so that all control parameters can be derived from experimental data. To improve this, a cycle-by-cycle modelling approach has been chosen to mathematically represent reciprocating engines starting by a complete dynamics crankshaft mechanism model which forms the base of the complete engine model. This system is modelled taking into account the possibility of a piston pin offset on the mechanism. The derived Valvetrain model is capable of representing a variable valve lift and phasing Valvetrain which can be used while modelling most modern engines. A butterfly type throttle area model is derived as well as its rate of change which is believed to be a key variable for transient engine control. In addition, an approximation throttle model is formulated aiming at real-time applications. Furthermore, the engine inertia is presented as a mathematical model able to be used for any engine. A spark ignition engine simulation (SIES) framework was developed in MATLAB SIMULINK to form the base of a complete high fidelity cycle-by-cycle simulation model with its major target to provide an environment for virtual <b>engine</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>procedures.</b> Some experimental measurements from an actual engine are still required to parameterise the model, which is the reason an <b>engine</b> <b>mapping</b> (EngMap) framework has been developed in LabVIEW, It is shown that all the moving engine components can be represented by a single cyclic variable which can be used for flow model development.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} <b>engine</b> <b>maps</b> in order to {{simulate}} fuel consumption for road vehicles after mechanistic principles. In an <b>engine</b> <b>map,</b> fuel consumption (g/kWh or g/s) is expressed as a function of engine speed and engine torque. In general, there is a considerable lack in <b>engine</b> <b>map</b> data. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a tool for assigning any segment of the car fleet a representative <b>engine</b> <b>map.</b> Two methods have been developed: a "matrix" method based on interpolation of measured values to a uniform grid of values and a "function" method based on regressions. The function alternative is in focus in this documentation. The estimated functions have a high degree of explanation (> 0, 97). On commission of the Swedish Road Administration, Rototest AB has measured stationary fuel consumption and exhaust emissions for more than 400 cars of different year models. If this data set could be used in mechanistic simulation models one could expect increased representativity in different applications. Advantages with the Rototest method, where the engine at measurements is mounted in the vehicle, could be increased representativity and lower costs compared to motor test bench, which is the traditional method for <b>engine</b> <b>map</b> measurements. One problem with the Rototest data set is that engine torque or power, which is needed in an <b>engine</b> <b>map,</b> is not available, only the output power from the final gear box. In order to estimate crankshaft torque, transmission losses need to be estimated...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{the engine}} {{operating}} condition {{in terms of}} engine load and engine speed, a fuzzy decision making system has been developed. The objective was to controlling the engine operating point in the <b>engine</b> torque-rpm <b>map,</b> {{in order to enhance}} fuel economy. The main idea stems from the approach of tracking the defined target curve in the <b>engine</b> <b>map</b> similar to the CVT control criteria. To provide resemblance between a traditional geared transmission and a CVT, a many-gear transmission concept was introduced. A Fuzzy control was utilized by defining proper membership functions for the inputs and output. The efficient fuel consumption curve in the <b>engine</b> <b>map</b> was taken as the target of controller. The effect of engine output power on fuel consumption has also been taken into consideration. Making use of ADVISOR software, vehicle simulations was performed for the many-gear base case and a very good consistency was found with the CVT case. As a result the fuel consumption was found to become considerably less than existing values. The developed strategy was then applied to other cases including conventional manual and automatic transmissions and improvements in the fuel economy was observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a placement-driven technology <b>mapping</b> <b>procedure</b> based on fuzzy delay curves. The fuzziness {{has been introduced}} {{to deal with the}} inherent vagueness in wiring loads (derived from a dynamically updated placement) and used by the mapper to calculate the signal arrival times. In the process we describe a number of fuzzy operations which are needed to generate the fuzzy delay curves and to select a minimum area mapping solution satisfying a set of timing constraints. This procedure has been implemented and the results are on average 1 % and 26 % (5 % and 3 %) better in terms of area and delay compared to a technology <b>mapping</b> <b>procedure</b> with zero (crisp) wire load values. ...|$|R
