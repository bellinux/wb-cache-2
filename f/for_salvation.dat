5|$|The Bible is {{the word}} of God, written by men {{inspired}} by the Holy Spirit. It authoritatively proclaims the will of God and teaches all that is necessary <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience was necessary <b>for</b> <b>salvation,</b> but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that it is necessary <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b> His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{a library}} clerk {{was forced to}} resign for {{promoting}} the idea that baptism is essential <b>for</b> <b>salvation,</b> considered a violation of the Statement of Faith. Further, in March 2006, five of the college's sixteen faculty members—Erik Root, Robert Stacey, Kevin Culberson, Todd Bates, and David Noe—resigned in protest, claiming that the President's interpretation of the Biblical Worldview Policy restricted academic freedom.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies <b>for</b> <b>salvation</b> {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising {{the lessons of the}} past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b> According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b> The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|During his 1965-1966 world tour, Dylan {{was backed}} by a five-member rock group, The Hawks, who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was injured in a {{motorcycle}} accident in July 1966, four members of The Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan {{was out of the}} public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of The Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b> In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties.|$|E

5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing <b>for</b> <b>salvation,</b> would be punished.|$|E
5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls <b>for</b> <b>salvation,</b> sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E
5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people <b>for</b> <b>salvation</b> and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some way}} God wills the damnation of those not chosen <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b> Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The Accounts, {{even more}} than other {{criminal}} biographies, had the purpose of teaching readers about the wages of sin and often follow a similar pattern that can be called a 'Sinner to saint' type of biography. They {{took the form of}} inverted parabolas, recounting the protagonist's descent from immorality to criminality, from minor delinquencies and skipping church to a life of crime. The condemned, brought in front of the Ordinary, confesses in detail his wrongdoings, repents and welcomes death hoping <b>for</b> <b>salvation</b> after having set an example for the audience. Accepting the judgment of the jury, coming to terms with their guilt and confessing their crimes led the criminals to a sort of reintegration into society, working as a repayment of their debts to the community and a preparation <b>for</b> <b>salvation.</b>|$|E
