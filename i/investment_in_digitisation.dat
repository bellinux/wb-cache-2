40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on which digital objects to {{preserve}} when preserving digital library materials derived from original paper materials. It will investigate preservation strategies for digital objects from digitised paper material that must both be preserved and simultaneously retain a short route to dissemination. The investigation is based on a study of digitisation done a decade ago and digitisation done today. In the last decade mass digitisation has become more commonly used since technological evolution has made it cheaper and quicker. The paper explores whether there are parts of digital material digitised a decade ago worth preserving, or whether a re-digitisation via mass digitisation today can create a relevant alternative. The results presented show that the old digitised objects are worth preserving, although new digitisation can contribute additional information. A supplementary result is that <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>digitisation</b> can mean lower costs in the long term. Manual adjustments for the image processing can result in considerably smaller images than images made in cheap mass digitisation. Although initial manual work is more expensive, the storage and bit preservation expenses are lower over a long period...|$|E
40|$|The creation, {{management}} {{and use of}} digital materials are of increasing importance {{for a wide range}} of activities. Much of the knowledge base and intellectual assets of institutions and individuals are now in digital form. The term digital curation is increasingly being used for the actions needed to add value to and maintain these digital assets over time for current and future generations of users. The paper explores this emerging field of digital curation as an area of inter-disciplinary research and practice, and the trends which are influencing its development. It analyses the genesis of the term and how traditional roles relating to digital assets are in transition. Finally it explores some of the drivers for curation ranging from trends such as exponential growth in digital information, to "life-caching", digital preservation, the Grid and new opportunities for publishing, sharing, and re-using data. It concludes that significant effort needs to be put into developing a persistent information infrastructure for digital materials and into developing the digital curation skills of researchers and information professionals. Without this, current <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>digitisation</b> and digital content will only secure short-term rather than lasting benefits...|$|E

40|$|This mini-dissertation {{reports on}} the {{guidelines}} for digitisation that were developed for the University of Zimbabwe Library. A literature study and an empirical investigation were done in order {{to come up with}} the guidelines. The literature study was primarily used to inform the researcher on those aspects of digitisation for which guidelines could be developed. A qualitative research design was adopted in this study. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from five South African institutions that are involved <b>in</b> <b>digitisation.</b> Digitisation managers from the five institutions were interviewed in this study. The data from the interviews and the literature study were used {{to come up with the}} proposed guidelines for digitisation at the University of Zimbabwe Library. The guidelines that were developed as a result of this study specifically address digitisation standards and best practices, technologies for digitisation, costs and sustainability of digitisation, intellectual property issues, steps <b>in</b> <b>digitisation,</b> challenges <b>in</b> <b>digitisation</b> and the selection of materials for digitisation. Although some of the respondents expressed that digitisation can be used as a sustainable method of preservation, this research could not demonstrate that current practices would be reliable in the long term...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} characteristics and trends of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed {{capital of the}} Northern regions. It singles out phases of rapid pre-crisis growth, crisis, post-crisis growth and stagnation. Stagnation and decline in recent years are caused by completed major investment projects, reduced own funds of enterprises, limited availability of investment resources and increased capital outflow. The article reveals that the growth of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital of the North in the post-crisis period {{is provided by the}} regions, carrying out major <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> oil and gas pipeline transport, oil extraction, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. The changes in the sectoral structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital of the Northern regions are barely visible; the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the traded sector is still high, especially in mining, due to the Northern regions’ specialization in the extractive industries. The share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> the public sector and social services remains low. The specific structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital has changed: the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> buildings (excluding housing) and structures has increased greatly; the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles has decreased due to insufficient <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> mining enterprises and financial shortages in manufacturing. In most regions the structure of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fixed capital by directions is characterized by the increase in the share of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles <b>in</b> new construction, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> buildings and structures and the decline in the proportion of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> machinery, equipment, vehicles modernization and reconstruction and acquisition of new fixed assets.

These investments are crucial for the long-term existence and development of a company, but their value is not disclosed on the assets side of the classical balance sheet.

However, <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> human capital are those with the highest long-term benefits for the company. Therefore, human capital is the only element of the business process that can add value.
