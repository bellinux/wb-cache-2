5|$|ATP synthase {{releases}} this {{stored energy}} by completing the circuit and allowing protons to flow down the <b>electrochemical</b> gradient, {{back to the}} N-side of the membrane. The <b>electrochemical</b> gradient drives the rotation of part of the enzyme's structure and couples this motion to the synthesis of ATP.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the brain depend {{on the ability of}} neurons to transmit <b>electrochemical</b> signals to other cells, and their ability to respond appropriately to <b>electrochemical</b> signals received from other cells. The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.|$|E
5|$|A third type {{of common}} {{maintenance}} is the installation and replacement of sacrificial anodes along the subterranean portions of pipeline. These anodes reduce the corrosion caused by <b>electrochemical</b> action that affect these interred sections of pipeline. Excavation and {{replacement of the}} anodes is required as they corrode.|$|E
5|$|Electrochemistry {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, <b>electrochemical</b> cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells. Aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way, and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an <b>electrochemical</b> gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium, and {{membrane}} reactors with Pd membranes {{are used}} in the production of high purity hydrogen. Palladium is used in palladium-hydrogen electrodes in <b>electrochemical</b> studies. Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, The <b>Electrochemical</b> Society (ECS) was founded.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemistry is {{the direct}} {{transformation}} of chemical energy into electricity, as in a battery. <b>Electrochemical</b> electricity generation {{is important in}} portable and mobile applications. Currently, most <b>electrochemical</b> power comes from batteries. Primary cells, such as the common zinc-carbon batteries, act as power sources directly, but many types of cells are used as storage systems rather than primary generation systems. Open <b>electrochemical</b> systems, known as fuel cells, {{can be used to}} extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges.|$|E
25|$|CO2 can be {{converted}} using <b>electrochemical</b> reactions at room temperature and pressure.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>electrochemical</b> {{capacitors}} {{used two}} aluminum foils covered with activated carbon—the electrodes—which were soaked in an electrolyte and {{separated by a}} thin porous insulator. This design gave a capacitor with a capacitance {{on the order of}} one farad, significantly higher than electrolytic capacitors of the same dimensions. This basic mechanical design remains the basis of most <b>electrochemical</b> capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} potential of an <b>electrochemical</b> cell requires standard conditions (ΔG°) {{for all of}} the reactants. When reactant concentrations differ from standard conditions, the cell potential will deviate from the {{standard potential}}. In the 20th century German chemist Walther Nernst proposed a mathematical model to determine the effect of reactant concentration on <b>electrochemical</b> cell potential.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also an}} {{experimental}} method of characterizing <b>electrochemical</b> systems. This technique measures the impedance of a system over a range of frequencies, and therefore the frequency response of the system, including the energy storage and dissipation properties, is revealed. Often, data obtained by <b>electrochemical</b> impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is expressed graphically in a Bode plot or a Nyquist plot.|$|E
25|$|Modeled fractals may be sounds, digital images, <b>electrochemical</b> patterns, {{circadian}} rhythms, etc.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> {{cell voltage}} is also {{referred}} to as electromotive force or emf.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{required}} to move solutes across the cell membrane {{is provided by}} the <b>electrochemical</b> gradient of sodium. Sodium's <b>electrochemical</b> gradient is established by the Na-K ATPase, which is an ATP-dependent enzyme. Since NKCC proteins use sodium's gradient, their activity is indirectly dependent on ATP; for this reason, NKCC proteins are said to move solutes by way of secondary active transport.|$|E
25|$|Cl− is reabsorbed in {{conjunction}} with sodium cations to maintain the system's <b>electrochemical</b> balance.|$|E
25|$|A {{conductive}} AFM tip {{can create}} an <b>electrochemical</b> reaction {{that can change}} the terminal group.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{extremely}} important <b>electrochemical</b> processes in both nature and industry, like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and {{the detection of}} alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an <b>electrochemical</b> process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the established <b>electrochemical</b> technologies (like deep cycle lead acid batteries) {{there is also a}} wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium ion batteries, <b>electrochemical</b> reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial. Electrochemistry has also important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the determination of free acidity in olive oil.|$|E

25|$|Pseudocapacitance, <b>electrochemical</b> {{storage of}} the {{electrical}} energy achieved by faradaic redox reactions with charge-transfer.|$|E
25|$|Both {{electrostatic}} and <b>electrochemical</b> {{energy storage}} in supercapacitors are linear {{with respect to}} the stored charge, just as in conventional capacitors. The voltage between the capacitor terminals is linear {{with respect to the}} amount of stored energy. Such linear voltage gradient differs from rechargeable <b>electrochemical</b> batteries, in which the voltage between the terminals remains independent of the amount of stored energy, providing a relatively constant voltage.|$|E
25|$|ATP {{hydrolysis}} is used {{to transport}} hydrogen ions against the <b>electrochemical</b> gradient (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). Phosphorylation of the carrier protein and the binding of a hydrogen ion induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the <b>electrochemical</b> gradient. Hydrolysis of the bound phosphate group and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} 2, the aluminium anode is consumed, {{limiting the}} production of aluminium hydride for a given <b>electrochemical</b> cell.|$|E
25|$|CFTR {{functions}} as an ATP-gated anion channel, increasing the conductance for certain anions (e.g. Cl−) to flow down their <b>electrochemical</b> gradient. ATP-driven conformational changes in CFTR {{open and close}} a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their <b>electrochemical</b> gradient. This in contrast to other ABC proteins, in which ATP-driven conformational changes fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes. Essentially, CFTR is an ion channel that evolved as a 'broken' ABC transporter that leaks when in open conformation.|$|E
25|$|In an <b>electrochemical</b> cell the faradaic {{impedance}} of an electrolyte-electrode interface is {{the joint}} electrical resistance and capacitance at that interface.|$|E
25|$|Almost any physico-chemical system, such as <b>electrochemical</b> cells, mass-beam oscillators, {{and even}} {{biological}} tissue possesses energy storage and dissipation properties. EIS examines them.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid capacitors, {{such as the}} {{lithium-ion}} capacitor, use electrodes {{with differing}} characteristics: one exhibiting mostly electrostatic capacitance and the other mostly <b>electrochemical</b> capacitance.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Martin Lowry {{published}} {{essentially the}} same theory about how acids and bases behave, using an <b>electrochemical</b> basis.|$|E

25|$|Corrosion is an <b>electrochemical</b> process, which {{reveals itself}} in rust or tarnish on metals like iron or copper and their {{respective}} alloys, steel and brass.|$|E
25|$|A {{fuel cell}} is an <b>electrochemical</b> cell that {{converts}} the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through an <b>electrochemical</b> reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. Fuel cells {{are different from}} batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery. Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously {{for as long as}} fuel and oxygen are supplied.|$|E
