Modeling of solid rocket motor components and its assembly is done in CATIAV 5 R 19. Stress distributions are due {{to the effect of}} working stress developed in the components. The maximum working stress is compared with allowable yield stress of the material. Final conclusion brings out a well designed solid rocket motor for the effective storage of propellant for obtaining the required impulse. 2 D Axi-Symmetric structural analysis for solid propellant rocket motor Casing is performed to determine the stress level of all components using ANSYS 12. 0. ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{goal of this}} research was to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of a cylindrical shock wave to serve as the major pressure recovery mechanism for wither cylindrical gas dynamic lasers or chemical lasers. An analysis was conducted to determine the minimum distance between the nozzle exit cylinder and the shock wave locations, r(m) -r(e), required for power extraction. A cylindrical nozzle array was designed using the axisymmetric method of characteristics for a Mach number of 4. 5 with a flexibility of other Mach numbers. A chamber incorporating end wall boundary layer bleed and ejectors for back pressure control was designed and built. The apparatus was run up to a pressure value of (r(m) -r(e)) /(r(s) -r(e)) of 0. 3 was attained, where r(s) is the shock wave location. Flow in the <b>end</b> wall <b>nozzles</b> consisted of a Conada jet with a subsonic flow region adjacent to the wall; flow was not altered by boundary layer bleed.

50|$|The M1A1 had a {{backpack}} configuration with a fuel tank {{that consisted of}} two upright bottles. A third, smaller upright bottle, the propellant tank, was located between the fuel tanks. The backpack had a high-pressure valve. The nozzle of the weapon was located {{at the end of}} a long, thin pipe, which was connected to the backpack via a hose. The pipe was slightly bent at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>end.</b> The <b>nozzle</b> had a hydrogen-powered ignitor. The long and thin cylindrical hydrogen tank was attached parallel to the pipe. A battery provided the spark needed to ignite the hydrogen. The hydrogen flame then ignited the fuel, which was forced out of the fuel tank through the hose and out of the nozzle by the propellant pressure when a valve was opened. The valve lever was located at the other end of the pipe, at the junction of the hose and the pipe.|$|R

50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ fluid amplifiers {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. Fluid amplifiers {{rely on a}} fluid control stream to switch a fluid power stream. Fluid amplifiers are so named because a low-energy fluid control signal can control and switch a high-energy fluid power stream to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the fluid control signal. In fluid amplifiers, a fluid power stream, after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying fluid control pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the exit <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the fluid that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient fluid pressure imbalance adjacent the exit <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> to effect switching of the fluid power stream.|$|R

Method of characteristics was used to solve the mathematical model by using a finite difference technique. The computer program has been written in Visual Fortran, which is capable of calculating pressure, velocity and other related parameters at different cam angles at any location of the fuel pipe, including pump and <b>nozzle</b> <b>ends.</b> First of all the numerical scheme was optimized and then its authenticity was verified by comparing its results with calculated and measured results available in the literature.

50|$|For optimal {{performance}} {{the pressure}} of the gas at the <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.|$|R
50|$|In {{the vortex}} {{separation}} process {{a mixture of}} uranium hexafluoride gas and hydrogen is injected tangentially into a tube at one <b>end</b> through <b>nozzles</b> or holes, at velocities close to the speed of sound. The tube tapers to a small exit aperture at one or both ends. This tangential injection of gas results in a spiral or vortex motion within the tube, and two gas streams are withdrawn {{at opposite ends of}} the vortex tube; centrifugal force providing the isotopic separation. The spiral swirling flow decays downstream of the feed inlet due to friction at the tube wall. Consequently, the inside diameter of the tube is typically tapered to reduce decay in the swirling flow velocity. This process is characterized by a separating element with a very small stage cut (the ratio of product flow to feed flow) of about 1/20, and high process-operating pressures.|$|R

30|$|As {{indicated}} in SEM images, {{the effect of}} voltage shows the same trend for all three configurations of the nozzle. The good morphologies of PMMA/PAN nanofibers (smooth and uniform {{in the distribution of}} the sizes) were obtained from the coaxial nozzle electrospinning at 15  kV. At a lower applied voltage of 10  kV, the injection was occurred after an electrospinning solution was agglomerated at the <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle,</b> retarded for a while until the electrostatic force was strong enough to inject the solution jet. The initial agglomerated shape may cause some difficulties for the solution jet to form the continuous compound of Taylor’s cone at the <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle.</b> Therefore, the obtained nanofibers show a non-uniform beaded fiber morphologies and some nanofibers were fused together as a bundle of fibers. For the coaxial electrospinning at higher voltage of 15 – 25  kV, composite nanofibers with no beads and more uniform morphologies were obtained. However, when the applied voltage was increased greater than 20  kV, the extraction rate of the precursor solution was too high and the solution was collected and accumulated at the collector before the evaporation of the solvent. Therefore, wet nanofibers were fused onto the aluminium foil collector or fused together resulting in the bundle morphologies. From the obtained results, we used the applied voltage at 15  kV for further experiment.|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} nozzle {{for reducing}} overspray in high temperature supersonic plasma spray devices comprises a body defining an internal passageway having an upstream end and a downstream end through which a selected plasma gas is directed. The nozzle passageway has a generally converging/diverging Laval shape with its upstream end converging to a throat section and its downstream end diverging from the throat section. The upstream {{end of the}} passageway is configured to accommodate a high current cathode for producing an electrical arc in the passageway to heat and ionize the gas flow to plasma form as it moves along the passageway. The downstream <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> is uniquely configured through the methodology of this invention to have a contoured bell-shape that diverges from the throat to the exit of the nozzle. Coating material in powder form is injected into the plasma flow {{in the region of}} the bell-shaped downstream <b>end</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> and the powder particles become entrained in the flow. The unique bell shape of the <b>nozzle</b> downstream <b>end</b> produces a plasma spray that is ideally expanded at the nozzle exit and thus virtually free of shock phenomena, and that is highly collimated so as to exhibit significantly reduced fanning and diffusion between the nozzle and the target. The overall result is a significant reduction in the amount of material escaping from the plasma stream in the form of overspray and a corresponding improvement in the cost of the coating operation and in the quality and integrity of the coating itself...|$|R

This study used variation of lip thickness of truncated nozzle 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mm. To obtain flame stability, fuel velocity and air velocity were variated. Thermocouples were used to measure flame temperature and its distribution. The results showed that stability of concentric jet diffusion flame flow increased with narrow lip thickness on a truncated nozzle. The wider stability area obtained in 4 mm lip thickness.
