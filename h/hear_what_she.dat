500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has to say and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E

60|$|He sighed, {{scarcely}} <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said. She waited, {{wishing he}} would go. At last {{he kissed her}} quickly and climbed the fence.

60|$|Mr. Newcombe {{now stood}} by, and Dickory also.

60|$|The {{relief of}} <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt sure was a false suspicion, {{in place of}} the {{expected}} real and true one, so lightened Lizzie's breast for the moment, that Miss Abbey was amazed at her demeanour.

60|$|The hard-headed {{man looked}} dubiously round, but finding {{himself in a}} minority, assumed a {{compassionate}} air and said no more.

50|$|Another aspect that {{challenges}} Marjorie’s suitability for her job {{is the fact}} she is overweight herself, although she does claim to be at her target weight, despite being approximately 15 stone and 8½ pounds (99 kg). This is easily explained when Marjorie's own eating habits are shown, often doing exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> tells the FatFighters not to do. During sketches, she will occasionally try {{to hide from the}} group and eat large amounts of food in the mistaken belief the group cannot see or <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> doing.|$|R
60|$|Any of the {{scholars}} may, at any time, make suggestions in writing, {{to any of}} these officers, or to the whole school.

If it is sustained, she is deprived of the office and another appointed to fill her place.|$|R

If I had not fortunately offended the music-master, she would have used Mr. Le Frank as a means of making Ovid jealous, and of sowing the seeds of dissension between us. Having failed so far, she is (as Miss Minerva thinks) at a loss to discover any other means of gaining her wicked ends. Her rage at finding herself baffled seems to account for her furious conduct, when she discovered me in Miss Minerva's room.|$|R
