5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> being, and the latter to a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E

5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was {{changed into a}} system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E
5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E

Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|Here, noncommutative <b>hierarchies</b> <b>of</b> {{nonlinear}} equations are studied. They {{represent a}} generalization to the operator level <b>of</b> corresponding <b>hierarchies</b> <b>of</b> scalar equations, {{which can be}} obtained from the operator ones via a suitable projection. A key tool is the application of Bäcklund transformations to relate different operator-valued hierarchies. Indeed, in the case when hierarchies in 1 + 1 -dimensions are considered, a “Bäcklund chart” depicts links relating, in particular, the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) to the modified KdV (mKdV) hierarchy. Notably, analogous links connect the <b>hierarchies</b> <b>of</b> operator equations. The main result is the construction of an operator soliton solution depending on an infinite-dimensional parameter. To start with, the potential KdV hierarchy is considered. Then Bäcklund transformations are exploited to derive solution formulas in the case of KdV and mKdV hierarchies. It is remarked that <b>hierarchies</b> <b>of</b> matrix equations, of any dimension, are also incorporated in the present framework...|$|R
