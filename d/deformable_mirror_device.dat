HoseitSystolic Array Implementation of the Fourier TransformAbstractAdaptive optics is a {{relatively}} new technology originally designed to eliminate negative effects of the atmosphere on telescopic images. This technology allows ground based telescopes to achieve resolutions comparable to the Hubble space telescope. Adaptive optics is the "cheaper" solution to capturing better images than sending telescopes into space. Ground based telescopes can be built with larger mirrors providing more light collecting area and ultimately better pictures. Telescopes on the ground can also be more easily maintained and upgraded than telescopes in space. Using a combination of innovative technology such as Laser Guide stars and <b>deformable</b> <b>mirrors,</b> (MEMs) <b>devices,</b> along with significant software and hardware engineering to implement algorithms allow adaptive optics to improve imaging with telescopes.

One of these devices, the <b>deformable</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>device</b> is used, to compare {{the relative merits of}} binary and partially-continuous phase filters in a specific problem of pattern recognition by optical correlation. Each filter was physically limited to only about a radiation of modulation. Researchers have predicted that for low input noise levels, continuous phase-only filters should have a higher absolute correlator peak output than the corresponding binary filters, as well as having a larger SNR. When continuous and binary filters were implemented on the DMD and they exhibited the same performance; an ad hoc filter optimization procedure was developed for use in the laboratory. The optimized continuous filter gave higher correlation peaks than did an independently optimized binary filter. Background behavior in the correlation plane was similar for the two filters, and thus the SNR showed the same improvement for the continuous filter.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} dynamic optical processing for the control of phased array antennas. The significant result presented is the demonstration of a continuously variable photonic RF/microwave delay line. Specifically, it is shown that by applying spatial frequency dependent optical phase compensation in an optical heterodyne process, variable RF delay can be achieved over a prescribed frequency band. Experimental results which demonstrate {{the performance of the}} delay line with regard to both maximum delay and resolution over a broad bandwidth are presented. Additionally, a spatially integrated optical system is proposed for control of phased array antennas. The integrated system provides mechanical stability, essentially eliminates the drift problems associated with free space optical systems, and can provide high packing density. This approach uses a class of spatial light modulator known as a <b>deformable</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>device</b> and leads to a steerable arbitrary antenna radiation pattern of the true time delay type. Also considered is the ability to utilize the delay line as a general photonic signal processing element in an adaptive (reconfigurable) transversal frequency filter configuration.

40|$|Future {{concepts}} of ultra large space telescopes include segmented silicon mirrors and inflatable polymer mirrors. Primary mirrors for these systems cannot meet optical surface figure requirements {{and are likely}} to generate over several microns of wavefront errors. In order to correct for these large wavefront errors, high stroke optical quality deformable mirrors are required. JPL has recently developed a new technology for transferring an entire wafer-level mirror membrane from one substrate to another. A thin membrane, 100 mm in diameter, has been successfully transferred without using adhesives or polymers. The measured peak-to-valley surface error of a transferred and patterned membrane (1 mm x 1 mm x 0. 016 mm) is only 9 nm. The mirror element actuation principle is based on a piezoelectric unimorph. A voltage applied to the piezoelectric layer induces stress in the longitudinal direction causing the film to deform and pull on the mirror connected to it. The advantage of this approach is that the small longitudinal strains obtainable from a piezoelectric material at modest voltages are thus translated into large vertical displacements. Modeling is performed for a unimorph membrane consisting of clamped rectangular membrane with a PZT layer with variable dimensions. The membrane transfer technology is combined with the piezoelectric bimorph actuator concept to constitute a compact <b>deformable</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>device</b> with a large stroke actuation of a continuous mirror membrane, resulting in a compact A 0 systems for use in ultra large space telescopes...|$|E
