5|$|The old name of Royston crow {{originates}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> {{this bird}} {{was a common}} winter visitor to southern England, the sheep fields around Royston, Hertfordshire, providing carcasses on which the birds could feed. The local newspaper, founded in 1855, is called The Royston Crow, and the hooded crow is also featured {{on the crest of}} the North Hertfordshire District Council.|$|E
25|$|The name 'Jockey's Cap' {{originates}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> {{the annual}} 'Stewarton Bonnet Guild Festival' included horse racing – like the 'Irvine Marymass' Celebrations still do.

25|$|The word wicket is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers {{it is quite possible that}} the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{district}} is open space, taken up by a mill pond and park, a cemetery and the former site of a racetrack. Its buildings, mostly from the 19th century but some predating the Revolution, are clustered in a small area Stage Road and represent the early core of Monroe <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Smith's Mill, its first business, had dammed the waters of Ramapo Creek. They are also survivors of an 1892 fire that devastated the village. The Greek Revival and Federal architectural styles prevail, with some mid-19th-century Gothic Revival homes included. Among the contributing properties are the oldest Masonic Lodge in New York, {{and the home of}} David Smith, the village's first settler.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Angels {{had a new}} spring {{training}} camp in Tempe, Arizona after 31 previous seasons in Palm Springs Stadium in Palm Springs, an idea Autry developed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he stayed in his desert resort home. The Angels hoped a new facility would rejuvenate and improve the roster in the long run. The 1993 and 1994 seasons proved to be worse for the Angels than the previous three, particularly since the 1994 season ended in a baseball player strike that kept Angel fans waiting even longer for the team's fate to change. In that season, the Halos had the second-worst record in baseball {{at the time of}} the strike, and were en route to a 66-96 season, which would have been their worst record in team history had the season continued, and were in last place in their division, but just 5 1/2 games out.|$|E

25|$|Over his cassock the Pope {{will wear}} a lace rochet. Over the rochet is worn the red Papal mozzetta, a {{shoulder}} cape {{that has a}} collar and is buttoned {{all the way down}} the front. The red color is a vestige <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> scarlet was the Papal color (white only became associated with the papacy after the Napoleonic wars). The Papal mozzetta had a small hood on the back, which disappeared after Vatican II but has recently been restored. In wintertime, the Papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with ermine (this also fell out of use after Vatican II, but Pope Benedict XVI began again to wear a winter mozzetta trimmed in ermine fur). In summer, the Papal mozzetta is of red satin. The Pope wears a pectoral cross suspended on a gold cord over the mozzetta. He may also choose to wear a red stole with gold embroidery over the mozzetta, even when he is not officiating at a service.|$|E
25|$|The {{school now}} has six day houses – Holden, Rigaud, Sherrington, School, Broke and Felaw – into which all pupils are {{filtered}} from year 9/Upper 6th Form onwards, {{and a single}} large boarding house - Westwood. Those with relatives who attended the school are generally expected {{to be placed in}} the same house. There is a good deal of competition between the houses and every year, the houses compete for the Ganzoni Cup (house cup), which is won by gaining points from winning inter-house events. These include most sports as well as others such as debating and art. The final and most important event is Sports Day, in the Summer Term, on which the athletics competitions take place. Felaw has won more times than any other house, with Rigaud in second place; it is believed that School has not won {{since the days of the}} reign of Queen Victoria. However, School is the oldest house and dates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the boys lived and were taught in one house (called School House). It later became the boarding house which occupied a part of the main building on Henley Road.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{the central}} region of Vietnam {{where the family}} lived was still under the {{sovereignty}} of Emperor Tự Đức, but {{the southern part of}} the country had gradually been colonised in the 1860s and turned into the colony of Cochinchina. In 1874, an attack on Hanoi forced Tự Đức to sign a treaty to open up the Red River for French trade. In Nam Đàn District, a Binh Tây (Pacify the French) movement sprung among the local scholar-gentry, and Phan responded at the age of seven by playing Binh Tây with his classmates, using “guns” made of bamboo tubes and lychee bullets. The unrest was enough to prompt the imperial court to bring in troops to quell the opposition to Huế's deal with the French. Phan's family was not affected by the crackdown, but the movement had a deep impact on him. Later in life, he noted that as a youth, “I was endowed with a fiery spirit. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I was a small child … every time I read the stories of those in the past who were ready to die for the righteous cause, tears would come running from my eyes, soaking the books.” ...|$|E
2500|$|By ancient tradition, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the Jews {{who passed}} the Middle Ages in Teutonic lands were {{still under the}} same tonal {{influences}} as the peoples in southeastern Europe and Asia Minor yet are, chromatic scales (i.e., those showing some successive intervals greater than two semitones) have been preserved. Sabbath morning and weekday evening motives are especially affected by this survival, which also frequently induces the Polish ḥazzanim to modify similarly the diatonic intervals of the other prayer-motives. The chromatic intervals survive as {{a relic of the}} Oriental tendency to divide an ordinary interval of pitch into subintervals (comp. Hallel for Tabernacles, the [...] "lulab" [...] chant), {{as a result of the}} intricacy of some of the vocal embroideries in actual employment, which are not infrequently of a character to daunt an ordinary singer. Even among Western cantors, trained amid mensurate music on a contrapuntal basis, there is still a remarkable propensity to introduce the interval of the augmented second, especially between the third and second degrees of any scale in a descending cadence. Quite commonly two augmented seconds will be employed in the octave, as in the frequent formmuch loved by Eastern peoplestermed by Bourgault-Ducoudray ("Mélodies Populaires de Grèce et d'Orient," [...] p.20, Paris, 1876) [...] "the Oriental chromatic" [...] (see music below).|$|E
