40|$|Context: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a complex}} and {{disabling}} condition, and its treatment becomes a challenge. Aims: The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} clinical outcome of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF Endoret) infiltrations (one intradiscal, one intra articular facet, and one transforaminal epidural injection) under <b>fluoroscopic</b> guidance <b>control</b> in patients with chronic LBP. PRGF Endoret which {{has been shown to be}} an efficient treatment to reduce joint pain. Settings and Design: The study was designed as an observational retrospective pilot study. Eighty six patients with a history of chronic LBP and degenerative disease of the lumbar spine who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited between December 2010 and January 2012. Subjects and Methods: One intradiscal, one intra articular facet, and one transforaminal epidural injection of PRGF Endoret under <b>fluoroscopic</b> guidance <b>control</b> were carried out in 86 patients with chronic LBP in the operating theater setting. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics were performed using absolute and relative frequency distributions for qualitative variables and mean values and standard deviations for quantitative variables. The nonparametric Friedman statistical test was used to determine the possible differences between baseline and different follow up time points on pain reduction after treatment. Results: Pain assessment was determined using a visual analog scale (VAS) at the first visit before (baseline) and after the procedure at 1, 3, and 6 months. The pain reduction after the PRGF Endoret injections showed a statistically significant drop from 8. 4 ± 1. 1 before the treatment to 4 ± 2. 6, 1. 7 ± 2. 3, and 0. 8 ± 1. 7 at 1, 3, and 6 months after the treatment, respectively, with respect to all the time evaluations (P < 0. 0001) except for the pain reduction between the 3 rd and 6 th month whose signification was lower (P < 0. 05). The analysis of the VAS over time showed that at the end point of the study (6 months), 91 % of patients showed an excellent score, 8. 1 % showed a moderate improvement, and 1. 2 % were in the inefficient score.

30|$|During the renovations of our angiographic-interventional suite, an {{alternative}} to the hybrid OR concept was implemented. Our institution cannot provide the case numbers required to justify an installation of an angiography system within the OR tract. However, we have noticed a steady increase in endovascular procedures, such as the interventional implantation of large lumen vessel prostheses, which should be implanted in an OR environment. With this concept, the additional option of utilisation for neurological interventions with a biplane angiography system and the further possibility of 3 D rotation angiography is taken into account. The angiography system can be operated in a biplane mode during joint surgical-angiographic procedures, which are performed under full anaesthesia. An optional ultrasound device is also connected to the angiography system’s monitors. On the other hand, we are seeing a marked increase in venous interventions (i.e., port implantations and tunnelled haemodialysis catheters) in interventional radiology.

40|$|Intrahepatic {{stones are}} {{prevalent}} in the Far East, whereas they are infrequently seen in Western countries. Hepatolithiasis can cause recurrent attacks of cholangitis, with a risk of liver abscesses, sepsis or hepatic failure. Immediate biliary decompression can usually be achieved by endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic drainage. Definitive treatment should aim for complete elimination of bile stasis and removal of all stones. Hepatic resection promises the best long term results when the disease is limited to segments or the left liver lobe. Endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography is not well established for intrahepatic stones because of frequent failures due to associated biliary strictures, angulated ducts or peripherally impacted concrements. In contrast, percutaneous procedures can be easily performed through a T tube tract for residual stones after surgery. Establishment of a transhepatic fistula allows a targeted approach to liver segments with catheters or miniscopes, {{without the need for}} laparotomy. Biliary strictures can be dilated with balloons, and intrahepatic stones can be removed with baskets under <b>fluoroscopic</b> or cholangioscopic <b>control.</b> These techniques can be combined with electrohydraulic lithotripsy or laser lithotripsy for disintegration of impacted calculi.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{identify}} classification and grading systems of percutaneous nephrolithotomy-related complications and evidence for the prevention and treatment of these complications. RECENT FINDINGS: A total complication rate of up to 83 % following percutaneous nephrolithotomy was recognized. These complications were mostly clinically insignificant including minor bleeding or fever. The frequency of major complications was 0. 9 - 4. 7 % for septicemia, 0. 6 - 1. 4 % for renal hemorrhage requiring intervention, 2. 3 - 3. 1 % for pleural injury and 0. 2 - 0. 8 % for colonic injury. The significance of grading perioperative complications according to their severity, emphasizing the need for a unique and broadly accepted classification system, which could be helpful for monitoring and reporting outcomes emerged from the current review. The modified Clavien system has recently been used for this purpose. Proper patient selection, preoperative imaging for planning the operation, adequate antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy, manipulation of the collecting system only under <b>fluoroscopic</b> or endoscopic <b>control,</b> use of a continuous flow system, use of normal saline as irrigant fluid, judicious stone fragmentation and finally fluoroscopic monitoring of nephrostomy tube insertion and removal are necessary to prevent percutaneous nephrolithotomy complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Of 756 {{percutaneous}} controlled radiofrequency thermocoagulations of gasserian ganglion and/or retrogasserian rootlets for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia or for trigeminal neuralgia {{in multiple}} sclerosis, {{the results in}} 158 patients who had isolated third division trigeminal neuralgia were reviewed. METHODS: In 129 patients, percutaneous thermocoagulation was fluoroscopic guided, whereas in the last 29 the procedure was performed under CT control. In all cases, {{the goal was to}} achieve selective anesthesia limited to the third trigeminal division. RESULTS: Complete pain relief was obtained immediately after the procedure in all patients and selective anesthesia in the third division was achieved in all of them, except for 2 patients in whom unwanted first and second division anesthesia/hypoesthesia also occurred. Other significant complications were transient sixth cranial nerve palsy in 1 patient and masseter muscle dysfunction, which improved during follow-up, in another one. The selected sensory impairment was well tolerated in all patients. During an average follow-up period of 8. 8 years, recurrences occurred in 12 patients, together with a partial regression of the anesthesia: in 10 patients the procedure was repeated successfully. In 2 patients with multiple sclerosis, the procedure was repeated twice and 3 times, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous controlled radiofrequency thermocoagulation is quite easy to perform under <b>fluoroscopic</b> or CT <b>control,</b> and it involves no mortality and very low morbidity; it is an immediately effective procedure and the rate of recurrence is low. Last, but not least, if the anesthesia is limited to the third division, no anesthesia dolorosa occurs and patients are very grateful...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Currently applied {{endoscopic}} palliative {{treatment of}} advanced rectosigmoidal carcinoma is {{hampered by the}} cost of the equipment, the need for repeated, often painful treatment sessions, and the occurrence of complications. Metallic expandable stents are effective in the palliation of malignant esophageal and biliary stenoses. We evaluated the use of a new type of self-expandable nitinol stent in the palliation of rectosigmoidal carcinoma. METHODS: In 10 patients with advanced obstructing rectosigmoidal carcinoma, initial Nd:YAG laser treatment was performed if necessary to allow passage of a gastroscope. Subsequently, a self-expanding nitinol stent with flanged ends was inserted under combined <b>fluoroscopic</b> and endoscopic <b>control.</b> Endoscopic and clinical follow-up was carried out at regular intervals. RESULTS: After 2 +/- 0. 4 sessions of initial laser therapy, minimal lumen diameter was 9 +/- 1 mm. Stent insertion was successful in 9 patients, increasing minimal lumen diameter to 14 +/- 1. 2 mm (p < 0. 005). In one patient, stent deployment was complicated by a sigmoid perforation, requiring surgery. After insertion, colorectal stents remained adequately positioned and free of obstruction for 103 +/- 31 days. Patient survival after stent placement was 204 +/- 43 days. Stent migration occurred in 3 patients, after 38 +/- 10 days. Obstruction of the stent because of tumor ingrowth was observed in only one patient, after 268 days. CONCLUSION: Insertion of self-expandable nitinol stents in patients with rectosigmoidal carcinoma is technically feasible. Metallic stents are effective in the palliation of malignant rectosigmoid obstruction; they provide an alternative to repeated palliative laser therapy or palliative surgery. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AimDefinitive surgery of ectopic ureter {{in infants}} is challenging. We propose an {{endoscopic}} urinary diversion (EUD) as a novel surgical technique {{in the initial}} management of symptomatic obstructive ectopic ureter. Patients and methodsSixteen obstructive ectopic ureters (14 patients) were initially treated by EUD between 2006 and 2015. All patients had urinary tract dilatation worsening at preoperative US scans {{and at least two}} febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) or urinary sepsis despite antibiotic prophylaxis. Ectopic ureter was confirmed by cystoscopy. When ectopic meatus was not found, EUD consisted {{in the creation of a}} transurethral neo-orifice (TUNO) performed by needle puncturing of the ureterovesical wall, under <b>fluoroscopic</b> and ultrasound <b>control.</b> If ectopic meatus was identified in the posterior urethra, “intravesicalization procedure” was done opening the urethral–ureteral wall to create a new ureteral outlet into the bladder. ResultsEUD was done at a median age of 3. 5 [*]months (0. 5 – 7) with median follow-up of 48 [*]months (24 – 136). TUNO was performed in six patients and “intravesicalization” in eight patients. Significant differences were observed in ureteral diameter and anteroposterior pelvis diameter before and after endoscopic treatment (p[*]<[*] 0. 005). Initial renal function was preserved in all cases. Postoperative complications were UTI in four patients and TUNO stenosis in one patient, treated by endoscopic balloon dilation. Definitive treatment was further individualized in each patient after 1 [*]year of life. ConclusionEUD is a feasible and safe less-invasive technique in the initial management of symptomatic obstructive ectopic ureter. It allows an adequate ureteral drainage preserving renal function until definitive repair if necessary and does not invalidate other surgical options in case of failure or future definitive treatments...|$|R

These procedures require long procedures and fluoroscopic exposure. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the performance of a new, nonfluoroscopic, real-time, three-dimensional navigation system for linear ablation at the left atrial roof and mitral isthmus. The study included 44 patients (54 +/- 10 years of age, 5 women) with drug-refractory AF, who underwent roof line or mitral isthmus linear ablation after 4 -PV isolation. In 22 patients, ablation was performed with the navigation system (test group), and in the remainders linear ablation was performed with <b>fluoroscopic</b> guidance alone (<b>control</b> group). Conduction block was achieved in 20 patients (91 %) in test group, and 21 patients (95 %) in the control group (ns). Use of the navigation system was associated with a shorter fluoroscopic exposure for roof line (5. 6 +/- 3. 0 minutes vs 8. 7 +/- 5. 0 minutes, P < 0. 05), and a trend for mitral isthmus ablation (7. 8 +/- 7. 8 minutes vs 12. 1 +/- 5. 9 minutes). It was also associated with a trend toward shorter procedure times for roof line (15. 3 +/- 8. 6 minutes vs 22. 9 +/- 16. 8 minutes) and mitral isthmus line (20. 2 +/- 15. 8 minutes vs 32. 0 +/- 7. 6 minutes) but no difference in duration of radiofrequency delivery. There was no procedural complication. The use of this new nonfluoroscopic imaging system was associated with a shorter fluoroscopic exposure as well as a trend toward shorter duration of linear ablation procedures for AF.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the safety, feasibility, and clinical efficacy of percutaneous transhepatic injection of beta-cell grafts {{in patients with}} type 1 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2001 and November 2003, 15 patients with C-peptide-negative type 1 diabetes underwent 31 percutaneous injections for intraportal implantation of beta-cell grafts. Grafts consisted of cultured beta-cell preparations as previously described. In 13 cases, the transplant procedure was done under sedation, whereas in 18 cases, general anesthesia was given. In all procedures, percutaneous access to the right portal vein occurred under ultrasound (US) guidance with use of a microbore puncture needle. The subsequent catheterization of the main portal vein was performed under <b>fluoroscopic</b> and angiographic <b>control</b> with use of a microbore delivery catheter and guide wire. Clinical, biochemical, and radiologic evaluation was performed {{before and after the}} procedure. RESULTS: In all cases, it was possible to access the portal vein (median number of needle passes, 1; range, 1 - 6). The volume of cultured beta-cell grafts injected for each transplantation averaged 0. 58 mL (range, 0. 26 - 1. 60 mL) and the mean recorded procedure time (from puncture to catheter withdrawal) was 19 minutes (range, 10 - 80 min). Three patients presented with transient abdominal pain immediately after the procedure; postprocedural duplex US of the liver revealed a patent portal vein and end branches in all cases and a minor perihepatic fluid collection in another three patients. From the end of week 1 to week 3, a mean 3. 8 -fold increase in liver aminotransferase levels was measured in all recipients after the first implantation session. A similar increase was seen in only one patient after a second transplantation session. At 6 months after transplantation, 13 of 15 patients (86 %) had a functioning graft with plasma C-peptide levels greater than 0. 5 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The combined US, fluoroscopic, and angiographic monitoring of percutaneous transhepatic injection with use of a microbore delivery catheter is a safe and reproducible radiologic procedure for transplantation of beta-cell grafts in diabetic patients. Increased posttransplantation C-peptide levels, which demonstrate acceptable graft function, can be obtained. status: publishe...|$|R

The median number of impulses in the latter was 4, 335 and 1, 800 with the former technique. Two parameters influenced the manner of laser guidance. In cases of stones situated above a stricture, cholangioscopic control was more effective (64. 7 % vs. 31. 9 %). When the stones were in the distal bile duct, <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>control</b> was more successful. CONCLUSION: In cases of difficult stones in the distal bile duct, laser lithotripsy under <b>fluoroscopic</b> <b>control</b> is very effective and easily performed. Cholangioscopic guidance should be recommended just in cases of intrahepatic stones or in patients with stones situated proximal to a bile duct stenosis. In these cases, cholangioscopy should be performed either endoscopically or percutaneously...|$|E
