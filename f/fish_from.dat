5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.|$|E

50|$|Recreational {{fishermen}} usually <b>fish</b> either <b>from</b> a boat {{or from a}} shoreline or river bank. When <b>fishing</b> <b>from</b> a boat, {{or fishing}} vessel, most fishing technique can be used, <b>from</b> nets to <b>fish</b> traps, but some form of angling {{is by far the}} most common. Compared to <b>fishing</b> <b>from</b> the land, <b>fishing</b> <b>from</b> a boat allows more access to different fishing grounds and different species of fish.|$|R

5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first.

5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid.

5|$|A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, {{it states}} that hairy trout {{were the result}} of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, {{fisherman}} would act as barbers and lure <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E

Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century.

5|$|Early <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> {{the fossil}} record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned the crops {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food rations had to be cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> Norway. The 1942 harvest was a good one and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E

Celebrated chefs from this region include Fernand Point, Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers and Alain Chapel.

5|$|In 1469 Shetland {{came under}} nominal Scottish control, {{although}} the Norse 'Lairds of Norway' kept their Papa Stour estates until the 17th century. In the 16th century merchants from Bremen and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> the local fleet. By the 18th century, two Scottish lairds, Thomas Gifford of Busta, and Arthur Nicolson of Lerwick, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous Haaf (Old Norse: 'deep sea') fishing industry, {{undertaken in the}} summer months using six-oared boats known as sixareens.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> the Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, {{produced by the}} diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in <b>fish</b> <b>from</b> clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
