25|$|While {{it is an}} {{emerging}} and developing field, {{the question of whether}} life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry. Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist David Grinspoon calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory. NASA's interest in <b>exobiology</b> first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first <b>exobiology</b> project, and in 1960, NASA founded an <b>Exobiology</b> Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. NASA's Viking missions to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biology experiments designed to look for metabolism of present life on Mars.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{objectives of}} the Mars Express mission represent an attempt to fulfill in part the lost scientific goals of the Russian Mars 96 mission, complemented by <b>exobiology</b> research with Beagle-2. Mars exploration is crucial for {{a better understanding of}} the Earth from the perspective of comparative planetology.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology is {{the study}} of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe: {{extraterrestrial}} life and life on Earth. Astrobiology addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does. The term <b>exobiology</b> is similar but more specific—it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.|$|E
25|$|The Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR) was {{designed}} to conduct scientific studies of lunar impact processes {{in support of the}} Apollo missions. In 1979, it was established as a National Facility, funded through the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program. In 1995, increased scientific needs across various disciplines resulted in joint core funding by three different science programs at NASA Headquarters (Planetary Geology and Geophysics, <b>Exobiology,</b> and Solar System Origins). In addition, the AVGR provides programmatic support for various proposed and ongoing planetary missions (e.g. Stardust, Deep Impact).|$|E
25|$|Mars Express {{consists}} of two parts, the Mars Express Orbiter and the Beagle 2, a lander designed to perform <b>exobiology</b> and geochemistry research. Although the lander failed to fully deploy after it landed on the Martian surface, the orbiter has been successfully performing scientific measurements since early 2004, namely, high-resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the surface, radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the permafrost, precise determination of the atmospheric circulation and composition, and study of {{the interaction of the}} atmosphere with the interplanetary medium.|$|E
25|$|ExoMars (<b>Exobiology</b> on Mars) is {{a two-part}} {{astrobiology}} project {{to search for}} evidence of life on Mars, a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The first part, launched in 2016, placed a trace gas research and communication satellite into Mars orbit and released a stationary experimental lander (which crashed). The second part is planned to launch in 2020, and to land a rover on the surface, supporting a science mission {{that is expected to}} last into 2022 or beyond.|$|E
25|$|Sagan {{advocated}} scientific skeptical {{inquiry and}} the scientific method, pioneered <b>exobiology</b> and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). He {{spent most of his}} career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, where he directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal, the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for his book The Dragons of Eden, and, regarding Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, two Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award and the Hugo Award. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from myelodysplasia, Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Joshua Lederberg {{received}} the Nobel Prize {{and moved to}} Stanford University, {{where he was the}} founder and chairman of the Department of Genetics. He collaborated with Frank Macfarlane Burnet to study viral antibodies. With the launching of Sputnik in 1957, Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration. In a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft, causing catastrophic diseases. He also argued that, conversely, microbial contamination of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life. He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment prior to launch. Teaming up with Carl Sagan, his public advocacy for what he termed <b>exobiology</b> helped expand the role of biology in NASA.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Martian {{meteorite}} ALH84001, {{a specimen}} {{that is much}} older than the majority of Martian meteorites that have been recovered so far, received considerable attention {{when a group of}} NASA scientists led by David S. McKay reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay's team cited as evidence of life were found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of <b>exobiology.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{term was}} first {{proposed}} by the Russian (Soviet) astronomer Gavriil Tikhov in 1953.

50|$|Although NASA had {{explored}} {{the idea of}} forming an astrobiology institute in the past, when the Viking biological experiments returned negative results for life on Mars, the public lost interest and federal funds for <b>exobiology</b> dried up.
