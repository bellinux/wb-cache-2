40|$|The {{essay is}} about the concept of text <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective, what can be {{included}} in that, {{how it can be}} used and above all, why one might want to use it. The essay will also include what the term popular culture implies, and school’s attitude towards it, since some of the medias that {{are a part of the}} text <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective, many times fits the description “popular culture”. Most of the earlier research show that the positive aspects of the use of text <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective as the same time as it attacks school because school is opposing the popular culture.       The essay consists of two parts and it begins with a theoretical part where I present existing research about the concept of text <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective and the research about popular culture. After that, there is an empirical part where I show my results from interviewing five active teachers that teach Swedish in senior high school, and their thoughts about the concept of text <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective. The result does not agree with the earlier research about how school does not appreciate popular culture, which I will show in the essay. All the teachers agreed though, that the concept of text <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> perspective was something that one should use while teaching...|$|R
