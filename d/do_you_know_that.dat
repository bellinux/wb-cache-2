2500|$|Umar's swift imparting {{of justice}} against his {{governors}} for any misdeeds they commit made even famous powerful governors such as Muawiyah scared of him. Ali ibn Abu Talib during the later rule of Uthman ibn Affan wanted Uthman {{to be more}} strict with his governors saying,I adjure you by God, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mu'awiyah was more afraid of Umar than was Umar's own servant Yarfa? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Do {{you know}} that Umar kept Mu'awiyah in office {{throughout}} his entire caliphate, and I have only done the same." [...] 'Ali answered, [...] "I adjure you by God, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mu'awiyah was more afraid of Umar than was Umar's own slave Yarfa?" [...] "Yes," [...] said (Uthman). 'Ali went on, [...] "In fact Mu'awiyah makes decisions on issues without [...] you, and you know it. Thus, {{he says to the}} people. 'This is Uthman's command.' You hear of this, but do not censure him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gurdjieff's former {{students}} who have criticized him argue that, despite his seeming total lack of pretension {{to any kind of}} [...] "guru holiness," [...] in many anecdotes his behavior displays the unsavory and impure character {{of a man who was}} a cynical manipulator of his followers. Gurdjieff's own pupils wrestled to understand him. [...] For example, in a written exchange between Luc Dietrich and Henri Tracol dating to 1943: [...] "L.D.: [...] How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Gurdjieff wishes you well? [...] H.T.: [...] I feel sometimes how little I interest him—and how strongly he takes an interest in me. [...] By that I measure the strength of an intentional feeling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Larry Laudan has {{suggested}} pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly {{used to describe}} our emotions: [...] "If we would {{stand up and be}} counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us". Likewise, Richard McNally states, [...] "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" [...] and [...] "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> your intervention works? What is your evidence?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{ultimately}} {{decided to}} rescind the order. Brander Matthews, {{a friend of}} Roosevelt {{and one of the}} chief advocates of the reform as chairman of the Simplified Spelling Board, remonstrated with him for abandoning the effort. Roosevelt replied on December 16, 1906: [...] "I could not by fighting have kept the new spelling in, and it was evidently worse than useless to go into an undignified contest when I was beaten. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the one word as to which I thought the new spelling was wrong – thru – was more responsible than anything else for our discomfiture?" [...] Next summer Roosevelt was watching a naval review when a press boat marked [...] "Pres Bot" [...] chugged ostentatiously by. The President waved and laughed with delight.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{their work}} is {{visually}} impressive and often controversial {{as a result of}} its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar landscapes. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo's wrappings as a [...] "revelation through concealment." [...] To his critics Christo replies, [...] "I am an artist, and I have to have courage... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I don't have any artworks that exist? [...] They all go away when they're finished. [...] Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 638, {{there was}} yet another {{incident}} where Wang, by then the minister of ceremonies, suggested that high-level officials {{should not have to}} yield to imperial princes when their processions meet. [...] Emperor Taizong initially saw this as an insult to the imperial princes—particularly Li Tai, whom he was secretly considering replacing Li Chengqian with—and he made the statement, [...] "Life is uncertain. [...] If the Crown Prince should die early, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one of the princes would not be your lord in the future. [...] How can you disrespect them?" [...] Wei, seeing what was happening, spoke bluntly, [...] "Ever since Zhou Dynasty, succession is always from father to son, not to brothers, to prevent plotting by younger sons and stop infighting at their origin. [...] This is what the rulers need to be careful about." [...] Emperor Taizong thereafter approved Wang's proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Wu Zetian {{was born}} into a rich family. She had {{servants}} at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers. Wu {{did not seem to be}} the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day. So Wu read and learned about many different topics such as politics and other governmental affairs, writing, literature, and music. Wu grew and continued to learn as much as she could, with her father backing her every step of the way. At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of Emperor Taizong of Tang. It was there that she became a type of secretary. This opportunity allowed her to continue to pursue her education. She was given the title of cairen, title for one of the consorts with the fifth rank in Tang's nine-rank system for imperial officials, nobles, and consorts. When she was summoned to the palace, her mother, the Lady Yang, wept bitterly when saying farewell to her, but she responded, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is not my fortune to meet the Son of Heaven?" [...] Lady Yang reportedly then understood her ambitions, and therefore stopped crying.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1939, Gromyko {{started working}} for the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in Moscow. Gromyko became the Head of the Department of Americas and because of his {{position}} Gromyko met with United States ambassador to the Soviet Union Lawrence Steinhardt. Gromyko believed Steinhardt to be [...] "totally uninterested in creating good relations between the US and the USSR" [...] and that Steinhardt's predecessor Joseph Davies was more [...] "colourful" [...] and seemed [...] "genuinely interested" [...] in improving {{the relations between the}} two countries. Davies received the Order of Lenin for his work in trying to improve diplomatic relations between the US and the USSR. After heading the Americas department for 6 months, Gromyko was called upon by Joseph Stalin. Stalin started the conversation by telling Gromyko that he would be sent to the Soviet embassy in the United States to become second-in-command. [...] "The Soviet Union," [...] Stalin said, [...] "should maintain reasonable relations with such a powerful country like the United States, {{especially in light of the}} growing fascist threat". Vyacheslav Molotov contributed with some minor modifications but mostly agreed with what Stalin had said. [...] "How are your English skills improving?," [...] Stalin asked, [...] "Comrade Gromyko you should pay a visit or two to an American church and listen to their sermons. Priests usually speak correct English with good accents. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Russian revolutionaries when they were abroad, always followed this practice to improve their skills in foreign languages?" [...] Gromyko was quite amazed about what Stalin had just told him but he never visited an American church.|$|E
