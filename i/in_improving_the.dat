5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|Reddy was succeeded as President by Giani Zail Singh who {{was sworn}} in on 25 July 1982. In his {{farewell}} address to the nation, Reddy criticised the failure of successive governments <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> lives of the Indian masses and called {{for the emergence of}} a strong political opposition to prevent governmental misrule. Following his presidential term, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde invited Reddy to settle down in Bangalore but he chose to retire to his farm in Anantapur. He died of pneumonia in Bangalore in 1996 at the age of 83. His samadhi is at Kallahalli near Bangalore. The Parliament mourned Reddy's death on 11 June 1996 and members cutting across party lines paid him tribute and recalled his contributions to the nation and the House.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Magda {{originated}} from a tropical low that was first {{identified by the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) on 18 January 2010 near the Indonesian island of Roti. Initially situated in a weak steering environment, the low drifted towards the southwest and gradually gained intensity. The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the system. Throughout 19 January, a developing low-level circulation showed improved organisation, feature deep convection over its centre. Atmospheric conditions in the region favoured further development, featuring low to moderate wind shear. A trough situated near the coast of Western Australia aided <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> low's outflow. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system; they expected the low to intensify into a tropical cyclone within the following 24hours.|$|E
5|$|The Princess {{production}} {{department of the}} Thanhouser Company started in 1913. It would have a film released on every Friday. Early Princess productions were mostly comedies that performed well, but the company's dramas were often unfavorable. The early Princess productions were marked by their poor scenarios that were illogically written or consisted of uninteresting material. Princess produced films out of a studio in New Rochelle from 1913 until 1915, when the production brand was changed and renamed Falstaff. The production and release of Across the Way occurred before Edwin Thanhouser returned and took personal interest <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> quality of the productions at the New Rochelle studio. The new brand, Falstaff, would soon replace the Princess productions.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light industrial goods. Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have a majority in the Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had a majority in the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental <b>in</b> <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J.
