I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift.

In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, because I <b>feel</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> overprotected.

5000|$|Following the album's release, Haines {{responded to}} a {{question}} about the changing meaning of songs over time and stated in relation to a lyric from the title song [...] "Synthetica": [...] "Like, 'Hey, I'm not synthetica'—sometimes it feels like a totally victorious statement and sometimes it <b>feels</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> beaten down … but it's just rock 'n' roll, you know. I'm not meaning to be pretentious about it at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|Sorry State Records: [...] "The Self-Titled Album also <b>feels</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> disorienting, {{but with}} a {{considerably}} shorter running length it at least gives off the surface impression of being more digestible. If you never liked Tenement before, I doubt that The Self-Titled Album {{is going to be}} the record that flips you since the rather slick production and Amos's distinctive singing style style still fly in the face of punk's cult of lo-fi. However, if you're a Tenement fan (particularly of their post-Napalm Dream material), this is an essential record, more immediate and, in a way at least, even more adventurous and free than Predatory Headlights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it wasn't so hard, that part. I just {{hid in the}} house, and--but say, let's forget it; {{it makes}} me <b>feel</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mean, somehow.

6000|$|A man who lay {{close by}} looked {{up with a}} twinkle in his eyes. “I have seen smarter soldiers,” he drawled. “Still, they’re a hard crowd, and I’d <b>feel</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sorry for Colonel Morales if his cazadores don’t put up a good fight to‐night.

60|$|AMERICAN. So you say. But I judge your form of chivalry is {{sacrifice}} to the state. We allow {{more freedom to}} the individual soul. Where there's something little and weak, we <b>feel</b> it <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> noble to give up to it. That way we feel elevated.|$|R
