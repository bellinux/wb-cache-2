They never saw one another as children {{and he did not}} know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a [...] "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant.

500|$|In August 1972, Nixon {{announced}} Romney would inspect Hurricane Agnes flood {{damage in}} Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, but neglected to tell Romney first. [...] Much {{of the area}} lacked shelter six weeks after the storm, residents were angry, and Romney got into a three-way shouting match with Governor Milton J. Shapp and a local citizens' representative. [...] Romney denounced Shapp's proposal {{that the federal government}} pay off the mortgages of victims as [...] "unrealistic and demagogic", and the representative angrily said to Romney, [...] "You don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> whether we live or die." [...] The confrontation received wide media attention, damaging Romney's public reputation. [...] Feeling very frustrated, Romney wanted to resign immediately, but Nixon, worried about the fallout to his 1972 re-election campaign, insisted that Romney stay on. [...] Romney agreed, although he indicated to the press that he would leave eventually.|$|E

500|$|Friday {{was known}} for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances. Hurley later said that Friday would often become furious at his {{teammates}} for not trying their best, even in training. [...] This strong drive to always win even extended {{to the use of}} physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a [...] "villain". Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle their testicles. Cardiff teammate Paul Went recalled that these tricks would [...] "completely [...] " [...] defenders and affect their concentration. [...] Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: [...] "On the pitch I hate all opponents.

500|$|Brosnan's Bond was {{introduced}} in Goldeneye; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond {{into the history of}} the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball, [...] "thus immediately evoking the memory of [...] Connery". Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being [...] "closer to the Fleming novels than Moore... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton". Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking. Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying [...] "I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke", although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in Die Another Day. Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a [...] "mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were [...] "flippant, but not crass".|$|E
500|$|With the {{lull in the}} fighting, and {{the onset}} of autumn rains, coupled with endless hills and {{deepening}} mud, Middleton's left knee, which had been uncomfortable {{for more than a}} year, was now becoming agonizing. He had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football, but there was no immediate explanation for the pain in his left leg. Medics studied his leg, but had no answers. In late November Middleton went to the hospital in Naples, staying well into December, still without adequate diagnosis. He was able to hobble around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton's difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, [...] "I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about his knees; I want his head and his heart. And I'll take him into battle on a litter if we have to." [...] Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.|$|E

5000|$|... "Jackie Brown" [...] {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} poverty and stimulates images of the hardships faced by those living in poverty. A lyric in the song's final verse which reads [...] "...But who <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about Jackie Brown?

5000|$|... "Notorious" [...] {{marked the}} debut of the new {{streamlined}} trio version of Duran Duran, as Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor had left the band {{by the time the}} album was released. In fact, the acrimonious nature of Andy Taylor's departure was reflected in the song to a certain degree. According to songwriter Simon Le Bon, the lyric [...] "Who really <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> for <b>a</b> flaky bandit" [...] was a direct dig at the guitarist.|$|R
500|$|The initial Columbia Records {{pressing}} of {{the single}} listed the title as [...] "Bolero" [...] and [...] "Jeff Beck" [...] as the composer. [...] However, Jimmy Page filed for the composer credit for [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] and it is his name that appears on the credits {{for all but the}} initial release. Nonetheless, Beck has claimed credit for his contributions to the composition. [...] Both Beck and Page agree that Page came up with the Boléro-influenced chords and rhythm. [...] However, Beck specifically claims that key features of the instrumental—the haunting melody line and the second part [...] "hard-rock" [...] break—are his. [...] Beck adds that the break contains [...] "the first heavy metal riff ever written and I wrote it". [...] While not addressing the specifics, Page asserts [...] "I wrote it, played on it, produced it... and I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> what [...] says. [...] That's the truth", but adds [...] "the slide bits are his". Beck later put it behind him, [...] "No, I didn't get a songwriting credit, but you win some and lose some down the years". Over the years, he and Page have made several appearances together in concerts and for interviews.|$|E
500|$|Poppy Cosyns of The Sun said Spears [...] "reaffirm her bad-girl {{image on}} the album's {{infectious}} second single", while BBC Music's Talia Kraines thought that the singer [...] "loves the attention being shone directly on her as the 'ringleader' as she sings of adrenaline flowing through her veins when it's time {{to put on a}} show." [...] Ben Norman of About.com considered the song a [...] "true and triumphant Britney Spears pop song with a pensive underbelly (the first verse in particular) and a supremely executed hook." [...] Jonny Mugwump of The Quietus said, [...] "a paean to her performance adrenalin, [...] a medium-paced, big power-popper topped with an orbit-esque guitar," [...] and commented that the song's lyrics highlight Spears' uniqueness – [...] "the fuck you attitude. Despite everything, regardless of the personal destruction and undoubted hell she might still be haunted by, within the fictional space of the music, this woman couldn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn.</b> She rightly taunts the world around her, sounding utterly defiant. There is no place for apology or humble platitudes." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH also praised its lyrics, describing them as [...] "a confident, and encouraging, return to form." [...] "Circus" [...] was nominated at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards in the category of Choice Music: Single, but lost to Miley Cyrus's [...] "The Climb".|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{by the press}} lords, notably Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere for [...] "Empire Free Trade", the removal of tariffs within the Empire, culminated in a crucial by-election at which the press lords ran their own candidate {{under the banner of}} the United Empire Party. Robert Topping, the General Director at Conservative Central Office, produced a memorandum showing that Baldwin's support had eroded tremendously. Chamberlain confronted Baldwin with the memorandum. Baldwin was badly shaken, and told Chamberlain he would resign. After a day, Baldwin reconsidered, and even considered giving up his seat and standing in the by-election himself. When Chamberlain told Baldwin that if he stood and lost, his successor would be badly damaged, Baldwin replied, [...] "I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about my successor, Neville." [...] Chamberlain resigned as party chairman, though he continued as head of the Conservative Research Department, which he had founded, until his death. Baldwin did not stand in the by-election, but he retained his position and attacked the press barons as wanting [...] "power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot through the ages", and the Conservatives won the election. Baldwin and Chamberlain healed their breach, and Chamberlain helped negotiate the return of the press lords to the Conservative fold. Baldwin led the Conservative Party for another six years. In January 1931, Churchill, one of Chamberlain's leadership rivals, left the Conservative front bench in a dispute over policy on India.|$|E

500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|In June 1942, Haynes went to China to {{organize}} and command the Bomber Command of the China Air Task Force (CATF) under General Claire Chennault. His fighter group counterpart was Scott—the three air leaders were {{the subject of a}} Life magazine article in August which described them as like-minded Southerners who [...] "are quietly tough, despise the word can't, eliminate all red tape and allow subordinates full range for individual initiative". Haynes told Jack Belden, the Life journalist, that he [...] "used to like pursuits better but now he likes bombers", and other airmen confirmed to Belden that Haynes handled bombers as easily as fighters. Belden wrote that the open and frank bomber group leader [...] "does not <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about playing Army politics". Chennault, Haynes and Scott were said to [...] "form just about the smartest, don't-give-a-damned-est trio Asia has ever seen." [...] Rarely able to send out more than four or five B-25 Mitchell twin-engine bombers at a time, supported by P-40s each carrying another bomb, Haynes constantly shifted his targets and kept the enemy guessing. Fuel and bomb scarcity limited the scope of operations. For instance, the only sortie on July 8 was Haynes piloting a single B-25 to bomb Japanese headquarters in Tengchong, China, near the border of Burma. Claims and losses in July proved the value of the strategy: One B-25 and five P-40s were lost in the destruction of 24 enemy fighters and 12 bombers. Supplies began to increase in the following months.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>damn</b> about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert panned {{the film}} and the motivations for {{producing}} the drama, writing: [...] "From the beginning, {{it sounded like a}} bad dream.
