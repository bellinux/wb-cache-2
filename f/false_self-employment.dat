5000|$|<b>False</b> <b>self-employment</b> is a {{situation}} in which somebody registered as self-employed, a freelancer, or a temp is de facto an employee carrying out a professional activity under the authority and subordination of another company. Such <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions. While a modern [...] "gig economy" [...] encourages more casual employment practices in the interests of labour flexibility, the extent to which this disguises precarious employment and denial of rights is of growing concern to authorities.|$|E
5000|$|A British {{trade union}} UCATT which {{specialized}} {{in the construction}} industry has expressed concern that <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> was being used by many British employers to evade taxes and engage workers without having to respect employment rights and entitlements such as holiday pay, sick pay and pensions. In their opinion, whilst the practice was immoral, it was not, in their view, necessarily illegal.The UK taxation arrangement known as the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) allowed registered companies to deduct tax at source and thus avoid employing workers directly as their regular or casual employee who would thus have acquired legal employee rights.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss recent trends in false (bogus) {{self-employment}} in east-west labour migration in Sweden after the enlargement of the EU into the former Eastern Bloc. The study explores the reasons for using “self-employed” migrant workers in the construction and road haulage industries, how the workers are recruited and how the organised parties in the labour market have recognised and responded to this practice. The emphasis is on the intertwined relationships between self-employment as a mode of exploitation and as a strategy for survival in the labour market, which always has made <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> a complex matter for the trade unions to address. The analysis also relates to the current scholarly debate on dual labour markets. The study shows that the practice of <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> has increased in recent years in both industries. Yet there are other ways to avoid Swedish collective agreements and labour standards, for example by concluding “false collective agreements”. The study analyses the reasons behind this increase in a Swedish and international context. The discussion includes, among other things, how <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> is related to the use of long subcontracting chains, the infringement of the EU regulations on the cabotage traffic and the evasion of taxes and social fees in the host countries. It also includes why combating <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> has become a matter of converging interests and organised cooperation between the social partners in the road haulage industry, but as yet not in the construction industr...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss the problem of <b>false</b> (bogus) <b>self-employment</b> and other {{precarious}} forms of employment in the ‘grey area’ between genuine self-employment and subordinate employment in Sweden. Why has this area developed in a longer and shorter perspective? How does the use of disguised and ambiguous forms of employment affect workers, industrial relations and regular labour standards? Examples are given from the construction, road haulage and cleaning industries. The article indicates that work in the grey area has become more and more common in recent years, not only in the context of east-west labour migration, but also among Swedish workers. The author also discusses this development...|$|R
40|$|Swedens {{membership}} in the European Union have resulted in an international characterized labour market. The construction sector is the area who employs most posted workers among the 7400 employees who monthly enters the market. It’s also the sector where {{a big part of}} the work-related deaths occurs. The purpose of this study is therefore to contribute to a greater understanding of the regulation regarding posted workers, their work environment and the consequences of it. I have been using the right dogmatic method and a social science perspective as complement in order to answer the purpose of the study.  The application of the posted workers directive has been criticized for opening opportunities for <b>false</b> <b>self-employment</b> and limiting the trade unions rights. Combined with the Laval-case the trade unions have restricted possibilities to enforce the collective agreements and protect the posted workers rights. Subcontracting processes complicates the investigation regarding which employer who has the overall responsibility for safety regulations and work environment. Foreign workers tend to be a big part in these subcontractor chains with major linguistic difficulties and lack of legislation knowledge which increases the risk of accidents.  Arbetsmiljöverket is the authority who has the general responsibility for monitoring that the health and safety legislation are respected by all employers. Their investigations are partially based on the statistics of work-related accidents. But when it comes to foreign workers only more serious accidents are reported to the authority. Which means that minor incidents regarding foreign workers never reaches the statistics.           In summary, conclusion is drawn that the inspection of posted workers working environment are unsatisfied. The hands of the trade unions are tied by the legislation while the inspections by the monitoring authority are based on inadequate statistics. All that combine with the fact that posted workers tend to be unwilling or lack the knowledge to take action for their rights, leads to openings for employers to take advantage of foreign workers...|$|E
