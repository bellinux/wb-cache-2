40|$|The {{development}} of numerically controlled machines, group technology, cellular manufacturing and just-in-time (JIT) production systems have revolutionized the way products are designed and manufactured. These technological and strategic advances {{have changed the}} role of human operators in the manufacturing environment. The highly specialized work force of the low-tech manufacturing system has evolved into the multi-skilled work force of the high- tech manufacturing system. Among the multiple tasks that an operator is expected to perform in advance manufacturing systems (AMS) are job scheduling, inventory planning, machine set-up, problem-solving and quality inspection. Throughout this evolution, human sensory detection capabilities have been a vital but often ignored component of the quality <b>inspection</b> <b>task.</b> Although automation is often employed to construct and assemble products within AMS, most inspections and quality checks are still done by human operators due to the inherent problems in machine vision and decision-making.

Some studies indicate human inspectors typically find only ~ 80 % of the defects.

The required hardware and software components and abilities of such a mobile offshore inspection and manipulation robot are presented in this paper. Possible applications of mobile service robots in an offshore environment range from simple visual <b>inspection</b> <b>tasks</b> to physical intervention with the process equipment, e. g. for sample taking, valve turning, cleaning up minor obstructions, and operating control panels. The first prototype of a mobile offshore inspection robot {{is equipped with a}} robotic arm which carries a camera for visual inspection as well as various application sensors such as a microphone, gas and fire sensors. It is able of both, remote and autonomous inspection of industrial process equipment. In automatic mode the robot autonomously executes preprogrammed <b>inspection</b> <b>tasks.</b> The results of all <b>inspection</b> <b>tasks</b> are saved to a database and can be reviewed by the responsible operator in the central control room at any time. The evaluation of the first autonomous mobile robot that has ever been operated in offshore environments has proven the applicability of mobile robotics to offshore environments. Different types of <b>inspection</b> <b>tasks</b> (visual and acoustic inspection, gas measuring) have been programmed to and executed by the robot successfully without ever jeopardizing the safety of the platform or the platform personnel. The application of mobile robotics in offshore environments can reduce the level of manual human intervention required to operate a production facility thereby increasing the efficiency of the workforce, improving safety and working conditions, and improving the production economics. The successful evaluation of the first realization of a mobile inspection and manipulation robot has thus leveled the ground for future mobile robot installations in offshore environments...|$|R

Among the multiple tasks that an operator is expected to conduct in advanced manufacturing systems (AMS) are job scheduling, inventory planning, machine set-up, problem solving, and quality inspection. The quality <b>inspection</b> <b>task</b> in AMS consists of a search component, frequently conducted by a machine, and a decision making component conducted by the operator. This quality inspection system {{is often referred to}} as a hybrid inspection system (HIS). It has been demonstrated that in general the performance of HIS is better than that of pure human or pure automated inspection systems.
