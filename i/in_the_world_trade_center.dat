5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Three {{buildings}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> collapsed due to fire-induced structural failure. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59a.m. after burning for 56minutes {{in a fire}} {{caused by}} the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28a.m. after burning for 102minutes. When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7WTC), damaging it and starting fires. These fires burned for hours, compromising the building's structural integrity, and 7WTC collapsed at 5:21p.m. The {{west side of the}} Pentagon sustained significant damage.|$|E

5|$|Health effects {{extended}} to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths {{have been linked}} to the toxic dust, and the victims' names were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> memorial. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses {{as a result of the}} toxic dust. There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Four {{passenger}} airliners {{operated by}} two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines) — {{all of which}} departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for California — were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed, with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially steered toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. 9/11 was the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers {{in the history of}} the United States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively.|$|E

25|$|Benson was re-elected without {{opposition}} in late 2000. He and his slate of officers were easily renominated, while an opponent received only 17 {{of the necessary}} 4,998 signatures needed to run for office. During Benson's second term, several PEF members died during the September 11 attacks on New York City.

25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial it was {{revealed}} that the FBI had an informant, a former Egyptian army officer named Emad Salem. Salem claims to have informed the FBI of the plot to build a bomb that would eventually be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> towers as early as February 6, 1992. Salem's role as informant allowed the FBI to quickly pinpoint the conspirators out of hundreds of possible suspects.|$|E

25|$|The World Trade Center Transportation Hub is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's formal {{name for}} the new PATH station and the {{associated}} transit and retail complex that opened on March 3, 2016. The station's renaming took place when the station reopened. It was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and composed of a train station with a large and open mezzanine under the National September 11 Memorial plaza. This mezzanine is connected to an aboveground head house structure called the Oculus—located between 2 World Trade Center and 3 World Trade Center—as well as to public concourses under the various towers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> complex.|$|E
25|$|The bomb {{instantly}} {{cut off the}} World Trade Center's main {{electrical power}} line, knocking out the emergency lighting system. The bomb caused smoke {{to rise to the}} 93rd floor of both towers, including through the stairwells which were not pressurized, and smoke went up the damaged elevators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> Towers 1 & 2. With thick smoke filling the stairwells, evacuation was difficult for building occupants and led to many smoke inhalation injuries. Hundreds were trapped in elevators in the towers when the power was cut, including a group of 17 kindergartners, on their way down from the South Tower observation deck, who were trapped between the 35th and 36th floors for five hours.|$|E
25|$|Salameh's arrest led {{police to}} the {{apartment}} of Abdul Rahman Yasin in Jersey City, New Jersey, which Yasin was sharing with his mother, {{in the same building}} as Ramzi Yousef's apartment. Yasin was taken to the FBI's Newark field office in Newark, New Jersey, and was then released. The next day, he flew back to Iraq, via Amman, Jordan. Yasin was later indicted for the attack, and in 2001 he was placed on the initial list of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, on which he remains today. He disappeared before the U.S. coalition invasion, Operation Iraqi Freedom, in 2003. In March 1994, Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj were each convicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> bombing. In May 1994, they were sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

500|$|In January 2005, Churchill's work {{attracted}} controversy {{because of}} the circulation of a 2001 essay, [...] "On the Justice of Roosting Chickens", in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful US foreign policy over {{the latter half of}} the 20th century; the essay is well known for Churchill's use of the phrase [...] "little Eichmanns" [...] to describe the [...] "technocratic corps" [...] working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|E
500|$|Sprayed-fire {{resistant}} materials (SFRMs) {{were used}} to protect some structural steel elements in the towers, including all floor trusses and beams. [...] Gypsum wallboard in combination with SFRMs, {{or in some cases}} gypsum wallboard alone, was used to protect core columns. Vermiculite plaster was used on the interior-side and SFRMs on the other three sides of the perimeter columns for fire protection. The 1968 New York City building codes were more lenient in some aspects of fire protection, such as allowing three exit stairwells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Center</b> towers, instead of six as required under older building codes.|$|E
