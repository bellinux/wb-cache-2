40|$|Yalcin [8] {{introduces}} us to {{a previously}} unnoticed puzzle concerning {{the interpretation of}} a certain class of sentences containing epistemic modals (what he calls ‘epistemic contradictions’). Yalcin begins by noting that epis-temic contradictions are infelicitous in a way very much like Moore paradoxi-cal sentences are. He then observes that, unlike Moore paradoxical sentences, the oddness of epistemic contradictions remains even when embedded under certain operators. Let us call this contrast Yalcin’s Puzzle. To solve the puzzle, Yalcin first argues that a relational semantics for modal expressions of the kind familiar from standard modal logic will not suffice. He uses the puzzling data, plus the insufficiency of standard inter-pretation systems, to motivate an enrichment to the semantic machinery employed by natural language. The enrichment involves the addition of an <b>information</b> <b>parameter</b> that the interpretation function is to be relativized to.

40|$|To date, {{a formal}} Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based metaheuristic {{has not been}} applied for solving Unequal Area Facility Layout Problems (UA-FLPs). This study proposes an Ant System (AS) {{algorithm}} for solving UA-FLPs using the Flexible Bay Structure (FBS) representation. In addition, this study proposes an improvement to the FBS representation when solving problems which have empty spaces. The proposed algorithm uses several types of local search to improve its search performance. It was extensively tested using 20 well-known problem instances taken from the literature. The proposed algorithm is effective and can produce all of the best FBS solutions (or even better) except for 2 problem instances. In addition, it can improve the best-known solution for 7 problem instances. The improvement gained by the proposed algorithm is up to 21. 36 % compared to previous research. Evidently, the proposed algorithm is also proven to be effective when solving large problem sets with 20, 25, and 30 departments. Furthermore, this study has implemented a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to automate the tuning of the AS algorithm.

40|$|To {{overcome}} the disadvantages of a non-cooperative frequency hopping communication system, {{such as a}} high sampling rate and inadequate prior <b>information,</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation based on Blind Compressed Sensing (BCS) is proposed.

Compared with conventional compressive sensing, blind compressed sensing does not require prior information of the frequency hopping signals; hence, it offers an effective solution to the inadequate prior information problem. In the proposed method, the signal is first modeled and then reconstructed by Orthonormal Block Diagonal Blind Compressed Sensing (OBD-BCS), and the hopping frequencies and hop period are finally estimated.
