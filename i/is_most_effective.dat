5|$|Antiparasitic {{treatment}} <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> {{early in}} the course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate T. cruzi from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.|$|E

5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E

5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved {{to mimic the}} {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, but has no sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiencies}} {{of three}} disinfection methods namely boiling, water guard and pur purifier were assessed.

The major components of Water Guard and Pur Purifier {{were found to be}} NaNO 2,SO 4, Cl 2; and NaNO 2, Ca, CaCO 3, SO 4, Mg and ClO 2 respectively. Pur purifier <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> for removal of electrical conductivity, nitrate, total coliform and yeast while Water Guard <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> for removal of phosphate, potassium, E-Coli and Fungi. In addition, boiling and water guard <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> for removal of turbidity while boiling <b>was</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> for removal of chlorine. Furthermore, Water Guard was found to be the cheapest with an estimated monthly household cost of N 240.

25|$|There {{are only}} two {{chemical}} bird repellents registered {{for use in the}} United States. They are methyl anthranilate and anthraquinone. Methyl anthranilate is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant sensation that is reflexive and {{does not have to be}} learned. As such it <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> for transient populations of birds (DeVault et al. 2013). Methyl anthranilate has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flightlines at Homestead Air Reserve Station (Engeman et al. 2002). Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an aversive response (Izhaki 2002, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} which attack strategies (hub, bridge, or fragmentation) <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> at disrupting two online child pornography networks in terms of outcome measures that include density, clustering, compactness, and average path length.

Overall, hub attacks <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> at reducing network density and clustering, whereas fragmentation attacks <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> at reducing the network 2 ̆ 7 s distance-based cohesion and average path length.

50|$|The game {{features}} {{a variety of}} characters who join the battle party {{throughout the course of}} the game. Every character fits into one of seven character classes: Swordsman, Armor, Archer, Hawknight, Monk, Mage and Cleric. The strengths of each class are determined through a hierarchy similar to the hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors: melee fighters (such as Swordsmen and Armors) <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when fighting against Archers. Archers <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when fighting against airborne characters such as Hawknights. Hawknights <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when fighting against Swordsmen. The other three classes are magic-users: the Monk pairs healing magic with average physical strength, where the Mage specializes in attack magic, and the Cleric specializes in healing magic. In addition, Mages <b>are</b> also <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> against Armor. <b>Most</b> magic-using classes have weak defensive capabilities when compared to other classes in the game and most attacking magic spells are stronger against heavily armored opponents.|$|R
