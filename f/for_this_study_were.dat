5000|$|Evidence {{that there}} are {{exceptional}} cases came in a 2004 study on oats. The patients drafted <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> those who had symptoms of celiac disease when on a [...] "pure-oat" [...] challenge, therefore not representative of a celiac sample. This study found that four patients had symptoms after oat ingestion, and three had elevated Marsh scores for histology and avenin responsive T-cells, indicating avenin-sensitive enteropathy (ASE). All three patients were the DQ2.5/DQ2 (HLA DR3-DQ2/DR7-DQ2) phenotype. Patients with DQ2.5/DQ2.2 {{tend to be the}} most prone toward gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), have the highest risk for GS-EATL, and shows signs of more severe disease at diagnosis.While the DQ2.5/DQ2 phenotype represents only 25% of celiac patients, it accounts for all of the ASE celiacs, and 60-70% of patients with GS-EATL.Synthetic avenin peptides were synthesized either in native or deamidated form, and the deamidated peptides showed higher response.|$|E

50|$|The {{second study}} {{consisted}} of a Canadian national replication of the study from the pilot project. The same basic methodology was used — comparing COSA Core Members to matched comparison subjects. Participants <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> drawn from COSA projects across Canada, but not including members of the pilot project. In total, the reoffending of 44 Core Members was evaluated against 44 matched comparison subjects, with an average follow-up time of approximately three years. Similar to the first study, dramatic reductions in rates of reoffending were observed {{in the group of}} COSA Core Members. The study reported an 83% reduction in sexual recidivism, a 73% reduction in all types of violent recidivism (including sexual), and an overall reduction of 71% in all types of recidivism (including sexual and violent) in comparison to the matched offenders. The authors also presented a 3-year fixed-comparison analysis, controlling for differences in risk level. Further significant reductions in violent offending (82%) and any offending (83%) were reported, although with a smaller sample than their main analysis (18 Core Members and 17 non-COSA controls).|$|E

30|$|The {{main focus}} of <b>this</b> {{research}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to evaluate the lubricity among water-based mud, oil-based mud, water-based mud with glass beads, and water-based mud with polymer beads in high-temperature conditions. The temperature used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> from 60 to 180  °C. The equipment used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> Lubricity Evaluation Monitor (LEM- 4100). The pump rate and bob speed were kept constant at 850 and 250  rpm, respectively. Pump speed represents the rate of mud flow into wellbore through nozzle on a drill bit while bob rotation represents drill bit rotation in a wellbore. Stationary sample used <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> steel to rock surface.|$|R
