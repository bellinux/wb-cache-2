5|$|Young {{was born}} in Fallowfield, Manchester, where {{he lived with his}} parents and older brother Chris. His house was half a mile from Manchester City's Maine Road ground, which was visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window. As a schoolboy he played for Manchester Boys, facing opponents who were two years older. After {{catching}} the eye of scout Harry Godwin, Young signed for Manchester City as an apprentice in 1959, turning down the opportunity to join Manchester United. Around this time he was capped by England at youth level. He turned professional in July 1960, and made his first team debut in November 1961, in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. After breaking into the team for the first time, Young played every match in the remainder of the 1961–62 season. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 December 1961, in a 3–0 home win against Ipswich Town. He finished his first season with 11 goals in 26 appearances.|$|E

25|$|Corinna {{breaks down}} and {{admits that she}} is unable to cope with their rebellious {{daughter}} and agrees that Jerome can look after her – especially as Nan/Zoe has had such an immediate impact. Eventually she confesses that she had hoped this meeting {{would lead to a}} reconciliation between her and Jerome. Jerome is delighted by this and tells Corinna that Nan/Zoe is only an actress.

500|$|Two east-facing doors {{led into}} the house. [...] One, {{at the end of}} the eastern {{projection}} of the L, {{led into the}} kitchen-hall. [...] A second, on the east side of the southern projection, led from the space enclosed by the arms of the L into the parlor-dining room. [...] Two windows faced northward: one from the kitchen-hall, one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> [...] Two more faced southward: one from the kitchen-hall and one from the parlor-dining room. [...] A single window faced eastward from the kitchen-hall. [...] Windows were flush with the exterior walls of the house. [...] The window wells were beveled, widening toward the interior of the house; this admitted more light to the house. [...] The configuration of the west wall is not known, since the wall was removed in 1924.|$|E
2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E

The doorbell rings: it is George, {{with a bunch of}} snapdragons in his hand, calling out, [...] "Flores para los muertos" [...] (flowers for the dead), a reference to the play and movie A Streetcar Named Desire, also about a marriage and outside influences. Martha and George argue about whether the moon is up or down: George insists it is up, while Martha says she saw no moon <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> This leads to a discussion in which Martha and George insult Nick in tandem, an argument revealing that Nick was too drunk to have sex with Martha upstairs.|$|E

An opening for earlier french doors east of the central entrance doorway is infilled with vertical timber boards.|$|R
2500|$|Michael Psellos {{says that}} Gello also killed {{pregnant}} women and their fetuses. Thus Gello in general blocked the cycle of reproduction. The patriarch John of Damascus, in the treatise Peri strygnôn ("Regarding striges"), records a belief among the [...] "common people," [...] still current in his day, that ghosts called gelloudes or striges flew nocturnally, slipped into houses even when the windows and doors were barred, and strangled sleeping infants. John's use of the plural shows that Gello has become a type, rather than an individual revenant. The 14th-century Greek ecclesiastical historian Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos said gelloudes [...] "bring the infant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> as if about to devour him." [...] Leo Allatios explicitly cross-identifies striges and gelloudes, recasting the demonic or revenant gello of Eastern tradition as the witch of Western Europe, who is often marginalized by age and poverty. The transformation of the gello from the ancient [...] "virginal reproductive demon" [...] to an envious crone occurs in the Christian era; what the virgin and crone share is their exclusion from the reproductive cycle, and their envy of fertility. The Greek folk belief continued into the modern era.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{episode in}} Season 1, titled [...] "Fenster Hall" [...] (aired March 31, 1985), was a {{failed attempt to}} create a {{spin-off}} of Punky Brewster. It was originally a one-hour episode, but was cut into two shows for syndication. This crossover episode marked the debut of Mike Fulton; T. K. Carter was the intended star of the Fenster Hall spin-off. Mike's history as a longtime resident of Fenster was explained, since he had been an orphan from birth and had been shuffled around to many foster homes before permanently staying at Fenster {{from the time he was}} seven. Now as the chief boys' counselor, Mike was saddled with helping new, tough street kid T.C. Finestra (Billy Lombardo) fit in with his group of regular charges, after an incident in which T.C. broke into and stole <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> of Punky Brewster. Punky had a confrontation with T.C. after following him to a shady lair kept by street thug Blade (James LeGros), who had taken T.C. under his wing and was teaching him how to rob. It was there in which Punky learned of T.C.'s situation, and brought him home to Henry before it was decided that he would be better off at Fenster.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{early to}} mid 20th century novelist {{associated}} with Birmingham was J. R. R. Tolkien, whose books The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings {{are two of}} the world's four best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million and over 150 million copies in print respectively. Although Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in South Africa, he later called this a [...] "fallacious fact" [...] claiming that he [...] "happened to be born there by accident". Both of his parents were from Birmingham and he was brought up in the city from the age of three, living in Sarehole – an area of Hall Green then on the semi-rural southern edge of the city – and in Moseley, Kings Heath, Edgbaston and Rednal. Tolkien later remembered his time in Hall Green in particular as [...] "the longest-seeming and most formative part of my life" [...] and numerous connections have been made between his Birmingham upbringing and features of his work: Sarehole Mill has been seen as the inspiration for the [...] "Great Mill" [...] of The Hobbit; Moseley Bog as the basis of the [...] "Old Forest" [...] of Book One of The Lord of the Rings; and the gothic brick towers of Perrott's Folly and Edgbaston Waterworks – dominating the skyline <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window of Tolkien's home in Stirling Street, Edgbaston – as the inspiration for [...] "The Two Towers" [...] of Book Two of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
50|$|The district's {{exclusive}} character {{had arisen}} {{because it was}} generally not cost-effective for the Corporation to build such prestigious, low-density developments, especially in the depressed economic climate of the inter-war years. Mosspark was consequently a showpiece of modern planning in Glasgow, but it could not serve as a realistic blueprint for the Corporation's long-term housing strategy. Similar later housing schemes were built like Knightswood although the blueprint was changed to cheaper building materials, fireplaces were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> and interior walls were no longer brick.|$|R
50|$|The house, the {{footprint}} {{of which}} is roughly square, has an asymmetrical layout. It contains a core of rooms comprising entry hall, lounge and dining rooms opening onto the now enclosed north- eastern verandah with <b>the</b> large main <b>bedroom</b> and a smaller second bedroom separated by a bathroom opening onto the enclosed western verandah or sleepout. A short hall separates the main living and dining room <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> At <b>the</b> rear of the house, a kitchen occupies the south-east corner and is separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> study in the south-west corner by the enclosed southern verandah that now serves as a long informal living area.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} contains four two bedroom flats, {{each with}} a living room, kitchen, bathroom, enclosed front sleep-out, and enclosed rear verandah. Each flat has decorative plaster ceilings to most rooms, and French doors open <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> to <b>the</b> enclosed sleep-out and enclosed verandah. Doors (some with upper glass panels), architraves and skirtings are finished in painted timber, with plate rails to the living room. Internal walls are plastered, with paint finish, and the kitchens and bathrooms have non-original fixtures. The southwest paired, arched, diamond paned windows light the living rooms in the two first floor flats.|$|R
