5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Staff {{meetings}} to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would stand now. As {{there had been no}} definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} {{used to refer}} to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who comes to represent the state in the same way may, in the past, be referred to as such, even <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.|$|E

25|$|Like many of Butler’s strong female African-American characters, Anyanwu {{is put in}} {{conflict}} with a male character, Doro, who is just as powerful as her. Butler uses this type of mis-match to display how differently males and females demonstrate their power and values. Since Anyanwu’s way, J. Andrew Deman notes, “is {{the way of the}} healer” rather than of the killer, she does not need violence to demonstrate her true strength or power. As Gant-Britton states, Anyanwu’s true power is shown many times during the story but it is definitely displayed when she threatens to commit suicide if Doro does not stop using her to create new species, making Doro submissive “to her will in the name of love,” <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E

However once they were crowned they were required to sleep there, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few nights, literally on the bed of their forefathers. In 1910, [...] prior to his coronation, King Rama VI had a well-concealed modern toilet installed near the bedchamber.

500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} {{toward the end}} of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often {{ignoring}} her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day, what I see each day I help the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E
500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E

500|$|Their Boer opponents taught {{not only}} the cavalry but the whole army some lessons. In one {{engagement}} at Dronfield, 150 Boers held off the British cavalry division, which was then supported by several artillery batteries, and at Bergendal seventy-four men held up the entire British Army. So effective were their tactics that they forced the British cavalry, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time, to leave their swords and lances behind and concentrate on their firepower. This proved to the British Army {{the value of a}} full size rifle over a carbine. Soon the cavalry were practising working dismounted and advancing in open order. Their change in tactics was evidenced during the charge at Klip Drift. On their way to relieve the siege of Kimberley, the cavalry used their horses and rifles instead of swords and lances to get behind the defending Boers. The charge was later described as [...] "an ideal cavalry operation, but not a cavalry charge as the term is generally understood." [...] Nevertheless, it would prove to be the last time that a full British cavalry division conducted a mounted charge.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to praise for Iridions graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. IGN's Craig Harris wrote that [...] "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress {{with all its}} effects, but that's about it." [...] He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets {{that appear to be}} in the distance. Bub and Game Informers Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave Iridion low marks, warning that [...] "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll be stuck with an empty experience." [...] Edge observed that Iridion is [...] "a sweet number that will entertain, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week or so". Allgame's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D {{was nothing more than a}} technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars.
