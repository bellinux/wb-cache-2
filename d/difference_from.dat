5|$|A major <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the US Navy tables is {{that the}} {{repetitive}} group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment.

50|$|The {{nations of}} Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are {{generally}} considered {{not to fall}} into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> Latin America, geographic <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> Anglo-America, and cultural and historical <b>differences</b> <b>from</b> both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the official and written language of Suriname.|$|R

5|$|The only {{region that}} has a {{significant}} <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the rest of Wales is the Gower peninsula, whose lack of land transport links left it isolated.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, with Loxton taking 0/12. Loxton came in at 2/327 and made 12, before sweeping a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face and breaking his nose. He retired hurt and took no further part in the match. Australia declared at 8/469 and the hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{taught for}} sixty years. She taught her pupils energetically {{in spite of}} having crude {{educational}} resources. In 1891, Dalton encouraged other women teachers {{to ask for a}} raise. The board of education did give the teachers a raise, but considered Dalton responsible for their petitioning and demanded that she pay the <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> her salary. When Dalton refused, they replaced her with a male teacher. Luckily, the city of Payson requested that Dalton teach at their school, and she moved there happily. Later she taught in Ogden and Manti. She served as an officer of the territorial women's suffrage association. Her sister Rose was vice-president of the Utah State Chapter of Women Voters.|$|E

5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E
5|$|Early federal {{plans for}} a {{nationwide}} system of interregional highways {{did not include a}} route along or near the present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and U.S. Route 69. By the mid-1940s, this route had shifted to roughly the present Interstate 35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along U.S. Route 50.|$|E

5|$|Serial {{production}} of the T1000 started in 1964 by Strømmens Værksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of the}} tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Peronism {{organized}} primary {{elections for}} the 2011 presidential elections between Duhalde and governor Alberto Rodríguez Saá, which would be held before the mandatory primary elections.

As the sole candidate, Rodríguez Saá ran for Federal Peronism, which allied with other provincial parties into the Federal Commitment coalition. Duhalde ran for president as well, on the Unión Popular ticket. He received nearly 6% of the vote in the main elections, a large <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the number of votes cast for the main candidates, and Hilda Duhalde was not reelected as senator. In 2017 he announced that he intends to run for president of the PJ.|$|E
5|$|The {{impacts of}} the various options were {{estimated}} as the differences between a carbon tax and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed the Kyoto Protocol.

The results of each model run was reported as the percent <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> the 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.|$|E
