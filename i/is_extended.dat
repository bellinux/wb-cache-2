50|$|FM 1788 was {{designated}} in 1951 from FM 1787 southward 4.2 mi. In 1953, FM 1788 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north 17.1 mi to US 80 (now supplanted by I-20). In 1961, FM 1788 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north to SH 158. In 1962, FM 1788 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north to FM 87. In 1967, FM 1788 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north 13 mi to a road intersection. In 2008, FM 1788 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north along Telephone Road to the Gaines County line. In 2010, FM 1788 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north along Telephone Road and west along CR 402 to US 385.|$|R

25|$|SR317 was {{established}} in the early 1930s. The highway <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> three times, the first in the early 1960s, to US33. The second time the route was in the early 1970s and it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> south to Groveport. The final time the route <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> <b>was</b> in the mid-1970s and the route <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to US23.|$|R
5|$|Powers of a {{positive}} real number are always positive real numbers. The solution of x2=4, however, can be either 2 or −2. The principal value of 41/2 is 2, but −2 is also a valid square root. If the definition of exponentiation of real numbers <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> to allow negative results then the result is no longer well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|The above {{definition}} <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> to directed graphs. Then, for a homomorphism f : G → H, (f(u),f(v)) is an arc (directed edge) of H whenever (u,v) is an arc of G.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery dissection, {{a tear in}} {{the arteries}} in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from {{rotation}} of the neck while the neck <b>is</b> <b>extended.</b> This can occur {{in a variety of}} contexts, but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices. This is a very serious condition which can result in a stroke.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 the last-16 and quarter-final rounds <b>were</b> <b>extended</b> from 9 to 11 frames {{while the}} final <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> from 17 to 19 frames. Wild-card matches <b>were</b> <b>extended</b> from 9 to 11 frames in 1999.|$|R
25|$|Since {{then the}} Munich S-Bahn network has been {{expanded}} multiple times. On 28 May 1980, it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Mammendorf. On 3 November 1979, it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Ebersberg (S4). S5 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Herrsching in 1984.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> several times. In 1865 {{the tower}} and spire were enlarged, in 1888 the chancel and aisles <b>were</b> <b>extended,</b> in 1898 the vestry <b>was</b> <b>extended,</b> and in 1910 the south chapel and porch were added.|$|R
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. His finger <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

50|$|Several {{extensions}} to {{the suburbs}} opened in the last years.Line 8 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Pointe du Lac in 2011, line 12 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Aubervilliers in 2012 and line 4 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Mairie de Montrouge in 2013.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Route 150 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Columbia. On January 12, Route 311 between Columbia and Baltimore was discontinued, and Route 150 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Columbia Mall. On February 8, {{the line}} <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to the Village of Harper's Choice.|$|R
5|$|In October 2015, {{the city}} of Buenos Aires {{together}} with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan Estratégico y Técnico para la Expansión de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts {{and the need to}} adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, Line I is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> to Plaza Italia from Retiro – a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.|$|E
5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> from {{pairs of}} points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E
5|$|OutRun Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode {{is similar to}} OutRun mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, {{there is a time}} limit that <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
50|$|In December 2012, Ruslan Salis' NATO {{contract}} <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> {{through the}} end of 2014, having previously <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> in 2008 and 2010. Prior to the 2014 Crimean crisis, it appeared likely that the contract would <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> for yet another two-year term.|$|R
50|$|On October 16, 2005, Viva Purple <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to McCowan as the {{temporary}} east terminus until January 27, 2008 when it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Markham Stouffville Hospital. On November 20, 2005, Viva Green <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> here during peak-periods and remains the east terminal.|$|R
5000|$|By 1930, NC 305 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> {{north to}} its current {{terminus}} in Seaboard. By 1940, NC 305 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> south to NC 97 north of Windsor. When US 13 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> south, NC 97 was renumbered as part of US 13. When NC 561 <b>was</b> <b>extended,</b> NC 305 <b>was</b> built to run concurrently with NC 561 for 6 mi. NC 305 has had the same routing since then.|$|R
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The nearest border pixels <b>are</b> conceptually <b>extended</b> {{as far as}} {{necessary}} to provide values for the convolution. Corner pixels <b>are</b> <b>extended</b> in 90° wedges. Other edge pixels <b>are</b> <b>extended</b> in lines.|$|R
50|$|SBI Route 127 {{originally}} {{ran from}} Raymond to Carlyle. In 1937 it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Nashville, replacing Illinois Route 153. By 1939 it had <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> to Pinckneyville. In 1944, it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> west to U.S. Route 66, and south {{to its current}} terminus.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, PTH 7 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> west of Fraserwood {{on to what}} is now PTH 17 as far as Narcisse.

25|$|The clock {{does not}} run during convert {{attempts}} {{in the last}} three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter <b>is</b> <b>extended</b> one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to decline any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.|$|E
