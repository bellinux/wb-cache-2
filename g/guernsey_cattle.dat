25|$|Two years later, {{the young}} {{family moved to}} his late {{paternal}} grandfather's property, 'Burnside', about 10 miles north of Baltimore {{at the entrance to}} the Green Spring Valley. In 1898, his father turned Burnside into a dairy farm, with a prize herd of <b>Guernsey</b> <b>cattle,</b> though his grandfather had preferred Jerseys. Sam Shoemaker was well aware of his privileged upbringing: Mennonite Schumachers had moved from Germany, Holland and Switzerland hundreds of years earlier, converted to Quakerism under the influence of William Penn's missionaries and Anglicised their surname as they moved to Germantown, which became a Philadelphia neighborhood. One of his ancestors of the same name had twice served as Philadelphia's mayor, and his paternal grandfather (who died in 1884 and for whom both Sam's father and young Sam were named), although born in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, made his fortune organizing the Great Western Express transportation line between Philadelphia and Baltimore. His paternal grandmother, the Victorian matriarch who raised him as an Episcopalian, was Augusta Chambers Eccleston, of Chestertown, Maryland, daughter of Maryland Court of Appeals Judge John Bowers Eccleston (1794-1860) and sister of the Rev. John H. E. Eccleston, whose Emmanuel Episcopal Church was decorated with flowers from the family's greenhouses. A more distant John C. Eccleston (1828-1912) served as a priest in Richmond County, New York. Sam's maternal grandfather, John Augustus Whitridge, had a fleet of clipper ships, although he died when Sam was 13. Shoemaker later became known for a slight southern inflection in his speech, which he attributed not to these relatives, but to his lifelong friend Hen Bodley, and to James (actually Richard Hugh Gwathney), a longtime family servant, who had been born in Fredericksburg, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|The Guernsey cow {{is a more}} internationally famous icon of the island. As well {{as being}} prized for its rich creamy milk, which is claimed by some to hold health {{benefits}} over milk from other breeds , <b>Guernsey</b> <b>cattle</b> are increasingly being raised for their beef, which has a distinctive flavour and rich yellow fat. [...] Although the number of individual islanders raising these cattle for private supply has diminished significantly since the 1960s, Guernsey steers can still be occasionally seen grazing on L'Ancresse common.|$|E

50|$|Most of the pure-breed Alderney cattle {{were removed}} from the island to Guernsey in the summer of 1940, because the island was then {{occupied}} by the Germans (during World War 2) and it was difficult for the few remaining islanders to milk them. On <b>Guernsey,</b> the <b>cattle</b> were interbred with local breeds. The few pure-breed cattle remaining on Alderney were killed and eaten by the Germans in 1944. In France, the Alderney was absorbed into the Normande breed.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the course}} of the show, a large range of {{livestock}} is judged. This includes the famous Merino sheep, whose fine wool was a major source of Australia's wealth in the 19th and 20th centuries. Also shown are dairy cattle of which the major breeds are the Australian Illawarra Shorthorn, Friesian, Ayrshire, Jersey and <b>Guernsey.</b> Beef <b>cattle</b> are predominantly Hereford, Aberdeen Angus and Murray Grey with other breeds including Brahman, Devon and Charolais. Other livestock judged at the show include a variety of sheep, pigs, goats, alpacas and poultry of all sorts.|$|R
2500|$|Both the fat {{globules}} and {{the smaller}} casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds (such as <b>Guernsey</b> and Jersey <b>cattle)</b> to impart a golden or [...] "creamy" [...] hue to a glass of milk. The riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products. Fat-free skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, {{and they tend to}} scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red, giving skimmed milk a bluish tint.|$|R
50|$|The {{viruses that}} infect other {{vertebrates}} {{are related to}} those of humans and most families of viruses that cause human diseases are represented. They are important pathogens of livestock and cause diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue. Jersey and <b>Guernsey</b> breeds of <b>cattle</b> are particularly susceptible to pox viruses, with symptoms characterised by widespread, unsightly skin lesions. And most people have heard of myxomatosis, which is a fatal pox virus infection of rabbits: once infected they die within twelve days. The virus was deliberately released in Australia in 1950, {{in an attempt to}} control the exponentially growing rabbit population. Rabbits had been brought to the continent in 1859 for sport, and having no natural predators, bred at an extraordinary rate. The infection killed 99.8 percent of rabbits, but by the late 1950s, Australian rabbits started to become immune to the virus and the population of rabbits increased, but never to the vast numbers seen before 1950.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{parameters}} {{were estimated}} for rear legs (rear view; RLRV) and 15 current linear type traits of Brown Swiss and <b>Guernsey</b> dairy <b>cattle.</b> The Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders' Association of the USA and the American Guernsey Association began scoring RLRV in 2004. For Brown Swiss, 8, 502 records {{were available for}} 7, 676 cows in 417 herds; Guernsey data included 5, 437 records for 4, 749 cows in 229 herds. Nine unknown-parent groups were defined for each breed, each with 2 birth years. The model included fixed effects for the interaction of herd, appraisal date, and parity; appraisal age within parity; and lactation stage within parity and random effects for animal, permanent environment, and residual error. The multitrait analysis for RLRV and the 15 linear type traits used canonical transformation, multiple diagonalization, and a decelerated expectation-maximization REML algorithm. For Brown Swiss, heritability was 0. 102 for RLRV and ranged from 0. 099 for rear legs (side view) to 0. 453 for stature. For Guernseys, heritability ranged from 0. 078 for RLRV to 0. 428 for stature. For Brown Swiss, the highest genetic correlation with RLRV was 0. 71 for rear udder width; the most negative correlation was - 0. 19 with rump angle. For Guernseys, the highest genetic correlations with RLRV were 0. 43 for rear udder width and 0. 42 for body depth; the most negative correlation was - 0. 46 with rear legs (side view). With heritability near 0. 10, RLRV should be useful in selection for improved locomotion. Release of genetic evaluations for RLRV began in May 2006 for Brown Swiss and Guernseys. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Los Poblanos Historic Inn & Organic Farm is a {{farm with}} a ranch house and inn that was {{established}} in the 1920s just north of Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Congressman Albert G. Simms. After he married Congresswoman Ruth Hannah McCornick Simms in 1932, the couple began construction of the Los Poblanos ranch. The building was designed by John Gaw Meem in the Pueblo Revival Style of architecture. Located on 800-acres, the property was the familyâ€™s private home, dairy, farm, nursery and cultural center. Numerous WPA artists and craftsmen also contributed to Los Poblanos to renovate the ranch house and create the Cultural Center. Rose Greely designed the gardens to the south and west of the ranch. La Quinta Cultural Center was later commissioned in 1934 as home base for Ruthâ€™s political fundraisers, recitals and parties with its ballroom, tin chandeliers, and carved wood ceilings. Los Poblanos was significant in the establishment of the dairy industry in New Mexico with their purebred herds of <b>Guernsey</b> and Holstein <b>cattle</b> which became Creamland Dairies.|$|R
