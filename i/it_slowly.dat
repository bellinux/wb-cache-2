5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed in late October. It became Tropical Depression Four-C on October 30 well southwest of Hawaii. Although the waters were very warm, some dry air was located {{north of the}} system. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day as the circulation became exposed.|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{prepared}} samarium has {{a silvery}} luster. In air, <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> oxidizes {{at room temperature}} and spontaneously ignites at 150°C. Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{circulation}} was exposed from the convection, {{although it was}} able to intensify into Tropical Storm Pongsona at 1200UTC on December 3 while located 375km (230mi) northeast of Pohnpei. It turned to the west on December4, due to a ridge to the north. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> intensified, developing an eye feature on December5. That day, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon about 1150km (715mi) southeast of Guam.|$|E

5|$|On August24, {{satellite}} imagery indicated a hurricane with a defined eye was located over the central Pacific Ocean. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> weakened {{as it moved}} over lukewarm waters, and deteriorated more rapidly after wind shear increased. By August28, the system consisted of a circulation with only weak associated convection. It weakened to a tropical depression on August30, although it remained a tropical cyclone until September2. At {{that time it was}} last observed about 200mi (320km) south of Hilo, Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Outflow {{became much}} better {{organized}} as Bertha became a tropical storm, and well-defined banding features persisted {{to the north}} of the storm. Though convection waned, forecasters predicted the friction between land and the warm atmosphere to redevelop more deep convection, potentially resulting in further strengthening. However, the storm failed to intensify, and Bertha made landfall near Boothville, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm early on August 5. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> weakened over the swampy portions of southeastern Louisiana, and degenerated to a tropical depression later on the 5th after crossing Lake Ponchartrain. Initially it was expected that a ridge of high pressure to its north would keep Bertha moving to the west and result in <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> dissipating. However, it turned to the southwest, and reached the Gulf of Mexico again on August 7. The circulation persisted over land, and Tropical Depression Bertha quickly redeveloped convection. Though the environment was not unfavorable, its proximity to land prevented re-strengthening to tropical storm status. Though the system showed periods of increased organization as it moved southwestward, Bertha remained a weak tropical depression until making landfall on south Texas to the east of Kingsville on August 9. Bertha weakened quickly over land, and dissipated over southern Texas ten hours after making landfall.|$|E

5|$|The tenth {{storm of}} the season formed on October 15 as a {{tropical}} storm east of the Bahamas and north of Hispaniola. The tropical storm moved northwest, but changed direction and began to curve northeastward on October 17. As the storm moved eastward, <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> strengthened; the storm attained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 18. The tropical storm headed directly eastward on October 19, and dissipated in the open Atlantic on October 20.|$|E
5|$|Tropical storm Oliwa {{began as}} a {{tropical}} disturbance that had meandered south of Johnston Atoll. It organized into Tropical Depression Two-C on September 2. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Oliwa (Hawaiian for Oliver) as <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> moved towards the west. It crossed the dateline late on September 3 and entered the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's Area of Responsibility.) In the Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclones are not renamed when they cross basin boundaries, so Oliwa kept its name.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> strengthened {{into the first}} tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving {{near the edge of}} a subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter under the influence of wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> curves to the northwest, matching a similar turn in the course of the creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest {{toward the}} North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the next}} two days, <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning toward the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alex {{was a rare}} June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane John was the {{eleventh}} named storm, seventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Hurricane John developed on August 28 from a tropical wave {{to the south}} of Mexico. Favorable conditions allowed the storm to intensify quickly, and it attained peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) on August 30. Eyewall replacement cycles and land interaction with western Mexico weakened the hurricane, and John made landfall on southeastern Baja California Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h) on September 1. <b>It</b> <b>slowly</b> weakened as it moved northwestward through the Baja California peninsula, and dissipated on September 4. Moisture from the remnants of the storm entered the southwest United States.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Neki was {{the final}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on October18 as an unusually large disturbance from a trough south of Hawaii. Moving northwestward, <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> organized at first due to its large size. After reaching hurricane status on October21, Neki intensified at a much faster rate and peaked with winds of 125mph (205km/h). It later turned {{to the north and}} north-northeast and weakened due to hostile conditions. While passing through the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Neki was downgraded to a tropical storm after the center became exposed from the deepest convection. It caused little impact in the island chain. After stalling and executing a small loop, Neki resumed its northward track and dissipated on October27.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{particularly}} deadly and destructive Pacific hurricane which killed a total of 1,696 people and caused $1.156billion in damage. The sixteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, Paul developed as a tropical depression just offshore Central America on September 18. The depression briefly moved inland two days later just before heading westward out to sea. The storm changed little in strength for several days until September 25, when <b>it</b> <b>slowly</b> intensified into a tropical storm. Two days later, Paul attained hurricane status, and further strengthened to Category 2 intensity after turning northward. The hurricane then accelerated toward the northeast, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). Paul made landfall over Baja California Sur on September 29, and subsequently moved ashore in Sinaloa, Mexico the next day.|$|E
