5|$|The three battles to {{hold back}} the Central Powers ended in early autumn 1917, by which time there were 31 dead and 453 wounded among the volunteers; 129 {{received}} distinction. Dimitrie Lăzărel was one to have survived all three engagements, and legend has it that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> into combat without the banner. Deleu had left reserve duty to join the 10th Chasseurs Battalion in the Mărășești combat, but fell severely ill and was reassigned to other offices.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|On 7 and 8 March 1894, he {{experimented with}} {{expanding}} his shows {{and held his}} first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily the biggest of its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the Countess de Sefton and Lady de Trafford. The publication Fur and Feather praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't so sure as the initial show had lost over a hundred pounds, and entries {{in some of the}} classes were restricted to only a handful of cats. He held a second show in March 1895, which once again Fur and Feather heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the show more profitable. Fur and Feather announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> on to run such a show again.|$|E

25|$|The Premiership was a reclusive office {{prior to}} 1832.

25|$|Pepys stopped {{writing his}} diary in 1669. His {{eyesight}} began to trouble {{him and he}} feared that writing in dim light was damaging his eyes. He did imply in his last entries {{that he might have}} others write his diary for him, but doing so would result in a loss of privacy and it seems that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> through with those plans. In the end, Pepys’s fears were unjustified and he lived another 34 years without going blind, but he never took to writing his diary again.|$|E
25|$|Gleason (who {{had signed}} a deal in the 1950s that {{included}} a guaranteed $100,000 annual payment for 20 years, even if <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> on the air) wanted The Honeymooners {{to be just a}} portion of his format, but CBS wanted another season of only The Honeymooners. The network had cancelled a mainstay variety show hosted by Red Skelton and would cancel The Ed Sullivan Show in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives' opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) {{has bought}} tickets to a Lady Gaga concert, but his plans go south when Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) gets sick. This causes Mitchell {{to be torn}} on whether he should stay with Cameron {{or go to the}} concert. He {{eventually}} tries to be supporting and attempts to subtly persuade Cameron to let him go, as Claire has advised him to do. Mitchell tries to sneak away after noticing that Cameron has drunk most of a cough syrup that would [...] "put down a Grizzly", but he is caught when Cam wakes up. Mitchell then gives a speech about how selfish he has been to Cameron, before realizing Cameron has fallen asleep once more. He then sneaks off to the concert and comes back before Cameron wakes up again. When Cameron does wake up, Mitchell acts as if <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> out, unaware that his glow stick is still visible underneath his shirt. As Cameron returns to bed, he pleasantly informs Mitchell that his glow-stick is still flashing, and switches off the light to reveal it.|$|E

500|$|Norman {{remained}} a travelling showman for another 10 years following his encounter with Joseph Merrick, and exhibited, among others, a troupe of midgets, a 'Man in a Trance', John Chambers the armless Carpenter and the 'World's Ugliest Woman'. In 1893, {{he announced that}} he was leaving for Chicago and advertised his goods for sale, but in the end, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went.</b> He became involved with the temperance movement and was the vice-president of the Van Dwellers Protection Association (which later became the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain). He became a showman's auctioneer, auctioning novelty shows and circuses and according to the World's Fair, presided over more such sales than any other auctioneer in the country at that time. Norman married the theatre performer Amy Rayner in 1896, and they had six sons and four daughters. The family moved to Croydon, and Norman went into semi-retirement, selling off some of his shops. In 1905 he sold showman [...] "Lord" [...] George Sanger's zoo, and then all of Sanger's circus effects, an achievement Norman called [...] "the crowning point in my life as regards the auctioneering business". [...] He made his comeback in 1919 with the exhibition of 'Phoebe the Strange Girl' in Birmingham and Margate.|$|E
500|$|Of equal {{importance}} to Burges's subsequent career was his travelling. Burges believed that all architects should travel, remarking {{that it was}} [...] "absolutely necessary to see how various art problems have been resolved in different ages by different men." [...] Enabled by his private income, Burges moved through England, then France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and finally into Turkey. In total, he spent some 18 months abroad developing his skills and knowledge by sketching and drawing. What he saw and drew provided a repository of influences and ideas that he used and re-used {{for the whole of}} his career. Although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> beyond Turkey, the art and architecture of the East, both Near and Far, {{had a significant impact on}} him; his fascination with Moorish design found ultimate expression in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle, and his study of Japanese techniques influenced his later metalwork. Burges received his first important commission at the age of 35, but his subsequent career did not see the development that might have been expected. His style had already been formed over the previous twenty years of study, thinking and travelling. J. Mordaunt Crook, the foremost authority on Burges, writes that, [...] "once established, after twenty years' preparation, his 'design language' had merely to be applied, and he applied and re-applied the same vocabulary with increasing subtlety and gusto." ...|$|E

Blair wrote that the soldier [...] "will most likely limp {{the rest of his life}} and need to use a cane," [...] which was untrue. He said another soldier had lost his right leg when it had been amputated below the knee. He described two soldiers as being in the hospital at the same time, but they were admitted five days apart.|$|E
2500|$|Grace {{had been}} [...] "notoriously unscholarly" [...] as a boy. Although {{opportunities}} arose, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>went</b> to university {{as his father}} was intent upon him pursuing a medical career. But Grace was approached by both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. Grace {{said he would have}} gone to either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, aged 20, and was a medical student until he finally qualified in November 1879.|$|E
