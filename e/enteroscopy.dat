40|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} (CE) {{is a novel}} {{technology that}} facilitates highly effective and noninvasive imaging of the small bowel. Although its efficacy {{in the evaluation of}} obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) has been proven in several trials, data on uses of CE in different small bowel diseases are rapidly accumulating in the literature, and it {{has been found to be}} superior to alternative diagnostic tools in a range of such diseases. Based on literature evidence, CE is recommended as a first-line investigation for OGIB after negative bi-directional endoscopy. CE has gained an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of Crohn’s disease and celiac disease and in the surveillance of small bowel tumors and polyps in selected patients. Capsule retention is the major complication, with a frequency of 1 %- 2 %. The purpose of this review was to discuss the procedure, indications, contraindications and adverse effects associated with CE. We also review and share our five-year experience with CE in various small bowel diseases. The recently developed balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopies</b> have both diagnostic and therapeutic capability.

40|$|Background: Device-assisted <b>enteroscopies</b> (DAEs) are recent {{endoscopic}} {{techniques that}} enable direct endoscopic small-bowel evaluation. Objective: The {{objective of this}} article is to evaluate the implementation of DAEs in Portugal and assess the main indications, diagnoses, diagnostic yield, therapeutic yield and complication rate. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective series using a national Web-based survey on behalf of the Portuguese Small-Bowel Study Group. Participants were asked to fill out two online databases regarding procedural data, indications, diagnoses, endoscopic therapy and complications using prospectively collected institutional data records. Results: A total of eight centers were enrolled in the survey, corresponding to 1411 DAEs. The most frequent indications were obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), inflammatory bowel disease and small-bowel tumors. The pooled diagnostic yield was 63 %. A relation between the diagnostic yield and the indications was clear, with a diagnostic yield for OGIB of 69 % (p 0. 02) with a 52 % therapeutic yield. Complications occurred in 1. 2 %, with a major complication rate of 0. 57 %. Perforations occurred in four patients (0. 28 %). Conclusion: DAEs are safe and effective procedures, with complication rates of 1. 2 %, the most serious of which is perfor-ation. Most procedures are performed in the setting of OGIB. Diagnostic and therapeutic yields are dependent on the indication, hence appropriate patient selection is crucial...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{reviews the}} various aetiologies of small bowel {{perforations}} and their management. In {{addition to the}} well-known aetiologies such as trauma, inflammation and circulatory disorders, several new causes of small bowel perforation have been described in recent years. The spectrum reaches from iatrogenic perforations during laparoscopic surgery or <b>enteroscopies</b> to drug-induced perforations with new anticancer agents. The management of small bowel perforations requires a concept consisting of the safe revision of the leaking bowel and {{the treatment of the}} peritonitis. Depending on the local situation and the condition of the patient, several treatment options are available. The surgical management of the bowel leak can range from a simple primary closure to a delayed restoration of bowel continuity. When the condition of the bowel or patient is frail, the risk of a failure of a closure or anastomosis is too high, and the exteriorization of the bowel defect as a primary measure is a safe option. The treatment of the peritonitis is also dependent on the condition of the patient and the local situation. Early stages of peritonitis can be treated by a simple peritoneal lavage, either performed by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Severe forms of peritonitis with multi-organ failure and an abdominal compartment syndrome need repeated peritoneal revisions. In such cases, the abdomen can only be closed temporarily. Different technical options are available in order to overcome the difficult care of these patients...|$|R

40|$|Von Willebrand disease (VWD) {{represents}} a heterogeneous group of autosomally inherited bleeding disorders {{usually associated with}} mu-cosal or postoperative bleeding. It results from either a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF) —a multimeric gly-coprotein with essential roles in platelet adhe-sion and as a carrier of factor VIII in the circula-tion. The identification of disease-associated mu-tations in the VWF gene has improved our un-derstanding of the structure and function of VWF, and demonstrated the importance of spe-cific regions of the protein in its interactions with the vasculature and other proteins (1). Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from angiodys-plasia is a feature of VWD (2), particularly type 2 A (3, 4). Typically affected patients have a life-long bleeding diathesis further complicated by recurrent GI bleeding beginning in middle age (when angiodysplasia begins to form) (5). CASE REPORT In July 2003 a 59 -year-old man was referred to our Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre for a second opinion. He had a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease and had had recurrent epis-taxis as a child. He had suffered from GI bleeds since the 1980 s requiring what had been esti-mated by one clinician to be thousands of units of red blood cells and millions of units of clot-ting factor concentrate. During that time he un-derwent multiple normal upper and lower GI endoscopies. More recently capsule and subsequent push <b>enteroscopies</b> had identified a lymphangiectatic cyst and bleeding in the third part of the duode-num from presumed angiodysplasia and cautery had been attempted with little long-term success.

40|$|International audienceIn {{patients}} with Crohn's disease, {{the risk of}} small bowel adenocarcinoma is 20 - 40 {{times higher than the}} low background risk of the general population. In the subset of {{patients with}} longstanding small bowel lesions, the absolute risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma exceeds 1 per 100 patient-years after 25 years of follow-up and becomes equivalent to the risk of colorectal cancer. Growing evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of small bowel adenocarcinoma arising in inflammatory lesions of Crohn's disease {{is similar to that of}} colorectal cancer complicating chronic colonic inflammation (inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence). However, contrasting with the established endoscopic detection of colonic advanced neoplasias in patients with longstanding extensive colitis, there is no consensus at this time how to face the excess-risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma in patients at high risk. There are no specific clinical or imaging alert signs and endoscopic surveillance of the totality of the inflamed small bowel mucosa would suppose to perform repeated <b>enteroscopies,</b> with the potential limiting factor of stenosis. Very preliminary data suggest that chemoprevention with salicylates could be an alternative way for reducing the risk. Data from referral centers and from the CESAME cohort suggest that intestinal lymphomas may arise in the chronically inflamed segments in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Regarding nonintestinal lymphomas, it is now established that IBD patients treated with thiopurines have an excess risk of lymphomas, exhibiting in most cases pathological features of lymphomas associated with immunosuppression, including the frequent presence of EBV in neoplastic tissues. There is growing evidence that treatment with thiopurines is responsible by itself for this excess risk. IBD patients receiving immunomodulators, especially young men, are also at risk (0. 4 for 10, 000 patient-years in the CESAME study) for developing fatal early post-mononucleosis lymphomas, like in Purtilo's syndrome, maybe in association with a background genetic susceptibility. Finally, patients receiving thiopurines and/or TNF-inhibitors are at risk for developing fatal hepatosplenic T cell lymphomas, but this risk is low (no case in the CESAME study). Whether patients receiving a monotherapy with methotrexate and/or TNF inhibitors are at increased risk of lymphomas is not known. Concordant data suggest that women receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for developing uterine cervix dysplasia and require closer surveillance. But it is not established whether the risk of uterine cervix cancer and basal and squamous cell skin cancers (that may be associated with chronic human papillomavirus infection) is increased in patients receiving immunomodulators...|$|R
50|$|Newer techniques, {{including}} {{single and}} double-balloon endoscopy {{have been developed}} to overcome some of these issues, but are limited by the length of the procedure, and the need for deep sedation or general anesthesia. Spiral <b>enteroscopy</b> is a novel technique that utilizes an overtube with raised spirals affixed on the enteroscope that is rotated to advance the enteroscope deep into the small bowel. Each of these 3 <b>enteroscopy</b> platforms offers similar accuracy and effectiveness but do not have widespread availability.|$|E
50|$|Traditional gastroscopes can {{generally}} {{visualize the}} proximal and distal duodenum {{in the hands}} of experienced endoscopists but are limited due to the length of the instrument. Pediatric colonoscopes or sometimes dedicated enteroscopes which are much longer than standard gastroscopes can visualize the proximal jejunum. This technique is referred to as push <b>enteroscopy.</b> Due to the length of the small bowel, averaging 4-6 meters in the adult, push <b>enteroscopy</b> is still not effective to adequately visualize large portions of the small intestine.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the small}} bowel {{can often be}} a source of pathology, {{endoscopy}} of the small bowel can be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic technique. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, also called upper endoscopy, gets as far as the first segment of the small bowel, the duodenum, but the next two, the jejunum and ileum, require other methods. Visualization of the small bowel has long posed a challenge to gastroenterologists, due to the physical difficulty of reaching more distal regions of the small bowel. With the advent of the newer forms of <b>enteroscopy,</b> such as the double-balloon type, visualizing the entire tract is finally a practical reality in at least some cases, although it is still technically demanding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Diagnostic and {{therapeutic}} endoscopic {{procedures of the}} small-bowel have {{for a long time}} been a great challenge to gastroenterologists. Especially the anatomy of the small intestine in combination with the lack of adequate, non-invasive, diagnostic tools, made it an almost ‘no-go’zone. Only in selected cases push <b>enteroscopy</b> and intraoperative <b>enteroscopy</b> were performed. Push <b>enteroscopy</b> has both diagnostic {{and therapeutic}} capabilities, but typically only examines a limited part of the proximal small bowel. Intraoperative <b>enteroscopy</b> permits examination of the entire small bowel and therapeutic interventions, but is much more invasive. The need for endoscopic access to improve diagnosis and treatment of small bowel disease has {{led to the development of}} novel endoscopic technologies. In 2000 the diagnostic and non-invasive video capsule endoscopy was introduced, followed by the more invasive double-balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> system in 2001, the latter combining diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. The following years, single balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> and spiral <b>enteroscopy</b> were introduced as alternatives for double balloon <b>enteroscopy,</b> with in theory, comparable diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Complete <b>enteroscopy</b> of the small bowel is now in reach: ‘easy’ and much less invasive, and can be performed world wide in any endoscopy unit...|$|E

40|$|Crohn&#x 2019;s disease (CD) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} gastrointestinal tract resulting in inflammation, stricturing and fistulae secondary to transmural inflammation. Diagnosis relies on clinical history, abnormal laboratory parameters, characteristic radiologic and endoscopic changes within the gastrointestinal tract and most importantly a supportive histology. The article is intended mainly for the general gastroenterologist and for other interested physicians. Management of small bowel CD has been suboptimal and limited due to the inaccessibility of the small bowel. <b>Enteroscopy</b> has had a significant renaissance recently, thereby extending {{the reach of the}} endoscopist, aiding diagnosis and enabling therapeutic interventions in the small bowel. Radiologic imaging is used as the first line modality to visualise the small bowel. If the clinical suspicion is high, wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is used to rule out superficial and early disease, despite the above investigations being normal. This is followed by push <b>enteroscopy</b> or device assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> (DAE) as is appropriate. This approach {{has been found to be}} the most cost effective and least invasive. DAE includes balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy,</b> [double balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> (DBE), single balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> (SBE) and more recently spiral <b>enteroscopy</b> (SE) ]. This review is not going to cover the various other indications of <b>enteroscopy,</b> radiological small bowel investigations nor WCE and limited only to <b>enteroscopy</b> in small bowel Crohn&#x 2019;s. These excluded topics already have comprehensive reviews. Evidence available from randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities is limited and at best regarded as Grade C or D (based on expert opinion). The evidence suggests that all three DAE modalities have comparable insertion depths, diagnostic and therapeutic efficacies and complication rates, though most favour DBE due to higher rates of total <b>enteroscopy.</b> SE is quicker than DBE, but lower complete <b>enteroscopy</b> rates. SBE has quicker procedural times and is evolving but the least available DAE today. Larger prospective randomised controlled trial&#x 2019;s in the future could help us understand some unanswered areas including the role of BAE in small bowel screening and comparative studies between the main types of <b>enteroscopy</b> in small bowel CD...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Enteroscopy</b> plays a {{key role}} in the {{post-operative}} monitoring of patients with small bowel transplantation for the early detection of post-transplant complications and for the assessment of the graft's integrity. Routine surveillance enteroscopies (trans-stomal terminal ileoscopy or jejunoscopy) are invasive, may be unsafe in frail patients, and only allow incomplete exploration of the transplanted graft, which may be unsatisfactory, since the distribution of the lesions is often patchy or segmental. Aims. To evaluate the potential of capsule <b>enteroscopy,</b> a new, minimally invasive technique which allows complete exploration of the small bowel, in small bowel transplant recipients. Methods. Five small bowel transplanted patients underwent capsule <b>enteroscopy</b> with the GIVEN(R) endoscopy system. The results of capsule <b>enteroscopy</b> were compared with those of trans-stomal ileoscopy. Results. Capsule <b>enteroscopy</b> was better tolerated than ileoscopy and good quality images of the small bowel were obtained in four patients. The terminal ileum was normal both on ileoscopy and capsule <b>enteroscopy.</b> Mucosal changes in segments not reached by ileoscopy were detected by capsule <b>enteroscopy</b> in three of four patients. Conclusions. Capsule <b>enteroscopy</b> is better tolerated than ileoscopy, allows complete exploration of the transplanted graft and can detect mucosal changes in segments not reached by ileoscopy.

40|$|Background—Push-type <b>enteroscopy,</b> {{a recent}} method for {{investigating}} the small intestine, is currently undergoing assessment. Its diagnostic yield varies {{in the studies}} reported to date.  Aim—To assess the diagnostic value of push-type <b>enteroscopy</b> according to indication.  Patients and methods—From January 1994 to September 1995, 152 consecutive patients (mean age 34 years) underwent push-type <b>enteroscopy</b> (jejunoscopy, n= 93; retrograde ileoscopy, n= 17; and double way <b>enteroscopy,</b> n= 42). The indications were: unexplained iron deficiency anaemia or macroscopic gastrointestinal bleeding (n= 76), radiological abnormalities of the small intestine (n= 23), chronic diarrhoea and/or malabsorption syndrome (n= 18), abdominal pain (n= 12), and miscellaneous (n= 23). All patients had undergone previous negative aetiological investigations.  Results—The jejunum and ileum were explored through 120 cm (30 - 160 cm) and 60 cm (20 - 120 cm). Digestive bleeding: lesions of the small bowel were found in 6 % of the patients with isolated iron deficiency anaemia and 20 % of patients with patent digestive haemorrhage. Radiological abnormalities of the small intestine: push-type <b>enteroscopy</b> provided a diagnosis or modified the interpretation of radiological findings in 18 / 23 cases (78 %). Chronic diarrhoea and/or malabsorption: push-type <b>enteroscopy</b> yielded explanatory findings in four cases (22 %). Abdominal pain: push-type <b>enteroscopy</b> provided no diagnosis.  Conclusion—In this series, push-type <b>enteroscopy</b> was of particular value in investigating patients with radiological abnormalities of the small intestine. It was of some value in the exploration of patent digestive haemorrhage or chronic diarrhoea, but not of abdominal pain. Its value was limited in the exploration of iron deficiency anaemia. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Double-balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> is a newly {{developed}} endoscopic method allowing non-surgical full-length {{exploration of the}} small bowel, biopsies sample and endoscopic treatment of previously inaccessible lesions. AIM: To prospectively assess the diagnostic and therapeutical impact of double-balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> in patients with suspected or documented small bowel disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients referring to our centre for suspected small bowel disease underwent double-balloon <b>enteroscopy.</b> Starting insertion route (anal or oral) of double-balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> was chosen according to the estimated location of the suspected lesions basing on the clinical presentation and on the findings, when available, of previous endoscopic or radiological investigations. Major indications for the procedures were acute recurrent or chronic mid-gastrointestinal bleeding (n= 71), suspected gastrointestinal tumours (n= 10), suspected Crohn's disease (n= 6), chronic abdominal pain and/or chronic diarrhoea (n= 8), refractory celiac disease (n= 5). RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen double-balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> procedures were carried out. Oral and anal route double-balloon enteroscopies were performed in 54 and 28 patients, respectively, while 18 patients underwent {{a combination of both}} approaches. Overall diagnostic yield of double-balloon <b>enteroscopy</b> resulted 69 %. Most common pathological findings included angiodysplasias (n= 39), ulcerations and erosions of various aetiologies (n= 21), tumours (n= 7) and ileal stenosis in patients with Crohn's disease suspicion (n= 2).

Results: From January 2007 until March 2009, 76 patients were included (M/F 31 / 45; mean age 46. 9 years; range 20. 0 - 78. 4 years) : 38 patients with OGIB and 38 with suspected or known CD. Seventeen patients did not undergo capsule endoscopy because of high-grade stenosis. Ninety-five percent (344 / 363) of the questionnaires were suitable for evaluation. Capsule endoscopy was significantly favored over magnetic resonance enteroclysis and balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> with respect to bowel preparation, swallowing of the capsule (compared to insertion of the tube/scope), burden of the entire examination, duration and accordance with the pre-study information. Capsule endoscopy and magnetic resonance enteroclysis were significantly preferred over balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> for clarity of explanation of the examination, and magnetic resonance enteroclysis was significantly preferred over balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> for bowel preparation, painfulness and burden of the entire examination. Balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> was significantly favored over magnetic resonance enteroclysis for insertion of the scope and procedure duration. Pre- and post-study the order of preference was capsule endoscopy, magnetic resonance enteroclysis and balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy.</b> Conclusion: Capsule endoscopy was preferred to magnetic resonance enteroclysis and balloon-assisted enteroscopy; it also had the lowest burden. Magnetic resonance enteroclysis was preferred over balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> for clarity of explanation of the examination, bowel preparation, painfulness and burden of the entire examination, and balloon-assisted <b>enteroscopy</b> over magnetic resonance enteroclysis for scope insertion and study duration. ...|$|E
