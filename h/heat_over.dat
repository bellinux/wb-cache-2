5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of <b>heat</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of a}} year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm {{in the context of a}} second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E

25|$|Cogeneration can {{be applied}} to any fuel which is combusted for energy. Fossil fuels, biomass and biogas can all be used in CHP plants. Transporting <b>heat</b> <b>over</b> long {{distances}} is impractical, so cogeneration plants are usually small and located close to the energy load. Hence, cogeneration is inherently linked to distributed generation. The urban location of CHP plants makes them very compatible with clean-burning fuels such as natural gas. The health concerns associated with other fossil fuels (see coal above) make them less suitable for areas with high population densities.|$|E

Processors are usually binned and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced <b>heat</b> <b>over</b> using a normal desktop part. Additionally Mobile XPs feature not being multiplier-locked and generally higher-rated maximum operating temperatures, requirements intended for better operation within the tight thermal constraints within a notebook PC—but also making them attractive for overclocking.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{affecting the}} monsoon {{is that the}} westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds {{in the form of}} the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense <b>heat</b> <b>over</b> the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated terrain features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the northern Indian plains, influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon.|$|E

A large amount of water {{would have to be}} continuously returned to the ocean, lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant. Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see thermal pollution), or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae. A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the <b>heat</b> <b>over</b> a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.|$|E

500|$|Bomb, cast iron: The first {{accounts}} of bombs made {{of cast iron}} shells packed with explosive gunpowder—as opposed to earlier types of casings—were written in the 13th century in China. The term was coined for this bomb (i.e. [...] "thunder-crash bomb") during a Jin Dynasty (1115–1234) naval battle of 1231 against the Mongols. The History of Jin (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general Subutai (1176–1248) descended on the Jin stronghold of Kaifeng, the defenders had a [...] "thunder-crash bomb" [...] which [...] "consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) {{there was a great}} explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than a hundred li, and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the <b>heat</b> <b>over</b> an area of more than half a mou.

[...] The Song Dynasty (960–1279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that arsenals should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in Jingzhou, about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to Xiangyang and Yingzhou. The significance of this, as British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham states, is that a [...] "high-nitrate gunpowder mixture had been reached at last, since nothing less would have burst the iron casing." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{averaging}} 17points {{per game}} as a rookie and more than 22per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth [...] $98 to $101million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing {{to account for the}} impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9million for the 1996–97 season placed the <b>Heat</b> <b>over</b> the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100million; his seven-year contract was worth $105million. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract. [...] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard. The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues: [...] "1.) Did the Heat circumvent the cap in first signing Mourning?; 2.) Did the Heat miscalculate bonus money for forward P. J. Brown and guard Tim Hardaway that was not counted correctly against the cap.?; 3.) Did the Heat add an illegal performance clause to Brown's contract?." [...] Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties. [...] In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams, the Bullets traded for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant.|$|E

40|$|Analyses of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{datasets}} {{revealed a}} prominent interannual {{variation in the}} convective-stratiform rainfall and latent <b>heating</b> <b>over</b> the southern South China Sea (SCS) during the winter monsoon between 1998 and 2010. Although the height of maximum latent heating remained nearly constant at around 7 km {{in all of the}} years, the year-to-year changes in the magnitudes of maximum latent <b>heating</b> <b>over</b> the region were noticeable. The interannual variations of the convective-stratiform rainfall and latent <b>heating</b> <b>over</b> the southern SCS were highly anti-correlated with the Ni (n) over tildeo- 3 index, with more (less) rainfall and latent heating during La Ni (n) over tildea (El Ni (n) over tildeo) years. Analysis of the large-scale environment revealed that years of active rainfall and latent heating corresponded to years of large deep convergence and relative humidity at 600 hPa. The moisture budget diagnosis indicated that the interannual variation of humidity at 600 hPa was largely modulated by the vertical moisture advection. The year-to-year changes in rainfall over the southern SCS were mainly caused by the interannual variations of the dynamic component associated with anomalous upward motions in the middle troposphere, while the interannual variations of the thermodynamic component associated with changes in surface specific humidity played a minor role. Larger latent <b>heating</b> <b>over</b> the southern SCS during La Ni (n) over tildea years may possibly further enhance the local Hadley circulation over the SCS in the wintertime...|$|R
