40|$|In this {{research}} article, we discuss two topics. Firstly, we introduce SCC-Map and ϕ-contraction type T-coupling. By using these two definitions, we generalize ϕ-contraction <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> given by H. Aydi et al.

Secondly, we attempt to give an answer to an open problem presented by choudhury et al. [7] concerning the investigation of fixed point and related properties for couplings satisfying other type of inequalities. In this direction we prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of strong coupled fixed point for (ϕ,ψ) -contraction <b>type</b> <b>coupling.</b> We give examples to illustrate our main results...|$|R

50|$|From 1935, all the ex Class 14B {{locomotives}} except no. 1750 were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14R.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Spirometry and maximal {{respiratory}} {{pressures are}} pulmonary function parameters {{commonly used to}} evaluate respiratory function. Prediction values are available for conventional lung function devices using a standard tube or <b>flanged</b> <b>type</b> of mouthpiece connection. This equipment is not suitable for patients with facial or buccal muscle weakness, because of air leakage around the mouthpiece. A face mask {{was used for the}} portable lung function devices used in the neuromuscular department. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the face mask and the conventional mouthpiece for the measurement of spirometry and of respiratory pressures in 22 healthy subjects. Values obtained with the conventional mouthpiece differed significantly from values obtained with the face mask. With the mask, forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second were 200 mL lower, and maximal expiratory pressure was 3. 2 kPa lower than with the mouthpiece. Subsequently, new prediction values for face mask spirometry and maximal respiratory pressures were obtained from 252 other healthy subjects, from which new prediction equations were derived. It was concluded that the face mask connection to the lung function device is a valid alternative, is easy to use and is most useful to monitor changes in patients. This study confirms the importance of appropriate prediction equations, depending on subject-instrument interfaces...|$|R
40|$|A exotic {{class of}} {{nonlinear}} p-form nonabelian gauge theories is studied, {{arising from the}} most general allowed nontrivial deformation of linear abelian gauge theory {{for a set of}} massless 1 -form fields and 2 -form fields in four dimensions. These theories combine a Chapline-Manton <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> of the 1 -forms and 2 -forms, along with a Yang-Mills coupling of the 1 -forms, a Freedman-Townsend coupling of the 2 -forms, and an extended Freedman-Townsend <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> between the 1 -forms and 2 -forms. It is shown that the resulting theories have a geometrically interesting dual formulation that is equivalent to an exotic Yang-Mills dilaton theory involving a nonlinear sigma field. In particular, the nonlinear sigma field couples to the Yang-Mills 1 -form field through a generalized Chern class 4 -form term. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between two variables may be mathematically coupled if either {{one or both}} variables are derived and/or calculated, and {{this can lead to}} erroneous results and invalid conclusions. The purpose of this report is to identify four <b>types</b> of mathematic <b>coupling</b> of data. <b>Type</b> 1 <b>coupling</b> involves directional changes in two variables which are mathematically <b>coupled.</b> <b>Type</b> 2 <b>coupling</b> is the functional {{relationship between}} two calculated variables which have one or more common component variables. Type 3, the most common <b>type</b> of mathematic <b>coupling,</b> is direct algebraic coupling between two variables, when {{one or more of the}} variables is derived and/or calculated. Type 4 is indirect coupling or physiologic coupling. The common problem in each <b>type</b> of mathematic <b>coupling</b> is that one variable either directly or indirectly contains the whole or components of the second variable. Statistical techniques, when properly applied to the relationship between the two variables, further obscure the underlying mathematic coupling, and tend to support the erroneous results.
