40|$|In the {{framework}} of a graduate student research group financed by the <b>German</b> National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> (DFG), an experimental study on nozzle flows was carried out at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The tests were performed at a free-stream Mach number of 8 in the H 2 K wind tunnel at the DLR in Cologne. The Reynolds number was varied in order to simulate the influence of different flight altitudes of a scramjet vehicle. The effects of different nozzle pressure ratios have been investigated and compared. The static pressure distribution on the single expansion ramp was measured by the Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) Method and PSI pressure transducers. A Pitot rake was used to measure the Pitot pressure distribution in the nozzle wake. Schlieren photographs are also used to investigate the flow field. The experimental results are discussed and compared with CFD calculations...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{graduate}} college financed by the <b>German</b> National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> (DFG), an experimental study on nozzle flows was carried out at the German aerospace center (DLR). The tests were performed at a free-stream Mach number Ma∞ = 7 in the H 2 K wind tunnel of the wind tunnel department in Cologne. The Reynolds number was varied in order to simulate the influence of different flight altitudes of a scramjet vehicle. The effects of different heat capacity ratios have been investigated by using gases with higher and lower heat capacity ratios than air. The obtained experimental results are discussed and compared with CFD calculations. Furthermore, an analysis {{on the effect of}} a Reynolds number and Mach number variation was carried out with a complete scramjet model. In both cases pressure measurements and Schlieren photographs were used in order investigate the flow properties...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{graduate}} college financed by the <b>German</b> National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> (DFG), an experimental study {{has been carried out}} on a fixed geometry scramjet inlet operating at Mach 6 in the hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne. To reduce the risk of inlet un-start, a passive boundary layer bleed has been integrated at the throat and successfully tested. The passive bleed reduces the lip shock induced separation bubble on the ramp significantly. The obtained experimental results are discussed and compared with CFD calculations. To investigate the compression behavior, different back pressures have been applied and the effects on the internal flow structure are analyzed by means of Schlieren pictures and Pitot pressure profiles at the exit of the isolator. The heat transfer coefficient to the inner sidewall of the isolator is calculated using the time dependent surface temperature, measured with an infrared system...|$|R
