25|$|Since {{joining the}} EU in 1973, Ireland has {{received}} over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These {{are made up}} of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the education system and to build physical infrastructure. These transfer payments from members of the European Union, such as Germany and France, were as high as 4% of Ireland's gross national product (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses, though the libertarian Cato Institute has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth. The conservative Heritage Foundation also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.|$|E

2500|$|Cornwall {{has become}} reliant on tourism, {{more so than}} the other {{counties}} of the South West. In 2010 Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly had the lowest GVA per head of any county or unitary authority in England. It contributes only 7.4% of the region's economy [...] and has received EU Convergence funding (formerly Objective One funding) since 2000. [...] Over four million people visit the county each year. [...] The reasons for Cornwall's poor economic performance are complex and apparently persistent, but causes include its remoteness and poor transport links, the decline of its traditional industries, such as mining, agriculture and fishing, the low-wealth generating capacity of tourism, relocation of higher skilled jobs {{to other parts of the}} South West, and lack of a concerted economic strategy (although use of European Regional Development Fund and <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Fund</b> monies have been deployed in an attempt at restructuring).|$|E
2500|$|Deprivation {{manifests itself}} {{in the form of}} high youth unemployment, an above average {{proportion}} of workers in manual occupations, low mean income and a low percentage of people with higher degrees. High educational attainment up to GCSE and A-level demonstrates the depth of local talent, however, poor job opportunities and the absence, until recently, of a university in Cornwall has meant that much of this young talent leaves the area and never returns. [...] As such Penwith was listed as an Objective 1 area by the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Fund,</b> however, this status expired in 2006 with the programme closing on 31 December 2008. [...] Traditionally, like {{much of the rest of}} Cornwall, Penwith's economy relied heavily on mining and fishing and was badly affected by the decline of these industries. Although the district has tried to stimulate employment through tourism, many of these jobs are by definition seasonal or part-time and do not replace the skilled jobs lost by the closure of the mines.|$|E

However, {{it is difficult to}} compute a tight WCET estimation for CMPs due to interferences that tasks suffer when accessing shared hardware resources.

40|$|To detect {{directional}} couplings {{from time}} series various measures based on distances in reconstructed state spaces were introduced. These measures can, however, be biased by asymmetries in the dynamics' structure, noise color, or noise level, which are ubiquitous in experimental signals. Using theoretical reasoning and results from model systems we identify the various sources of bias {{and show that}} most of them can be eliminated by an appropriate normalization. We furthermore diminish the remaining biases by introducing a measure based on ranks of distances. This rank-based measure outperforms existing distance-based measures concerning both sensitivity and specificity for directional couplings. Therefore, our findings are relevant for a reliable detection of directional couplings from experimental signals.
