5000|$|It is popularly {{believed}} that Pavlov always signaled {{the occurrence of}} <b>food</b> by <b>ringing</b> a bell. However, his writings record {{the use of a}} wide variety of stimuli, including electric shocks, whistles, metronomes, tuning forks, and a range of visual stimuli, in addition to the ring of a bell. In 1994, Catania cast doubt on whether Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his experiments. Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlov’s contemporaries Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev and John B. Watson. Roger K. Thomas, of the University of Georgia, however, said they had found [...] "three additional references to Pavlov's use of a bell that strongly challenge Littman's argument". In reply, Littman suggested that Catania's recollection, that Pavlov did not use a bell in research, was [...] "convincing ... and correct".|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} attachment of acceleration dataloggers to the lower beaks of loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta could be a useful technique for monitoring their feeding and breathing behaviors. Attaching acceleration dataloggers to the lower beak of turtles allows determination of the pitch of the head from the low frequency component of the acceleration data, and of dynamic movements (e. g. biting) from the high frequency component. In addition, to determine whether the acceleration datalogger could distinguish between different food sources and feeding locations based on acceleration characteristics, we fed the turtles with different types of <b>food</b> (squid <b>rings,</b> fins, and heads that include arms and tentacles) across different locations. Our results demonstrate that the acceleration datalogger was able to detect the lower beak movements of loggerhead turtles, which enabled detection of 99. 6 ± 1. 1 (SD) % of feeding and 100 % of breathing behaviors, with respective false detection rates of 24. 8 ± 12. 4 % and 2. 4 %. Furthermore, our results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} (1) determine whether feeding on prey requires a strong biting force, and (2) differentiate between feeding at the sea floor and in the water column. Attaching an acceleration datalogger is thus established as a useful technique for monitoring the feeding and breathing behaviors of sea turtles. Future studies employing acceleration dataloggers should provide new insights into the biology of sea turtles and their feeding and diving strategies...|$|R
2500|$|Thomas Jefferson had [...] "potatoes {{served in}} the French manner" [...] at a White House dinner in 1802. The {{expression}} [...] "French fried potatoes" [...] first occurred in print in English in the 1856 work Cookery for Maids of All Work by E.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{measure the}} {{concentrations}} of particles less than 100  nm diameter and of oxides of nitrogen generated by cooking with gas and electricity, to comment on possible hazards to health in poorly ventilated kitchens.  METHODS—Experiments with gas and electric rings, grills, and ovens were used to compare different cooking procedures. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured by a chemiluminescent ML 9841 A NOx analyser. A TSI 3934  scanning mobility particle sizer {{was used to measure}} average number concentration and size distribution of aerosols in the size range 10 - 500 nm.  RESULTS—High concentrations of particles are generated by gas combustion, by frying, and by cooking of fatty <b>foods.</b> Electric <b>rings</b> and grills may also generate particles from their surfaces. In experiments where gas burning was the most important source of particles, most particles were in the size range 15 - 40 nm. When bacon was fried on the gas or electric rings the particles were of larger diameter, in the size range 50 - 100 nm. The smaller particles generated during experiments grew in size with time because of coagulation. Substantial concentrations of NOX were generated during cooking on gas; four rings for 15  minutes produced 5  minute peaks of about 1000  ppb nitrogen dioxide and about 2000  ppb nitric oxide.  CONCLUSIONS—Cooking in a poorly ventilated kitchen may give rise to potentially toxic concentrations of numbers of particles. Very high concentrations of oxides of nitrogen may also be generated by gas cooking, and with no extraction and poor ventilation, may reach concentrations at which adverse health effects may be expected. Although respiratory effects of exposure to NOx might be anticipated, recent epidemiology suggests that cardiac effects cannot be excluded, and further investigation of this is desirable.    Keywords: cooking fuels; nitrogen oxides; ultrafine particle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStudies of waterbirds rely to a {{large extent}} on ringing and resighting or {{recapture}} data, whilst assuming that ringed birds are broadly representative of the population as a whole. This may not be the case if the capture process may in itself have an influence on the birds. The analyses presented here showed that the body mass of ringed ducks often decreases between capture and recapture if the latter occurs within a few days or weeks. This could possibly reflect stress caused by handling, which would be problematic if it causes ringed birds to behave in a way that differs from the population as a whole. Alternatively, body mass measurements could also be biased by the general use of bait to attract birds to the trap. Initial and subsequent body mass data recorded for Eurasian Teal Anas crecca caught then recaptured within three weeks were compared between sites where the birds were attracted to traps with bait or with live decoys. When bait was used individuals had a greater body mass at ringing but were lighter at recapture at all but one site, where only a marginal difference was found. Conversely, when using live decoys, body mass remained constant at the next capture event. This suggests that mass loss commonly observed between capture and recapture is not caused by handling, but is potentially an artefact linked to duck hyperphagia in the presence of abundant <b>food</b> at <b>ringing.</b> It also implies that most available duck body mass data, which are usually obtained from birds ringed at baited traps, may be artificially inflated. The present results are based on one single unbaited site, however, and experimental manipulative studies (alternating the use of bait and live decoys to trap birds) are needed to confirm the findings...|$|R
40|$|A food {{supplement}} was provided every second {{day during the}} nine months of the dry season to a population of the gerbil Taterillus pygargus on the former IBP study site of Fété-Olé, Northern Senegal. The effects of this supplementary food were assessed by comparison with the population of a control quadrat {{set up in the}} same dry bush savanna. During {{the first three months of}} food provisioning, a spectacular increase of Taterillus pygargus numbers was noticed on the provisioned quadrat (QA), as compared to the control area (QT). This was entirely due to a concentration of mature individuals, mostly adult males. Food provisioning also had a beneficiai effect upon the growth curve of young individuals, and on the adult body weight, in both sexes. The breeding season of the females was also lengthened on the provisioned quadrat, but the production of young was not significantly different on the two quadrats. However, <b>food</b> provisioning du <b>ring</b> the lean part of the year was unable to prevent or slow down the sharp population decline of this species which took place from January to June 1977, at Fété-Olé as well as all over Northern Senegal. Such a population crash cannot therefore be ascribed to a mere shortage of foo...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Teschen disease (previously {{also known}} as Klobouk’s disease), {{actually}} called Teschovirus encephalomyelitis, is a virulent fatal viral disease of swine, characterized by severe neurological disorders of encephalomyelitis. It was initially discovered in the Teschen district of North-Eastern Moravia. During the 1940 s and 1950 s it caused serious losses to the pig production industry in Europe. The most critical situation at that time, however, was in the former Czechoslovakia. A nationally organized eradication programme started in 1952. That year the reported number of new cases of Teschen disease reached 137 396, i. e., an incidence rate of 2 794 per 100 000 pigs, in 14 801 villages with 65 597 affected farms, i. e., 4. 43 affected farms per village and 2. 10 diseased pigs per affected farm. The average territorial density of new cases was 1. 07 per km 2. For etiological diagnosis histological investigation of the central nervous system, isolation of virus and seroneutralization were used. Preventive measures consisted in feeding pigs with sterilized waste <b>food</b> and in <b>ring</b> vaccination. Eradication measures {{took the form of}} the timely detection and reporting of new cases, isolating outbreak areas, and the slaughter of intrafocal pigs followed by sanitation measures. Diseased pigs were usually destroyed in rendering facilities. The carcasses of other intrafocal pigs were treated as conditionally comestible, i. e., only after sterilization. During the years 1952 – 1965 from a reported 537 480 specifically diseased pigs 36 558 died; i. e., Teschen disease mortality rate was 6. 80 % while other intrafocal pigs (88. 12 %) were urgently slaughtered. During the whole eradication programm...|$|R
