Designed in the Late Baroque style, the building with its black-glazed tile roof consists of two storeys and a cellar.

The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are {{in stark contrast to the}} often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central <b>door</b> <b>is</b> ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E

5|$|The Thousand-Year <b>Door</b> <b>is</b> set in {{the town}} of Rogueport, in the Mushroom Kingdom. The {{majority}} of locations are not featured in previous Mario games.

The enemies and town inhabitants in the game range from recurring Mario characters, like Boo, to characters exclusive to the game, such as the X-Nauts. For many stages in the game, the story is presented {{in the context of a}} novel, and is divided into eight chapters (nine counting the prologue).|$|E
5|$|The Victorian square font and pulpit match, but are now largely whitewashed, as is much of {{the rest}} of the church.

50|$|Although {{the terms}} {{are often used}} interchangeably, {{platform}} screen doors can refer to both full-height and half-height barriers. Full height platform screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> total barriers between the station floor and ceiling, while the half-height platform screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> referred to as platform edge doors, as they do not reach the ceiling and thus do not create a total barrier. The half-screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> usually {{only half of the}} height of the full-screen doors, but they sometimes reach to the height of the train. These two types of platform screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> presently the main types in the world.|$|R

5|$|The roof is tiled and hipped, {{with five}} hips in all. The seven window {{openings}} {{built into the}} roof at second-floor level are original, but fitted with modern windows. On the first floor there are nine tall, narrow windows with wide frames, stone sills and deep arches of rubbed brick. In the late 18th century, eight windows were altered, {{two of which are}} on the left-hand-side of the door. The door itself is placed centrally with a coved, moulded architrave above and 45-degree corbels decorated with acanthus supporting a cornice with round brackets and a carved keystone. The <b>door</b> <b>is</b> glazed and a Doric porch of modern brick covers the doorcase.|$|E
5|$|The third <b>door</b> <b>is</b> a vestry door further right, {{leading to}} the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of {{uncertain}} age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. Above the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> an oculus window that originally had glazing bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and timber sills.
