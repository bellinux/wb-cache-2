25|$|The {{voyage to}} the Americas {{produced}} many discoveries and developments {{that help to}} illustrate Humboldt's ideas about this <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces.</b> Humboldt produced the Tableau physique des Andes ("Physical Profile of the Andes), which aimed at capturing his voyage to the America's in a single graphic table. Humboldt meant to capture all of the physical forces, from organisms to electricity, in this single table. Among many other complex empirical recordings of elevation-specific data, the table included a detailed biodistribution. This biodistribution mapped the specific distributions of flora and fauna at every elevation level on the mountain.|$|E
500|$|The speech ends as such [...] "With {{violence}} and disturbance {{in the natural}} world, we see a constant effort to maintain an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces.</b> Nature, like a loving mother, is ever trying to keep land and sea, mountain and valley, each in its place, to hush the angry winds and waves, balance the extremes of heat and cold, of rain and drought, that peace, harmony, and beauty may reign supreme. There is a striking analogy between matter and mind, and the present disorganization of society warns us that in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of {{violence and}} ruin that she only {{has the power to}} curb. If the civilization of the age calls for an extension of the suffrage, surely a government of the most virtuous educated men and women would better represent the whole and protect the interests of all than could the representation of either sex alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Humboldtian science {{applied the}} idea of general <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> to the continuities {{in the history of}} the {{generation}} of the planet. Humboldt saw the history of the earth as a continuous global distribution of such things as heat, vegetation, and rock formations. In order to graphically represent this continuity Humboldt developed isothermal lines. These isothermal lines functioned in the general balancing of forces in that isothermal lines preserved local peculiarities within a general regularity. According to Humboldtian science, nature's order and equilibrium emerged [...] "gradually and progressively from laborious observing, averaging, and mapping over increasingly extended areas." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the working depth of mid-water trawl net has been obtained by considering that the towing warp in operation takes geometrically {{a part of a}} circular arc and was verified by a series of experiments. This time, the gear was analyzed on the basis <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> hydrodynamic <b>forces,</b> and six <b>equilibrium</b> equations <b>of</b> the state in operation were obtained. Seven diagrams were obtained by calculation of these equations for the convenience of practical use, and the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> hydrodynamic <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the mid-water trawl net in operation was realized...|$|R

The dynamics of turbulent flows arising from external <b>forcing</b> <b>of</b> the turbulence are poorly understood. In particular, here are many unanswered questions relating the basic dynamical balances {{and the existence}} or nonexistence <b>of</b> statistical <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> turbulent flows.

2500|$|The linear {{relation}} between [...] and [...] {{follows from the}} fundamental laws of conservation of linear momentum and static <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces,</b> and is therefore mathematically exact, for any material and any stress situation. [...] The components of the Cauchy stress tensor at every point in a material satisfy the equilibrium equations (Cauchy’s equations of motion for zero acceleration). Moreover, the principle of conservation of angular momentum implies that the stress tensor is symmetric, that is , , and [...] Therefore, the stress state of the medium at any point and instant can be specified by only six independent parameters, rather than nine. [...] These may be written ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{concept that}} {{is central to}} Humboldtian science {{is that of a}} general <b>{{equilibrium}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces.</b> Humboldt explains: [...] "The general equilibrium which reigns amongst disturbances and apparent turmoil, is the result of infinite number of mechanical forces and chemical attractions balancing each other out." [...] Equilibrium is derived from an infinite number of forces acting simultaneously and varying globally. In other words, the lawfulness of nature, according to Humboldt, is a result of infinity and complexity. Humboldtian science promotes the idea that the more forces that are accurately measured over more of the earth's surface results in a greater understanding of the order of nature.|$|E

The tetrahedron is formed by slicing the infinitesimal element along an arbitrary plane n. The stress vector on this plane is denoted by T(n). The stress vectors acting {{on the faces of}} the tetrahedron are denoted as T(e1), T(e2), and T(e3), and are by definition the components σij of the stress tensor σ. This tetrahedron is sometimes called the Cauchy tetrahedron. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces,</b> i.e. Euler’s first law of motion (Newton’s second law of motion), gives: ...|$|E

For easy derivation, we assume that the force vector f_i is parallel to the direction of gravity; in other words, the friction force is determined uniquely. We only consider the static equilibrium because the leg-grope is carried out without any movement as in Fig. 2. First, we show the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> and moment <b>of</b> the robot system, and next, we show the admissible geometrical regions {{of the position of}} the COG and the contact point for the groping leg.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> on {{the surface}} is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of surface active molecules which can stabilise a microbubble at a size where surface tension on a clean bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to surface curvature, providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the gas out of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A gas bubble can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E

All four classes are delightful, but only the last class is ever really decorative. Acrobats and gymnasts can give the young painter infinite suggestions, for they bring into their art an element of swiftness of motion and of constant change that the studio model necessarily lacks. What is interesting in these 'slaves of the ring' is that with them Beauty is an unconscious result not a conscious aim, the result in fact of the mathematical calculation of curves and distances, of absolute precision of eye, of the scientific knowledge of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces,</b> and of perfect physical training. A good acrobat is always graceful, though grace is never his object; he is graceful because he does {{what he has to}} do in the best way in which it can be done - graceful because he is natural. If an ancient Greek were to come to life now, which considering the probable severity of his criticisms would be rather trying to our conceit, he would be found far oftener at the circus than at the theatre. A good circus is an oasis of Hellenism in a world that reads too much to be wise, and thinks too much to be beautiful. If it were not for the running- ground at Eton, the towing-path at Oxford, the Thames swimming- baths, and the yearly circuses, humanity would forget the plastic perfection of its own form, and degenerate into a race of short- sighted professors and spectacled PRECIEUSES. Not that the circus proprietors are, as a rule, conscious of their high mission. Do they not bore us with the HAUTE ECOLE, and weary us with Shakespearean clowns? Still, at least, they give us acrobats, and the acrobat is an artist. The mere fact that he never speaks to the audience shows how well he appreciates the great truth that the aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please. The clown may be blatant, but the acrobat is always beautiful. He is an interesting combination of the spirit of Greek sculpture with the spangles of the modern costumier. He has even had his niche in the novels of our age, and if MANETTE SALOMON be the unmasking of the model, LES FRERES ZEMGANNO is the apotheosis of the acrobat.|$|E
