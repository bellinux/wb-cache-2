The experimental strain field distribution is measured over the whole <b>deformable</b> <b>zone</b> of a plane strain test specimen by an optical strain gauge. The chosen material is the DC 06 IF steel of 0. 8 mm thickness. The stress field is computed for several geometries at different strain levels by a Finite Element (FE) commercial code (Samcef ®). The results show that the stress field is sensitive to the specimen’s geometry and also to the tested material (strain field behavior is independent of material) and, based on results, an optimal specimen geometry is proposed in order to minimized the stress computation error.

In-situ stress around the fault was estimated based on the stress memory of rocks recovered from five depths (739 – 1316 m) of a 2 -km-deep-hole. The borehole intersects a fault zone at a depth of 1111 m (FZ 1111), which is the best candidate for the Chelungpu fault. Our main results are: (1) the SHmax direction is parallel to the slip for the Chi-Chi earthquake and agrees with those of the local, regional, or tectonic scales estimated from various stress indicators; (2) significant aspects of the stress field are identical to those of paleostress; (3) the horizontal differential stress was significantly reduced just above FZ 1111, which may be attributable to the existence of a significantly <b>deformable</b> <b>zone</b> at this depth.|$|E

Shortening of the Moroccan Atlas has accommodated 17 %? 45 % of the total African-Eurasian plate convergence since the early Miocene, whereas the majority of the plate convergence is accommodated in the Rif-Betic-Alboran region. Although the latter underwent other geodynamic processes, as demonstrated by extension of the Alboran Sea contemporaneous with plate convergence, shortening directions in the Atlas are generally consistent with ongoing plate convergence and show no influence of these additional processes. In the framework of plate tectonics, the western Mediterranean region, including the Atlas system, should be regarded as a diffuse plate boundary in which the Atlas Mountains comprise narrow <b>deformable</b> <b>zones</b> bounding larger, relatively rigid crustal blocks.

The statistics of traffic accidents by MLITT (2004) show that of these 7400 accidents, top three main root causes are speeding, distracted driving and drunk driving. The purpose of this project proposal presented by group 12 {{is to develop a}} Safety System {{to reduce the amount of}} car traffic accidents. Included in the scope are the research, development and selection of one of the designs to finally execute. Moreover this project focuses on Suzuki's small car segment with a high potential in Japanese and Indian market. These cars are cheap and relatively of high quality but have a bigger chance on a fatal car accident as their <b>deformable</b> <b>zone</b> is only small compared to big car models. Excluded is execution of the implementation of the final selected option and research on feasibility of worldwide product launch (including other car brands). A Safety Premium Point System is introduced as the final result. For every distance and time driven without any warnings of the system, the driver earns points. When the system defines a "danger" measured with an in-car sensor, an advice is provided to change this behavior. According to what is done with the advice, the system converts to points and a final amount of points appear. Services can be interchanged for the amount of points earned, to provide incentives for drivers to purchase system. With method we obtained the following characteristics of the in-car sensors, related to aforementioned root causes: webcam to detect distraction, alcohol detector to measure drunk drivers, car navigation to track speeding. Results from customer's request, provide us with the preference of possible services a driver can chose, respectively: car maintenance (24 %), donation (18 %), traffic voting right (18 %), day-off (15 %), discount highway (14 %), motor sports tickets (11 %), and discount of parking (1 %). [1] When we think about business model, concerns of investors, customer's, supplier's, and competitor's have important meaning. There are many IT machines such as i-Pod or portable GPS cellular phone in these days, so above machinery system will be able to attain cheaply. However, funds and cooperation among involved companies is difficult as realizing implementation requires a lot of change in the world. Therefore, closer cooperation among government, NGO, Japan Automobile Federation (JAF), Japan Safe Driving Center and other companies surrounding Suzuki will be necessary in order to successfully integrate our system in people's daily lives. In conclusion, if our suggestion of SPPS pervades among drivers, they will pay attention more carefully while driving, and the number of traffic accidents will decrease, gradually. Not only pursuing one's company's profit, but also having close teamwork among car companies may be required, nowadays. After successfully launching in Japan and India we would like to launch this system worldwide. Any unexpected problems resulting in a substantial influence on one of the premises: cost, quality, time, schedule will result in a meeting with investors and first customer (Suzuki) on how to proceed. Quality control, budget control and time control are already implemented to avoid these unexpected problems, plus regular meetings with investors, end-users and customers...|$|E

Robots are well adapted for this task especially when exploring karst conduits at depths greater than 200 m. However, as karst aquifers environment is very complex, robots need to exhibit a collection of abilities to ensure a safe exploration. Among them, being able to "center" safely within the karst conduits and avoid collisions is a key point to ensure the robot safety during its mission. We propose a new reactive way to do so, based on the <b>Deformable</b> Virtual <b>Zone.</b> This allows us to model the interaction of the robot with its environment as a physics inspired equation.

See also: [URL] Atlas Mountains of North Africa, {{located in}} the African {{foreland}} of the Alpine mountain belts, comprise a 2, 000 km long Cenozoic mountain chain whose development was guided by older Mesozoic rift structures. This dissertation examines one component, the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco, using geological and geophysical data to constrain the tectonic development of the mountain chain. These results are then placed in the broader context of regional deformation. The NE-SW trending Middle Atlas Mountains are obliquely oriented within the late Cenozoic regional stress field, resulting in deformation partitioned into strike-slip faulting and thrust-related folding. Kinematic analyses of fault-slip data and earthquake focal mechanisms demonstrate that compressional deformation dominates the Folded Middle Atlas, whereas strike-slip faulting, with possible horizontal extension, predominates in the Tabular Middle Atlas. Geological field observations, digital topography, LANDSAT imagery, and seismicity provide evidence for recent tectonics in the Middle Atlas. In the central Middle Atlas, cross-section balancing across the 20 km wide fold belt demonstrates about 4. 7 km of Cenozoic horizontal shortening producing 800 m of structural relief. Other constraints on crustal thickening suggest a discrepancy between contraction and thickening. One possible explanation involves partitioning crustal deformation with depth: The upper crust shortens by thickening (faulting and folding), whereas the lower crust deforms laterally. At the northern extent of the mountain chain, the Guercif Basin developed where the Middle Atlas abut the Rif thrust belt. Similar timing of extensional deformation and proximity with the Rif, suggest that the Guercif Basin has been influenced by Rif tectonics. Stratal relations demonstrate that uplift of the Middle Atlas is a late Cenozoic phenomenon. In Morocco, shortening of the High and Middle Atlas Mountains accommodated 20 - 45 % of the total African-Eurasian plate convergence since the Early Miocene. The diffuse plate boundary comprises large, relatively rigid crustal blocks (Moroccan Meseta, High Plateau, and Saharan Platform) bounded by narrow <b>deformable</b> <b>zones</b> (the Atlas). In this context, the Middle Atlas {{can be interpreted as}} an accommodation zone resulting from differential movements between two large crustal blocks impinging on stable Africa. The Atlas Mountains exemplify the possible structural influence of inherited crustal weaknesses in a diffuse plate boundary such as the western Mediterranean region...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a closed-form analytical {{solution for the}} consolidation of soil around a laterally loaded pile, assuming the soil skeleton deforms elastically and under plane strain conditions. The problem is idealized as a circular rigid disk surrounded by a <b>deformable</b> soil <b>zone.</b> Drainage is assumed to occur at the boundary of the assumed <b>zone</b> of <b>deformable</b> soil around the pile. The response around the pile is obtained using an uncoupled consolidation analysis. The solution for the governing equation of excess pore water pressure is found by using the separation of variables technique. Expressions for the initial excess pore water pressure distribution are derived from the mean total stress changes given by the elastic solution. Curves showing decay of the excess pore water pressure with time, and also the variation of pile displacement, are plotted in nondimensional form. The parameters that affect the displacement prediction are illustrated and discussed. Comparison with three-dimensional analysis of a laterally loaded pile shows that the two-dimensional analysis can reasonably predict the consolidation process along the shaft of the pile. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{technological}} advances and the growing demands for underwater operations suggest that autonomous underwater vehicles will become increasingly present in com-mercial and research activities, performing tasks such as survey, inspection of sub-sea pipelines and object recovery. This fact calls for the development of guidance and control algorithms for the execution of this kind of mission. This paper proposes a reactive control approach for pipeline following by a torpedo-like autonomous underwater vehicle. The method presented here, called the <b>Deformable</b> Virtual <b>Zones</b> (DVZ) method was originally conceived at the LIRMM for obstacle avoidance by mobile robots and AUVs. It consists of the modelling of a virtual zone around the robot, whose configuration depends on the robots states. The intrusion of proximetric information in this zone inflicts a deformation, and the control signal is computed so that the robot will react in order to minimise this deformation. We extend this sensor-based control method by proposing a new DVZ configuration for pipeline following by an autonomous underwater vehicle. Simulation results allow verifying its robustness as the pipeline changes direction, taking into account AUV dynamics. The proposed method is currently being implemented using the TAIPAN II, a small sized torpedo-like AUV developed at the LIRMM, fitted with a profiling sonar system. Experimental results will soon be available. I...|$|R
3000|$|Because the {{conductive}} {{zones are}} located in the middle crust in the vicinity of active volcanoes (Kuju, Aso, Tsurumi, Garan, and Yufu) or in the lower crust beneath the Futagawa and Hinagu faults, we interpret that the deep conductors represent high-temperature ductile or low-rigidity zones due to the presence of fluids such as magma or saline water. In contrast, we interpret the resistive zones as relatively cold brittle zones with a fluid deficit. We hypothesize that the conductive zone preferentially deforms, such that the static stress over Kyushu (Matsumoto et al. 2015; Savage et al. 2016) accumulates preferentially in proximal brittle resistive zones and subsequently causes large earthquakes. The concept of local stress accumulation has been proposed {{based on the results of}} previous magnetotelluric studies (e.g., Ogawa et al. 2001; Ichihara et al. 2008, 2014; Wannamaker et al. 2009). The concept is similar to the hypothesis of Iio et al. (2002) who assumed that the lower crust had a <b>deformable</b> weak <b>zone.</b> In addition, our results suggest that fluids supplied from conductive zones to nearby resistive zones can promote earthquake occurrences (e.g., Mitsuhata et al. 2001; Ogawa et al. 2001; Yoshimura et al. 2009) by increasing pore pressure and decreasing the effective normal stress. Although it is usually difficult to uniquely determine the triggering mechanism, the effect of fluids on earthquake generation is especially plausible in the region of Seis. 3, which is approximately 100  km away from the hypocenter of the M [...]...|$|R
