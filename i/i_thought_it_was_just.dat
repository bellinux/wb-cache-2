500|$|Engineering of {{the song}} was done by Emily Wright and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I thought it was just another song, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> like all the other ones I'd written. I didn't even know if it was very good.

In a conversation that reportedly lasted 45 seconds Johnson pitched the idea to Mittal, who immediately agreed to supply the steel. Mittal later said of his involvement, [...] "I never expected that this was going to be such a huge project. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the supply of some steel, a thousand tonnes or so, and that would be it. But then we started working with artists and I realised that the object was not just to supply steel but to complete the whole project. It took us almost 15 months of negotiation and discussion." [...] Johnson has said that, [...] "In reality, ArcelorMittal has given much more than the steel." ...|$|E
