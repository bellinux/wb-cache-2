60|$|The {{chilling}} rains of November and December's {{flurry of}} snow had passed and mid-winter with its icy blasts had set in. The Black Forest had changed autumn's gay crimson and yellow to the somber hue of winter and now looked indescribably dreary. An <b>ice</b> <b>gorge</b> had {{formed in the}} bend of the river {{at the head of}} the island and from bank to bank logs, driftwood, broken ice and giant floes were packed and jammed so tightly as to resist the action of the mighty current. This natural bridge would remain solid until spring had loosened the frozen grip of old winter. The hills surrounding Fort Henry were white with snow. The huge drifts were on a level with Col. Zane's fence and in some places the top rail had disappeared. The pine trees in the yard were weighted down and drooped helplessly with their white burden.|$|E
50|$|Chu River posed {{a risk of}} {{flooding}} for settlements located in Chu Valley. In winter 1878, an <b>ice</b> <b>gorge</b> formed on Chu River upstream town Tokmok that {{was the center of}} Semirechye Province. This was followed by severe flooding that damaged the town and the center of the province was moved to Pishpek (Bishkek). After this, Tokmak gradually lost its significance.|$|E
50|$|Nantua Lake is a glacial lake. Its {{formation}} {{is the result}} of an overflow towards the west a huge orientation North South. The original extent of the glacier lake, once the glaciers disappeared, (the study of terminal glacial moraines) was about two to three times area of 2000 with extensions in the plain in three directions (Nurieux, Saint Martin du Fresne, Montreal). This explains the significant depth (42.9 m) and its configuration in the form of <b>ice</b> <b>gorge</b> east-west areas at risk of flooding towards the plain and Port areas moraines. Its scope was much larger and was marked by two arms of lakes and large marshes to unhealthy important work done in 1856. This work lowered the lake level by more than one meter. The cleared zones were cleaned and sold largely to individuals in 1869 by the mayor of Nantua previously owned these recently discovered areas.|$|E
5000|$|John Hilger, {{an early}} {{resident}} of Pierre, South Dakota described the flood, saying, “When the snow started to disappear, it {{left in a}} hurry. The river rose very rapidly, the <b>ice</b> <b>gorged</b> a short distance below town, turning the water into the bottoms and flooded the town with from four to six feet of water. Those who were not so fortunate as to possess two story houses were obliged to retreat to higher ground. My dugout was filled with {{women and children and}} I was obliged to seek quarters elsewhere {{because of the lack of}} room.” ...|$|R
60|$|So {{steep and}} glazed with <b>ice</b> was this <b>gorge</b> or gully {{that they were}} {{compelled}} to tie themselves together with strands of Cullum. They laid Thimble's litter on three long pieces of wood strapped together. Then, Ghibba going foremost, {{one by one they}} followed the ascent after him, stumbling and staggering, and heaving at the Cullum-rope to drag up poor Thimble on his slippery bed.|$|R
40|$|Changing {{temperature}} regimes {{inside a}} field of debris with year-round ice blocks are the base of this study in northern New Hampshire, USA. This unique ecosystem shows strong temperature anomalies {{in comparison to the}} surrounding area and ice, especially year-round ice, is not common below 700 m a. s. l. Yearly mean air temperatures can be strongly connected to the yearly ice level variations. Besides the analysis of the complete dataset of five years and a comparison of the impact of different seasons onto the ice considering precipitation, air temperature and special weather phenomena, the question about the use of talus 2 ̆ 6 <b>gorge</b> <b>ice</b> caves as a climate indicator for a region has priority...|$|R
40|$|The {{breaking-up}} of the <b>ice</b> <b>gorge</b> on the Mississippi River in {{the winter}} of 1865 - 66 caused a loss of nearly a million dollars to owners and underwriters at St. Louis. It was the most disastrous break-up that had ever occurred to that date. This text lists the estimates of damage along with the names of the boats lost.
