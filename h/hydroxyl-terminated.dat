5000|$|HAN is a {{potential}} rocket propellant, both in the solid form as a solid propellant oxidizer, and in the aqueous solution in monopropellant rockets, including the Network Centric Airborne Defense Element boost-phase interceptor being developed by Raytheon. [...] It is typically bonded with glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB), or carboxy-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB) and requires preheating to 200-300 °C to decompose.

50|$|Elastomers {{have to be}} {{used with}} more {{mechanically}} sensitive explosives, e.g. HMX. The elasticity of the matrix lowers sensitivity of the bulk material to shock and friction; their glass transition temperature is chosen to be below the lower boundary of the temperature working range (typically below -55 °C). Crosslinked rubber polymers are however sensitive to aging, mostly by action of free radicals and by hydrolysis of the bonds by traces of water vapor. Rubbers like Estane or <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB) are used for these applications extensively. Silicone rubbers and thermoplastic polyurethanes are also in use.|$|E
50|$|This was the binder {{formulation}} {{widely used}} on the 1960s-1970s big boosters (e.g., Titan III and Space Shuttle SRBs). It is also sometimes used by amateurs due to simplicity, very low cost, and lower toxicity than the more common <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB). HTPB uses isocyanates for curing, which have a relatively quick curing time; however, they are also generally toxic. PBAN based propellants also have a slightly higher performance than HTPB based propellants.PBAN is normally cured {{with the addition of}} an epoxy resin, taking several days at elevated temperatures to cure.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid {{rocket fuel}} grains can be {{manufactured}} via casting techniques, {{since they are}} typically a plastic or a rubber. Complex geometries, which are driven by the need for higher fuel mass flow rates, makes casting fuel grains for hybrid rockets expensive and time consuming {{due in part to}} equipment costs. On a larger scale, cast grains must be supported by internal webbing, so that large chunks of fuel do not impact or even potentially block the nozzle. Grain defects are also an issue in larger grains. Traditional fuels that are cast are <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB) and paraffin waxes.|$|E
50|$|In another project, protons easily {{pass through}} {{slightly}} imperfect graphene membranes on fused silica in water. The membrane {{was exposed to}} cycles {{of high and low}} pH. Protons transferred reversibly from the aqueous phase through the graphene to the other side where they undergo acid-base chemistry with silica hydroxyl groups. Computer simulations indicated energy barriers of 0.61-0.75 eV for <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> atomic defects that participate in a Grotthuss-type relay, while pyrylium-like ether terminations did not. Recently, Paul and co-workers at IISER Bhopal demonstrated solid state proton conduction for oxygen functionalized few-layer graphene(8.7x10−3 S/cm) with a low activation barrier (0.25 eV).|$|E

France denies that the sale took place. U.S. intelligence traces the sale back to China's Qilu Chemicals company in Shandong province. The chemical sale involved a French company known as CIS Paris, which helped broker the sale of 20 tons of HTPB, which was then shipped from China to the Syrian port of Tartus. The chemicals were then shipped by truck from Syria to an Iraqi missile manufacturing plant.|$|E

50|$|Polymeric {{surfaces}} generally only possess dispersion forces but {{may contain}} functional groups able to bond to adhesion promoters. If parylene is bonded to {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) then often the mechanical tie-points allow parylene to exhibit good adhesion as opposed to bonding through covalent links (chemical bonding). Sometimes plasma methods are effective in the promotion of adhesion between parylene and polymeric surfaces but these techniques are not trivial to employ. The third surface, metal-oxide forming surfaces, generally possess a <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> surface, M-OH, where M is a metal such as aluminum or chromium. This termination group has the ability to react with commercially available silanes such as A-174 (methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), which is the common adhesion promoter for the parylene polymers.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium {{perchlorate}} composite propellant is {{a composite}} propellant, meaning that it has both fuel and oxidizer mixed with a rubbery binder, all combined into a homogeneous mixture. The propellant is most often composed of ammonium perchlorate (AP), an elastomer binder such as <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB) or polybutadiene acrylic acid acrylonitrile prepolymer (PBAN), powdered metal (typically aluminum), and various burn rate catalysts. In addition, curing additives induce elastomer binder cross-linking to solidify the propellant before use. The perchlorate serves as the oxidizer, while the binder and aluminum serve as the fuel. Burn rate catalysts determine how quickly the mixture burns. The resulting cured propellant is fairly elastic (rubbery), which also helps limit fracturing during accumulated damage (such as shipping, installing, cutting) and high acceleration applications such as hobby or military rocketry.|$|E
50|$|The PSLV {{has four}} stages using {{solid and liquid}} {{propulsion}} systems alternately. The first stage, {{one of the largest}} solid rocket boosters in the world, carries 138 tonnes of <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene-bound (HTPB) propellant and develops a maximum thrust of about 4,800 kN. The 2.8-m diameter motor case is made of maraging steel and has an empty mass of 30,200 kg. Pitch and yaw control during first stage flight is provided by the Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control System (SITVC), which injects an aqueous solution of strontium perchlorate into the nozzle to produce asymmetric thrust. The solution is stored in two cylindrical aluminium tanks strapped to the solid rocket motor and pressurised with nitrogen. Roll control is provided by two small liquid engines {{on opposite sides of the}} stage, the Roll Control Thrusters (RCT).|$|E

5000|$|U.S. Rockets [...] {{manufactures}} and deploys hybrids using self-pressurizing {{nitrous oxide}} N2O and HTPB {{as well as}} HTP and HTPB. The High Test Hydrogen Peroxide H2O2 86% and <b>Hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB) and aluminum hybrids developed by U.S. Rockets produce a sea level delivered specific impulse (Isp) of 240, well above the typical 180 of N2O-HTPB hybrids. In addition to that, they are self-starting, restartable, have considerably lower combustion instability making them suitable for fragile or manned missions such as Bloodhound SSC, SpaceShip Two or SpaceShip Three. The company has successfully tested and deployed both pressure fed and pump fed versions of the latter HTP-HTPB style. Deliverables to date have ranged from 6 inch to 18 inch diameter, and development units up to 54 inch diameter. The vendor claims scalability to over 5 meters diameter with regression rates approaching solids, according to literature distributed at the November 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency meeting for XS-1.|$|E
50|$|A {{powdered}} oxidizer {{and powdered}} metal fuel are intimately mixed and immobilized with a rubbery binder (that also {{acts as a}} fuel). Composite propellants are often either ammonium nitrate-based (ANCP) or ammonium perchlorate-based (APCP). Ammonium nitrate composite propellant often uses magnesium and/or aluminium as fuel and delivers medium performance (Isp of about 210 s) whereas Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant often uses aluminium fuel and delivers high performance (vacuum Isp up to 296 s with a single piece nozzle or 304 s with a high area ratio telescoping nozzle). Aluminium is used as fuel {{because it has a}} reasonable specific energy density, a high volumetric energy density, and is difficult to ignite accidentally. Composite propellants are cast, and retain their shape after the rubber binder, such as <b>Hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPB), cross-links (solidifies) {{with the aid of a}} curative additive. Because of its high performance, moderate ease of manufacturing, and moderate cost, APCP finds widespread use in space rockets, military rockets, hobby and amateur rockets, whereas cheaper and less efficient ANCP finds use in amateur rocketry and gas generators. Ammonium dinitramide, NH4N(NO2)2, is being considered as a 1-to-1 chlorine-free substitute for ammonium perchlorate in composite propellants. Unlike ammonium nitrate, ADN can be substituted for AP without a loss in motor performance.|$|E
5000|$|Solid {{propellants}} {{are either}} [...] "composites" [...] composed mostly of large, distinct macroscopic particles or single-, double-, or triple-bases (depending {{on the number}} of primary ingredients), which are homogeneous mixtures of one or more primary ingredients. Composites typically consist of a mixture of granules of solid oxidizer (examples: ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, potassium nitrate) in a polymer binder (binding agent) with flakes or powders of energetic compounds (examples: RDX, HMX), metallic additives (examples: aluminium, beryllium), plasticizers, stabilizers, and/or burn rate modifiers (iron oxide, copper oxide). Single-, double-, or triple-bases are mixtures of the fuel, oxidizer, binders, and plasticizers that are macroscopically indistinguishable and often blended as liquids and cured in a single batch. Often, the ingredients of a double-base propellant have multiple roles such as RDX which is both a fuel and oxidizer or nitrocellulose which is a fuel, oxidizer, and plasticizer. Further complicating categorization, there are many propellants that contain elements of double-base and composite propellants, which often contain some amount of energetic additives homogeneously mixed into the binder. In the case of gunpowder (a pressed composite without a polymeric binder) the fuel is charcoal, the oxidizer is potassium nitrate, and sulphur serves as a catalyst. (Note: sulphur is not a true catalyst in gunpowder as it is consumed to a great extent into a variety of reaction products such as K2S.) During the 1950s and 60s researchers in the United States developed ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). This mixture is typically 69-70% finely ground ammonium perchlorate (an oxidizer), combined with 16-20% fine aluminium powder (a fuel), held together in a base of 11-14% polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) or <b>Hydroxyl-terminated</b> polybutadiene (polybutadiene rubber fuel). The mixture is formed as a thickened liquid and then cast into the correct shape and cured into a firm but flexible load-bearing solid. Historically the tally of APCP solid propellants is relatively small. The military, however, uses a wide variety of different types of solid propellants some of which exceed the performance of APCP. A comparison of the highest specific impulses achieved with the various solid and liquid propellant combinations used in current launch vehicles is given in the article on solid-fuel rockets.|$|E
40|$|The {{covalent}} immobilization of DNA onto {{self-assembled monolayer}} (SAM) modified gold electrodes (SAM/Au) was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry and electrochemical method {{so as to}} optimize its covalent immobilization on SAMs. Three types of SAMs with hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl terminal groups, respectively, were examined. Results obtained by both X-ray photoelectron spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry show that the largest covalent immobilization amount of dsDNA could be gained on <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> SAM/Au. The ratio of amount of dsDNA immobilized on <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> SAMs to that on carboxyl-terminated SAMs and to that on amino-terminated SAMs is (3 - 3. 5) : (1 - 1. 5) : 1. The dsDNA immobilized covalently on <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> SAMs accounts for 82. 8 - 87. 6 % of its total surface amount (including small amount of dsDNA adsorbed). So the <b>hydroxyl-terminated</b> SAM is a good substrate for the covalent immobilization of dsDNA on gold surfaces. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
