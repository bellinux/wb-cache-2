The analysis of the data used in this research is a method of multiple linear regression with the dependent variable is profit and the independent variables are dormant account and third party funds. The result shows that the dormant account didn 2 ̆ 7 t have an effect on bank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit.</b> Otherwise, the third party funds/deposit funds has an effect of bank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit.</b> This result imply that bank should reduce the dormant account, if there is a decreasing in dormant account there will be an increasing too in third party funds, and if the third party funds is increasing the bank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit</b> will be also increasingDOI: 10. 15408 /etk. v 14 i 1. 226...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a model for}} exploring the interactions between a transport market and a monopolistic market for advanced traveller information systems (ATIS). We examine {{the properties of the}} information market, and in particular, the relationship between monopoly information pricing and road system efficiency. From model experiments, we find that increasing information penetration will lead to negative external effects for the already informed drivers. Furthermore, monopoly information pricing is not the most attractive option from a system efficiency viewpoint, because of the relatively high price charged by the monopolist. Third, a user or a producer subsidy on the information market can help realise a second-best optimum of road use. Finally, relatively low uncertainty on the road and high information costs limit the monopolist 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>profit</b> on the information market, as well as relative system efficiency.

40|$|The paper augments the {{asymmetric}} information literature on bank lending to new ventures {{by focusing on}} the more neglected area of moral hazard; specifically the relationship between risk aversion, an <b>entrepreneur.</b> <b>s</b> wealth and the provision of collateral. The results highlight some interesting nuances which are not characteristic of the properties of models that have dominated the literature and which mainly focus on the problems of adverse selection. Contrary to models such as Evans and Jovanovic (1989) Blanchflower and Oswald (1998) our model shows that credit rationing does not necessarily have to be negatively related to an <b>entrepreneur.</b> <b>s</b> initial wealth. Our model shows that banks can use collateral as a means of affecting an entrepreneur's risk aversion - the tactic being least effective for both very low and high wealth individuals. We show that this can cause banks to ration credit at both tails of the wealth distribution. Furthermore, we argue that credit rationing is likely to be less applicable to low wealth individuals, as a small increase in their initial wealth can have very dramatic effects on access to bank finance as it both increases the risk aversion of the borrower as well as the usual affect of raising the amount of the debt that is effectively securitized through borrower collateral. Thus, through this mechanism, low wealth individuals who can provide at least some collateral would have greater access to finance than previously supposed. The results also indicate why collateral to debt ratio need not be negatively related to interest rate margins...|$|R

Transportation method {{used by a}} company will cause great impact on company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit.</b> If company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>profit</b> can be maximal, the company {{will be able to}} develop its business even greater. Some problem solution steps proposed were: determining optimum criteria, developing alternative solution, developing optimum model, and practicing chosen implicative planning solution. These steps were implemented to obtain optimum goods distribution cost to gain maximum profit. This research resulted in that the distribution cost for goods implemented by current method in the company has been already optimum.
