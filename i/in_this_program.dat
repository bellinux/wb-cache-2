They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't {{have to leave the}} synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> until the Rebbe would tell them to return home to their wives and families.|$|E

25|$|There are {{instances}} where {{the use of}} a PHR would be beneficial to patients and may, therefore, override privacy concerns. Stage 1 of meaningful use of certified EHR systems requires that practices provide at least 50 percent of their patients with a copy of their health records upon request. While this can be accomplished through a patient portal, this function can also be part of a larger system such as Kaiser Permanente's My Health Manager—a PHR that is integrated into the health system's patient portal. By June 2012, 3.9 million Kaiser members were enrolled <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>program.</b> For the first half of 2012, members viewed 2.5 million lab results, sent 1 million e-mails to physicians, and scheduled 230,000 appointments monthly, demonstrating ease of use and convenience.|$|E

25|$|The William Allen High School {{offers a}} dual {{enrollment}} program. This state program permits {{high school students}} to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>program.</b> In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis.|$|E
