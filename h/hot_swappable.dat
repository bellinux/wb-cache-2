50|$|Skilled in {{computer}} programming and engineering, Prewitt founded and managed {{a number of}} technology firms. The largest and best known was Core International, a developer of disk array, computer data storage and backup products. Core created and in 1990 marketed the world's first disk drives, disk controller or host adapter and power supplies that were <b>hot</b> pluggable or <b>swappable.</b> Prewitt was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until 1993 when the company was sold to Sony.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Hot Plug" [...] was a {{registered}} trademark {{issued by the}} USPTO and other countries in 1992 under [...] "Computer & Software Products & Electrical & Scientific Products Trademarks". [...] It was invented for computer components including PATA in the late 1980s by Hal Prewitt, founder of Core International. First patent details were disclosed in 1987 in USA [...] and Europe [...] related to development of the technology to connect host bus adapters to mass storage device however the filings were not completed. Core created and in 1990 marketed the world's first disk controller, host adapter, disk drives, disk arrays and power supplies that were <b>hot</b> pluggable or <b>swappable.</b> Initial implementations were on the IBM PS/2 series and Micro Channel architecture bus controllers.|$|R

50|$|National Instruments have {{developed}} a hybrid embedded computing system called CompactRIO. It consists of reconfigurable chassis housing the user-programmable FPGA, <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> I/O modules, real-time controller for deterministic communication and processing, and graphical LabVIEW software for rapid RT and FPGA programming.|$|E
50|$|CompactRIO {{real-time}} controllers {{include a}} microprocessor for implementing control algorithms, and support {{a wide range}} of clock frequencies. Controllers are only compatible with National Instruments C Series I/O Modules. I/O modules are <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> (can be connected/disconnected while the unit is powered up).|$|E
50|$|The device {{features}} Bluetooth, a 1.3-megapixel fixed-focus camera, front VGA (0.3-megapixel) {{video call}} camera, <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> Dual Voltage Reduced Size MMC (DV-RS-MMC) memory expansion card support, stereo audio playback and a 2.1", 176x208, 18-bit (262,144) color display with {{automatic brightness control}} based on the environment.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 Siemens {{launched}} its first phone {{running on the}} Symbian OS operating system, the Siemens SX1. The phone featured <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> MultiMediaCard. In the same year Siemens launched the Xelibri range of fashion phones. In 2005 Siemens launched the first phone with real GPS support, the Siemens SXG75.|$|E
50|$|A gigabit {{interface}} converter (GBIC) {{is a standard}} for transceivers, commonly used with Gigabit Ethernet and fibre channel in the 2000s. By offering a standard, <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> electrical interface, one gigabit port can support {{a wide range of}} physical media, from copper to long-wave single-mode optical fiber, at lengths of hundreds of kilometers.|$|E
50|$|Power {{supplies}} for servers, industrial control equipment, or {{other places where}} reliability is important may be <b>hot</b> <b>swappable,</b> and may incorporate N+1 redundancy; if N power supplies are required to meet the load requirement, one extra is installed to provide redundancy and allow for a faulty power supply to be replaced without downtimes.|$|E
50|$|The {{key feature}} of this phone is Dual SIM. It means that the phone can have two SIM cards of which the second is <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> (i.e. can be changed without {{restarting}} the phone). Other features include: VGA camera, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, Flash Lite 4.0 and MIDP Java 4.5 with additional Java APIs.|$|E
50|$|Servers {{commonly}} have a backplane {{to attach}} <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> hard drives; backplane pins pass directly into hard drive sockets without cables. They may have single connector to connect one disk array controller or multiple connectors {{that can be}} connected {{to one or more}} controllers in arbitrary way. Backplanes are commonly found in disk enclosures, disk arrays, and servers.|$|E
50|$|The SystemPro line {{continued}} for several years, {{ending with the}} SystemPro XL (the only model that supported symmetric multiprocessing). It {{was replaced by the}} Compaq Proliant line, which introduced <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> drives and the rack mount chassis now popular in data centers. However, the SystemPro is notable for having established the PC-based server market, and setting a high-water mark for the servers that followed.|$|E
5000|$|The Enterprise SSD {{form factor}} was {{developed}} by the SSD form factor working group (SFFWG). The specification was released on December 20, 2011 as a mechanism for providing PCI Express connections to SSDs for the enterprise market. Goals included supporting existing 2.5" [...] and 3.5" [...] mechanical enclosures, to be <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> and to allow legacy SAS and SATA drives to be mixed using the same connector family.|$|E
50|$|The Nokia N900 has 32 GB eMMC and 256 MB NAND {{non-removable}} storage. Additional {{storage is}} available via a <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> microSDHC card socket, which is claimed to support up to 64 GB of additional storage. However, the SDHC specification supports cards {{only up to}} 32 GB in size, and some difficulty has been reported {{with the use of}} 64 GB SDXC cards. Sandisk claims that SDXC cards are not compatible with the N900.|$|E
50|$|PS/2 ports are {{designed}} to connect the digital I/O lines of the microcontroller in the external device directly to the digital lines of the microcontroller on the motherboard. They are not designed to be <b>hot</b> <b>swappable.</b> Hot swapping PS/2 devices usually does not cause damage because more modern microcontrollers {{tend to have more}} robust I/O lines built into them which are harder to damage than those of older controllers; however, hot swapping can still potentially cause damage on older machines, or machines with less robust port implementations.|$|E
50|$|Up to 192 <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> {{hard disk}} drives can be {{supported}} per system. Drives can be designated {{for use by}} an array {{in the event of}} hardware failure. Up to 32 separate RAID arrays can be supported per adaptor, and arrays can be mirrored across servers to provide cost-effective protection for critical applications. Furthermore, arrays can be sited up to 25 metres apart - connected by thin, low-cost copper cables - allowing subsystems to be located in secure, convenient locations, far from the server itself.|$|E
50|$|The I-brick is a 4U-high {{enclosure}} {{that provides}} boot I/O functions for the Origin 3000. It features five <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> PCI-X slots, with three clocked at 33 MHz and two at 66 MHz on two separate buses, two sled-mounted 3.5-inch Fibre Channel hard drives and a proprietary CD-ROM drive. The I-Brick {{also provides a}} 10/100BASE-T Ethernet port, an IEEE-1394 port, a serial port, two USB ports {{as well as a}} real time clock and NVRAM for storing configuration information through the IO9. It connects to the system using Crosstown2.|$|E
50|$|A later crate {{standard}} is Computer Automated Measurement and Control, or CAMAC. CAMAC modules are much thinner than NIM modules. The backplane connector of a CAMAC module is a card-edge connector; {{because of the}} possibilities of mis-aligning the connectors upon plugin, CAMAC modules are NOT <b>hot</b> <b>swappable.</b> The CAMAC backplane contains a signaling protocol for the crate controller to set the values of registers in modules (for configuration) and to read values of registers (for data acquisition). Due to the slowness of the data communication along the backplane, once FASTBUS was invented, CAMAC modules were mostly used for modules {{that needed to be}} computer-configured but not for data acquisition.|$|E
5000|$|As {{opposed to}} the 6600 and 6620's VGA {{resolution}} digital camera (640×480), the 6630 has a 1.3-megapixel camera (1280×960). It can record video clips at the resolution of 176×144, using H.263 video compression. Like the 6600 and 6620, the 6630 has Bluetooth capabilities and has a 176×208 pixel 65,000-color TFT LCD. It comes with a <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> DV-RS-MMC card, capacity 32 MB or 64 MB depending on the region where the phone is sold. It is noteworthy that normal RS-MMC cards do not work with the 6630, it requires dual-voltage (1.8 V and 3.0 V) RS-MMC cards. Currently it {{has been known to}} support up to 2 GB from a DV-RS-MMC but may support more.|$|E
5000|$|The E25K {{supports}} up to 72 dual-core UltraSPARC IV+ processors (up to 1.95 GHz). As with UltraSPARC IV-based 15K systems, the [...] "MaxCPU" [...] {{option was}} not offered for E25K systems. Overall system bandwidth is claimed as up to 172.8 GB/s aggregate, up to 115.2 GB/s peak, {{and up to}} 43.2 GB/s sustained. For overall I/O bandwidth, up to 35.8-GB/s sustained. Up to 64 GB of RAM per board is possible with a maximum of 1.15 TB of RAM for a single domain. Up to 72 <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> PCI-X I/O slots; 54 slots are 90 MHz, 18 slots are 33 MHz. It also supports 10/100 BaseT Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, UltraSCSI (LVD and HVD), ATM, FC-AL, HSI and SCI.|$|E
5000|$|The Moto Z {{features}} an accessory system known as [...] "Moto Mods". Mods are case-like accessories that {{are attached to}} the rear of the Moto Z via a series of magnets. Using the pogo pin connectors, Mods can communicate with the device to provide additional functionality. Mods are <b>hot</b> <b>swappable,</b> and are automatically detected by the operating system software once installed. During the launch event, Lenovo unveiled several mods to be available on launch, including battery packs, the [...] "SoundBoost" [...] (which features a JBL speaker and a kickstand), and a pico projector ("Insta-Share"). All Moto Z devices ship with a [...] "Style Shell"—a basic rear cover, as well as a clear, plastic [...] "bumper" [...] case that protects the bezel of the device.|$|E
50|$|Although most {{contemporary}} video game systems can interchange games and multimedia (e.g. Blu-ray discs) without powering down the system, older generations of systems varied in {{their support of}} hot swapping capabilities. For example, where the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could eject a game disc with the system powered on, Nintendo Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo 64 would freeze up and could potentially become corrupt if the game cartridge was removed with the power on. Manufacturers specifically warned against such practices in the owner's manual or on the game cartridge. It was supposedly the aforementioned reason Stop 'N' Swop {{was taken out of}} the Banjo-Kazooie series. With the Sega Genesis system, it was sometimes possible to apply cheats (such as a player having infinite lives) and other temporary software alterations to games by hot swapping cartridges, even though the cartridges were not designed to be <b>hot</b> <b>swappable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Large {{traditional}} single servers {{would need}} to be run for long periods without interruption. Availability would have to be very high, making hardware reliability and durability extremely important. Mission-critical enterprise servers would be very fault tolerant and use specialized hardware with low failure rates in order to maximize uptime. Uninterruptible power supplies might be incorporated to insure against power failure. Servers typically include hardware redundancy such as dual power supplies, RAID disk systems, and ECC memory, along with extensive pre-boot memory testing and verification. Critical components might be <b>hot</b> <b>swappable,</b> allowing technicians to replace them on the running server without shutting it down, and to guard against overheating, servers might have more powerful fans or use water cooling. They will often be able to be configured, powered up and down or rebooted remotely, using out-of-band management, typically based on IPMI. Server casings are usually flat and wide, and designed to be rack-mounted.|$|E
40|$|Some Lisp {{programs}} such as Emacs, but also the Linux kernel (when fully modularised) are mostly dynamic; i. e., apart from a small static core, the significant functionality is dynamically loaded. In this paper, we explore fully dynamic applications in Haskell where the static core is minimal and code is <b>hot</b> <b>swappable.</b> We demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture by two applications: Yi, an extensible editor, and Lambdabot, a plugin-based IRC robot. Benefits of the approach include <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> code and sophisticated application configuration and extension via embedded DSLs. We illustrate both benefits in detail at {{the example of a}} novel embedded DSL for editor interfaces...|$|E
30|$|Like {{software}} is exchanged by a patch, hardware can be reconfigured as well. A reconfiguration {{is likely to}} enforce a reboot, if an exchanged component is not <b>hot</b> <b>swappable.</b> Therefore, we assume the same local impact as induced by a reboot.|$|E
40|$|A {{solid state}} analog {{television}} transmitter designed for 200 MHz operation is being commissioned as a {{radio frequency power}} amplifier on the Wisconsin superconducting electron gun cavity. The amplifier consists of three separate radio frequency power combiner cabinets and one monitor and control cabinet. The transmitter employs rugged field effect transistors built into one kilowatt drawers that are individually <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> at maximum continuous power output. The total combined power of the transmitter system is 33 kW at 200 MHz, output through a standard coaxial transmission line. A low level radio frequency system is employed to digitally synthesize the 200 MHz signal and precisely control amplitude and phase...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{solution}} to the problem of dynamic extension in statically typed functional languages with type erasure. The presented solution retains the benefits of static checking, including type safety, aggressive optimizations, and native code compilation of components, while allowing extensibility of programs at runtime. Our approach is based on a framework for dynamic extension in a statically typed setting, combining dynamic linking, runtime type checking, first class modules and code hot swapping. We show that this framework is sufficient to allow a broad class of dynamic extension capabilities in any statically typed functional language with type erasure semantics. Uniquely, we employ the full compile-time type system to perform runtime type checking of dynamic components, and emphasize the use of native code extension to ensure that the performance benefits of static typing are retained in a dynamic environment. We also develop the concept of fully dynamic software architectures, where the static core is minimal and all code is <b>hot</b> <b>swappable.</b> Benefits of the approach include <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> code and sophisticated application extension via embedded domain specific languages. We instantiate the concepts of the framework via a full implementation in the Haskell programming language: providing rich mechanisms for dynamic linking, loading, hot swapping, and runtime type checking in Haskell for the first time. We demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture through a number of novel applications: an extensible text editor; a plugin-based network chat bot; a simulator for polymer chemistry; and xmonad, an extensible window manager. In doing so, we demonstrate that static typing is no barrier to dynamic extension...|$|E
40|$|Suburban Americans {{suffer from}} homes built with: a low {{standard}} of craftsmanship, poor efficiency of construction, {{excessive use of}} material resources and a disregard for their site. Architectural diversity is at a low, driven by a consolidation of homebuilders and fewer floor plans. The current home production workflow from commission to build {{pales in comparison to}} the automotive industries solutions. Influenced by heavy machinery and <b>hot</b> <b>swappable</b> computers, ideas are born for a better way to build houses. These ides evolve though understanding the principles of several successful vehicles, analyzing census data, and studying floor plans. The flexible autonomous systems house (FASH), involves a 900 mm x 900 mm framework and a kit of parts that engages our industrial ability and maintains architectural values of space, form, materiality and site specificity. FASH is about bringing a logic and simplification of technique to building that allows quality and reuse to become reality...|$|E
