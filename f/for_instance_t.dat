50|$|Consonants whose {{constriction}} is {{made with}} the tongue tip or blade touching or reaching for the alveolar ridge are called alveolar consonants. Examples of alveolar consonants in English are, <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> <b>t,</b> d, s, z, n, l like in the words tight, dawn, silly, zoo, nasty and lurid. There are exceptions to this however, such as speakers of the New York Accent who pronounce t and d {{at the back of}} their teeth. When pronouncing these sounds the tongue touches (t, d, n), or nearly touches (s, z) the upper alveolar ridge, which can also be referred to as gum ridge. In many other languages, consonants transcribed with these letters are articulated slightly differently, and are often described as dental consonants. In many languages consonants are articulated with the tongue touching or close to the upper alveolar ridge. The former are called alveolar plosives, and the latter alveolar fricatives.|$|E

However, their size can vary based on location. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> <b>T.</b> carbonaria from Queensland can be as small as T. mellipes, but in New South Wales, they can get as large as T. hockingsi. They are all {{predominantly}} black-bodied, covered in microscopic hairs. The adult workers and males are all black, with some brownish tint in certain {{areas such as the}} legs. The worker’s body length is 3.9-4.3 mm, and the wing length (including tegula) is 4.1-4.6 mm. The male drones have very similar bodies and wing lengths. T. carbonaria is a very strong flier, being able to fly up to 1 km. However, the species will not fly any further than they have to, so close resources are preferred over those farther away. T. carbonaria and its closely related species have high levels of morphological similarities. Also very low genetic variation exists within T. carbonaria.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a local non-equilibrium diffuse {{interface}} {{model is}} introduced for describing solid-liquid dissolution problems. The model is developed {{based on the}} analysis of Golfier et al. (J Fluid Mech 457 : 213 - 254, 2002) upon the dissolution of a porous domain, with the additional requirement that density variations with the mass fraction are taken into account. The control equations are generated by the upscaling of the balance equations for a solid-liquid dissolution using a volume averaging theory. This results into a diffuse interface model (DIM) that does not require an explicit treatment of the dissolving interface, e. g., the use of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods, <b>for</b> <b>instance.</b> <b>Test</b> cases were performed to study the features and influences of the effective coefficients inside the DIM.
