40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{tutorial}} is to present an overview of various information hiding techniques. A brief history of steganography is provided along with techniques {{that were used to}} hide information. Text, image and audio based information hiding techniques are discussed. This paper also provides a basic introduction to digital watermarking. 1. History of Information Hiding The idea of communicating secretly is as old as communication itself. In this section, we briefly discuss the historical development of information hiding techniques such as steganography/ watermarking. Early steganography was messy. Before phones, before mail, before horses, messages were sent on foot. If you wanted to hide a message, you had two choices: have the messenger memorize it, or hide it on the messenger. While information hiding techniques have received a tremendous attention recently, its application goes back to Greek times. According to Greek historian Herodotus, the famous Greek tyrant Histiaeus, while in prison, used unusual method to send message to his son-in-law. He shaved the head of a slave to tattoo a message on his scalp. Histiaeus then waited until the hair grew back on slave’s head prior to sending him off to his son-inlaw. The second story also came from Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named Demeratus needed {{to send a message to}} Sparta that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back then, the writing medium was written on wax-covered tablet. Demeratus removed the wax from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally sent the document without being detected. <b>Invisible</b> <b>inks</b> have always been a popular method of steganography. Ancient Romans used to write between lines using <b>invisible</b> <b>inks</b> based on readily available substances such as fruit juices, urine and milk. When heated, the <b>invisible</b> <b>inks</b> would darken, and become legible. Ovid in his “Art of Love ” suggests using milk to write invisibly. Late...|$|R

It is easier to perform large-scale undetected screening of millions of electronic communications, than to mass-screen even {{a small fraction of}} conventional mail. Apart from in dictatorships where large numbers of personnel are employed to spy on fellow nationals, screening of posted mail is only feasible in particular situations, such as letters to and from a particular suspect or facility.|$|R
25|$|The Greeks of Classical {{times are}} said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale {{transposition}} cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. More modern examples of steganography include the use of <b>invisible</b> <b>ink,</b> microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.|$|E

In 1615 she commenced the building of a grand hunting lodge with fine vistas, Houghton House in Bedfordshire, on an estate granted to her by King James I, which she completed in 1621, shortly before her death. It is said that the house, today a ruin, was the model for House Beautiful in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).|$|E

40|$|At present time, no safety {{technique}} or tool {{is available}} for {{the identification of the}} authenticity of licensed production of high quality technical textiles.

40|$|International audienceLaser {{cutting of}} paper {{is widely used}} in the paper {{conversion}} industry. CO 2 lasers are well suited {{for this type of}} applications. Desktop printing is a large market both for digital photography, document management and graphics applications, but it still lacks advanced cutting and scoring ability, and CO 2 lasers seem costly to be integrated in mass-market printers. For that reason, mass-scalable and low-cost semiconductor laser diodes would be very advantageous to add paper cutting and scoring features in desktop printers. However, common paper can not be cut properly using visible or Near Infrared (NIR) laser diode since it has a very poor absorption at these wavelengths. We report here an innovative solution to achieve paper cutting or scoring using a 1 W single emitter NIR laser diode, within an inkjet printer. A special ink that absorbs the NIR light, and that penetrates all through the paper, is first disposed on the lines to be cut. Then, the laser diode goes along the lines to be cut. We show that a cutting speed of 2 m/min can be achieved on 80 g/m 2 conventional paper. The influence of the optical properties of the ink on the cutting speed are discussed, as well as focussing issues. In particular, we show that <b>invisible</b> <b>inks</b> are suitable, and very clear-cut edges can be obtained. The perspective of this technique are discussed...|$|R

Later, Hannay and Victoria kiss, and the next morning he sees her leaving with a man, whom he recalls seeing previously on the train and at the rally. With the notebook missing and finding out that Victoria disconnected the call she made to the Secret Service Bureau before it was connected, Hannay goes to Stirling Castle, believing Victoria to be a traitor. There, Victoria reveals she works for the Secret Service Bureau and he meets Kell (Alex Jennings) and Wakeham, the man Victoria left with earlier (Steven Elder), who reveal they used Hannay to distract the Germans and sent Victoria {{to keep an eye on}} him. Hannay deduces that Sir George is the traitor, as he should have heard them when he was at Fisher's House, and, with his photographic memory, has escaped with the naval plans memorised. To identify his rendezvous point with the Germans, they crack the remaining code, referring to the room they were previously imprisoned in at Longkeep Castle, and discover [...] "39 steps" [...] written in the notebook by Scudder using <b>invisible</b> <b>ink.</b> At the Castle, Hannay and Victoria find 39 steps leading to a loch.

It includes a vast array of secret communications methods that conceal the message’s very existence. These methods include <b>invisible</b> <b>inks,</b> microdots, character arrangement, digital signatures, covert channels, and spread spectrum communications. Steganography and cryptography are cousins in the spy-craft family. This paper information hiding and its applications, and image compression using proposed efficient encoding technique with the main focus being on hiding in the spatial domain are developed. Three information hiding methods are proposed, which are based on the encoding technique, are tested and the results are analyzed. Increase in tolerance level would allow using all range blocks so that more data can be stored. However low tolerance is desirable in order to give an image that is visually close to the original. Further research should go towards improving the watermarking program and adding extra functionality. One of these is looking at having multiple watermarks for a single image, so that different parts of the image have a different watermark. There is also the need to further develop the robustness of existing watermarking techniques to combat the ever-increasing attacks on watermarks. We used fixed partitioning scheme. Instead of this, adaptive partitioning scheme can be used, which would yield better results if used {{as the basis for the}} data hiding method...|$|R
