50|$|A {{variety of}} prodrugs of {{amphetamine}} and/or methamphetamine exist, and include amfecloral, amphetaminil, benzphetamine, clobenzorex, D-deprenyl, dimethylamphetamine, ethylamphetamine, fencamine, fenethylline, fenproporex, <b>furfenorex,</b> lisdexamfetamine, mefenorex, mesocarb, prenylamine, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Furfenorex</b> (Frugalan), {{also known}} as furfurylmethylamphetamine, is a {{stimulant}} drug which {{was developed in the}} 1960s and used as an appetite suppressant. It produces methamphetamine as a metabolite, and is no longer marketed, due to possible problems with abuse.|$|E
40|$|An ultra high {{performance}} liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS) screening method for the direct analysis in oral fluid (OF) of 24 drugs, including new synthetic cannabinoids and so-called “smart” designer drugs, {{in a single}} chromatographic run was set up. Benzylpiperazine, methylone, 5, 6 -methylenedioxy- 2 -aminoindane (MDAI), fenproporex, 4 -fluoroamphetamine (4 -FA), 4 -methyl-N-ethylcathinone (4 -MEC), 4 -methylamphetamine (4 -MA), methylbenzodioxolylbutanamine (MBDB), mephedrone, methylthioamphetamine (MTA), methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), mefenorex, nabilone, <b>furfenorex,</b> clobenzorex, JWH- 200, AM 694, JWH- 250, JWH- 073, JWH- 018, JWH- 019, JWH- 122, HU 210 and CP 47497 were determined in a chromatographic run of 9 min only with no sample pre-treatment, after addition of ISs and dilution in mobile phase A. This method {{is designed to be}} applied to 250 L of OF sample, anyway is suitable to be used on smaller volumes (till 100 L). LODs vary from 1 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL. No interfering peaks were observed due to similar analytes, common therapeutic drugs or endogenous compounds. Matrix effect, although present especially for mephedrone, is acceptable, allowing the detection of the compounds at the LODs described. The developed method was applied on 400 real OF samples from on-site tests performed by police officers...|$|E
