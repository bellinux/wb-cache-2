Hypothesis {{of research is}} the existence of methodological criteria of territory classification {{on the basis of}} external and <b>internal</b> <b>terrorism.</b> On the basis of the analysis of theoretical works of national and foreign authors, normative documents of state and international level the genesis of approaches {{to the understanding of the}} essence of modern terrorism, its contents, the subject-object relations and manifestation forms is received. As the result, according to the authors’ definition “terrorism” is understood as an ideology connected with deliberate violence or threats against the civilian population or property to influence on the government or the interstate organizations. In the work, the factors of development and spreading of terrorism in the Russian Federation’s regions are allocated and quantitatively proved. Weight parameters of the specified factors are determined. The methodological differentiation of the specified factors on factors of terrorism external (attacks from the outside) and an internal form (distribution and realization of radical ideas within the region in the territory) is the distinctive feature of the conducted research. During the research, the cluster analysis of a region is carried out to distribute of Russia’s regions according to the typological characteristic of the region of internal and external terrorism. The obtained data are verified in accordance with empirical data, the hypothesis of the existence of methodological criteria of the region classification on the basis of external and <b>internal</b> <b>terrorism</b> is proved...|$|E

Nevertheless, it has continued {{to rely on the}} criminal justice system when terrorist attacks developed within U. S. territory. It has arrived at a hybrid system which tracks geography - the difference between at home and abroad - rather than enemy capability. The European approach has been different. The earlier confrontation with terrorism in France and the United Kingdom encouraged more robust legal authorities there. European nations, however, have struggled to respond to the international dimension of more recent attacks.

This Article argues that they should see democratic change in Arab countries as an important long-term goal and seek opportunities to support it. Democratization would advance Western countries 2 ̆ 7 interests, as well as the ideals they proclaim and the interests of Arab citizens who aspire to govern themselves. The Article synthesizes empirical social science, social science theory, and policy analysis that strongly suggest that democratization of Arab countries would serve core Western interests in the region. First, democracy would have a stabilizing impact inside Arab countries, reducing the risk of civil war and <b>internal</b> <b>terrorism</b> in the long run and quite possibly in the short run. Second, interstate conflict, which this Article 2 ̆ 7 s original empirical findings show to be frequent in the Arab world, would likely diminish in the long run as more Arab states became democratic. Third, terrorist attacks against Western countries {{would be less likely to}} originate in Arab countries if the latter became solid democracies. Finally, Western countries 2 ̆ 7 fundamental interests in the region align more closely with those of Arab publics than those of Arab dictators, so Arab citizens are likely to be better partners for the West. This benefit will not materialize automatically, however. Western policymakers will have to overcome ordinary Arabs 2 ̆ 7 well-justified skepticism about their intentions. Their first step must be to transform their attitudes and policies so as to respect Arab citizens as equals and partners. The Article also considers the possibility that Islamists elected to lead new Arab democracies would use state power to harshly oppress women and minorities. It concludes that this is unlikely, but not out of the question. Continued autocracy is likely to strengthen Islamists 2 ̆ 7 support anyway, so Western countries should not hesitate to support democratization out of concern over what Islamists might do in office. Western countries must step carefully as they try to support democratic change in Arab countries. Their power is limited and they cannot be the primary drivers of change. Their efforts must be guided by subtle analysis of local power dynamics and of how their influence functions in each national context...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA (German) lady vanishes: The {{silent and}} {{somewhat}} restless {{disappearance of the}} GDR Police after 1989 Introduction What was {{at stake in the}} German process of reforming its socialist police after 1989 ? Of course, some of the problems of the German transformation are common to other former socialist countries, i. e., the integration of former agents, reform of former organisations and bureaucracies, the formulation and implementation of new legislation, etc [...] Yet, many factors separate Germany from its eastern neighbours. In terms of constitutional law, the transformation occurred simply with the integration of the administrative regions (known as the " neue Bundesländer " " or NBL) into the constitutional and administrative order of the German Federal Republic (Article 23 of the West German Constitution). There was no constitutional reform, merely a " Unification Treaty " (" Einigunsvertrag ") between the two German states, which was signed in 1990 (Glaeβner and Wallace, 1992, Maier, 1997, and for the full Unification Treaty, see Hancock and Welsh (eds.), 1994, p. 353 - 63). The method of transformation of the administrative structures that existed in East Germany largely resembled a " flash of lightning ". On the day of unification, 3 October 1990, there became one sole political regime, which was that of Federal Republic of Germany, with sixteen autonomous administrative regions, referred to as the " Länder " (or States), and thus sixteen police forces and two federal-level police forces (one, the " Bundeskriminalamt " or BKA) similar to the FBI, and the other being the border and transport police, i. e. the " Bundesgrenzschutz polizei " (BGS) – (for details on the German police see Busch et al, 1998; and Rupprecht, 1995). Which lessons can this " German approach " provide in terms of transforming law enforcement or policing institutions? In answering this question, one ought to consider whether the uniqueness of the German political transition, based on the integral expansion of state structures from the FRG towards former GDR territories, can impart any lessons in police transformation for other states. Given the normative nature of this book (see the Introduction in Caparini and Marenin, 2003), which attempts {{to gain a better understanding}} of what a democratic police force actually is and ought to be, we shall, in particular, endeavour to understand how the authoritarian regime that existed in East Germany could have led to the introduction and success of reforms, or, to put it terms of " transitology ", to the transition and subsequent democratic consolidation of the police (See Stark and Bruszt, 1998 and Dobry (ed.) 2000, and also see Hancock and Welsh (eds.), 1994 and Offe, 1996 on the transition process in Germany). Before being able understand this issue, it is appropriate to include a few words about the GDR police prior to 1989 (for information on the GDR itself, see the Introduction in Fulbrooke, 1995; and for an extensive analysis of the GDR police, see Lindenberger, 1998). The police (" Volkspolizei ", or DVP), which consisted of approximately 120, 000 officers, 1 was one of the pillars of national defence and was placed under the authority of the Secretary-General of the Communist Party. The DVP, which was organised on a military basis, found itself having to submit to oversight bodies and those conducting political investigations, most notably to the " Staatssichereit " or " Stasi " (information on the Stasi is provided in Fulbrooke, 1995). The Stasi, or " political police " viewed the DVP " Volkspolizei ", or regular police, as being poorly equipped, especially for dealing with criminal matters. The Vokspolizei were primarily responsible for public security and surveillance of local social activities. We will turn first to examine the " absorption " process, and then address the effects of this very particular feature on the transformation and democratisation of the police. The process of absorption (1989 - 90) 1 This number is as high as that of the French national police at present, for a population that is about 3. 5 times smaller. 2 The FRG Police: The only possible standard for police forces From a constitutional and political point of view, and in particular after the legislative elections of 18 February 1990 in the GDR, which saw the victory of Chancellor Kohl " s party, the West German Government sought unification between the two States to be achieved as quickly as possible, which avoided any institutional changes in West Germany (Glaeβner, 1994; and Maier, 1997). Whether the matter is considered from a monetary or administrative point of view, the only acceptable standards had to be those of the FRG, which were simply exported. The transformation was to be based on the " transplant " method. The most crucial feature of the transformation was that of the West German constitutional procedure known as " administrative mutual assistance " (" Amshilfe "), in which one Lander lends its help to another Lander; thus each state in West Germay had to provide assistance and share its experience with another state in the Eastern part (Bavaria and Bade-Wurttemburg towards Saxony, Northern Westphalia towards Brandenburg, Schleswig-Holstein towards Mecklenburg, etc.). Standards and values of the FRG police In West Germany, the responsibility for policing lies with each state. Hence, one finds as many police forces as states, as well as the two federal forces, i. e., the BKA and BGS. These police forces, which are placed under the increasingly lenient control of the paired state authorities, are subject to the same rules on penal procedures, but have their own capacities in terms of police administration and public security (" Polizeirecht "). The increasing centralisation of the FRG (German Federal Republic) since the time of Chancelor Willy Brandt (1969 - 74), the fight against <b>internal</b> <b>terrorism</b> (since 1972), and the increased professionalisation of police forces, encouraged a growing alignment of practices and structures from the 1970 s. This was particularly encouraged through the device of the " Conferences of the Interior Ministers of the Lands (IMK) ", held under the authority of the Federal Minister, which brought about de facto a form of growing centralisation of the West German police forces, a process which continues even today. Moreover, since the early 1990 s, these police forces have been involved in programmes promoting community policing and creating urban partnerships with municipal and local associations (Aden, 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} community has many reasons {{to be concerned about}} the growing number of internal conflicts worldwide. 1 Especially where ethnicity or religion is involved, those conflicts can be extremely violent and result in tremendous suffering and large numbers of displaced persons. But even where internal conflicts are relatively peaceful, they still threaten to destabilise the international system. Some internal conflicts involve demands for territorial autonomy or secession which, for better or worse, call the prevailing international order directly into question. Others risk turning into regional conflicts, as neighbouring states seek to protect their ethnic kith-and-kin across the border or strive to ensure that rival states do not gain influence or access to resources that they might secure for themselves. In recent years, internal conflict has also become closely linked to such things as the international drugs trade, piracy and, perhaps most dramatically of all, to the rise of international <b>terrorism.</b> <b>Internal</b> conflicts are extremely difficult to manage, let alone resolve.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between terrorism, civil war and crime in Colombia where the internal conflict is both highly criminalized and low to medium in intensity. One of the main tenets of the 'new wars' thesis is that the civilian|combatant ratio in civil conflicts has worsened dramatically, said {{to be associated with}} the increasingly violent or terrorist behaviour of the groups that participate in the conflict. However, in Colombia the 'new wars' thesis does not hold, despite the very strong link between the guerrillas, the paramilitary and the narco-economy. This argument is supported by an exploration of the methods used and factors motivating the actors involved in the conflict. In constructing a political economy of <b>internal</b> conflicts and <b>terrorism</b> and in the context of territoriality, it is further argued that the 'political' part of the equation is often under-estimated, due not least of all to the lack of a working notion of governance. The policy relevance of the argument is that terrorist acts need to be located in political context and understood in relation to the political content of the challenge they pose and the response they elicit.

Indeed, by analysing this question, the never-ending debate on the relationship between International Human Rights Law and International Humanitarian Law reappears. The second part of this study therefore focuses on the issue of discovering whether and in which way jus in bello has found its place into the Inter-American Human Rights bodies’ case-law.

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{the role of}} {{individual}} and intergroup factors in predicting Muslims’ tendency to attribute domestic terrorism in Indonesia to an external cause (i. e., The West) or an internal cause (i. e., radical Islamist groups). The results (N = 308) showed that intergroup factors of symbolic threat and realistic threat directly increased the external attribution and conversely decreased the internal attribution. Within {{the context of the}} current research, symbolic threat refers to Muslims’ perception that the norms and values of the West undermine Islamic identity. Realistic threat denotes Muslims’ perception that the economy and technology of the West undermine Islamic power. The individual factor of Islamic fundamentalism, which has to do with Muslims’ belief in the literal interpretation of and strict guidelines to Islamic doctrines, indirectly predicted both external attribution and <b>internal</b> attribution of <b>terrorism</b> as hypothesized, via the extent to which Muslims perceived the West as posing a symbolic threat, but not a realistic threat to Islamic existence. Uncertainty avoidance, a cultural dimension that describes the extent to which people view clear instructions as a pivotal source of concern to deal with societal problems, also significantly increased perceived symbolic threat and realistic threat, and this cultural dimension mediated the effect of Islamic fundamentalism on each of the intergroup threats. Finally, we found that the level of Islamic fundamentalism was dependent upon cognitive response, but not emotional response to mortality salience. The cognitive response to mortality salience denotes what Muslims are thinking about in coping with their own death whereas the emotional response denotes what Muslims are feeling about such issue. In particular, we found the cognitive response, but not the emotional response to mortality salience significantly gave rise to Muslims’ Islamic fundamentalism. These findings shed light on the importance of combining individual factors and group factors in explicating the dynamics of Muslims’ tendency to make attributions of causes of domestic terrorism. We discuss theoretical implications and study limitations, as well as practical actions policy makers could conduct to deal with Muslims’ Islamic fundamentalism and reduce the extent to which this particular group perceives the West as threatening their existence...|$|R
40|$|European {{institutions}} are either loathed or underestimated: this book analyses {{the role of}} EU institutions, especially the European Commission in an area which has seen tremendous growth over {{the last ten years}} – European internal security. From Justice and Home Affairs, this area has become more like a European Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In this process, the European Commission has demonstrably played the role of an ‘engine of integration’ in areas such a counter-terrorism, policing, asylum, migration and border management, internally and externally. This book analyses the role of EU Institutions in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. It uses the framework of supranational policy entrepreneurs (SPE), which is often referred to by the academic literature that discusses the role of agency in European integration and is grounded in the work of John Kingdon. The policy-making model starting with the identification of a problem (first stream), which is then followed by a search for alternative solutions (second stream) and a decision among these alternatives (third stream). Policy entrepreneurs stand at the policy window in order to propose, lobby for and sell ‘their’ policy proposal. Yet, this book takes this framework further by synthesising insights from the literature on norm entrepreneurship. This book fills a distinct gap in this scholarship on European internal security and EU policy-making. Although a growing body of literature has emerged that provides regional and thematic explorations of the EU Justice and Home Affairs, crucially, there is no book that addresses the entire Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). Furthermore, the existing literature on policies that we might classify as components of the AFSJ discusses them in isolation from one another. There are some excellent individual studies of asylum, migration, and police cooperation, but not of the entire Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). Because the idea of homeland security has been so controversial and difficult to approach, due to its perceived links to the Bush administration, the body of literature on the subject is rather limited. In the case of internal security literature, most of the work has been done in the United States and focused mostly on the American context. Therefore, scholars and practitioners interested in European internal security are forced to build synergies and draw conclusions by themselves. Within the <b>internal</b> security and <b>terrorism</b> literature, the European dimension to internal security is absent. Most books so far focus on the USA, the UK or individual countries, but not the European Union. This book will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners interested in European internal security, European integration, terrorism and security studies, and international relations and politics more broadl...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} Hungary’s antimoney laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism measures. The Hungarian authorities have made significant progress in strengthening their AML regime. The most important step has been {{the passage of a}} revised AML Act of 2003, replacing the 2001 revision of the original 1994 AML Act. With this, the legislative framework for AML is in place, and has been extended to nonfinancial businesses and professions. Financial institutions’ compliance with the AML requirements is well supervised, and they are well aware of their obligations under the Act.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{humanitarian}} arms control {{emerged in the}} context of the new security challenges of the 21 st century. The 1997 Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines, the 2001 Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PoA) and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions all set out to introduce arms control instruments to regulate not only uncontrolled transfers of arms, but also to end or to limit the indiscriminate use of weapons, and to deal with the long-term effects following intra-state conflicts. The three institutions share similar characteristics and thus permit the conclusion that a structural change has taken place in arms control and disarmament. This change is a consequence of the changed security environment after the end of the Cold War: Fragile statehood, economic under-development, <b>internal</b> state conflicts, <b>terrorism</b> and transnational organized crime provided the international state community with new challenges calling for different and new forms of arms control. This report identifies the indicators for this change and examines the reasons for the development of particular forms of arms control and disarmament. The three regimes banning anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions and restricting the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons all show similar characteristics which were decisive for their evolution and have given a new face to arms control as a whole. The key normative agents that were decisive for this structural change included transnational campaigns by non-governmental organizations as well as a number of small and medium-sized states. These alliances managed to get the arms control agreements off the ground despite opposition from the leading powers. Two factors were remarkable: On the one hand, the special negotiating formats which were set up for the Ottawa and Oslo processes and, on the other hand, “new diplomacy”, which was characterized by a mutual “give and take” between the different actors. By involving NGOs, like-minded states sought global public support and gained additional legitimacy for their ambivalent undertaking. By granting civil society stakeholders the right to participate in the negotiations, these states also enabled NGOs to gain certain influence on the norm generation processes. The change of perspective on arms control also becomes visible in a different, individualized understanding of security. Instead of concentrating exclusively on improving state’s security, attention is now being increasingly directed towards human security. Embedded in the concept of “human security”, one finds references to larger concepts such as development aims and conflict resolution practices. Humanitarian arms control is concerned with mitigating the consequences of the use of weapons as well as their deliberate misuse during and following intra-state conflicts. This new understanding of arms control lies within the wider context of security sector reform, which seeks to make fragile states capable of guaranteeing public security again, but it also addresses individual human needs in post-conflict situations such as victim rehabilitation and reintegration. The new arms control and disarmament agreements are an outcome of specific normgenerating processes which are to be seen {{in the context of}} “new humanitarianism”. The most visible expression and, at the same time, probably the most controversial expression II of this new humanitarianism are a number of military interventions in response to gross violations of human rights and the deliberate disregard of international humanitarian law, as for example in Ruanda or Bosnia. Questions of justice are becoming the direct legitimization for state action and have also inspired and triggered norm-generation processes in other policy fields – for example, the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Moral convictions or questions of justice also motivated norm generating actors in the field of humanitarian arms control. In all three cases under consideration, the need for a new institution was determined by the moral conviction that action must be taken against numerous incidents of severe injustice where innocent people and civilians were killed or wounded by the indiscriminate use of these weapons in cases of intra-state conflicts. This conviction is based on one of the few global concepts of justice in international relations which is also anchored in international humanitarian law, such as the principle of need and proportionality. At the same time, this moral conviction has provided the basis for norm development in the field of humanitarian arms control: The suffering of the civilian population as a result of the use of antipersonnel mines or cluster munitions prompted non-governmental organizations to demand of states to take action and seek a norm banning the use of such weapons. Certain convictions of justice, which seem to be shared in the international system of states, were finally enshrined in the principles, norms and procedures of the three regimes. According to the principle of equality, for example, all states parties must renounce the use of anti-personnel mines or cluster munitions and compile an overview of their national stocks of small arms. A further characteristic of humanitarian arms control is the comprehensive application of the principles of proportionality, need and compensation. For example, the costs-by-cause principle applies to the clearance of cluster munitions. Those states which are particularly affected can rely on technical as well as financial support under the Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines and the Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons. This structural change towards humanitarian arms control is significant for arms control and for disarmament as a whole. However, the moral convictions and the principles of justice demanded by the NGOs in particular touched the limits of national and national security interests. Normative conflicts occurred in the negotiating processes of all three regimes; particularly over question of the appropriate definition of weapons categories, but also with regard to the possible renunciation of sovereignty, for example banning transfers of arms to non-state actors or prohibiting the private possession of weapons. Although the principles of proportionality, necessity and compensation and the recognition of the special needs of the affected states provided an important impetus for the negotiations, the actual implementation process, particularly of the PoA, has been very slow. Das Anti-Personenminenverbot von 1997, das Kleinwaffenaktionsprogramm von 2001 und die Streubombenkonvention von 2008 weisen auf einen Formenwandel in der Rüstungskontrolle hin. Alle drei Regime fokussieren stärker die menschliche Sicherheit und vertreten sicherheits- wie entwicklungspolitische Ziele. Die entscheidenden Initiatoren waren Nichtregierungsorganisationen, transnationale Kampagnen und Klein- und Mittelmächte, die, vereint durch überkulturelle Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen, zu Normunternehmern wurden. Sie förderten neue Verhandlungsformen und konfrontierten die bestehende politische Verhandlungskultur mit einem diplomatischen Miteinander. Simone Wisotzki ermittelt die Indikatoren des Formenwandels, stellt die Gründe dar und benennt die Probleme, wenn globale Ziele der humanitären Rüstungskontrolle mit nationalstaatlichen Sicherheitsinteressen kollidieren. Sie verweist auf die Herausforderungen, die nach wie vor zu bewältigen sind, etwa die fehlenden globalen Normen zur Begrenzung des staatlichen Waffenhandels in Kriegs- und Krisengebiete, und fordert eindringlich, weitere Normentwicklung in der humanitären Rüstungskontrolle zu unterstützen...|$|R
40|$|Student Number : 0415941 F - MA {{research}} report - School of Social Sciences - Faculty of HumanitiesIt is interesting how a specific date and month {{has come to}} define the world. In {{the dawn of the}} millennium, few people would have thought international politics would suddenly change. It was even harder to envisage that America would be a direct target of terror groups’ right inside their country in such a huge magnitude, in this age after the end of cold war when it was the only super power. The events of September 11, 2001 will forever remain entrenched in history and even more so the political events that followed after, since they have redefined the world and its political ideology. Different states have responded to the attacks differently, springing surprises, twists and turns that have shaped the agenda of the human rights discourse. The response to the attack on the Pentagon and World Trade Centre has posed a dilemma to scholars in international human rights law, some of them whom have questioned if {{this is the end of}} human rights era. 1 This is because of how the human rights discourse has been put at cross purpose with the anti-terror efforts that have been employed. After Al-qaeda operatives crashed three airlines into the Pentagon and World Trade Centre, while a fourth one crashed in a field in Shanksville, this was seen as a direct act of aggression on America and President George Bush vowed revenge. On October 8 th 2001, Bush launched a campaign to track Osama Bin Laden and followers of his Al-qaeda group, who were responsible for the attacks. The “war on terror” began the same day with the bombing of Afghanistan that aimed at toppling the Afghanistan government, which supported Al-qaeda. While doing this, Bush placed terrorism above any other global agenda. It is important to note that the toppling of the Afghanistan regime was through the UN Security Council. When a new government was set up after the regime was toppled, the “war on terror” entered new frontier. In his State of the Union address in January 2002, President Bush declared that Iran, Iraq and North Korea were “rogue states” and alleged that the three countries were developing weapons of mass destruction. Bush feared that terrorists would use these chemical and biological weapons to attack other countries, more so American interests and hence measures had to be taken before this happened. He next turned to Iraq which was suspected of having chemical and biological weapons and links with Al-qaeda. He vowed to topple the Iraq regime of Saddam Hussein on these pretexts. 2 These actions led to a lot of international debate, with many countries urging America not to use force to push its agenda. Specifically, most countries were of the view that inspectors from the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNIMOVIC) should be allowed to inspect Iraq to authenticate the claims. 3 In addition, many countries felt that for such a war to happen, the UN Security Council had to pass a resolution allowing the attack of Iraq. Nevertheless, America and its allies went ahead with their plans of toppling Saddam. On April 9, 2003 the regime of Saddam Hussein was toppled and he was captured on December 14, 2003. However, Osama has not yet been caught. At the same time, the United Nations (U. N.) has passed various resolutions condemning terrorism and urging countries to enact anti-terror measures that do not infringe on the people’s human rights. Despite this, the anti-terrorism measures adopted by many countries have fallen short of the U. N. human rights requirements and have proved to be a challenge to internationa l human rights law and refugee law. This has led to various scholars arguing that the U. N. charter should be reviewed to adequately cater for the “war on terror” and the enforcement of human rights while engaging in these efforts. In any case, it is clear that legal safeguards that were once viewed as unchangeable are now being challenged. As David Rieff avers, “…the threat that <b>internal</b> war and <b>terrorism</b> poses to the edifice of international law would have become apparent sooner or later. If anything, September 11 only hastened and focused the process. ” This {{research report}} aims to study the implications of the “war on terror” for the protection of human rights in Kenya. In doing so, it is noted that even though Kenya has been a victim of terrorist activities, it was only after America began the “war on terror” in October 2001 that it started putting up structures to address terrorism. Thus, the main thrust of this research is to investigate the human rights dilemma that Kenya faces in these efforts includ ing interrogating the reasons for the tensions that resulted from the draft Suppression of Terrorism bill 2003 that was drawn up by the government in its effort to fight terrorism. In order to do this, several research questions inform the study. a) How has the “war on terror” shaped the understanding and practices of human rights in Kenya? b) How has the “war on terror” shaped Kenya’s approach to terrorism? c) How did the draft Suppression of Terrorism bill 2003 emerge? d) Was the draft bill a result of social struggles and history of the country as regards terrorism? e) What are the human rights concerns that have emerged from the draft bill? f) What are the tensions that have cropped up between protecting human rights and ensuring national security in Kenya? This will include a study of local campaigns by the Civil Society and Muslim community against the draft antiterror bill. g) Why have the tensions come up between the citizens and the government? To do this, the study will look into the human rights history of Kenya and relationship between the government and its citizens. h) What has been the impact of anti-terrorism measures on certain ethnic and religious groups? i) How have suspected terrorists in Kenya been treated while under custody? Human rights as applied in this research report refers to a set of internationally agreed upon principles which have been set down in the various declarations of United Nations human rights instruments, African Charter and other legal documents like Constitutions. Over the years, these principles have continuously been refined and extended to ensure that more people especially the minorities are catered for and have since been evoked when oppression occurs...|$|R
