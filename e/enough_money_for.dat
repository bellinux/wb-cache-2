5|$|By 1896 {{the family}} had hit another period of {{financial}} trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe {{with his mother and}} older brother Archie until there was <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother how to shoot. After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|The Glebe's {{profits were}} barely enough for Breckinridge's growing family. His legal career {{provided}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> some comforts but required {{long hours and}} difficult work. Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge, and John Marshall both referred clients to him {{and asked him to}} represent his own clients in his absence. Though still interested in politics, Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people's support. He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed with much of the proposed U.S. constitution, but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary. Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend, Archibald Stuart, he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia's ratification convention.|$|E

5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} save up <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E
5|$|He {{was awarded}} the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> him to resign his curator {{position}} and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. For this work he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 {{under the direction of}} Professor J. D. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the Medical Research Council's System of Bacteriology. He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee {{was set up}} with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E

He applied for a commission in the Regular Army, and was re-commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Air Service, on 11 September 1920. On 25 September 1920, he married Mary Nicholson, whom he had known while at the University of Kansas.

Whitehead, Jr., who was born in 1926 and graduated from West Point in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{shoots a}} film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers from Outer Space would result in a box office success, and {{generate}} <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's stand-in for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism.

5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
