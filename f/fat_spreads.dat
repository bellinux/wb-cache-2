However, studies analyzing {{the effect of a}} combination of both in individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk are lacking. Therefore, this randomized, controlled, double-blind study investigated the effect of a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> enriched with two different doses of MCT {{and a special}} long-chain fatty acid-micronutrient combination on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight diabetic patients. Methods: Fifty-four patients received either a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> with 6 g/d MCT (MCT 30 %) or 1. 2 g/d (MCT 6 %). Forty-three completed the study. Analysis was performed according to the median of MCT intake (supplemented and foodderived MCT).

Results: Total MCT intake> 7 g/d (MCT> 7 group) significantly reduced waist circumference (WC) by 1. 81 ± 2. 69 cm, whereas ≤ 7 g/d MCT (MCT ≤ 7 group) increased WC by 0. 32 ± 3. 03 cm (p = 0. 027), which was supported by a change in waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (p = 0. 018). Fasting serum triglycerides (TG) increased in both groups over time due to dietary habits. In contrast, diabetic metabolic situation and urinary albumin excretion did not alter. Urinary pH differed significantly between groups after 12 weeks. Conclusion: An intake of> 7 g/d MCT reduced WC in overweight diabetics, whereas the increase in the intake of fatty acids may have worsened fasting TG. Therefore, the suitability of a fat for nutrient enrichment remains to be challenged, and further studies in low-fat matrices are desirable...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> enriched with vegetable oil sterols on plasma lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations. A randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with two consecutive periods of 8 weeks was conducted. 30 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia treated concurrently with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and 32 patients with type IIa primary hypercholesterolaemia with a total cholesterol concentration > 6. 5 mmol/l not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy were recruited from a hospital lipid clinic. The active treatment was a fortified <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> (25 g/day) providing 2. 5 g of plant sterols. The control spread was indistinguishable in taste and appearance. Comparison at the end of the two 8 -week trial periods showed a statistically significant reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol with use of the fortified spread but the results were confounded by a carry-over effect, which was partly explained by changes in the background diet. Because a carry-over effect was present, further analyses were restricted to the parallel arms of the first treatment period and were conducted on an intention to treat basis. After 4 weeks, LDL-cholesterol had decreased by 0. 04 mmol/l ([0. 8 %] 95 % confidence interval - 0. 44 - 0. 37 NS) in the placebo group and decreased by - 0. 76 mmol/l ([15. 0 %] 95 % CI - 1. 03 [...] 0. 48, P< 0. 0001) in the active treatment group. After 8 weeks, the corresponding results were 0. 0 mmol/l ([0. 0 %] 95 % CI - 0. 26 - 0. 24 NS) and - 0. 51 mmol/l ([10. 0 %] 95 % CI - 0. 73 [...] 0. 29 P< 0. 0001). There were no significant changes in apolipoprotein AI or B concentrations in the placebo group, but there was a small but statistically significant increase in apolipoprotein AI and a decrease in apolipoprotein B in the active treatment group. HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were unchanged. There was no difference in response between patients with statin-treated familial hypercholesterolaemia and patients with type IIa hyperlipoproteinaemia. We conclude that a fortified <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> enriched with vegetable oil sterols reduces LDL-cholesterol by 10 - 15 % with no difference in response between hypercholesterolaemic patients prescribed statins and those not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy...|$|R

50|$|Modern margarines can be {{made from}} any {{of a wide variety of}} animal or {{vegetable}} fats, mixed with skim milk, salt, and emulsifiers. Margarines and vegetable <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> found in the market can range from 10 to 90% fat. Depending on its final fat content and its purpose (spreading, cooking or baking), the level of water and the vegetable oils used vary slightly. The oil is pressed from seeds and refined. It is then blended with solid fat. If no solid fats are added to the vegetable oils, the latter undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The resulting blend is mixed with water, citric acid, carotenoids, vitamins and milk powder. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, and salt and preservatives are also commonly added.

Eight <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> containing 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % total fat were used; of these, four spreads were formulated using palm and flaxseed oils while the other four treatments were prepared by palm and soybean oils at the same concentrations. Results showed that <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> containing flaxseed oil exerted reducing effect on total cholesterol, LDL levels, TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios at higher rates compared with those containing soybean oil or pharmaceutical product especially after 8 weeks of feeding experiment. Levels of HDL in animals administered the studied <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> were lowered at significant to insignificant different rates. Flaxseed oil exerted its beneficial effect when it was incorporated into formulation at high amounts since G 6 (FPB 3, containing 29. 5 % flaxseed oil) and G 8 (FPB 4, containing 39 % flaxseed oil) animal groups exerted higher/comparative levels of HDL after 8 weeks of feeding compared to the initial concentration. Concerning triglycerides levels, all studied groups (except G 8, FPB 4) and controls showed significant higher levels at the end of feeding experiment compared to initial concentration.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of increased dietary intakes of ALA and EPA+DHA on a range of atherogenic risk factors. Design: This was a placebo-controlled, parallel study involving 150 moderately hyperlipidemic subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: 0. 8 or 1. 7 g EPA+DHA/d, 4. 5 or 9. 5 g ALA/d, or an n- 6 PUFA control for 6 mo.

40|$|Background: Greatly {{increasing}} dietary {{flaxseed oil}} [rich in the n- 3 {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} (PUFA) ?-linolenic acid (ALA) ] or fish oil [rich in the long-chain n- 3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids] can reduce markers of immune cell function. The effects of more modest doses are unclear, {{and it is not}} known whether ALA has the same effects as its long-chain derivatives. Objective: The objective was {{to determine the effects of}} enriching the diet with ALA or EPA+DHA on immune outcomes representing key functions of human neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Design: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study, 150 healthy men and women aged 25 – 72 y were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: placebo (no additional n- 3 PUFAs), 4. 5 or 9. 5 g ALA/d, and 0. 77 or 1. 7 g EPA+DHA/d for 6 mo. The n- 3 PUFAs were provided in 25 g <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> plus 3 oil capsules. Blood samples were taken at 0, 3, and 6 mo. Results: The fatty acid composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell phospholipids was significantly different in the groups with higher intakes of ALA or EPA+DHA. The interventions did not alter the percentages of neutrophils or monocytes engaged in phagocytosis of Escherichia coli or in phagocytic activity, the percentages of neutrophils or monocytes undergoing oxidative burst in response to E. coli or phorbol ester, the proliferation of lymphocytes in response to a T cell mitogen, the production of numerous cytokines by monocytes and lymphocytes, or the in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity response. Conclusion: An intake of 9. 5 g ALA/d or 1. 7 g EPA+DHA/d does not alter the functional activity of neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes, but it changes the fatty acid composition of mononuclear cells...|$|R
