5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because,</b> in the end, it's not really at all about domestic violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E
25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>because</b> the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey {{specifically}} to be the first black player in major league baseball. Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn't have time to get his full college education, and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>because</b> of those circumstances, he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson. I don't think he has gotten the credit he deserves." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writer and}} actor Mark Gatiss, paying tribute to Kneale on the BBC News Online website {{shortly after his}} death, {{indicated}} that {{he was among the}} first rank of British television writers, but that this had been overlooked. [...] "He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because</b> of a strange snobbery about fantasy or sci-fi it's never quite been that way." [...] Similarly, his obituary in The Guardian commented that: Kneale was {{by no means the only}} author to have been largely wasted by television, and to have seen his status overtaken by soap opera hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss, as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has said}} of his character: [...] "The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's {{wonderful}} about him as a character. It's why children like him, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Because</b> he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe." [...] In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with Orbital, and performed with them {{a version of the}} Doctor Who theme, at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the Olympic torch in Cardiff, an activity which was noted by Doctor Who fans for its resemblance to a 2006 episode of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} 2013 Christmas special.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because</b> I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, on the Charlie Rose show on PBS, Rose {{asked if}} South Korea {{might be an}} analogy of where Iraq might be, {{in terms of an}} American {{presence}}, over the next 20 to 25 years. McCain replied that he didn't think so – even if there were no (ongoing) casualties, saying [...] "I can see an American presence for a while. But eventually <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because</b> {{of the nature of the}} society in Iraq and the religious aspects of it that America eventually withdraws.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the novel}} explores the types of {{cultural}} ideologies, like nationalism and masculinity, that facilitated the War. Barker states that she chose to write about World War I [...] "because it's come to stand in for other wars, {{as a sort of}} idealism of the young people in August 1914 in Germany and in England. They really felt this was the start of a better world. And the disillusionment, the horror and the pain followed that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because</b> of that it's come to stand for the pain of all wars." [...] Critic Kaley Joyes argues that choices like the inclusion of the work by poet Wilfred Owen in the novel, whose life has been romanticised as [...] "an expressive exemplar of the war's tragic losses," [...] highlights this thematic interest in breaking down the common ideological interpretations of the war.|$|E
2500|$|The {{publisher}} explained its {{objective in}} a blog post accompanying the announcement about the jacket art: [...] "This new image [...] . . {{looks at the}} children {{at the center of}} the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahl’s writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life." [...] Additionally, Penguin Press's Helen Conford told the Bookseller: [...] "We wanted something that spoke about the other qualities in the book," [...] Penguin Press's Helen Conford told the Bookseller. [...] "It's a children's story that also steps outside children's and people aren't used to seeing Dahl in that way." [...] She continued: [...] " [...] a lot of ill feeling about it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because</b> it's such a treasured book and a book which isn't really a 'crossover book'" [...] As she acknowledged: [...] "People want it to remain as a children's book." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people thought I had a lot of wear and tear on me, too much, so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>because</b> of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

5000|$|In a press statement, Followill said of {{recording}} the debut EP, [...] "Coming together just worked. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's <b>because</b> we took such an easy approach to it, we didn't bring any egos to it.
