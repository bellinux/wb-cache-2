40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center, in {{collaboration}} with GE Aviation, has begun {{the development of a}} smart adaptive structure system with piezoelectric (PE) transducers to improve composite fan blade damping at resonances. Traditional resonant damping approaches may not be realistic for rotating frame applications such as engine blades. The limited space in which the blades reside in the engine makes it impossible to accommodate the circuit size required to implement passive resonant damping. Thus, a novel digital shunt scheme has been developed to replace the conventional <b>electric</b> <b>passive</b> shunt <b>circuits.</b> The digital shunt dissipates strain energy through the load resistor on a power amplifier. General Electric (GE) designed and fabricated a variety of polymer matrix fiber composite (PMFC) test specimens. Investigating the optimal topology of PE sensors and actuators for each test specimen has revealed the best PE transducer location for each target mode. Also a variety of flexible patches, which can conform to the blade surface, have been tested to identify the best performing PE patch. The active damping control achieved significant performance at target modes. This work has been highlighted by successful spin testing up to 5000 rpm of subscale GEnx composite blades in Glenn s Dynamic Spin Rig...|$|R

40|$|An {{intelligent}} control system {{has the ability}} to learn about its environment, process the information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and execute actions to either control or reduce to a minimum the undesired motion of all or some of its parts. It generally incorporates sensors, actuators, a controller and a power supply unit. Most of the previous work has focused on active control in which electric power is supplied to the actuators that exert actions on the host structure to suppress its vibrations. Alternatively, undesired mechanical energy of a host structure could be converted into electrical energy that can be dissipated through a set of resistor. This does not require an external power unit and is a more economical means of controlling vibrations of a structure, but an effective transduction of mechanical energy into electric energy has to be guaranteed. Such an effective transduction can be achieved imposing to the electric controller to be resonant at all the mechanical resonance frequencies, and to mimic all the mechanical modal shapes, i. e. to be the analog of the host structure.

30|$|The {{first and}} main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is introducing the exponential reproducing windows into Gabor sampling scheme and reducing the time domain modulation functions, constructed by appropriately weighted window sequences, to simple exponential functions. The time domain modulation functions of this study can avoid holding complicated function structures and intricate system functions, which are difficult to realize in real world. Any time domain response function from E-spline system could be defined as exponential reproducing function, the simplest one being E-spline itself [18]. Interestingly, with appropriate weighting coefficients, the exponential reproducing window sequences can be synthesized to a simple exponential function. It could be viewed as the impulse response representation of an exponential filter, which can be carried out with simple <b>passive</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> [19, 20]. For this study, we deduced the representation of the filter form of the time domain modulation functions in Gabor sampling scheme and chose the appropriate E-spline parameter vector α for guaranteeing the window positive real functions. Then, we constructed the measurement matrix for CS recovery and calculated each entry and proved that such measurement matrix has better coherence than that of DFT matrix. Hence, the measurement matrix satisfies the RIP, making it possible to recover the sparse Gabor coefficient matrix perfectly.|$|R
