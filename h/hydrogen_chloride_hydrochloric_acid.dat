5000|$|The {{hydrogen}} halides are diatomic molecules with no {{tendency to}} ionize {{in the gas}} phase (although liquified hydrogen fluoride is a polar solvent somewhat similar to water). Thus, chemists distinguish <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> from <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid.</b> The former is a gas at room temperature that reacts with water to give the acid. Once the acid has formed, the diatomic molecule can be regenerated only with difficulty, but not by normal distillation.

This study aims {{to analyse}} the {{influence}} of the pollution of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> which is the side effect of the leakage accident of a 50 m 3 phosphorus trichloride tank. When the leakage source intensity is 1. 06 kg/s with the leakage time of 30 minutes, and the distance is about 2700 m away from the highest allowable concentration (0. 05 mg/m 3) in air of residential areas, which goes beyond about the distance of 700 m over the "Comprehensive emission standard of air pollutants" (GB 16297 - 1996) table 2 (100 mg/m 3, new sources of pollution emission limits), however, the mean value of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration beyond 400 m is less than the that of IDLH (immediately dangerous to life or health concentration), and no half lethal concentration(LC 50) appears.

40|$|Monitoring the {{exposure}} of an employee to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> or <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> {{in the presence of}} other acids has been a challenge to the industrial hygiene community. The capability of a device to differentiate the levels of acid vapors would allow for more accurate determinations of exposure and therefore improved occupational health. In this work, a selective direct-read colorimetric badge system was validated for Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL) monitoring of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride.</b> The passive colorimetric badge system consists of a direct reading badge and a color scale. The badge has a coated indicator layer with a diffusive resistance in the shape of an exclamation mark. An exclamation mark will appear if <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is present in the atmosphere at concentrations at or above 2. 0 ppm. By using the color scale, the intensity of the color formed on the badge can be further quantified up to 25 ppm. The system was validated according to a protocol based on the NIOSH Protocol for the Evaluation of Passive Monitors. The badge was exposed to relative humidities ranging from 11 % to 92 %, temperatures ranging from 7 C to 400 C and air velocities ranging from 5 cm/sec to 170 cm/sec. All experiments were conducted in a laboratory vapor generation system. Hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, chlorine, hydrogen sulfide and organic acids showed no effect on the performance of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> monitoring system. The passive badge and color scale system exceeded the accuracy requirements as defined by NIOSH. At ambient conditions, the mean coefficient of variation was 10. 86 and the mean bias was 1. 3 %.
