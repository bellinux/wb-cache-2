5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>action</b> which {{physically}} {{connects the}} keys and the windchests is a mechanical or tracker action. Connection is achieved {{through a series of}} rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding tracker pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker <b>key</b> <b>action</b> on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 {{the organ}} was reconstructed by Henry WillisIII {{when the number}} of stops was {{increased}} to 120 and electro-pneumatic action introduced for the combination systems and some of the <b>key</b> <b>action.</b> Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some reed stops. In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 electric blowers remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.|$|E

500|$|An organ {{contains}} two actions, or systems of moving parts. When a key is depressed, the <b>key</b> <b>action</b> admits wind into a pipe. The stop action allows the organist to control which ranks are engaged. An action may be mechanical, pneumatic, or electrical (or {{some combination of}} these, such as electro-pneumatic action). [...] The <b>key</b> <b>action</b> is independent of the stop action, allowing an organ to combine a mechanical <b>key</b> <b>action</b> along with an electric stop action.|$|E

500|$|During the Romantic period, {{the organ}} became more symphonic, capable of {{creating}} a gradual crescendo. New technologies {{and the work of}} organ builders such as , Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and Henry Willis made it possible to build larger organs with more stops, more variation in sound and timbre, and more divisions. Enclosed divisions became common, and registration aids were developed {{to make it easier for}} the organist to manage the great number of stops. The desire for louder, grander organs required that the stops be voiced on a higher wind pressure than before. As a result, a greater force was required to overcome the wind pressure and depress the keys. To solve this problem, Cavaillé-Coll configured the English [...] "Barker lever" [...] to assist in operating the <b>key</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1857, Banks ran for Governor of Massachusetts {{against the}} {{incumbent}} Gardner. His nomination by the Republicans was contentious, with opposition coming primarily from radical abolitionist interests opposed to his comparatively moderate {{stand on the}} issue. After a contentious general election campaign Banks won a comfortable victory. [...] One <b>key</b> <b>action</b> Banks took {{in support of the}} antislavery movement was the dismissal of Judge Edward G. Loring. Loring had ruled in 1854 that Anthony Burns, a fugitive slave, be returned to slavery {{under the terms of the}} Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. [...] Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills of Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Loring's removal from his state office, but in both cases Gardner had declined to remove him. [...] Banks signed a third such bill in 1858. [...] He was rewarded with significant antislavery support, easily winning reelection in 1858.|$|E

2500|$|The organ {{was built}} by Henry Willis and {{completed}} in 1855 with 100speaking stops across four manual divisions (of non-standard compass, 63notes GG to a) and pedals (30notes). It comprised a total of 119ranks of pipes, plus 10couplers, 10composition pedals, and 36pistons to set combinations of stops. It was initially tuned to meantone temperament to the specification of S.S.Wesley but in 1867 W.T.Best, city organist, retuned it to equal temperament. [...] The organ was rebuilt in 1896 when the <b>key</b> <b>action</b> was changed from the Willis-Barker lever assisted tracker (i.e. pneumatic assisted mechanical) action to pneumatic action. Also the manual compass was changed to the now standard CC to c, 61notes, making the bottom 5pipes on every manual stop redundant.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of pneumatic and electro-pneumatic <b>key</b> <b>actions</b> {{in the late}} 19th century {{made it possible to}} locate the console independently of the pipes, greatly expanding the possibilities in organ design.
