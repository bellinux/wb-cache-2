"It's an {{illusion}} to believe himself {{active in the}} story. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> he's changing something, watching news programmes, or {{lying on his back}} on the sofa on Sunday afternoon, reading more opinion columns of ungrounded certainties, more long articles about what really lies behind this or that development, or what is surely going to happen next, predictions forgotten as soon as they are read, well before events disprove them?" [...] Physically, Perowne is neither above nor outside the fray but at an angle to it; emotionally his own intelligence makes him apathetic, he can see both sides of the argument, and his beliefs are characterised by a series of hard choices rather than sure certainties.|$|E
500|$|As Alfred Gough sees it, Lana is a {{by-product}} of Clark and Lex's decisions. She will always love Clark, and Clark will always love her, but it was Clark's bad decisions, and Lex's [...] "basest instincts" [...] that make Lana the [...] "receptacle {{of all of these}} bad decisions", marking her as a tragic figure on the show. While Lana was with Clark, Kreuk characterizes her as a [...] "wimpy, whiny kind of girl"; with Lex, Lana is [...] "strong, powerful, and doesn't have to question, 'What is going on? What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think?</b> Does he love me? I don't know where I stand.'" [...] To clarify, Lana's relationship with Lex brings out a darkness that had not been seen in the character. This is evident in [...] "Nemesis" [...] when Lana manipulates her way into seeing Lionel, only to interrogate him about why he forced her to marry Lex, as well as leaving Lex to die in the underground tunnels. As Gough explains, {{by the end of the}} sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own games.|$|E
500|$|Asked how <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> {{that the}} album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think it's timely and {{timeless}} {{at the same}} time, and I think that's {{one of the most}} difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

2500|$|Gareth Gates who has {{performed}} together with Siti during MTV Asia Awards 2004 {{when he was}} asked what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> about Siti, he said, [...] "She definitely has the looks and she certainly has the voice. If she continues to sing the way she does, she'll go really far." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2003, Tatchell {{acted as}} a press {{spokesman}} for {{the launch of the}} Zimbabwe Freedom Movement, which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that it might have been by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action. This speculation proved to be unfounded. The Mugabe regime dismissed the ZFM as a [...] "hoax." [...] However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film [...] "Peter Tatchell: Just who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> he is?" [...] by Max Barber.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas C. Drabick Jr. of Blacklick said in {{a letter}} to the editor {{published}} in The Dispatch [...] "He has unlimited and unfettered arrogance. Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> he works for? Clearly, he does not believe that he is responsible to the people of Ohio; otherwise, he would not seek to keep secrets from us." [...] The Dispatch agreed, editorializing that [...] "Government decisions made in secret aren't necessarily better decisions, they're just secret decisions. [...] Unfortunately, too many of Ohio's legislative leaders seem sold on the idea that keeping things hush-hush is good." [...] Nevertheless, the Senate passed Johnson's proposal, part of the state budget, over attempts by the Democratic minority to remove the language from the bill.|$|E

2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E
2500|$|By summer 572, both Zu and Mu Tipo were in {{conflict}} with Hulü Guang. [...] Hulü disliked Zu, and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals. [...] Once, when he was resting at a governmental building, Zu, who was blind, rode past him without realizing that Hulü was there, and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time. [...] Hulü angrily stated, [...] "Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> he is?" [...] Zu, realizing that Hulü disliked him, bribed Hulü's servant and asked the servant about Hulü's opinion of him. [...] The servant stated, [...] "Ever since you came into power, the Minister Prince each night sighed and stated, [...] "With a blind man in power, the empire will surely be destroyed." [...] Meanwhile, Mu had once requested to marry Hulü's daughter by a concubine, but Hulü refused. [...] Further, when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang, Hulü publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army's horses. [...] Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hulü. [...] They therefore fostered suspicion of Hulü in the emperor's mind, and that suspicion was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Hulü's daughter and Gao Wei's wife Empress Hulü was not favored by Gao Wei.|$|E

500|$|Many fans on the {{internet}} were hoping that the episode would reveal whether or not Mulder is Jewish. In the episode, however, Mulder is unable to identify a Jewish book, states that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know Hebrew, and quips that Jesus returned from the dead. When asked whether or not Mulder is Jewish, Gordon said that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> is, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "even half-Jewish". <b>He</b> <b>did,</b> however, note that [...] "there's something about David [...] that could be Jewish or that has a Jewish sensibility." ...|$|R
