Downsizings, mergers, and acquisitions are examples of radical organizational responses, stemming from increased global competition, improvements in technology, and government deregulation. These organizational responses are intended to improve a firm's financial position; however, these actions need support from employees in order to become successful change strategies. Human resources practitioners can provide support, develop and implement training, and communicate information throughout these change events. The <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>unit</b> or organization, unlike those of accounting and finance, does not have a clearly defined list of tasks and roles for the due diligence of mergers and acquisitions. Rather, the strategic and intervention roles of HR must be improved or modified through lessons learned during these chaotic events. The roles of human resources tend to be situational and are highly dependent on the business context of the respective organization. This study investigates the various roles that human resource organizations assume when a firm is involved in downsizings, mergers, and/or acquisitions. Perspectives were gathered from human resource practitioners who had experienced downsizings, mergers, and/or acquisitions.

40|$|This paper {{takes its}} cue from Stronach and MacLure (1997) {{and hopes to}} be more problem-generating than problem-solving. We {{do not want to}} set down a ‘how to do {{collaborative}} research’, but instead explore the methodological and political complexities of doing collaborative research with industry partners. In doing this we want {{to draw attention to the}} uncertainties and messy ‘business’ of collaborative research. We are particularly interested in exploring the political tensions around the co-production of knowledge and we ask ‘how might we use research methodologies that incorporate uncertainty and disruption while at the same time remaining credible and legitimate to our research partners and academics?’ We recognise that a ‘methodology of disappointment’, where the ‘comforts of certainty’ are abandoned (Stronach & MacLure, 1997), may not have the same appeal to our industry partners as it does within our research team. And not always do academics enjoy uncertainty! We explore these themes and questions by taking a reflexive look at our own research practice in a collaborative research project that is currently underway in Australia. Government views on the relationship between research and economic activity are driving changes in research funding arrangements in Australia (Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson MP, 2002). The increase in collaborative research partnerships between universities and industry, as well as an increasing pressure on universities to view their work in commercial terms are evidence of these changes. In these performative times we are told we need to be ‘entrepreneurs’ (Gallagher, 2000) and the commodification of education requires that researchers learn how to play a new game. But does playing the game mean we need to automatically ‘tow the corporate line’ in collaborative partnerships with industry? Stronach and MacLure (1997) suggest that ‘it may be possible to envisage new concepts and practices of research that do not simply surrender to…the general demands of performativity’ (Stronach & MacLure, 1997, p. 100). Luke (1995) writes about a ‘pragmatic politics of the postmodern’ and recommends that it is time to start ‘getting our hands dirty’. Scheeres & Solomon (2000) point out that one way of doing this is to recognise the research methodology as ‘a site of contention’ where a number of different positions can be taken up by researchers. We are interested in this paper in exploring the ways knowledge is being co-produced in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project and the contested nature of this knowledge production. We adopt an understanding of power, where we are more interested in the way power relations have been negotiated in the project and the spaces this has opened up, rather than assuming that industry is all-powerful. But before exploring the ‘sites of struggle’ of the project and the spaces that have been opened up, we take a closer look at collaborations in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project. The ‘Uncovering Learning’ project involves many layers of collaborative partnerships. The project is a three-year Australian Research Council funded project which is part of the strategic partnerships with industry – research and training (SPIRT) program. The project involves a research partnership between the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) and the Department of Education and Training (DET), a state government department. DET and UTS are working collaboratively to explore the significance of everyday learning at work. The workplace being studied is TAFE NSW, the state government provider of vocational education and training in NSW. But rather than focusing on TAFE as an educational institution our interest in this project is on TAFE as a workplace. TAFE is a large organisation and employs approximately 35, 000 people in NSW. As well as the partnership between UTS and DET, the research team present as another layer of collaboration. The research team could be described as a ‘cross-boundary’ group, as members come from both inside and outside of TAFE, as well as across various disciplines including adult education, applied linguistics, psychology and organisational behaviour. The team is made up of two senior researchers from UTS, a DET representative who works in the Professional Development Network at TAFE, a research associate and a doctoral student. The research interests of the team members vary and this has contributed to the opening up of project questions and connections beyond the focus of just one discipline. In this sense, we (the research team) could be thought of as the embodiment of the theoretical and knowledge worlds we are studying in the project. The research team is working collaboratively with four workgroups in TAFE and this illustrates yet another layer of collaboration. The four workgroups that we are working with in the project come from diverse occupational areas and diverse hierarchical levels across two institutes in TAFE. One group are senior level managers in an institute, another are trade teachers, another group works in a <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>unit</b> performing mainly administrative functions and the final group provide business related training in the workplace. While these are the most obvious collaborations, there are many other layers of collaboration connected with the project. For example collaborations between the research team and: the Faculty of Education at UTS; the Research Office; and the Australian Research Council. There are also layers within layers of collaboration, for example the two senior researchers in the project are the academic supervisors of the PhD student. The contemporary research context and the interrelated layering and multiplicities associated with collaborative partnerships begin to ‘flag’ the political complexities of doing collaborative research. These are foregrounded when we ask: What’s in it for UTS? What’s in it for TAFE? What are the interests of each of the members of the research team? What do the Professional Development Network want from this? What are the interests of each of the workgroup members who are collaborating on the project? The ‘political’ refers to both the macro politics of government policy and the local politics of research teams and workgroups and the alignments between these. We will explore the political complexities of collaborative partnerships further by focusing on some of the ‘sites of struggle’ in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project. There is pressure on researchers to produce output-driven knowledge in the contemporary research context (Usher, 2000). The research contract between UTS and DET provides an example of the type of output-driven knowledge that is required in partnership arrangements. For example, the contract states that UTS will provide their industry partner with the following research outcomes: •	Improved recognition of the learning to be found in the organisation, to the benefit of both the organisation and individual employees. •	Improved understanding by key personnel in the organisations of the ways in which organisational culture and procedures encourage or inhibit learning, and the issues which need to be resolved in developing the learning organisation. •	Improved learning systems and learning strategies in the organisation that will more effectively facilitate learning embedded in practice. But rather than providing just a straight ‘outcomes’ focus for the project we have attempted to reconcile the performative contractual obligations with our own research interests and desires. In this sense, the methodology of the project becomes a ‘site of struggle’. Various ‘openings’ have been created in the project to move it beyond a performative focus. One way we have done this is by disrupting conventional educational discourses of learning. Stronach and MacLure suggest that rather than providing certainty through educational research that a better strategy might be ‘…to see how far it can get by failing to deliver simple truths’ (1997, p. 6). While they are referring to commissioned research for the development of educational policy by government, we can see that this is also a useful way for approaching industry contracted research in the field of workplace learning. While contemporary adult learning discourses such as lifelong learning and situated learning have contributed to breaking down the old binaries between work and learning, these discourses do not challenge performative notions of what counts as learning in organisations. We are interested in mobilising the meanings of ‘learning’ and opening up different ways of thinking about learning at work. The above discussion suggests a unified purpose within the research team, however, the cross-boundary nature of the research team has meant a multiplicity of interests and desires. We have different ideas on what the project should be doing and what we want out of the project. But rather than adopting a research methodology based on consensus, with unified research goals and objectives, we have tried to open-up space in the project for a multiplicity of voices, identities, meanings and narratives (Rooney, Boud, Harman, Leontios, & Solomon, 2003). Having said this, we have still followed the established model of research where researchers: enter the workplace, collect data, analyse the data, and report the findings to our research partner, academic communities and other relevant agencies. But within this structure we have disrupted and made space for different voices. For example there have been different ways of analysing and making sense of the data we have collected. One version adopted an interpretive approach and examined the ‘who we learn from at work’ (Boud & Middleton). Another focused on the discourses of learning and explored the ‘naming of learning at work’ (Boud & Solomon, 2003). Still others used a communities of practice framework (Leontios, Boud, Harman, & Rooney, 2003). There are many examples from the project of the contested nature of co-produced knowledge. Some of these are referred to in other papers from the project (Rooney et al., 2003; Solomon, Boud, Leontios, & Staron, 2001) while many just do not get written up. Some project stories remain unwritten and only circulate in oral accounts. This is yet another instance of negotiating the political, where some things just can’t be written. While wanting to disrupt and challenge, there is also the recognition that the members of the research team have ‘business’ interests. For example, the academics are in the business of research where there is a need for ongoing contracts with industry partners, and this is less likely when you are using a ‘methodology of disappointment’! The tensions around ‘disrupting’, ‘contesting’ and ‘resisting closure’ in the ‘Uncovering Learning’ project were foregrounded in the project during feedback sessions with the workgroups. After conducting initial interviews with members from each of the workgroups, feedback sessions were organised to move the project into its second stage, where we would be working with each of the workgroups on a ‘learning’ project. A document was prepared which we presented to the workgroups, not as a document of ‘facts’, but more as a trigger for conversations about their learning. In this sense it was a document that raised questions rather than provide simple truths. It was around this time that dissatisfaction was expressed by some of the workgroups about the project. They felt it was vague and lacked direction. The hybridity and looseness of the project needed to be ‘tightened up’ for us to establish legitimacy with the workgroups. We made a strategic decision to present a coherent story to each of the workgroups in an effort to seduce. It is important to recognise that when we talk about collaborative partnerships as sites of struggle it is not as simple as drawing an academy/industry divide. Further complexity is added when we take into consideration that one of the ‘we’ writing this paper is also an employee of the partner organisation and representative of the industry partner on the research team. There are struggles around managing the outcomes focus required by your employer while not wanting to restrict the ‘intellectual freedom’ of project team members. Overall, our reflexive tales point to the political nature of collaborative research. Collaborative partnerships connect multiple stakeholders with different accountabilities. The ‘multiplicities’ within collaborative research produce messiness and uncertainty, but with this ‘messiness’ there is also regulation. This account of the project draws our attention to the tensions around ‘messiness’, hybrid methodologies and regulation, and these tensions provide yet another layer of political complexity. While the messy research of our collaborative partnership may produce discomfort, for both industry partners and academics, we suggest they are productive. Our hybrid methodology/s have enabled the opening-up of spaces in the research project and the production of knowledge about learning, and researching learning at work. Our reflexivity has enabled us to explore the tensions around co-producing knowledge. We have found these practices ‘useful’ in our performative research context...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} dissertation {{examines the}} approach {{taken by the}} Land Registry to integrate a strategic approach to <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Management since the launch of Strategic Management Initiative in 1994 and Delivering Better Government in 1996. In particular it examines the role and re-orientation of the <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>unit</b> in the Land Registry {{to take account of}} more developmental and strategic focus as envisaged in the Civil Service Modernisation Programme. The methodology chosen for this dissertation is a case study methodology. The case study method is a qualitative approach, which is found useful for social science research and studies. The case study method will allowed me to look in depth at a complex and single instance phenomenon in the Land Registry. I will analyse the Land Registry's <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practices critically and {{determine the extent to which}} the <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> activities are integrated and aligned with the strategic needs of the organisation. A multi-method approach using both primary and secondary research data was used in this dissertation. The launch of the Strategic Management Initiative in 1994 set the scene for reform in the civil service with significant emphasis on developing greater strategic capacity for departments to help the government facilitate economic and social development. The policy document Delivering Better Government in 1996 sought to develop this capability further by setting out the vision and road map for change in the civil service. It proposed reforms consistent with matching the skills of individuals with the needs of departments, and the creation of a more flexible workforce. In particular the Delivering Better Government proposed a number of reforms for <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Management in the Irish Civil Service such as developing greater autonomy and responsibility for HR units, reorienting HR unit's activities and focus to take a more strategic/developmental approach and devolve responsibility for day-to-day <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> issues to line management. The development by each department of a <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategy linked to the overall strategy for the organisation and reforming arrangements for the recruitment, placement, tenure, promotion and development of staff was also proposed. It can be concluded from the research that an overall strategic management framework in which <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Management can evolve is in place within the Land Registry. However, in terms of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> policy and practices, there has been only been individual development and innovations, rather than a more integrated strategic approach to <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Management. However, the Land Registry like all civil service departments must adhere to centralised policy. This is creating a lack of flexibility to recruit and retain competent staff and deal with under-performance. There is evidence among those interviewed for a considerable level of continuing commitment for change. However, within the Irish Civil Service, an often repeated criticism of Strategic Management Initiative and Delivering Better Government is that it has lead to reform fatigue. It is therefore important that the <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>unit</b> in the Land Registry identify, support and communicate the case for civil service reform and modernisation...|$|R

Also, absenteeism from school or class always has detrimental effects on the students’ academic performance and attitudinal development.

Despite the legislative stipulations that seek to promote equitable access to participation in the creation, development and sharing of the South African economy and natural resources through the establishment of a workplace environment conducive for learning to take place, little is known on how Tumela Mine implements mentoring programmes to foster effective <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> development. The study explored and analysed participants’ perceptions regarding the implementation of the Tumela Mine Mentoring Programme. The research was conducted {{through the use of a}} case study approach, and primary data was collected from respondents, and secondary data was gathered from relevant policies, minutes of meetings and company annual reports. The research questioned the successful aspects in the <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Development <b>unit,</b> challenges and management’s responses to impediments to the implementation of mentoring programmes at Tumela Mine. The findings indicate that two key issues to improve implementation of mentoring programmes at the Tumela Mine are a transformational style of management and strategic repositioning of the mentoring programmes. The research argues that although company corporate strategic policy formulation and planning seek to promote equal participation of all employees in mentoring relationships, programme interventions at an operational level make it difficult to promote mentoring programmes. The key recommendation is that in order to implement effective mentoring programmes the company should review the corporate business strategy focused on strategic repositioning of mentoring programmes and inspire visionary leadership to implement a transformational style of management...|$|R

It is deem crucial to identify the adoption of knowledge management initiative in Malaysian commercial banks particularly on Procurement and Empowerment of knowledge; Training and Mentorship; Communication; and Incentives. A survey employing questionnaires was carried out involving all 10 domestic commercial banks focussing on <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Management <b>units.</b> Procurement and empowerment of knowledge (four aspects), training and mentorship (six aspects), communication (three aspects), and incentives (two aspects) were examined. It is evident that knowledge management practices do exist in all of the investigated aspects. The study reveals that banks do procure and utilise knowledge from their industrial associations, competitors, customers, and suppliers and also encourage staff to pursue education by giving incentives such as reimburse the fees for job-related courses. With respect to communication, written documents such as training manuals, job procedures and practices, and articles depicting organizational knowledge are addressed. In addition, financial and non-financial incentives are also practiced which indicate that incentives are also within the concern. It is believed, this study would motivate banks in Malaysia to acknowledge the knowledge management initiative as a new activity to embark on...|$|R

Method: Epidemiological cross-sectional study undertaken at three Non-Hospital Emergency Units. The data were collected using systematic observation, registered daily in a spreadsheet and checklist, and analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results: the generation of waste varied from 0. 087 to 0. 138 kg per patient per day. Waste management showed inadequacies in all stages, especially in the separation stage. Infectious waste was found together with common waste, preventing recycling, and piercing and cutting objects were mixed with waste from different groups, increasing the risk of occupational accidents. Conclusion: the study reveals {{the lack of an}} institutional waste management policy, as demonstrated by the failure of operational stages, involving problems related to management, physical structure, material and <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> at the <b>units.</b> This is relevant for health care units, considering the quality of patient care and its interface with sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nowadays <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Management {{issues are}} highly {{related to the}} {{strategic}} approach (Analoui, 2007; Daft, 2008; Becker, Huselid & Beatty, 2009; Jackson, Schuler & Werner, 2009). Workforce is considered as an asset and HRM is required to match human capital with organization strategic purposes. HRM practices have accordingly evolved to better fulfil this requirement through for instance Competency Modelling (CM) (Werbel & De Marie, 2005). Diagnosis: This communication illustrates a specific CM validation process in a wide Public Administration. Through a “one-size-fits-all” competency model approach (Mansfield, 1996), the HRM department of this Public Administration has developed a set of 29 transverse competencies broken down across 290 behavioural indicators. After several in-house pre-validation steps (workshops and test cases), <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> Development <b>Unit</b> of University of Liege was invited to collaborate to the final validation process. Solution: Based on Van Beirendonck (2006) CM validation criteria, a two steps validation method was jointly developed. Four main criteria were used, therefore each behavioural indicator ought to : (1) meet various organizational departments needs; (2) be clearly understood within the organization (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004); (3) have a straight link with its belonging competency and (4) be observable. A questionnaire survey (n= 252) was drawn up to appraise the first three criteria and quantitative analysis results provided the CM improvement framework. The concluding validation stage assessed the three last criteria by measuring Subject Matter Experts (HR managers responsible for staff evaluation) interrater agreement {{in order to improve}} CM content validity (Sanchez & Levine, 2009). Finding: Results comfortably confirm CM content validation under the four criteria. One of the project’s more relevant elements is developing a scientifically based method adapted to wide administration organizational features and constraints. In contrast, this CM validation project presents some limitations in relation to the CM theoretical concept (ambiguous concept in its validation perspective) and to organizational constraints (lack of strategic project concerning the use of the CM). Method and outcomes will be discussed in connection with the customer’s requirements and the constraints from the organizational context. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In Spain, the {{political}} efforts {{to eliminate the}} gender gap in the labour market have crystallised with {{the enactment of the}} Law 3 / 2007, 22 March on effective equality between women and men. However, despite the inclusion of gender issues in {{the political}} agenda, there is evidence that occupational sex segregation remains a significant barrier toward gender equality, in particular, in the Spanish advertising sector. Given that advertising speech has a great potential in fostering egalitarian attitudes in our society, it is necessary to make research focused on achieving the full gender equality between the advertising professionals (the creators of these messages). With this background, this article attempts to analyse if there is a disguised form of sexism (neosexism) that could impede advertising women’s upward mobility and could concentrate them in activities related to their gender roles. Thus, the aim of this study, focusing on gender, is to examine the neosexist attitudes of a sample of 753 Spanish advertising employees. Our results indicate that, in line with previous findings, men scored significantly higher than women on the Neosexism scale. However, there was little observed absolute separation of neosexist attitudes between males and females. It would be necessary, as a future line of research, to analyse if there are gender-biased methods in the <b>Human</b> <b>Resources</b> Selection <b>Units</b> that could exclude women from advertising decision-making positions and from departments like creative services. This study {{is part of a larger}} project, “The woman in the advertising industry”, supported by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Spanish National Women’s Agency) (ref. i+d+i 1 / 03) to the second author...|$|R
