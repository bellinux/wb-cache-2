50|$|In sprint <b>hurdle</b> {{races for}} men, {{regardless}} {{of the length of}} the race, the first <b>hurdle</b> is 13.72 m from the starting line and the distance between <b>hurdles</b> is 9.14 m. In sprint <b>hurdle</b> races for women, the first <b>hurdle</b> is 13 m from the starting line and the distance between <b>hurdles</b> is 8.5 m. In long <b>hurdle</b> events, whether for men or women, the first <b>hurdle</b> is 45 m from the starting line and the distance between <b>hurdles</b> is 35 m. Most races which are shorter than the standard distance (such as indoor races) are simply run over fewer <b>hurdles</b> but use the same distances from the starting line. There are variations on <b>hurdle</b> height and spacing for the age groups of athletes competing. See Masters athletics (track and field) and Youth athletics.|$|R
5|$|Track {{and field}} events {{are divided into}} three broad categories: track events, field events, and {{combined}} events. The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (or event type) {{with the aim of}} perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and—in the case of the <b>hurdling</b> and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team member {{at the end of a}} certain distance.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the hurdles}} events, the steeplechase race {{is the other}} track and field event with obstacles. Just as the <b>hurdling</b> events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student {{competition}} in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500m and 4000m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked {{the rise of the}} 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance coming in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Former Florida International University athlete Ronald Forbes {{participated in}} the men's 110meters hurdles event {{on behalf of the}} Cayman Islands. His {{participation}} in the Beijing Olympics marked his debut at the Olympic games. Forbes' qualification in the hurdle event made him the first British Virgin Islander to participate in Olympic <b>hurdling.</b> While at the Olympics, Forbes was placed in Heat 3 of the 17 August first round in the event against, among others, Colombia's Paulo Villar and Barbadian Ryan Brathwaite, who scored first and second in the heat. Forbes ranked fifth out of eight with a time of 13.59seconds; he was 0.06seconds behind China's Shi Dongpeng and 0.13seconds ahead of Puerto Rico's Hector Cotto Gonzalez. Overall, Forbes tied Russia's Igor Peremota for 19th place out of 43 athletes. He progressed to the second round on 19 August, where he was placed in Heat 4 against France's Ladji Doucoure and American David Oliver. He again ranked fifth out of eight with a time of 13.72seconds. Overall, Forbes ranked 26th out of 32 athletes, and did not progress to semifinals.|$|E

5|$|The IAAF ratifies {{track and}} field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first {{published}} a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, <b>hurdling</b> and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes {{were made in the}} late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in {{track and field}}, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} Thursday, 22 April, United hosted their longtime rivals, Red Bull New York. Broadcast on ESPN2, it was United's first televised {{match on}} the network this year. In the 12th minute of play, a Luke Rodgers cross to Red Bulls striker, Thierry Henry led to the first goal for New York. Henry scored his third goal of the season, and {{the second of the}} match in the 38th minute of play, doubling New York's lead. Heading into halftime, Olsen replaced club captain, McCarty in for DP, Branko Bošković at halftime. Bošković, praised for his play in the match, had two shots on goal that were deflected off of the crossbar. In the 64th minute, Bošković sent a free kick <b>hurdling</b> towards the upper right post, only to be denied by the crossbar. Throughout a majority of the second half United dominated the Red Bulls in possession, but failed time and time again to score. A counterattack in the 72nd minute, led by Estonian international, Joel Lindpere gave New York a 3–0 advantage over United. Subsequently, Bošković had his third shot on goal deflect off the bar. American prospect, Juan Agudelo netted in injury time for the Red Bulls, giving the club a 4–0 win over United. The loss for United was their worst ever home loss against New York, and their worst loss at home since 2005, when the team lost 4–0 to Chicago Fire in an MLS Cup quarterfinal leg.|$|E

5000|$|A modern <b>hurdle</b> {{will fall}} over if a runner hits it. There is no penalty for hitting a <b>hurdle</b> (provided {{this is not}} judged deliberate). The {{misconception}} is based on old rules before the <b>hurdles</b> were weighted. In the 1932 Olympics, Bob Tisdall famously won the Olympic Gold medal in the 400 metre <b>hurdles</b> in World Record time, but was not credited with the record due to knocking over a <b>hurdle.</b> There can be disqualification if a hurdler knocks a <b>hurdle</b> into an opponents lane and it is judged to have interfered with the opponent's ability to run the race. There are now specifications for the tipping weight of a <b>hurdle</b> (the weights need to be adjusted to correspond with {{the height of the}} <b>hurdle)</b> so hitting a <b>hurdle</b> theoretically slows down the rhythm of the hurdler. However, pushing the <b>hurdle</b> with one's hands or running out of one's lane as a result of hitting the <b>hurdle</b> is cause for disqualification. While hitting <b>hurdles</b> is not generally considered desirable, a few sprint hurdlers have succeeded despite knocking over many <b>hurdles.</b> Contact with <b>hurdles</b> can decrease speed and also result in disruption of a hurdler's technique. Some coaches suggest if you lightly [...] "kiss" [...] the <b>hurdle</b> with the side of the leg closest to the <b>hurdle,</b> it can help with the runners speed by keeping the runner closer to the ground.|$|R

25|$|A {{member of}} Pembrokeshire Harriers and then Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club, Omoregie {{took part in}} {{athletics}} from a young age {{and focused on the}} combined track and field events. Born in Durham, England, both his parents emigrated from Nigeria at age twenty. In 2011 his father died of cancer shortly after his sister had died in a car crash. Omoregie focused on athletics and his schoolwork as a tribute to them and received five A stars in his GCSEs that year. He was the Welsh youth champion in the pentathlon in 2012 then won the English indoor junior championship in the men's heptathlon in 2013. That year he began to focus more on his best event – sprint <b>hurdling.</b> At the 2013 European Athletics Junior Championships he set a best of 13.45 seconds for the junior 110m hurdles in qualifying before placing fifth in the final. He was Welsh junior champion in the hurdles and also runner-up at the English junior championship. His <b>hurdling</b> talents invited comparisons to Colin Jackson, a former world champion and member of the same Cardiff club.|$|E
5000|$|The idea {{of using}} 27-inch (68.6 cm) <b>hurdles</b> was {{introduced}} in Europe in 2000. The increment does not exist on standard <b>hurdles,</b> which caused resistance from some NGBs, but the rules were adopted worldwide. [...] Many modern <b>hurdles</b> will not go to that height or would at least require modification to cut the <b>hurdle.</b> Most facilities that have spent {{thousands of dollars to}} buy regulation <b>hurdles</b> would certainly not let their <b>hurdles</b> be damaged like this. Since it is a requirement, major championship meets have purchased a few sets of modern modified <b>hurdles,</b> which then creates the logistical problem of shipping these few <b>hurdles</b> between meets in order for the competitors {{to have an opportunity to}} race over proper <b>hurdles.</b> As a substitute, many older <b>hurdle</b> designs are easier to modify to get to the proper height and most facilities are less protective of the old, rusty <b>hurdles</b> in the junk pile. Also many training <b>hurdles</b> (used to teach smaller, youth beginners) will go to 27 inches and lower.|$|R
50|$|Other {{distances}} are run, particularly indoors {{but occasionally}} outdoors. The sprint <b>hurdle</b> race indoors is usually 60 meters {{for both men}} and women, although races 55 meters or 50 meters long are sometimes run, especially in the United States. A 60-meter indoor race is run over 5 <b>hurdles.</b> A shorter race may occasionally have only 4 <b>hurdles.</b> Outdoors, a long <b>hurdle</b> race is sometimes shortened to 300 meters for younger participants, who run over 8 <b>hurdles.</b> For example, high school and middle school athletes in California and Pennsylvania run the 300 meter <b>hurdles</b> instead of running the 400 meter <b>hurdles,</b> like what the majority of state competitors run today. These <b>hurdles</b> are spaced distance-wise identical to the beginning of a standard 400 meter race which would have 10 <b>hurdles.</b> There are also 200 meter races for middle school and younger divisions over 5 <b>hurdles</b> (spaced in the same position as the last 5 <b>hurdles</b> of a standard 400 meter race).|$|R
50|$|Women also do the 300 <b>hurdles,</b> W50 to W65 {{divisions}}. Like the men, the W50 and W55 divisions do 30-inch <b>hurdles,</b> W60 and W65 do 27-inch <b>hurdles,</b> and W70+ do the 200-metre version over 27-inch <b>hurdles.</b>|$|R
