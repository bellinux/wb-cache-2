40|$|<b>Discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> {{health status}} {{is a serious}} problem in China, which {{influences}} the fundamental rights of millions of people. This thesis mainly discusses the nature, characteristics and reasons of <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status in China. As a contextual and socio-legal study, this thesis employs doctrinal, empirical, historical, international & comparative law methods to provide a comprehensive and in-depth study <b>on</b> tackling <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status in China. It is among the earliest researches that focus on the specific topic of <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status in China. This thesis argues that various factors are responsible for continuing <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status in China. Particularly, the fragmentary, incomplete, ambiguous and conflicting legislation, the ineffective, arbitrary and bureaucratic administration, the dependant and ineffective judiciary, the less active nongovernmental actors, and other relevant political, economic, medical and cultural factors, interact with one another to cause continuing discrimination. To pursue this argument, first, the thesis clarifies the necessity to prohibit <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status by analysing relevant definitions and theories of such discrimination. Second, the thesis explores how <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status has been tackled in international law and domestic law in various other jurisdictions, in order to reveal international responsibility China should bear and foreign lessons China can learn. Third, the thesis examines how <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status has been tackled in Chinese history and reality to understand why such discrimination remains serious today. Fourth, the thesis discusses findings of the author’s fieldwork <b>on</b> tackling <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status in China to investigate the effectiveness of the current anti-discrimination regime. Based on the above analyses, the thesis finally concludes the main reasons for continuing <b>discrimination</b> based <b>on</b> health status in China and proposes a more effective antidiscrimination regime in China to prohibit such discrimination...|$|R

This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them.
