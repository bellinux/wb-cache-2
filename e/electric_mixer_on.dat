25|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{a kitchen}} {{appliance}} used for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It typically {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. The first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was invented by Rufus M. Eastman in 1885. U.S. patent #330,829 for the first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was filed by Eastman on March 6, 1885, and issued on November 17, 1885.|$|R

5000|$|The first <b>mixer</b> with <b>electric</b> motor {{is thought}} to be the one invented by American Rufus Eastman in 1885. [...] The Hobart Manufacturing Company was an early {{manufacturer}} of large commercial mixers, and they say a new model introduced in 1914 {{played a key role in}} the mixer part of their business. The Hobart KitchenAid and Sunbeam Mixmaster (first produced 1910) were two very early US brands of <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> Domestic <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> were rarely used before the 1920s, when they were adopted more widely for home use.|$|R
50|$|When {{selecting}} a mixer, the purchaser should {{consider how the}} mixer will be used. <b>Electric</b> <b>mixers</b> with more speed options give the user {{more control over the}} development of the mixture.|$|R
50|$|For the dough, most {{versions}} {{still use}} 19th century ingredients such as potassium carbonate and ammonium carbonate as leavening agents {{to get the}} sticky and dense consistency of the original mixture. It is then either kneaded by hand or {{through the use of}} an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{prepare an}} Angel Delight dessert, a single 59 g packet of dessert powder {{is added to}} a bowl {{containing}} 300 ml of milk. This is then whisked, either by hand, or with an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer,</b> until the dessert is smooth and creamy, and left for approximately five minutes to set.|$|R
50|$|With <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> {{and food}} {{processors}} commonly available in most household kitchens, {{people can make}} butter {{in their own homes}} without a large churn. These small appliances are used to mix the cream until it is close to forming solid butter. This mixture is then mixed by hand to remove the buttermilk and water.|$|R
30|$|The {{petroleum}} coke particles, deionized water, one additive and moderate HCl or NaOH were mixed with an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> at 1000  r/min for 10  min {{to form a}} PCWS sample. With each additive, PCWSs were prepared at four different pH values (i.e., pH 5, 7, 9 and 11). The pH values were measured by using an E 200 Portable pH Meter (Mont, China).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the General Electric Co. sent Hach an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer,</b> which she used on her {{television}} {{show for the}} first time. When she {{put it into a}} bowl of egg whites, eggs were spattered everywhere. She said, [...] "It was just funny. They thought {{it was supposed to be}} funny...the show was such fun and such a fiasco".|$|R

50|$|Wet grinder {{consists}} of granite stones which rotate inside a metal drum {{with the help}} of an electric motor and the food grains get crushed between the stone and drum. Wet grinders have two advantages over <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> or blenders. First, the stone grinder generates less heat than a mixer and heat affects the flavor of the food. Second, the stones remain sharp for a greater time than do metal blades.|$|R
5000|$|For the hour-long season 1 episode, [...] "Try to Remember," [...] {{originally}} {{broadcast on}} February 9, 1987, ALF tries to simulate a jacuzzi by bringing Kate's <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> into the bathtub, thus receiving an electrical shock that caused amnesia. Fusco ended the original episode {{with a public}} service announcement from ALF himself, warning of the dangers from mixing water and electricity. Despite this, NBC reported that a child attempted to recreate the scenario and nearly electrocuted himself in the process (Fusco confirmed {{that the child was}} unharmed); Fusco was forced to refilm the opening sequence, replacing the <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> with a manual egg beater. ALF's amnesia is instead caused by a cranial concussion received after slipping in the shower (a [...] "thud" [...] is heard rather than a [...] "zap"), with all mentions of being shocked either overdubbed with new dialogue or deleted entirely (including ALF's public service announcement). This edited version was utilized for a Fall 1988 rebroadcast, as well as all future U.S. and Canadian syndicated airings.|$|R

40|$|The gain {{bandwidth}} of NbN hot-electron bolometer terahertz <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> electrically thin Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 membranes was experimentally {{investigated and}} {{compared with that}} of HEB <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> bulk substrates. A gain bandwidth of 3. 5 GHz is achieved on bulk silicon, whereas the gain bandwidth is reduced down to 0. 6 – 0. 9 GHz for <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> 1. 5 um Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 membranes. We show that application of a MgO buffer layer on the membrane extends the gain bandwidth to 3 GHz. The experimental data were analyzed using the film-substrate acoustic mismatch approach...|$|R
