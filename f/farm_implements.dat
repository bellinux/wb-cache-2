25|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries shipbuilders {{sought out}} the odd angular {{branches}} to make special joints. Pioneers moving west would harvest small amounts for making <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> and wagon wheels, but the greatest impact was the wholesale clearing of oak woodlands to erect sprawling cities such as San Diego and San Francisco. The irregular shape often let the tree escape widespread harvest for building timbers, and also led the early settlers to endow the coast live oak with mystical qualities. Its stateliness has made it a subject of historical landscape painters throughout California modern history since the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately, he {{realized}} that he was ruining his life, and took up new interests. He began to draw. Then he took up blacksmithing, so he could repair the iron <b>farm</b> <b>implements</b> that had recently been introduced to the area. Self-taught as usual, he made his own tools, forge and bellows. He was soon doing a good business either repairing items or selling items he had created himself. His spurs and bridle bits were in great demand because he liked to decorate them with silver. Although he maintained his store, he not only stopped drinking but stopped selling alcohol.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, such {{socially}} responsible forestry {{was encouraged by}} state community forestry agencies. They emphasized such projects as planting wood lots on denuded communal cattle-grazing grounds to make villages self-sufficient in fuelwood, to supply timber needed {{for the construction of}} village houses, and to provide the wood needed for the repair of <b>farm</b> <b>implements.</b> Both individual farmers and tribal communities were also encouraged to grow trees for profit. For example, in Gujarat, one of the more aggressive states in developing programmes of socioeconomic importance, the forestry department distributed 200 million tree seedlings in 1983. The fast-growing eucalyptus is the main species being planted nationwide, followed by pine and poplar.|$|E
