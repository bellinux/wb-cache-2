50|$|In horse racing, a stayer {{refers to}} a <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> {{may be a better}} {{performer}} over a longer distance, such as more than 1-1/2 miles. Sometimes, the term may also refer to a <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> is not able to quicken or speed up.|$|R

5|$|Arabians are {{versatile}} <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> {{compete in}} many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the horse show disciplines of saddle seat, Western pleasure, and hunt seat, {{as well as}} dressage, cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others.

5|$|Averages, however, can be deceiving. For example, at the 2007 Fall Yearling sale at Keeneland, 3,799 young horses {{sold for}} a total of $385,018,600, for an average of $101,347 per horse. However, that average sales price {{reflected}} a variation that included at least 19 <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> sold for only $1,000 each and 34 that sold for over $1,000,000 apiece.|$|E

5|$|Feral {{horses are}} born {{and live in}} the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist {{throughout}} the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> live in domesticated conditions.|$|E
5|$|Height is not {{the sole}} {{criterion}} for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2h, but are still considered to be ponies.|$|E
5|$|Probably the {{earliest}} horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly, through Spain and France. Others would have arrived with returning Crusaders—beginning in 1095, European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored war horses who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses {{and their descendants}} were used to develop faster, agile light cavalry <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> were used in warfare into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Kathiawari are unknown. There were {{indigenous}} horses on the western coast of India before the arrival in the early sixteenth century of the Turco-Mongol invaders who later established the Mughal Empire. Beginning during the Mughal reign, and continuing during the British Raj, Arab horses were imported to India and crossed with native stock, creating the ancestors of the modern Kathiawari breed. The Kathiawari may have also {{been influenced by the}} Mongolian horse. Traditionally, noble households specialised in their own strain of horses, naming their lines of horses after a foundation mare; 28 of these lines still exist. These noble houses selectively bred <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> could withstand extreme temperatures and minimal rations, carry a man with weapons and armour for long periods in rough terrain, and still be swift and nimble. They bred for wiry, sleek <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> were ideal for war, and Kathiawaris were noted for their loyalty and bravery in battle, often defending their riders even when wounded themselves. This breeding was maintained until the Independence of India.|$|E
5|$|Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TRPM1 gene {{have been}} {{identified}} as closely associated with the LP mutation, although the mechanism by which the pattern is produced remains unclear.

5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> belonged to the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When {{they came to the}} nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E

5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
5|$|Alder {{was born}} September 17, 1773, in Gloucester, New Jersey, to Bartholomew Alder and Hannah Worthington. The family moved in 1775 to Wythe County, Virginia, where Alder's father died {{about a year}} later. In May 1782, Jonathan, at eight years old, was sent out with his brother David {{to search for a}} couple of <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> ran away. They were {{attacked}} by a small group of Shawnee Indians from Ohio. David saw the Indians first and tried to escape, but he was chased down, killed, and later scalped. The Indian group also captured Alder's neighbor, Mrs. Martin, and her young child.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E

5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite {{opposition from the}} local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the Boathouse) was built with stabling for <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> pulled the barges. The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, when it was replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence. A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Daniel C. Lindley, {{a native}} of Middlebury, Vermont, {{compiled}} a book of Morgan breeding stallions, published in 1857. Colonel Joseph Battell, also a Middlebury, Vermont native, published {{the first volume of}} the Morgan Horse Register in 1894, marking the beginning of a formal breed registry. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont).|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
