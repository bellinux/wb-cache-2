Formerly {{a joint venture with}} The Washington Post named The International Herald Tribune, The New York Times took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its <b>domestic</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the mid–1990s, EVA Air {{expanded}} into the domestic Taiwan market by acquiring shares in Makung International Airlines, followed by Great China Airlines and Taiwan Airways. On 1 July 1998, all three carriers, {{as well as}} EVA's existing <b>domestic</b> <b>operations,</b> merged under the UNI Air title. UNI Air became EVA Air's domestic intra-Taiwanese subsidiary, operating short haul flights out of its base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's southern port and second-largest city.|$|E
5|$|A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 {{were the}} first {{aircraft}} in Biman's fleet. <b>Domestic</b> <b>operations</b> commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes. The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.|$|E
50|$|Oki built Microsoft's {{international}} operations, {{and within}} two years it was more profitable than Microsoft's <b>domestic</b> <b>operation.</b> Bill Gates then made him Vice President of <b>Domestic</b> <b>Operation,</b> and within five years, the company's sales rose from $100 million to $1 billion. One of Oki's major contributions to Microsoft's success during that time was convincing Bill Gates {{and the board of}} directors to center product development and marketing efforts on Windows instead of OS/2. By the time he retired Oki was overseeing 3,000 employees.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} crashes {{internally}} on the <b>domestic</b> <b>operation</b> {{with the total}} loss of one F28 aircraft and one DHC7, both due pilot error. Fortunately no deaths or injuries occurred.|$|R

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the <b>domestic</b> <b>operations</b> of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|While the 747-100 {{powered by}} Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US <b>domestic</b> <b>operations,</b> it was {{marginal}} for long international route sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly {{led to the}} improved -200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the -100. A few early -200s retained the three-window configuration of the -100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side. The 747-200 was produced in passenger (-200B), freighter (-200F), convertible (-200C), and combi (-200M) versions.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Glitnir would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed. On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the <b>domestic</b> <b>operations</b> of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, {{more than half a million}} depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.|$|E
50|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>operation</b> did {{not change}} much at first; but the London trains ran from Dumfries to Carlisle via Annan rather than via Lockerbie, with a {{significant}} time saving. The MR put on a six-wheel Pullman sleeping car.|$|R
50|$|Jetstar Asia's {{first flight}} {{took off on}} 13 December 2004 to Hong Kong, {{one of the two}} initial {{destinations}} from Singapore. Jetstar Asia was established six months after Jetstar Airways first commenced its <b>domestic</b> <b>operation</b> in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the buyout}} of British Midland International (BMI), British Airways served some short- and medium-haul {{destinations}} from this terminal.

50|$|In 1972 ABN absorbed all of HBU's {{overseas}} branches. HBU's international history {{ended in}} 2001 when ABN AMRO sold the Ecuadorian operation it had {{inherited from the}} HBU to Banco del Pichincha (est. 1906). The HBU name continued as a small Netherlands <b>domestic</b> <b>operation</b> within ABN.|$|R

The RAF conducted the largest peace time <b>domestic</b> <b>operation</b> in its history to rescue over 120 residents from flood affected areas. The damage was estimated at over £2 billion.|$|R
50|$|Qantas {{revived the}} Australian Airlines brand between 2002 and 2006 {{to serve the}} {{low-cost}} leisure market of visitors to and from Australia but using a full-service model, operating selected Qantas 767-338ERs - although the livery used {{was not the same}} as that used by the previous <b>domestic</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|R

25|$|While ANA's <b>domestic</b> <b>operations</b> grew, the Ministry of Transportation had granted government-owned Japan Airlines (JAL) a {{monopoly}} on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986. ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights: its first was a 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on 21 February 1971.|$|E

25|$|By October 1964, British Eagle had {{accumulated}} {{a deficit of}} £300,000 on its domestic scheduled operations. Load factors on the Belfast route averaged only 13%. Persistent refusal of British Eagle's requests for a frequency increase led to Bamberg's decision to suspend his airline's <b>domestic</b> <b>operations</b> as of 20 February 1965.|$|E

There are lounges for Regional Express Airlines and Virgin Australia.|$|E
25|$|Iceland {{had been}} hit {{especially}} hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because {{of the failure of}} its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14billion ($19billion). In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the <b>domestic</b> <b>operations</b> of the three largest banks. Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the <b>domestic</b> <b>operations</b> of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Bmi regional’s {{three main}} {{operating}} bases are Aberdeen Airport and Bristol Airport in the UK, {{as well as}} Munich Airport in Germany.

This new service provided the first scheduled direct air link between Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes and Stavanger, however this service no longer operates.|$|R
50|$|OLT Express Regional began life in 2001 as Jet Air, {{an airline}} {{operating}} in the business aviation sector, providing broker rendering services (small aircraft and helicopters) to local operators and companies.

25|$|During the 1970s {{government}} regulations ensured Air Canada's dominance over domestic regional carriers and rival CP Air. Short-haul carriers were each restricted {{to one of}} five regions, and could not compete directly with Air Canada and CP Air. CP Air was subject to capacity limits on intercontinental flights, and restricted from <b>domestic</b> <b>operations.</b> Air Canada's fares were also subject to regulation by the government.|$|E
25|$|Three Fokker F-27-600s were leased and {{converted}} to combi-freighters. These could be converted from freighter to passenger configuration {{in half an}} hour.
