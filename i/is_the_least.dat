5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E

5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E

5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E
5|$|Helium <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of}} {{the least}} water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} five district councils in favour of a unitary authority (covering the existing two-tier county) were rejected following local opposition. West Somerset <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> populous district (except for the two sui generis districts) in England. In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed in principle to merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. It is planned to achieve this on 1 April 2019 with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new district {{would not be a}} unitary authority, with Somerset County Council still performing its functions.|$|E

5|$|Less {{reactive}} than iodine, astatine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> reactive of the halogens, {{although its}} compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively {{as possible before}} their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. Acting as a carrier, the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to work. Like iodine, astatine {{has been shown to}} adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} valence {{electron}} that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity {{as well as a}} highly reactive element, though it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only two thirds as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3). Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} zirconium {{is composed}} of five isotopes. 90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr and 94Zr are stable, although 94Zr is predicted to undergo double beta decay (not observed experimentally) with a half-life of more than 1.10×1017years. 96Zr has a half-life of 2.4×1019years, and is the longest-lived radioisotope of zirconium. Of these natural isotopes, 90Zr is the most common, making up 51.45% of all zirconium. 96Zr <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> common, comprising only 2.80% of zirconium.|$|E
