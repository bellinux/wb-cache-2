40|$|Using data {{drawn from}} the U. S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we explore the {{relationship}} between the donating behaviour of parents and that of their children aged less than 18. Furthermore, we exploit information relating to whether or not parents encourage their children <b>to</b> <b>donate</b> <b>to</b> charity in order to unveil information related to the intergenerational transmission of philanthropic behaviour. Our findings suggest that whether a child <b>donates</b> <b>to</b> charity is influenced by positive effects from whether the parent <b>donates</b> <b>to</b> charity as well as from whether the parent talks to their child about <b>donating</b> <b>to</b> charity. In addition, whether the parent <b>donates</b> <b>to</b> charity has an indirect influence via its positive effect on the probability that the parent talks to the child about <b>donating</b> <b>to</b> charity. Further, we find that the influence of whether the parent <b>donates</b> <b>to</b> charity on the probability that the child <b>donates</b> <b>to</b> charity is particularly heightened in terms of both magnitude and statistical significance in the context of parental donations to religious causes...|$|R
