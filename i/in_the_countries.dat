5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E

5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E

The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E
5|$|Chronic Chagas disease {{remains a}} major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the {{effectiveness}} of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects.

These exercises aimed to increase naval inter-operability, enabling the two navies to function with enhanced coordination during possible HADR operations.

5|$|In 1934 Marcinkus was {{transferred}} to the air reconnaissance department, there he started improving his expertise in independent flying, mapping, photography, and weapon systems. 1934 proved to be a challenging year for Marcinkus. Antanas Gustaitis, a prominent Lithuanian aircraft constructor and commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation, invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans-European flight, along with Jonas Liorentas, Juozas Namikas, Jonas Mikėnas, and Kazys Rimkevičius. After detailed planning and preparation, the trans-European flight was begun in the same year. During the 25 days of their flight, the pilots flew three of Gustaitis' designed aircraft, the ANBO IVs, over 10,000 kilometers and visited 12 European capitals. The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> they visited. They were received by the British Royal Family and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity.

Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries.</b> The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E

5|$|Numbers have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel {{is thought to be}} due to pesticides. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky. There are indications that this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|Under the Pact's terms, Hitler was, in effect, given {{authorisation}} {{to occupy}} two-thirds of Western Poland, {{as well as}} Lithuania. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland.

The Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere {{in exchange for a}} more favourable border in Poland.
