5|$|Potassium {{homeostasis}} {{denotes the}} maintenance of the total body potassium content, plasma potassium level, and the ratio of the intracellular to <b>extracellular</b> potassium concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), obligatory renal excretion, and shifts between intracellular and <b>extracellular</b> compartments.|$|E
5|$|The human {{dopamine}} transporter {{contains a}} high affinity <b>extracellular</b> zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. binding site with three coordinating residues on its <b>extracellular</b> face (His193, His375, and Glu396).... Thus, when Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate, it may greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.}} The human serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter {{do not contain}} zinc binding sites.|$|E
5|$|Administration of alprazolam, as {{compared}} to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in <b>extracellular</b> dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform <b>extracellular</b> roles, {{inhibiting}} proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, <b>extracellular</b> serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the <b>extracellular</b> matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The <b>extracellular</b> matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these <b>extracellular</b> enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting <b>extracellular,</b> chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases {{possess a}} nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces <b>extracellular</b> hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the <b>extracellular</b> hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|Naked <b>extracellular</b> DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released}} by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. <b>Extracellular</b> DNA acts as a functional <b>extracellular</b> matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in <b>extracellular</b> fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in <b>extracellular</b> fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the <b>extracellular</b> SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol are quite different from those in <b>extracellular</b> fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} {{microbes}} {{is a critical}} function of phagocytes that is performed either within the phagocyte (intracellular killing) or outside of the phagocyte (<b>extracellular</b> killing).|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and <b>extracellular</b> potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the <b>extracellular</b> volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{assembly}} of these <b>extracellular</b> structures {{is dependent on}} bacterial secretion systems. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens, so are intensively studied.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extracellular</b> {{signaling}} molecule: an <b>extracellular</b> signaling molecule {{is produced}} by one cell and is at least capable of traveling to neighboring cells.|$|E
25|$|TGF-β1 {{stimulates the}} {{synthesis}} of collagen and fibronectin and inhibits the degradation of the <b>extracellular</b> matrix degradation. Ultimately, it increases the production of <b>extracellular</b> matrix by epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|During chemotaxis, cell {{movement}} is {{facilitated by the}} binding of β1 integrins to components of the <b>extracellular</b> matrix: VLA-3, VLA-4 and VLA-5 to fibronectin and VLA-2 and VLA-3 to collagen and other <b>extracellular</b> matrix components.|$|E
25|$|The N-terminal and {{tandem repeat}} domains are both entirely <b>extracellular</b> and highly O-glycosylated. All mucins contain a tandem repeat domain that has repeating amino acid {{sequences}} high in serine, threonine and proline. The C-terminal domain contains multiple <b>extracellular</b> SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin) modules, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The <b>extracellular</b> region of MUC16 can {{be released from}} the cell surface by undergoing proteolytic cleavage.|$|E
25|$|SGCs also {{express a}} {{specific}} type of channel, the Kir4.1 channel, which works to maintain the desired low <b>extracellular</b> K+ concentration in order to control hyperexcitability, which is known to cause migraines. Additionally, <b>extracellular</b> K+ concentration {{has been found to be}} controlled by guanine nucleoside guanosine (Guo). Guo, which may be involved in neuron-to-SGC communication and interaction in sensory ganglia, is also a potential target that could control the alterations of <b>extracellular</b> K+ concentration associated with chronic pain.|$|E
25|$|Rotation Model: Ligand binding to the <b>extracellular</b> {{part of the}} {{receptor}} induces {{the rotation}} of the receptor's transmembrane region inside the cell membrane, in doing so regulate its activity inside the cell. Prior to ligand binding, the <b>extracellular</b> protein loses flexibility while the intracellular portion gains it.|$|E
25|$|The TSP1 repeats mediate <b>extracellular</b> matrix protein-protein interactions.|$|E
25|$|Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors, transmembrane receptors) are receptors {{that are}} {{embedded}} in the membranes of cells. They act in cell signaling by receiving (binding to) <b>extracellular</b> molecules. They are specialized integral membrane proteins that allow communication between the cell and the <b>extracellular</b> space. The <b>extracellular</b> molecules may be hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, or nutrients; they react with the receptor to induce changes in the metabolism and activity of a cell. In the process of signal transduction, ligand binding affects a cascading chemical change through the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|During {{the signal}} {{transduction}} event in a neuron, the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor and alters the conformation of the protein. This opens the ion channel, allowing <b>extracellular</b> ions into the cell. Ion permeability of the plasma membrane is altered, and this transforms the <b>extracellular</b> chemical signal into an intracellular electric signal which alters the cell excitability.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the kidney}} cannot {{directly}} sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly {{depends upon the}} kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the <b>extracellular</b> fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. Renin {{is the first in}} a series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin-angiotensin system. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the <b>extracellular</b> fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the <b>extracellular</b> fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the <b>extracellular</b> fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|GPCRs are {{integral}} membrane proteins that possess seven membrane-spanning domains or transmembrane helices. The <b>extracellular</b> {{parts of the}} receptor can be glycosylated. These <b>extracellular</b> loops also contain two highly conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds to stabilize the receptor structure. Some seven-transmembrane helix proteins (channelrhodopsin) that resemble GPCRs may contain ion channels, within their protein.|$|E
25|$|Osteopontin is {{involved}} in mineralization in the <b>extracellular</b> matrices of bones and teeth.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{consolidation}} in the {{entorhinal cortex}} is achieved through <b>extracellular</b> signal-regulated kinase activity.|$|E
25|$|Proteins of {{the matrix}} {{metalloproteinase}} (MMP) family {{are involved in the}} breakdown of <b>extracellular</b> matrix proteins and during tissue remodeling in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development and reproduction, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis, and tumour metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by <b>extracellular</b> proteinases.|$|E
25|$|Receptors can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} major classes: {{intracellular}} and <b>extracellular</b> receptors.|$|E
25|$|The notch <b>extracellular</b> domain is {{composed}} primarily of small cystine-rich motifs called EGF-like repeats.|$|E
25|$|Integrins are {{produced}} by {{a wide variety of}} cells; they play a role in cell attachment to other cells and the <b>extracellular</b> matrix and in the transduction of signals from <b>extracellular</b> matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen. Ligand binding to the <b>extracellular</b> domain of integrins changes the protein's conformation, clustering it at the cell membrane to initiate signal transduction. Integrins lack kinase activity; hence, integrin-mediated signal transduction is achieved through a variety of intracellular protein kinases and adaptor molecules, the main coordinator being integrin-linked kinase. As shown in the adjacent picture, cooperative integrin-RTK signaling determines the timing of cellular survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation.|$|E
25|$|SAgs are {{produced}} intracellularly by bacteria and are released upon infection as <b>extracellular</b> mature toxins.|$|E
25|$|In the membrane-bound form, the TM {{segments}} {{are embedded}} in the membrane bilayer, the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are located inside the cell, and the segment between the two TMs remains outside of the cell as the <b>extracellular</b> region of ENaC. This <b>extracellular</b> region includes about 70% of the residues of each subunit. Thus, in the membrane-bound form, the bulk of each subunit is located outside of the cell.|$|E
25|$|A microRNA (abbreviated miRNA) {{is a small}} non-coding RNA {{molecule}} (containing about 22 nucleotides) {{found in}} plants, animals and some viruses, that functions in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. While the majority of miRNAs are located within the cell, some miRNAs, commonly known as circulating miRNAs or <b>extracellular</b> miRNAs, have also been found in <b>extracellular</b> environment, including various biological fluids and cell culture media.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{living in}} a biofilm usually have {{significantly}} different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways. One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to detergents and antibiotics, as the dense <b>extracellular</b> matrix and the outer layer of cells protect {{the interior of the}} community. In some cases antibiotic resistance can be increased a thousandfold. Lateral gene transfer is often facilitated within bacterial and archaeal biofilms and leads to a more stable biofilm structure. <b>Extracellular</b> DNA is a major structural component of many different microbial biofilms. Enzymatic degradation of <b>extracellular</b> DNA can weaken the biofilm structure and release microbial cells from the surface.|$|E
25|$|Maturation of {{the notch}} {{receptor}} involves cleavage at the prospective <b>extracellular</b> side during intracellular trafficking in the Golgi complex. This {{results in a}} bipartite protein, composed of a large <b>extracellular</b> domain linked to the smaller transmembrane and intracellular domain. Binding of ligand promotes two proteolytic processing events; {{as a result of}} proteolysis, the intracellular domain is liberated and can enter the nucleus to engage other DNA-binding proteins and regulate gene expression.|$|E
