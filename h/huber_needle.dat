40|$|Introduction: Totally implantable central venous access devices (TIVADs) {{are widely}} used for {{intravenous}} therapy in cancer populations. By withdrawal of the <b>Huber</b> <b>needle,</b> the non-dominant hand is vulnerable to a 'rebound' stick. The PolyPerf Safe (PS) <b>Huber</b> <b>needle</b> (Laboratoires Perouse, lvry-le-Temple, France) is developed to increase safe use by health care professionals. We conducted a study to evaluate the safety and user-friendliness by end-users. Methods: A prospective descriptive study carried out at the University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium). Five hundred PS needles were evaluated {{on an individual basis}} in cancer patients. Different aspects of the PS were assessed: packaging, needle insertion and needle removal. Nurses indicated if they inserted or removed the needle for the first time or not. Comparison with the standard Gripper· needle was assessed only in terms of 'safety' and 'ease of use and training'. Results: Three hundred sixty-six forms were analysed. No statistical difference was found between first and non-first users. Packaging and access evaluations were scored in general positively except for two aspects: (1) needle stability and (2) ease of dressing. The 'ease of removal' was scored unsatisfactory in up to 22. 4 % of the registrations. Pain at insertion was recorded in about one in five registrations and blood contact in 2. 5 % of non-first users. The safety aspect was scored good however the 'ease in use' and 'ease in training' scored in 25. 4 to 43. 8 % less than the Gripper'. Discussion and conclusions: Nurses evaluated the PS in general positively with exception of 'needle stability'; 'ease of dressing' and 'ease of removal'. No needlestick accidents were recorded. Aspects of 'ease in use' and 'ease of training' scored less compared to the Gripper' in up to one-third of the registrations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Chemoports are subcutaneously placed {{long term}} central venous access devices usually {{inserted}} under local anaesthesia. Rare complications include port inversion or flip over. These {{can be prevented}} by anchoring the port to the tissues at its base. We describe an in situ technique of port anchoring. Here, the port is first ‘fixed’ temporarily to the overlying skin by <b>Huber</b> <b>needle,</b> thus facilitating placement of fixing sutures without port manipulation. The described technique is safe {{and we have not}} encountered complications. In addition, ex - planting the port was easier due to the use of delayed absorbable sutures. It is safer to anchor the port even if the port pocket ensures that the port fits in snugly. This described technique results in minimal manipulation of portcatheter system thereby ensuring that the catheter tip which is properly placed remains unaltered...|$|E

The effective flushing of these devices is a central element to assure long-lasting use. Our experimental work demonstrates that directing the <b>Huber</b> point <b>needle</b> opening in the diametrically opposite direction of the implantable port exit channel increases the flushing efficiency. These results are consolidated by numerical computations, which support recommendations not only for their maintenance, but also for their use.

50|$|The septum {{is made of}} {{a special}} {{self-sealing}} silicone; it can be punctured hundreds of times before it weakens significantly. To administer treatment or to withdraw blood, a health care professional will first locate the port and disinfect the area, then access the port by puncturing the overlying skin with a <b>Huber</b> point <b>needle.</b> Due to its design, {{there is a very}} low infection risk, as the breach of skin integrity is never larger than the caliber of the needle. This gives it an advantage over indwelling lines such as the Hickman line. Negative pressure is created to withdraw blood into the vacuumized needle, to check for blood return and see if the port is functioning normally. Next, the port is flushed with a saline solution. Then, treatment will begin.|$|R
40|$|In {{the public}} sector most Caesarian Sections are {{performed}} using SA. In this setting, epidural anaesthesia for labour is infrequently used, so relatively few epidurals are extended for CS. Both maternal and fetal complications may occur as a con-sequence {{of the use of}} RA. These may develop during admin-istration of the RA, intraoperatively or in the postpartum pe-riod. Complications arising during administration of RA: 1. Anxiety related The preparation required for RA is stressful for the patient, and can result in anxiety-related physiological changes. Vas-ovagal episodes are not uncommon and are more severe when the patient is in the sitting than the lateral position. Severe episodes can result in maternal asystole 4 and fetal compro-mise. 5 Anxiolytic premedication is usually omitted lest it causes neonatal depression, but when the mother is very anx-ious, 1 mg of midazolam IV may help prevent vasovagal epi-sodes. 6 2. Equipment related Technical problems related to the spinal needle are more frequent when the CSE needle through needle technique is used. If the epidural space is located with a curved <b>Huber</b> tip epidural <b>needle</b> and a fine gauge spinal needle inserted through this, the curve may bend the spinal needle tip result-ing in the inability to withdraw the stylet 7, or causing no cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) to flow, due to blockage by the kinked tip. 8 Blocked epidural catheters secondary to a defective com-ponent have resulted in technical failure. The obstruction is often located in the catheter connector and remedied simply by changing the connector. 9, 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground and objective: Trabactedin is an {{alkylating agent}} {{which has not}} been {{identified}} as a necrosing agent in case of extravasation. However, we observed a necrosis in a patient treated for an endometrial sarcoma. This work aims to understand how such a side effect has occurred. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the case using the ALARM method. Main outcome measures: Improvement of the follow-up in order do diminish the incidence and severity of extravasation. Results: In February 2011, the patient received her second course of trabectedin through an implantable port that has been implanted in 2007. Three hours after the perfusion start, the patient felt a stinging sensation along the <b>Huber</b> <b>needle.</b> This was followed by discomfort in the middle ofthe night. After checking, nurses didn’t notice any occlusion of the system. The patient came back twice at the hospital emergency ward for worsening symptoms on days 2 and 5. At her first came, extravasation was diagnosed. On day 8, a large necrotic zone (8 cm of diameter) was observed and the patient had surgery The retrospective analysis of the case indicates a failure with the medical devices and a misdiagnosis of extravasation due to theweakness of the symptomsThe extravasation may have three main causes: a disconnection of the catheter, a lack of impermeability of the septum or a fissure of the <b>Huber</b> <b>needle.</b> The ALARM analysis shows three levels of major failures. A failure in checking the integrity of the port implanted since more than 3 years. A weakness of the communication between nurses and doctors as well as a lack of knowledge on the dangerousness of the treatment. Conclusions: The incident described here reminds us the importance of actively watching the administration of vesicant products. Vigilance against signs of local intolerance, reinforcement of the communication between nurses and doctors, and identification insidethe institute of an expert in extravasation management are threecorrective actions. Finally, it’s essential to check the integrity of implanted ports. Cases of catheters disconnection are frequent in scientific literature. Disclosure of interest: None declared...|$|E

Owing to the thermo-rheological properties of the contrast media, the primary aim of this work is to present an in vitro experimental impact study concerning {{the impact of the}} temperature level on flushing efficiency after contrast medium injection. Moreover, we report experimental data that confirms the role of needle bevel orientation. The secondary aim is to answer the following questions: Is there significant device contrast medium trapping after contrast medium injection? Is saline flushing efficient? And, finally, is it safe to inject contrast medium through an indwelled port catheter?Results: The experimental results show that in addition to hydrodynamics, temperature is a key parameter for the efficiency of device flushing after contrast medium injection. It appears that this is the case when the cavity is incompletely rinsed after three calibrated flushing volumes of 10 mL saline solution, even by using the <b>Huber</b> <b>needle</b> bevel opposite to the port exit. This leads to a potentially important trapped volume of contrast medium in the port, and consequently to the possibility of subsequent salt precipitates and long term trisubstituted benzene nuclei delivery that might impair the solute properties, which may be further injected via the power port later on. Conclusion: We thus suggest, in TIVADS patients, the use of a temporary supplementary intravenous line rather than the port to perform contrast medium injections in daily radiology routine practice.

40|$|Background: Totally implantable {{vascular}} access devices (TIVAD) {{are considered}} {{safe and reliable}} for the administration of intravenous therapies, including chemotherapy and blood sampling. They provide direct vascular access through a simple percutaneous puncture. However, {{in order to avoid}} paravenous injection, it is mandatory to check for blood withdrawal before administering medication: this simple procedure confirms both the system’s patency, correct needle position in the chamber and the catheter tip’s intravascular location. This study’s objective was to evaluate the incidence of partial and total blood withdrawal impairment in TIVADs directly after accessing the port system. Material and Methods: From November 2003 to March 2004, nurses from 20 hospitals in Flanders (Belgium) agreed {{to take part in a}} prospective cohort study and collect data on TIVAD access procedures in cancer patients. In case of blood withdrawal problems or device occlusion, they recorded all actions needed for diagnosing the cause of the problem and restoring patency. In each hospital, TIVAD maintenance and solutions for troubleshooting were performed according to individual institutional protocols. Results: The data included 8685 accesses in 2853 patients. The incidence of blood withdrawal occlusion and total occlusion were 11. 11 % and 0. 24 % respectively. Overall incidence varied between hospitals from 3. 05 % to 28. 37 %. Nurses restored full device patency in 53. 25 % of cases, mostly by changing patients’ position or intrathoracic pressure, additional flushing and repositioning of the <b>Huber</b> <b>needle</b> in the port septum. In 83. 51 % of persistent occlusions, no further investigation into the cause of the functional impairment was undertaken. Thirty-one events of occlusion (3. 14 %) were treated by thrombolytics or device replacement. Altogether, blood aspiration was regained in 55. 17 %. Conclusions: Withdrawal and total occlusion problems occurred in 11. 35 % of TIVAD access and were resolved by nurses’ interventions in 53. 25 % of cases. The incidence expressed in function of the number of punctures reflects accurately the impact of this problem in daily practice. The differences between hospitals revealed that prevention of occlusion and established protocols for maintenance or troubleshooting solutions are important factors to maintain optimal TIVAD patency and deserves further analyses. status: publishe...|$|E
