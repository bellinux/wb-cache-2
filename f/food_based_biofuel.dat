40|$|It would, for {{the sake}} of food security, be {{rational}} to start an agricultural transition to a system less dependant on fossil fuels in good time before a possible energy crisis. It therefore seems a paradox that policy makers choose to do the opposite; establish an additional link between the food and energy market through subsidization of <b>food</b> <b>based</b> <b>biofuel</b> production, thus putting food security even more at the mercy of energy supply. The dynamic policy model presented in this thesis illustrates how growth in <b>food</b> <b>based</b> <b>biofuel</b> production enhances the link between the energy and food market. An alternative policy example is developed and tested using the model to simulate future scenarios. The model simulations suggest the current policy of supporting <b>food</b> <b>based</b> <b>biofuel,</b> combined with a peak in oil production, could lay the foundation of a future food crisis and that an alternative policy needs to be implemented as quickly as possible; most importantly, before policy makers receive feedback signals {{in the form of a}} continuous rising food price trend...|$|E

Both institutions are seeking to overcome the twin evils of "peak oil" (Hubbert 1949 & 1956) and "global warming" (IPPC 2007, Stern 2006, Alison 2010), through development of Generation 1, 2 and 3 (Gen- 1, 2 & 3) biofuels (Clarke 2008, Clarke 2010). This includes development of parallel Chemical Biorefinery, value-added, co-product chemical technologies, which can underpin the commercial viability of the biofuel industry. Whilst there is a focused effort to develop Gen- 2 & 3 biofuels, thus avoiding the socially unacceptable use of <b>food</b> <b>based</b> Gen- 1 <b>biofuels,</b> it must also be recognized that as yet, no country in the world has produced sustainable Gen- 2 & 3 biofuel on a commercial basis.

40|$|AbstractMost {{long-term}} global energy scenarios rely on biomass for {{a variety}} of possible uses, but there is unlikely to be enough to replace the majority of fossil fuel use in all sectors. Improving the understanding of the sustainable and realistic potential for biomass is crucial. We present a comprehensive, country-based, bottom-up assessment of the land-based global biofuel (bioethanol and biodiesel) potential, taking into account a range of scenarios with varying yield gradients, land-use change and technology development, covering energy from both lignocellulosic and food crops as well as residues from agriculture and forestry. We have also gone beyond many other studies by analysing the potential for <b>food</b> crop <b>based</b> <b>biofuels</b> as well as lignocellulosic-sourced biofuels. We find a global biofuel supply potential increasing from 15 – 70  EJ final transport fuel energy (30 – 140  EJ primary energy) currently to 40 – 190  EJ (130 – 400  EJ) in 2070, depending on the development of land-use, productivity and technology mix. Over 3 / 4 of this potential comes from energy crops: up to 70 % could come from food crops and at least 10 % from lignocellulosic crops. The remaining quarter would be from agricultural and forestry residues. For comparison, current (2010) total global energy use (fuel, heat and electricity) stands at 365  EJ final energy (530  EJ primary energy). Depending on demand developments, countries such as Brazil or Russia could become net bioenergy exporters {{in the second half of}} the century, while others, such as India or Nigeria, may become net importers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{drawn on}} {{theoretical}} insights from {{science and technology}} studies and rural studies literatures to interrogate the potential agricultural system and on-farm changes required for developing lignocellulosic biofuel supply chains in the UK. Previous work has largely examined first generation, <b>food</b> <b>based</b> <b>biofuels,</b> with limited focus on the prospects for lignocellulosic technologies. Likewise policy identifies a number of challenges for lignocellulosic biofuels, commercial, technical, and sustainability, that require policy solutions. However, biofuels straddle the agricultural-energy sectors. The deployment of these technologies will demand the adoption of certain practices and crops by farmers, as well as broader changes to agricultural systems. These important components for delivering lignocellulosic biofuels require examination which {{has so far been}} limited. Using semi-structured interviews alongside documentary analysis I identify the ways in which policy constructs and imagines the interface between lignocellulosic biofuels and agriculture, before interrogating these tacit assumptions through comparison with perspectives from farmers, agricultural intermediaries and industry representatives. A key finding is that through knowing farmers and agricultural systems with modelling alone, important avenues for producing and procuring biomass for use in lignocellulosic biofuel production are obscured, whereas significant barriers are presented as readily negotiable. This thesis argues the following points. Firstly, there is an emerging disjuncture between biofuel imaginaries and agricultural imaginaries. This is particularly apparent as food security concerns re-emerge and Common Agricultural Policy moves towards embedding types of multifunctional arable production which both exclude dedicated non-food energy cropping. Secondly, policy understands farmers as rational economic decision makers influenced by price, ignoring entrenched on farm practices, technologies, values and farmer decision making which are difficult to untangle. These factors can create resistance to increasing straw baling, or the cultivation of dedicated energy crops. Fourthly, marginal land and straw are material heterogeneous resources not the fungible commodities imagined in policy. This materiality shapes how land and biomass is and can be used. Foregrounding these considerations identifies oil seed rape straw as a potentially large, but challenging opportunity. Finally, agricultural intermediaries are a crucial link in biomass supply chains but have been entirely ignored in policy. Contractors and merchants undertake in-field operations, own large scale machinery and manage inter-relationships between farmers and end users. Agronomists are important land management advisors and involved in the soft sell of new technologies and practices. Neither groups are addressed in policy and require active enlistment in lignocellulosic developments. These insights highlight the following: a need for policy makers to forge better linkages between biofuel, bioenergy and agricultural policy domains; the incorporation of qualitative insights into policy understandings of on-farm decision making, practices, biomass materials and farmer values; the engagement with a wider range of agricultural actors to better deliver desired agricultural change...|$|R
