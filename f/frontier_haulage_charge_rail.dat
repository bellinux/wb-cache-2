50|$|La Grandière was {{extensively}} modernised in 1944. Her anti-aircraft armament {{was replaced}} with 40 mm Bofors and 20 mm Oerlikon guns, and new anti-submarine armament of (4 depth charge throwers and 6 depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails,</b> with 66 <b>charges)</b> was installed. She also received two radars and a sonar.|$|R

50|$|The {{class was}} armed with one 4-inch (102-mm) Quick Firing Mk.XIX High Angle/Low Angle {{combined}} air/surface gun, two twin 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons and six single 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons for air/surface combat. For anti-submarine warfare, the ships were equipped with one Squid anti-submarine mortar and one depth <b>charge</b> <b>rail</b> with 15 depth charges.|$|R
50|$|The primary armaments of {{the ship}} are two twin 57mm 70-cal Type 76 DP guns and two twin 25mm 60cal Type 61 guns. Besides these she carries a variety of weapons to perform ASW missions. The ASW weapons are four RBU-1200 (Type 81) (5-barrel) ASW rockets, two BMB-2 ASW mortars and two depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails</b> with 20 depth charges.|$|R
25|$|The corvettes {{were armed}} with one QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun mounted forward. Anti-air {{armament}} varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth <b>charge</b> <b>rail</b> on the stern {{that came with}} 15 depth charges.|$|R

50|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Racehorse had one quadruple mount for QF 2-pdr Mark VIII ("pom-pom") guns and six single 20 mm Oerlikon autocannon.

5000|$|While the Penn Central did not {{connect with}} the old New Haven {{on the west side}} of the line, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between Cedar Hill Yard in New Haven, Connecticut and Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia, by way of the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway, which {{connected}} with a former Pennsylvania Railroad line in Belvidere, New Jersey, 72 miles south of the old interchange with the [...] New Haven at Maybrook Yard in Maybrook, New York. The service ended in a dispute over <b>haulage</b> <b>charges</b> and the traffic was diverted to the longer all Penn Central route through Selkirk, New York. Ironically, the only reason the Lehigh and Hudson River was not part of the Penn Central was because Penn Central predecessor, the Pennsylvania Railroad, had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.|$|R
500|$|The ship mounted five 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120mm) Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Grenville had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for [...] torpedoes. One depth <b>charge</b> <b>rail</b> and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 {{shortly after the}} war began.|$|R
5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were {{fitted in}} two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts {{to the deck}} below the {{platform}} for the 4-inch guns. Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried. Sydney was fitted with a single depth <b>charge</b> <b>rail</b> at the stern, which held five Mk VII depth charges.

50|$|Narcissus was {{constructed}} at Lewis’s shipyard in Aberdeen in April 1941, with {{the express purpose}} of joining the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was to act as a platform, from which attacking German submarines could be detected above or below the surface anytime, and driven away or destroyed. She was equipped with sonar and, eventually, type-271 radar and armed with depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails</b> and throwers. A forward throwing Hedgehog was added at a later date.|$|R
50|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Diana {{had a single}} 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted {{on the side of}} her bridge.

5000|$|The {{ships were}} armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for {{anti-aircraft}} defense. In many ships {{a shortage of}} 1-pounders caused them {{to be replaced by}} 3-inch (76 mm) guns.

They also carried a pair of depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails.</b> A [...] "Y-gun" [...] depth charge thrower was added to many ships.|$|R

2500|$|Brazil became {{involved}} in the Second World War in 1942, and while Maranhão was obsolete, she was used for convoy escort and patrol duties. During the war, she was fitted with sonar and depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails,</b> and her armament was supplemented by three Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. On 12 July 1943, the German submarine [...] sunk the merchant ship [...] with torpedoes in the South Atlantic, killing one of the African Stars crew.

25|$|In July 1917, all six ships rendezvoused off the Cocos Islands: {{the first}} time the entire class had been in one location. From there, the River-class destroyers {{proceeded}} to the Mediterranean. On arrival at Malta, they were immediately deployed as escorts for a convoy. After this, the destroyers were modified for anti-submarine warfare: the aftmost torpedo tube was removed and replaced with depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails.</b> From August 1917, the six destroyers were based at Brindisi, Italy, assigned to patrol the Adriatic and prevent enemy submarines using it as a route to the Mediterranean.|$|R
25|$|Isuzu was {{the only}} cruiser which {{underwent}} conversion into a dedicated anti-aircraft/anti-submarine cruiser.

Her Type 96 25mm AA guns were increased to a total of 11 triple-mounts and 17 single-mounts. Her torpedo launchers were replaced by two quadruple launchers mounted in the stern, along with two depth <b>charge</b> <b>rails.</b> She was given a complete set of the latest radar, hydrophones and sonar.|$|R

The fore and aft twin torpedo tubes were removed {{and replaced by}} two quadruple mounts aft. The aircraft catapult was removed and replaced by two triple-mount Type 96 25-mm AA gun mounts bringing the Nagaras 25-mm total to 22 barrels (2x3, 6x2, 4x1).
