50|$|The airport has a {{reputation}} for high <b>domestic</b> <b>fares,</b> and they are usually attributed to the lack of a true low-cost carrier (LCC) serving the airport, such as JetBlue or Southwest Airlines. Low-cost carrier AirTran Airways served the airport for a time, but Delta Air Lines and other airlines matched fares on the routes that AirTran served, and passengers continued to fly the traditional network carriers. AirTran ultimately discontinued all service, and fares increased once again. AirTran later entered the Pensacola market, and fares dropped significantly from Pensacola International Airport. Because of this, many people drove about an hour in either direction to Pensacola International Airport in Florida or the Gulfport Airport in Mississippi. Fares from Pensacola were lower primarily on routes that AirTran served, while on other routes, including international services, Mobile and Pensacola offered similar fares. AirTran, however, was acquired by Southwest beginning in 2011 and ending in 2014.|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Over two decades ago, Congress deregulated the airline industry, phasing out the federal government's control over <b>domestic</b> <b>fares</b> and routes served and allowing market forces to determine the price, quantity, and quality of service. Concerned that air service to some small communities would suffer in a deregulated environment, Congress established the Essential Air Service (EAS) program {{as part of the}} Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The act guaranteed that communities served by air carriers before deregulation would continue to receive a certain level of scheduled air service. As of July 1, 2002, the EAS program provided subsidies to air carriers to serve 114 communities [...] 79 in the continental United States and another 35 in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. From 1995 to July 2002, the net member of EAS-subsidized communities increased by four in the continental United States. Several factors [...] including increasing carrier costs, limited passenger revenue, and increasing numbers of eligible communities requiring subsidized service [...] are likely to affect potential future subsidy requirements of the EAS program. GAO identified and evaluated major categories of options to enhance the long-term viability of the EAS program, each of which has associated potential effects. In no particular order, the options identified to control costs and improve the program's sustainability include (1) targeting subsidized service to more remote communities by changing eligibility criteria, (2) better matching capacity with community use by increasing the use of smaller aircraft and restricting little-used flight frequencies, (3) consolidating service to multiple communities into regional airports, and (4) changing the form of the federal assistance from carrier subsidies to local grants. Potential positive effects include decreasing federal costs, increasing passenger traffic, and creating community choice for transportation options. Potential negative effects also exist, such as increased passenger inconvenience and the potential negative effect on local economies of lost scheduled airline service. ...|$|R

Simulations help identify those underlying structural features of economies which are the primary determinants of differential impacts; these are suggestive of policy instruments to countervail undesirable effects. Results show that all these countries will potentially suffer income and production losses.

Although this compared unfavourably with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), whose regular scheduled services took only 24 hours, load factors averaged 93% during {{the first nine months of}} operation. Hunting-Clan and Airwork continued to achieve very high average load factors of 85-90% because their £98 single fare was £42 cheaper than the comparable BOAC fare. These load factors were much higher than BOAC's, as a result of which the independents doubled the flight frequency on their London-Nairobi Safari/colonial coach route to once-a-week. This service proved to be so popular that a second weekly frequency was eventually added, which was operated alternately by each airline.|$|R
