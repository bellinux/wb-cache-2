40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the range of motion (ROM) of the knee before and four years after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with a mobile or <b>fixed</b> <b>type</b> of platform and to prospectively evaluate whether there was a difference in ligament balance between the platform types. The subjects were 68 patients involving 76 joints. The mobile type was used in 31 joints and <b>fixed</b> <b>type</b> in 45 joints by employing a prospective randomised method. The passive maximum ROM was measured using a goniometer before and four years after surgery. Also, the intraoperative knee ligament balance was measured. The postoperative extension ROM was significantly improved after TKA using a mobile <b>bearing</b> <b>type</b> compared with that employing a <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>type.</b> In TKA using the former, the intraoperative gap difference was not related to the postoperative flexion angle of the knee. However, they were related in TKA using a <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>type,</b> with a positive correlation regarding the flexion gap...|$|R

40|$|Polyethylene (PE) wear is the {{limiting}} {{factor for the}} longevity of a conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Excessive wear leads to loosening and even - tual implant failure. The aim of our in vitro {{study was to investigate}} wear of a PE tibial insert on a rotating platform as compared to the same insert fixed to the tibial baseplate and articulating with a similar femoral component. All tests were performed at Endolab Laboratories, Rosenheim, Germany using a knee joint simulator following ISO 14243 - 1. Three specific configurations were tested and compared to a loaded soak control : (1) the rotating platform using machined polyethylene (PE), (2) fixed bearing using machined PE, (3) fixed bearing using compressionmoulded PE. Calf serum with a high protein concentration of 30 g/l was chosen as test lubricant. PE wear was measured gravimetrically using the ISO 14243 - 2 protocol. The total wear rates found for all systems tested were low. The mean wear rate was 1. 40 mg per million cycles for the moulded fixed bearing, 4. 07 mg per million cycles for the machined <b>fixed</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>type</b> and 0. 82 mg per million cycles for the machined rotating platform <b>bearing</b> <b>type.</b> We conclude that the TKA system we tested (Performance®, Biomet, Warsaw, IND, USA) demonstrated very low gravimetric wear. The wear rate of the same implant in the fixed mode compared to the rotating platform mode was four times higher. status: publishe...|$|R
