40|$|OBJECTIVES: Numerous {{environmental}} contaminants {{have been}} linked to adverse reproductive health outcomes. However, the complex correlation structure of exposures and multiple testing issues limit the interpretation of existing evidence. Our objective was to identify, from a large set of contaminant exposures, exposure profiles associated with biomarkers of male reproductive function. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study (n= 602), male partners of pregnant women were enrolled between 2002 and 2004 during antenatal care visits in Greenland, Poland and Ukraine. Fifteen contaminants were detected in more than 70 % of blood samples, including metabolites of di(2 -ethylhexyl) and <b>diisononyl</b> <b>phthalates</b> (DEHP, DiNP), perfluoroalkyl acids, metals and organochlorines. Twenty-two reproductive biomarkers were assessed, including serum levels of reproductive hormones, markers of semen quality, sperm chromatin integrity, epididymal and accessory sex gland function, and Y:X chromosome ratio. We evaluated multipollutant models with sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression, a simultaneous dimension reduction and variable selection approach which accommodates joint modelling of correlated exposures. RESULTS: Of the over 300 exposure-outcome associations tested in sPLS models, we detected 10 associations encompassing 8 outcomes. Several associations were notably consistent in direction across the three study populations: positive associations between mercury and inhibin B, and between cadmium and testosterone; and inverse associations between DiNP metabolites and testosterone, between polychlorinated biphenyl- 153 and progressive sperm motility, and between a DEHP metabolite and neutral α-glucosidase, a marker of epididymal function.

40|$|Background: Some {{legacy and}} {{emerging}} environmental contaminants are suspected {{risk factors for}} intrauterine growth restriction. However, the evidence is equivocal, {{in part due to}} difficulties in disentangling the effects of mixtures. Objectives: We assessed associations between multiple correlated biomarkers of environmental exposure and birth weight. Methods: We evaluated a cohort of 1, 250 term (≥ 37 weeks gestation) singleton infants, born to 513 mothers from Greenland, 180 from Poland, and 557 from Ukraine, who were recruited during antenatal care visits in 2002 ‒ 2004. Secondary metabolites of diethylhexyl and <b>diisononyl</b> <b>phthalates</b> (DEHP, DiNP), eight perfluoroalkyl acids, and organochlorines (PCB- 153 and p,p´‑DDE) were quantifiable in 72 ‒ 100 % of maternal serum samples. We assessed associations between exposures and term birth weight, adjusting for co-exposures and covariates, including prepregnancy body mass index. To identify independent associations, we applied the elastic net penalty to linear regression models. Results: Two phthalate metabolites (MEHHP, MOiNP), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and p,p´-DDE were most consistently predictive of term birth weight based on elastic net penalty regression. In an adjusted, unpenalized regression model of the four exposures, 2 -SD increases in natural log–transformed MEHHP, PFOA, and p,p´-DDE were associated with lower birth weight: – 87 g (95 % CI: – 137, – 340 per 1. 70 ng/mL), – 43 g (95 % CI: – 108, 23 per 1. 18 ng/mL), and – 135 g (95 % CI: – 192, – 78 per 1. 82 ng/g lipid), respectively; and MOiNP was associated with higher birth weight (46 g; 95 % CI: – 5, 97 per 2. 22 ng/mL). Conclusions: This study suggests that several of the environmental contaminants, belonging to three chemical classes, may be independently associated with impaired fetal growth. These results warrant follow-up in other cohorts...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that prenatal or early-life exposures to environmental contaminants may contribute to {{an increased risk of}} asthma and allergies in children. We aimed to explore associations of prenatal exposures to a large set of environmental chemical contaminants with asthma and eczema in school-age children. METHODS: We studied 1024 mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine from the INUENDO birth cohort. Data were collected by means of an interview-based questionnaire when the children were 5 - 9 years of age. Questions from the ISAAC study were used to define asthma, eczema, and wheeze. We applied principal components analysis (PCA) to sixteen contaminants in maternal serum sampled during pregnancy, including perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), metabolites of diethylhexyl (DEHP) and <b>diisononyl</b> (DiNP) <b>phthalates,</b> PCB- 153 and p,p'-DDE. Scores of five principal components (PCs) explaining 70 % of the variance were included in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: In a meta-analysis which included both populations, the PC 2 score, reflecting exposure to DiNP, was negatively associated with current eczema (OR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 52 - 0. 96). Other associations were not consistent between the two populations. In Ukrainian children, the PC 3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1. 56, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 2. 37), whereas the PC 5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0. 64, 0. 41 - 0. 99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC 4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0. 78, 0. 61 - 0. 99) was found. CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence to support a link between prenatal exposure to environmental chemical contaminants and childhood asthma and eczema. This article is protected by copyright.

Using a 100 |am PDMS fibre and GC-MS analysis, VOCs could be determined in water samples at the low parts per billion level. This was found to match Purge and Trap-GC-MS detection limits for most VOCs but with the additional advantage of easier operation, shorter analysis times and potential on-site sampling. PVC toys and childcare articles were screened for leaching of the phthalate ester <b>Diisononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DINP) by shaking a sample disc in a saliva simulant followed by extraction of the leached phthalates. An 85 |xm polyacrylate fibre was used to extract the leached phthalates and analysis was carried out using GC-MS. Solvent extraction was carried out for comparative purposes. Articles leaching phthalates above xfig / 1 0 cm 2 / min could be identified...|$|E
40|$|Phthalates, {{widely used}} in {{flexible}} plastics and consumer products, have become ubiquitous contaminants worldwide. This study evaluated the acute toxicity and estrogenic endocrine disrupting activity of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP), bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), <b>diisononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DINP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) and their mixtures. Using a 72 h zebrafish embryo toxicity test, the LC 50 values of BBP, DBP and a mixture of the six phthalates {{were found to be}} 0. 72, 0. 63 and 0. 50 ppm, respectively. The other four phthalates did not cause more than 50 % exposed embryo mortality even at their highest soluble concentrations. The typical toxicity symptoms caused by phthalates were death, tail curvature, necrosis, cardio edema and no touch response. Using an estrogen-responsive ChgH-EGFP transgenic medaka (Oryzias melastigma) eleutheroembryos based 24 h test, BBP demonstrated estrogenic activity, DBP, DEHP, DINP and the mixture of the six phthalates exhibited enhanced-estrogenic activity and DIDP and DNOP showed no enhanced- or anti-estrogenic activity. These findings highlighted the developmental toxicity of BBP and DBP, and the estrogenic endocrine disrupting activity of BBP, DBP, DEHP and DINP on intact organisms, indicating that the widespread use of these phthalates may cause potential health risks to human beings...|$|E
40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: <b>Diisononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DINP), a {{principal}} plasticizer in many polyvinyl chloride products, {{has been shown}} to have an adjuvant effect on immunoglobulin (Ig) production in mice. However, the effects of DINP on allergic diseases have not been fully elucidated. Objectives: In the present study we investigated the effects of DINP on atopic dermatitis (AD) -like skin lesions induced by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) in atopic-prone NC/Nga mice. Me t h o d s: Mice were injected intradermally with Dp on their ears and were exposed to DINP (0, 0. 15, 1. 5, 15, or 150 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally. We evaluated clinical scores, ear thickening, histologic findings, protein expression of cytokines/chemokines in the ear, and serum levels of Ig and histamine. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of DINP on bone-marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) or splenocytes in vitro. After exposure to DINP (0 – 100 µM), cells were evaluated for phenotype and function. Re s u l t s: DINP aggravated AD-like skin lesions related to Dp. The aggravation was consistent with eosinophilic inflammation, mast cell degranulation, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) expression in the ear. DINP enhanced the expression of cell surface activation markers on BMDCs and their production of TARC/CCL 17 (thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine) and MDC/CCL 2...|$|E
