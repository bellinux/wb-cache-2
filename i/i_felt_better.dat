500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "I {{loved this}} episode for... its careful {{layering}} {{and expansion of}} the series’ key themes, and for the way it’s setting us up for a truly superb, universe-shaking episode when Fringe returns Dec. 2." [...] The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining he enjoyed the episode more than the previous visit to the parallel universe because [...] "the last five minutes or so of 'The Abducted' were more compelling than the case-of-the-week. But not far more. The Candy Man is just so creepy—and his crime so powerfully symbolic—that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> about this episode overall than I did about 'Amber." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Gore {{became a}} vegan. He had earlier {{admitted}} that [...] "it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets {{across the world}} {{is one of the}} issues connected to this global crisis – {{not only because of the}} [...] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process" [...] and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, Gore said [...] "Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it was like. ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better,</b> so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} greeted with {{widespread}} derision in preview screenings. An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, {{and a lot of}} people that I felt knew what they were doing, saw it and thought it was a great piece of science fiction." [...] Christian also spoke of an initially positive reception, mentioning an enthusiastic response from both the audience and Tarantino.|$|E
60|$|He laughed. It {{was the old}} buoyant, boyish laugh {{of sheer}} happiness, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the <b>better</b> for hearing it.|$|R
60|$|ANNYS [She shakes {{hands with}} SIGSBY.] How are you? [To LAMB.] I'm so glad you're helping him. [She turns again to GEOFFREY.] Pure imagination, dearest. <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> any <b>better,</b> I'd {{have to call}} in the doctor," [...] {{announced}} Andy with {{a sudden}} sober look on his face, and at this little sally all the girls giggled.|$|R

60|$|I {{knew the}} end was near and, almost involuntarily, I did that which I had not done since childhood--I prayed. After that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
60|$|I let go, {{and they}} looked reproachfully at me, as though I had imperilled their chance for a bed and three parts of skilly. Nobody came. Luckily {{it was the wrong}} bell, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The captain laughed. [...] "I {{have had}} plenty to eat," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b> If <b>I</b> had not taken exercise, you would have found me as fat as a porpoise." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was settled}} beyond a peradventure that the Avenger and her crew {{should become a}} portion of Commodore Barney's flotilla, and <b>I</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in mind after the {{question}} had been definitely decided.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! Why, I'm {{perfectly}} well. <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in my life. Of course, that congestion {{last winter}} pulled me down a little. But just see my color. I don't {{look much like}} an invalid, I'm sure." ...|$|R
60|$|Bloody, dirty, ragged and {{wringing}} {{wet with}} sweat I {{must have been}} a sight. R.C. however, did not look so very immaculate, and when I saw he also was lame and scratched and black <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
60|$|Presently he turned, and perceiving that I {{was sitting}} up {{advanced}} to me, and with the utmost courtesy said that he trusted that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b> I answered that at present I scarcely knew how I felt, except that I ached all over.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in mind after Hiram had {{replied to}} my question, believing {{that we would}} be somewhere near even in point of numbers; but within ten minutes that sense of {{security}} had vanished, for I saw yet another fleet of barges coming out from Boston town laden with infantry, marines, and grenadiers.|$|E
6000|$|He colored, {{but gave}} her a steady look. [...] "That is so. I admit the thing's ridiculous; but at first <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I'd <b>better</b> pull out. Then I noted {{something}} about your pose; you looked angry." ...|$|R
60|$|After this {{consultation}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> much <b>better.</b> The reëstablishing {{in my mind}} of {{the fact}} that I was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that I almost became gloomy again. There is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful.|$|R
60|$|I {{wrote in}} my diary {{this morning that}} really on the whole <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in my life. Mouth, eyes, head, feet, and fingers all fairly in trim; older than they were, yes, but if the head and heart grow wiser, they won't want feet or fingers some day.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Come on, now,' I said, when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b> 'Stop your fooling {{and tell}} me where that nugget is.' 'It's nearer {{to you right now}} than I'll ever get,' she answered, her big eyes going sudden wistful. 'All you Gringos are alike. Gold is the love of your heart, and women don't count much.' ...|$|E
60|$|I did better. I {{went to my}} hotel, {{called for}} the hotel book, and {{registered}} an oath, which is, therefore, copyright. I swore that in twenty-five years I would be even with him I hated. I prayed, rather inconsistently, that honour and happiness might be the lot of her I had lost. After that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not love}} my work; but {{it was good for}} me, and helped cure my sick soul. I never guessed why <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better,</b> but dug on with {{indifference}} first, then felt pride in my garden, then interest in the plants I tended, and by and by I saw what they had done for me, and loved them like true friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, dear," [...] I replied, [...] "I shall {{always love}} you. I have had many sorrows myself, and I {{know how hard}} it is to speak of them; but always when I have confided in a true friend, <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> and sorry that I had not sought relief sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, it is {{the warmth}} of the room that lends me the color, and I am already too much indebted to your skill to give you any further trouble. Miss Wharton knows that I am quite well, and I do assure you that <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> or happier in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not; but <b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>felt</b> <b>better,</b> because if {{anything}} {{has happened to}} father, though I don't say it can be possible, I'm the one who must {{take care of you}} and Margie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I lay still," [...] he said, [...] "scared {{out of my}} wits, {{with the}} fore quarter of a horse atop of me. We'd been wiped out. And the smell--good God! Like burnt meat! I was hurt across the back {{by the fall of}} the horse, and there I had to lie until <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b> Just like parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!" ...|$|E
60|$|I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And {{every time}} I waked up I thought {{somebody}} had {{me by the}} neck. So the sleep didn't do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm a-going {{to find out who}} it is that's here on the island with me; I'll find it out or bust. Well, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> right off.|$|E
6000|$|... "As a {{concession}} to my ideas of self-preservation and rectitude he promised that if I should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch, sight, taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy. After that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> and entered more cheerfully into the foul play.|$|E
5000|$|After MacArthur was {{evacuated}} to Australia, General Jonathan Wainwright {{was given}} {{command of the}} Philippine defense force. As talk of surrender began, Lapham sneaked through the lines. In his 1996 book, Lapham’s Raiders: Guerrillas in the Philippines, 1942-45, he explained why he headed to the jungles to fight: [...] "Somehow, I didn’t {{like the idea of}} surrendering. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> had <b>better</b> chances on the outside than in a Japanese prison camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|I laid {{my hand on}} his shoulder, for, though <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{how much}} <b>better</b> {{it would have been}} to walk on, I was not yet quite able. [...] "No, I can't say that, Miles." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Muriel was the speaker. And, for the moment, {{that was}} the only fact I could clearly realise. But how she came to be there and how I came to be there--and how the glass of {{champagne}} came to be there--all these were questions which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>better</b> to think out in silence, and not commit myself to any statement till I understood things a little more clearly.|$|R
60|$|We {{talked of}} birds and fishes, and of many other things, while once a big blue grouse perched on a fir bough and looked down fearlessly within reach of her, though when the {{wrinkles}} of pain had vanished Alice seemed happy to sit still in the warm sunshine speaking of nothing at all. Still, even in the silence, the bond of friendship between us was drawn tighter than it ever had been, and I knew that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> and stronger for my cousin's company.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke it was broad daylight. My {{mind was}} clear and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> than I had done for many a day, signs by which I knew that the fever had left me and that I was on the high road to recovery. Now I remembered all {{the events of the}} {{previous}} night and was able to weigh them carefully. This, to be sure, I did for many reasons, among them that I knew I had been and still was, in great danger.|$|E
60|$|When I {{had had a}} spin {{of about}} a hundred miles <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>better.</b> The bracing {{of the wind and}} the quick, exhilarating motion {{restored}} me to myself, and I felt able to cope with Master Ernest, or whatever else chagrinable might come along, without giving myself away. As Teuta had thought it better to keep silence as to Ernest's affront, I felt I must not acknowledge it; but, all the same, I determined {{to get rid of him}} before the day was much older.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This {{will not}} do,' {{he said to}} himself. 'If I {{go on like this}} I shall become a crazy fool. This must stop! I promised the doctor I would not take tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My nerves must have been getting into a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>better</b> in my life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool again.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In August 1950, Prince re-enlisted in the Canadian Army {{to fight}} with the United Nations troops in the Korean War. As he later commented, [...] "As soon as I put on my uniform <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a <b>better</b> man." [...] Re-instated with his {{previous}} rank of sergeant, Prince was {{now a member of}} the 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), the first Canadian regiment to arrive in the war zone.|$|R
60|$|When {{we should}} have been striving to build up the town once more, we spent all our time loading the ship with this {{worthless}} cargo, and indeed <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the <b>better</b> in my mind when finally Captain Newport set sail, the John and Francis loaded deeply with sand, because of believing that we were come to an end of hearing about treasure which lay at hand ready for whosoever would carry it away.|$|R
