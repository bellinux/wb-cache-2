50|$|Freeze drying is {{a recent}} {{dehydration}} breakthrough-method that is restricted to high-value foods due to the high cost associated with the process. Despite its cost, freeze-drying is very effective in retaining the overall quality and nutritional value of the food through a process called sublimation, where water is removed (evaporated) from food in its frozen state without the transition through the liquid state. Removing water from food prevents spoilage as it does not give an environment that favors the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, mould, and yeast. Freeze-drying also reduces the total weight of the food, especially fruit and vegetables that are mostly water, thus making the transportation of these products more efficient. Vegetables used in instant soup mixes often undergo freeze-drying that helps them retain their nutritional value, texture, and flavor. Furthermore, as the food remains rigid during dehydration, subliming water creates holes where the evaporated ice crystals used to be. This allows <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>foods</b> such as vegetables to retain their shape without shrinkage, and these foods rehydrate completely when water {{is added to the}} mix that fills the voids left by the subliming water. Due to the reduced water content of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>foods</b> that inhibit the growth of microorganisms and prevents enzymatic chemical reactions, these foods are considered shelf-stable and can be kept safe from spoilage for years by preventing the reabsorption of moisture. <b>Freeze-dried</b> <b>foods</b> can be stored in room temperature without the need for refrigeration.|$|R

50|$|Cooper did not {{experience}} much of an appetite during the flight and ate only because it was scheduled. The food containers and water dispenser system proved unwieldy {{and he was not}} able to properly prepare <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> packages, so he limited his consumption to cubed food and bite-sized sandwiches. Cooper found the cubed food largely unpalatable, which contributed to his lack of eating. He had no difficulty urinating during the flight and the urine collection system worked well, although transferring urine to storage bags in the cramped capsule proved difficult. Cooper took several naps during the flight, lasting about an hour each. He experienced some discomfort from the pressure suit compressing his knees, this, which he alleviated by moving his feet slightly upward. An hour and 20 minutes before retrofire, Cooper took a dextro-amphetamine tablet to ensure his alertness, he reported not feeling any sleepiness for the remainder of the flight.|$|E
50|$|Astronauts {{in later}} Mercury {{missions}} (1959-1963) disliked {{the food that}} was provided. They ate bite-sized cubes, freeze-dried powders, and tubes of semiliquids. The astronauts found it unappetizing, experienced difficulties in rehydrating the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>foods,</b> and did not like having to squeeze tubes or collect crumbs. Prior to the mission, the astronauts were also fed low residual launch-day breakfasts, to reduce the chances that they would defecate in flight.|$|R

40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} is {{the main}} chemical reaction that determines stability of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food.</b> The aim {{of this research was}} to determine the quality of lipids in 10 types of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> and in meals prepared from them. Lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method and the following parameters were determined: oxidation level (PV, AsV, CD), hydrolysis level (AV) and fatty acid composition (FA). An analysis of the level of oxidation and hydrolysis in <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> revealed a wide range of values for each analysed parameter – PV: 8 - 52 meq O 2 per 1 kg, AsV: 6 - 9 and AV: 3. 5 - 9. Adding hot water to <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> resulted, for some of the samples, in further oxidation and hydrolysis of lipids. In general, preparing meals had no significant effect on the composition of FA. General desirability of prepared meals was relatively low (average score of 4. 9 points). The characteristic that was evaluated to be the lowest was consistency (≈ 4. 9), whereas colour received the highest score (≈ 6. 8).

Weaned foods on vitamin A activity of formulated using treated cowpea flour, locally available rice flour, banana-pumpkin, skim milk powder and sugar in the ratio 35 : 35 : 15 : 15 : 5. Treated cowpea flour consisted of original cowpea flour, 24 h germinated cowpea flour. Each treated flour was mixed separately with the other ingredients and cooked into a slurry. Each mixture was either oven-dried or freeze-dried to produce a dry flaky mixture. The carotenoid composition of the product was determined by HPLC. Vitamin A activity of oven-dried weaning food was significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) compared to <b>freeze-dried</b> weaning <b>food.</b> The <b>freeze-dried</b> weaning <b>foods</b> showed a higher retinol equivalent than oven-dried weaning foods for all treatments.

40|$|In this study, {{laboratory}} experiments {{were performed to}} investigate the impact of different food types and temperatures on the reproduction and growth of the benthic foraminifer Bulimina marginata. To study reproductive success, adult specimens were kept alive at 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 ° C, and fed with either freeze-dried green algae or live diatoms. The effects of temperature, food type, and food quantity on test growth rate were studied under different combinations of these parameters. Lower temperature delayed reproduction, resulted in fewer offspring, and decreased growth rate. Fresh food produced better results than <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> probably because the latter reduces the amount of digestible compounds (carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids). In order to obtain reproduction and growth of the open marine species B. marginata in a limited period of time, we recommend keeping them at a temperature ranging 8 – 12 ° C (approximating their in situ temperature), and to feed them with fresh algae.

40|$|Samples from {{unprocessed}} {{and processed}} cooked tubers {{of the nine}} most abundant potato cultivars used to prepare the traditional <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> product, “chuño” in the central highlands of Peru were prepared and analyzed for their protein and mineral concentrations. The protein, iron, zinc and calcium concentration of cooked chuño of the nine cultivars evaluated ranged from 0. 49 to 1. 15 g, from 0. 29 to 0. 65 mg, from 0. 04 to 0. 14 mg and from 18. 9 to 31. 0 mg per 100 g on a fresh weight basis, respectively. Potatoes processed as chuño have a lower concentration of protein and zinc than unprocessed tubers, and a higher content of calcium, while iron concentration may be expected not {{to be subjected to}} changes. Water used in preparing the chuño is suggested to be the cause for an increased calcium concentration in the final product, as the water used had higher calcium content before (1. 35 mequiv. /l) than after (0. 84 mequiv. /l) use in the preparation. Thus, water seems to be source of the increased calcium concentration. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe drying of food {{products}} {{can result in}} {{significant changes in the}} chemical composition, morphology and physical properties of foods and can lead to stabilized products with longer shelf-life and easier commercialization. Information on porous structure of foods is very important, characterizing the quality and texture of dehydrated {{food products}}. Therefore, structural properties, such as porosity, bulk density and true density of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>food</b> products were investigated as affected by process conditions. Rice kernels were boiled for different time periods and agricultural products, including potato, mushroom and strawberry, were cut into cubes. The samples were frozen, tempered in liquid N 2 and freeze-dried, under various vacuum conditions, using a laboratory freeze-dryer. True density of the products was measured using a helium stereo-pycnometer. Bulk density was obtained by measuring the dimensions of the samples with a Vernier caliper. Simple mathematical models were developed in order to correlate the structural properties with process conditions. The microstructure of food products was also analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and image analysis. Bulk density of freeze-dried materials increased with the applied pressure during freeze-drying, while porosity decreased. In addition, bulk density of freeze-dried rice kernels decreased with the increment of boiling time, while porosity increased. The changes in bulk density and porosity were closely supported by microstructural observations, according to SEM images. The microstructural changes of products, freeze-dried under various vacuum conditions, can be predicted using the proposed models and image analysis...|$|E
