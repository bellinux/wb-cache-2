25|$|This {{confusion}} {{results in}} a ballot for one polling place being deposited in the ballot box corresponding to an officially different polling place, giving both an undervote for the correct polling place and an overvote for the incorrect one. According to the COFIPE (Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures), article 231 a ballot which {{is placed in the}} wrong box should be moved to the correct box if possible (as is the case, for example, if the presidential ballot is deposited in the senatorial ballot box), but should in any case be counted and reported.

2500|$|The {{estimate}} of cooperative time presented {{below is a}} minimum estimate, since data were not originally collected {{with a focus on}} recording all cooperative activity. Short cooperative activities were especially unlikely to be recorded in field notes. For example, examination of videotapes from hunting episodes during the sample period reveals that very short cooperative activities are frequently embedded into longer hunting segments that we have not coded as cooperative time. [...] While pursuing monkeys, hunters often call to others to [...] "stay put", [...] "don't make noise", [...] "don't shoot", [...] "shake a branch", [...] "pound a vine" [...] etc. [...] Other multi-hunter pursuits contain numerous similar requests. [...] The recipient of such a command almost always complies immediately, at a cost to his own chances of making the kill. [...] These events were extremely common, but of very short duration (usually only 10 seconds or so) and are not included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses.</b> Aché men spent an average of 41 (s.e. 7) minutes per day in food acquisition activities scored as cooperative, and women spent 33 (s.e. 14) minutes per day cooperating in foraging. This represents about 10% of total foraging time in the men's sample, and 11% of total foraging time in the women's sample. [...] Both sexes show some sample days with more than 50% of total foraging time being spent helping other individuals to acquire resources.|$|E

40|$|Purpose -The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse whether innovators {{perceive}} corruption to be systematically more important than non-innovators across different post-transition EU countries. Design/methodology/approach -We use the Business Environment Survey (BEEPS V) data. The sample consists of 3, 716 firms from the post-transition EU members (Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Croatia, Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia). We first estimate simple matching model, specifically, average treatment effect of the treated (ATT) framework. In order to explore the determinants of the innovation activity of <b>the</b> firms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> countries, conditional on the fact that they consider the corruption to be important obstacle for their business activity, we employ the Heckman probit procedure. Findings - The results imply that there is a link between innovation activity of the firms, perceptions of corruption and the evaluation of innovation enabling specificities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> countries. Research limitations/implications - Although the results confirm that <b>in</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> countries innovative firms perceive corruption to be major impediment for their business activity, based on this analysis we cannot argue that innovation activity would be higher if corruption perceptions were lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> countries. Originality/value - The results suggest that, in order to boost innovation, not only traditional innovation-supporting policy measures should be considered, but also wider spectrum of activities oriented towards business climate improvement...|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that body size and {{dispersal}} ability do not correlate (Jenkins et al. 2007).

50|$|Homoptera is a {{suborder}} {{of order}} Hemiptera {{that is considered}} by some taxonomists to be paraphyletic, and therefore deprecated (obsolete).

The earlier work was based on nuclear DNA, but more recent phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA suggest that Homoptera may be a monophyletic group after all, a sister group of Heteroptera. The cause of the disparity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> is suggested to be the long branch attraction effect in phylogenetic analysis, due to rapidly evolving DNA regions.|$|E
