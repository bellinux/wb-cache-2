5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E

Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Ragnarök is briefly {{referenced}} in stanza 40 of {{the poem}} Helgakviða Hundingsbana II. Here, the valkyrie Sigrún's unnamed maid <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane's burial mound. Helgi is there with a retinue of men, surprising the maid. The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if Ragnarök has occurred. In stanza 41, Helgi responds that it is neither.|$|E
5|$|The Earth <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> {{through an}} ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E

5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When the Syndicate suspect {{that one of their}} members <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is working with the Russians.|$|E

50|$|BRNN can {{be trained}} using similar {{algorithms}} compared to RNN, because the two directional neurons {{do not have any}} interactions. However, when back-propagation is applied, additional processes are needed because updating input and output layers cannot be done at once. General procedures for training are as follows: For forward pass, forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed.</b> For backward <b>pass,</b> output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> next.

5|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the Bears {{traveled}} to Lambeau Field {{to play the}} Green Bay Packers in the 189th meeting between the two rivals. The Bears had struggled regarding scoring against Green Bay in the last nine games between the two prior to 2013, and including the 2010 NFC title game, had scored 127 points, an average of 14.11 points. The two teams entered with among the top three scoring offenses, with Chicago and Green Bay ranked second and third, respectively, with 30.4 and 30.3 points per game, both of which rank behind the Denver Broncos. Among the weapons of the Packers offense that the Bears must attempt to hinder was the running game, as Green Bay's rookie running back Eddie Lacy has recorded over 100 yards per game in the previous six during the season, along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers. One of Rodgers' skills <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> balls longer than 20 yards, and was 16 of 32 on these attempts, which was tied with Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks for the highest percentage in the league; the Bears allowed 57 percent of opponents to throw for the aforementioned distance, the second-worst score in the NFL. However, both teams ranked in the bottom five in the NFL in pass rush, with the Bears being in last with only nine sacks. For Chicago, Matt Forté had gained 533 yards along with averaging 4.6 yards per run, while Josh McCown filled in for Jay Cutler. Since 2009, Bears quarterbacks besides Cutler had thrown a combined eight touchdowns and 21 interceptions against the Packers; in McCown's last start in 2011 against the Packers, he threw for 242 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions in a 35–21 losing effort.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{assumption}} that mass is conserved means that for any fixed control volume (for example, a spherical volume) – enclosed by a control surface – {{the rate of change}} of the mass contained in that volume is equal to the rate at which mass <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> through the surface from outside to inside, minus the rate at which mass <b>is</b> <b>passing</b> from inside to outside. This can be expressed as an equation in integral form over the control volume.|$|E

25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} any good pass is it being {{difficult}} to intercept.
