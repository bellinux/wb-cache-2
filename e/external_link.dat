40|$|Recently, many video sharing sites provide <b>external</b> <b>links</b> so {{that their}} video or audio {{contents}} can be embedded into external web sites. For example, users can copy the embedded URLs of the videos of YouTube and post on their own blogs. Clearly, the purpose of such functionality {{is to increase the}} distribution of the videos and the associated advertisement. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive measurement study and analysis on these <b>external</b> <b>links.</b> With the traces collected from two major VOD sites, YouTube and Youku of China, we show that the <b>external</b> <b>links</b> have various impact on the popularity of the VOD sites. More specifically, for videos that have been uploaded for eight months in Youku, around 15 % of views can come from <b>external</b> <b>links.</b> Some contents are densely linked, for example, the comedy videos can attract more than 800 <b>external</b> <b>links</b> on average. We also study the relationship between the <b>external</b> <b>links</b> and the internal links. We show that there are correlations; for example, if a video is popular itself, it will likely have a larger number of <b>external</b> <b>links.</b> Another observation is that we always find that the <b>external</b> <b>links</b> of Youku usually have a higher impact than that of YouTube. We conjecture that a more regional site may enjoy a relatively higher impact from the <b>external</b> <b>links.</b> Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R

Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury also account for a substantial number of compound failures, highlighting the need for drug screening assays, such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process. Chemicals often cause subclinical injury to the liver, which manifests only as abnormal liver enzyme tests.|$|E
25|$|Sean Humby {{created a}} variant of maka dai dai shogi called Hishigata shogi. (See the <b>external</b> <b>link</b> below.) It was {{motivated}} by criticisms that maka dai dai takes {{a very long time}} to finish, and that the more interesting pieces have little opportunity for play. The only difference is in the setup, which places the opposing pieces close together and leaves the armies' rear flanks exposed, though Humby recommends that the teaching king be played as the weaker Western variant (as a queen), probably referring to the single alternative offered by Sean Evans' ShogiVar software, which is Queen plus 3-step King with full lion power, no longer believed to be the correct move by anyone.|$|E

500|$|Sousa's {{antipathy}} to recording {{was such}} that he almost never conducted his band when it was being recorded. Nevertheless, Sousa's band made numerous recordings, the earliest being issued on cylinders by several companies, followed by many recordings on discs by the Berliner Gramophone Company and its successor, the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). The Berliner recordings were conducted by Henry Higgins (one of Sousa's cornet soloists) and Arthur Pryor (Sousa's trombone soloist and assistant conductor), with Sousa quoted as saying, [...] "I {{have never been in}} the gramophone company's office in my life." [...] A handful of the Victor recordings were actually conducted by Sousa, but most were conducted by Pryor, Herbert L. Clarke, Edwin H. Clarke, or by four of Victor's most prolific house musicians: Walter B. Rogers (who had also been a cornet soloist with Sousa), Rosario Bourdon, Josef Pasternack, and Nathaniel Shilkret. Details of the Victor recordings are available in the <b>external</b> <b>link</b> below to the EDVR.|$|E
