5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
5|$|The Earls of Argyll {{appointed}} Captains {{to oversee}} Dunstaffnage, and <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> readiness, on their behalf. Changes {{were made to}} the buildings, particularly the gatehouse, which was rebuilt around this time. The Campbells were loyal allies of the royal house, and Dunstaffnage was used as a base for government expeditions against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, among others, during the 15th and 16th centuries. James IV visited Dunstaffnage on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority and trying to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise {{that they were being}} exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
5|$|Opeth {{was formed}} in 1990 by vocalist David Isberg. He later {{recruited}} bassist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{without the consent of}} the other band members he previously hired, which resulted in the departure of all members except Isberg and Åkerfeldt. Isberg soon left, but Åkerfeldt decided to remain in the band and <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> activity. For this he contacted guitarist Peter Lindgren, bassist Johan De Farfalla, and drummer Anders Nordin. With this lineup, they recorded a demo, which led to the band’s first record label contract. Candlelight Records signed the band. In 1995, Opeth released their first studio album, Orchid, and after more changes to the lineup, the band released Morningrise and My Arms, Your Hearse in 1996 and 1997 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Golden State Warriors are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Oakland, California. The franchise {{had been known}} as the Philadelphia Warriors and the San Francisco Warriors, due to it previously being based in or near those cities. The team {{is a member of}} the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors initially joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, and won the first BAA championship title in the same year under coach Edward Gottlieb. The Warriors later joined the NBA at its foundation in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26–42 in their first NBA season and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals. Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962–63 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the area. The team became the Golden State Warriors and moved to Oakland before the 1971–72 NBA season.|$|E

5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> time with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E
25|$|An {{inflatable}} gag {{is usually}} a rubber balloon which is inflated by a hand valve. Most inflatable gags will not hold in the gagged person's mouth well, so the gag is usually paired with a ring gag to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place.|$|E

25|$|In 1953 the {{railroad}} fell into disrepair. The extensive maintenance costs were {{too much to}} <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> business and the Brandywine and Cedar Point was closed in 1954. The last regular run was made in July 1954 from the Naval Air Station to Hollywood, MD. Through the late 1950s/early 1960s, PRR trains used the line to deliver aviation fuel to the base.

Laura Hasbrouck died childless in 1964 and willed it to Richard Relyea Hasbrouck, a descendant of Maurice Hasbrouck's brother Huram, specifically to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the family, since he had two sons already.

25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. One of the biggest challenges is trying to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> one piece.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time before}} 1765 the Crows held a Sun Dance, {{attended}} by a poor Arapaho.

During the next Sun Dance, some Crows stole back the figure to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the tribe. Eventually the Arapaho made a duplicate. Later in life, he married a Kiowa woman and brought the doll with him. The Kiowas use it during the Sun Dance and recognize {{it as one of}} the most powerful tribal medicines. They still credit the Crow tribe for the origin of their sacred Tai-may figure.|$|E

In February 2011, majority owner Michael Gearon stated that the team would be seeking new investors. Various local groups announced their intent to purchase the franchise and <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta, but ultimately the team was sold to the Canadian group True North Sports & Entertainment.|$|E
