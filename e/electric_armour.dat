50|$|Since then, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory {{has been}} researching <b>Electric</b> <b>Armour,</b> {{with the view}} of {{ultimately}} integrating it into the FRES design. Plans for FRES vehicles to be carried by C-130 have also been dropped for being unworkable.|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic Armor or <b>Electric</b> <b>Armour</b> {{is a type}} of armour {{which has}} been {{proposed}} for the protection of ships from shaped charge weapons. The idea is that the system uses a strong electric field to disrupt the jet of ionized gas produced by the warhead. The system has been proposed as an upgrade to the Gerald R. Ford-class supercarriers [...]|$|E
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the ending of the Cold War, RARDE merged with other {{research}} establishments in April 1991 to form the Defence Research Agency (DRA), an executive Agency of the Ministry of Defence. In turn, DRA became a division of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) in 1995. The Chertsey and Christchurch sites were among those allocated to Qinetiq when DERA was broken up in 2001 with the intention that Qinetiq would be privatised, which happened in 2006. Technologies such as <b>electric</b> <b>armour</b> were retained within the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl).|$|E

40|$|Shaped {{charges are}} {{considered}} to be a big threat. The Dutch army frequently encounters shaped charges like RPG 7 while operating in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. Conventional armour offers only limited protection against these types of threats, within the weight restrictions. One possible countermeasure is <b>electric</b> reactive <b>armour</b> (ELRA). This armour system is not yet available, but with the growth potential of the use of electric power it is possible in the future...|$|R
5000|$|A new {{technology}} called electric reactive armour (also termed electromagnetic reactive armour, or colloquially as <b>electric</b> <b>armour)</b> is in development. This armour {{is made up}} of two or more conductive plates separated by an air gap or by an insulating material, creating a high-power capacitor. In operation, a high-voltage power source charges the armour. When an incoming body penetrates the plates, it closes the circuit to discharge the capacitor, dumping a great deal of energy into the penetrator, which may vaporize it or even turn it into a plasma, significantly diffusing the attack. It is not public knowledge whether this is supposed to function against both kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge jets, or only the latter. This technology has not yet been introduced on any known operational platform.|$|E

The results of the static experiments are used to discuss the effects responsible for the disruption of shaped-charge jets in <b>electric</b> <b>armour.</b> These effects include ohmic heating of, and current diffusion into, the rod as well as radial magnetic forces.

50|$|Reactive armor {{is a type}} {{of vehicle}} armor that reacts in some way to the impact of a weapon to reduce the damage done to the vehicle being protected. It is most {{effective}} in protecting against shaped charges and specially hardened kinetic energy penetrators. The most common type is explosive reactive armour (ERA), but variants include self-limiting explosive reactive armour (SLERA), non-energetic reactive armour (NERA), non-explosive reactive <b>armour</b> (NxRA), and <b>electric</b> reactive <b>armour.</b> NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits, unlike ERA and SLERA, but a second hit in exactly the same location may potentially penetrate any of those.|$|R
5000|$|Hogan rose to {{national}} fame working on several high-profile {{cases in the}} 1920s and 30s. His most notable case was his defense of oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny and the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company {{in a series of}} trials from 1924 to 1930. In what {{came to be known as}} the Teapot Dome scandal, Doheny was accused of bribing Interior Secretary Albert Fall to lease the the oil production rights at Elk Hills Oil Field. The company was forced to cancel its lease, but Hogan succeeded in clearing Doheny on charges of bribery and conspiracy to defraud the government. In 1935 he successfully defended Andrew Mellon on charges of tax evasion, and was featured on the cover of Time magazine the same year. Other clients included former president Warren G. Harding, the General <b>Electric</b> Company, <b>Armour</b> & Co., and Swift & Co. Reportedly, he once said that [...] "the best client is a rich man who is scared." ...|$|R
