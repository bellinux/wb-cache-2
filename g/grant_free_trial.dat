40|$|A {{monopolist}} {{can offer}} free samples or free returns to let consumers try his product. When {{the cost of}} offering <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> is negligible, the standard theory (Milgrom 1981, Grossman 1981) predicts unraveling: the monopolist always offers them to reveal his product’s quality. I show that when products differ in vertical quality and a horizontal attribute, unraveling may not occur. When consumers know the product’s vertical quality, the monopolist offers <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> for a central region of horizontal attributes. He {{is less likely to}} offer <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> when quality is higher. Mandating <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> may hurt expected consumer welfare. When consumers do not know the product’s vertical quality, the monopolist is more likely to offer <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> when quality is higher. Nevertheless, he may not offer <b>free</b> <b>trials</b> even when his product has the highest possible vertical quality...|$|R

40|$|A common {{business}} strategy to promote product adoption in software industry {{is to provide}} a <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> version with limited functionalities of the commercial product to increase the installed user base. The increase of user base will lead to higher value of the software because of positive network effects. However, offering a <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> version may cannibalize some demand of the commercial software. This paper examines the tradeoff between network effects and the cannibalization effect, and aims to uncover the conditions under which firms should introduce the <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> product. We find that when network intensity is strong, it is more profitable for a software monopoly to offer <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> than to segment the market with two versions of different qualities. In addition, this paper solves the joint decision problem of finding the optimal quality for the firm's <b>free</b> <b>trial</b> software and the optimal price of its commercial product.
