25|$|The term Parliament {{is used in}} {{a number}} of {{different}} senses. First, it refers to the institution made up of a group of people (Members of Parliament or MPs) who are elected to discuss matters of state. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> each group of MPs voted into office following a general election. In this sense, the First Parliament of the independent Republic of Singapore sat from 8 December 1965 to 8 February 1968. The current Parliament, which started on 15 January 2016, is the thirteenth.|$|E
25|$|Exercises {{that are}} used to enhance back {{strength}} may also be used to prevent back injuries. Back exercises include the prone press-ups, upper back extension, transverse abdominus bracing, and floor bridges. If pain is present in the back, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> that the stabilization muscles of the back are weak and a person needs to train the trunk musculature. Other preventative measures are to lose weight and to not work oneself past fatigue. Signs of fatigue include shaking, poor coordination, muscle burning and loss of the transverse abdominal brace. Heavy lifting should be done with the legs performing the work, and not the back.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no single}} usage of segregation; in some cases <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> the {{exclusion}} of motor vehicles and in other cases the exclusion of pedestrians as well. Thus, it includes bike lanes with solid painted lines but not lanes with dotted lines and advisory bike lanes where motor vehicles are allowed to encroach on the lane. It includes cycle tracks as physically distinct from the roadway and sidewalk (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards). And it includes bike paths {{in their own right}} of way exclusive to cycling. Paths which are shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized traffic are not considered segregated and are typically called shared use path, multi-use path in North America and shared-use footway in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two {{meanings}} for {{rechargeable batteries}} {{but only one}} for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> either {{the length of time}} a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the Zamboni pile, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The Oxford Electric Bell has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

500|$|Like {{the vision}} of Banquo's lineage, the banquet scene has also {{been the subject of}} criticism. Critics have {{questioned}} whether not one, but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene: Banquo and Duncan. Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king. [...] "Thou canst not say I did it", for example, can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo, or <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> that Duncan, who was asleep when Macbeth killed him, cannot claim to have seen his killer. To add to the confusion, some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost, such as [...] "Thy bones are marrowless", cannot rightly be said of Banquo, who has only recently died.|$|E

500|$|The {{stone was}} {{originally}} {{raised by a}} wealthy lady named Ástríðr in memory of her husband Eysteinn, and Sawyer (2000) suggests it to {{have been one of}} several stones made in a tug-of-war over inheritance. There is uncertainty as to why Eysteinn went to Greece and Jerusalem, because of the interpretation of the word sœkja (attested as sotti in the past tense). It means [...] "seek" [...] but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "attack" [...] as on the stones Sö 166 and N 184, but also [...] "visit" [...] or [...] "travel". Consequently, Eysteinn has been identified {{as one of the first}} Swedes to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but Jesch (2001) notes that judging from the other runic examples, the [...] "attack" [...] sense is more likely. The translation of sœkja as [...] "attack" [...] is also chosen by the Rundata project (see below). It is one of two Jarlabanke Runestones that mention travellers abroad, the other being U140, below.|$|E
