Only armour units have a Zone of Control, which costs an extra two movement points to pass through (German and US armour have 6 movement points per turn, enabling them to move through two zones of control, other countries' armour units only 5; US armour units, and the two German SS Panzer corps added in 1943, also have 5 strength points rather than the usual 4).

30|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that {{many studies have}} criticised Smeed’s model because it only {{concentrates}} on the motorisation level of country and ignores the impact of other variables (cf. [3, 8]). An implication {{of this is that}} effectiveness assessment of road safety measures would have little meaning because road fatalities can simply be predicted from population and vehicle numbers in any country and any year, at least at macroscopic level. Andreassen [3] criticised the model’s accuracy because there would always be a decline in traffic risk for any {{increase in the number of}} vehicles, but generally in a non-linear way, and proposed using country-specific parameters to distinguish between countries with a similar <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation.</b> The main criticism of Andreassen, however, seems to be targeted at the way that the Smeed formula was manipulated algebraically (instead of a new regression being fit to the resulting transformation). Smeed’s formula expected the downtrend in fatalities rate but not the number of absolute fatalities, which occurred in the highly motorized countries in the seventies [8].|$|E

Taking a broad view of automobility culture to include cars, infrastructure, legal systems, medical services, and populist views of motoring, it is argued that reducing the human cost <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> (and making motorised mobility more sustainable) cannot be achieved only by technical fixes to the car.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the interdependence of transport strategy and the portion of urban land given over to traffic attains its full meaning only {{in the light of}} drastically different spatial/physical characteristics of world cities. Advocates of the pro-automobile transport strategy are persistent in their support of the hypothesis that along with the increase in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorisation</b> of a population, the share of urban land needed for transport unavoidably increases. But it is exactly this spatial aspect that makes transport strategy of the large, proautomobile oriented US cities (that occupy few thousand square kilometres and have extremely low population densities), completely inadequate for the compact, densely populated cities of developing countries and countries in transition. Distinctive features of large cities of the developing world and countries in transition: monocentric, compact spatial structure and extremely high urban densities, are the main causes of extremely high volumes of motorized traffic per unit of urbanized area (in spite of their very low levels of motorization). Supply of urban roads per capita in these metropolises is not going to significantly improve, whatever length of new urban roads they (manage to) construct. That makes them completely unsuitable for pro-automobile transport strategy and, at the same time, very suitable for development of light rail and metro systems, and rigorous traffic limitation policy.

As a result, the previous lack of planning for western style car usage is now a problem for local governments. Due to this rise in car use and a shift in retail market demand, developers began constructing large shopping malls at a rapid pace, usually on the city’s outskirts, with the first mall opening in 1997.

40|$|When {{observing the}} {{development}} and operation of modern cities, one can quickly {{come to the conclusion}} that in the recent years the chief factor of the spatial-structural transformation of cities in Poland (though not only there) and the spatial behaviour of their residents has been motorisation, and more precisely, the car. This is so because the car, while facilitating and intensifying mobility, makes it possible to draw places of residence apart from those of goal implementation. The ever-growing number of cars moving around a city leads to disturbances in street traffic, makes the service of residents worse, causes many road accidents, and brings about unfavourable qualitative changes in the environment. That is why in many recent conceptions of urban development there appear measures intended to restrict the use of cars, which is one of the ways leading to the construction of ‘a city for people’.

40|$|Vehicles {{and traffic}} routes are a {{widespread}} {{potential source of}} groundwater contamination.

Impacts on human health through contaminants in groundwater from traffic are generally substantially lower than the direct health effects through, for example, injuries and deaths in accidents, air pollution, noise, and stress. Traffic associated operations and facilities to recognise in situation assessments include roads, airfields, railway lines, inland waterway transportation (rivers, lakes, canals) where surface water strongly influences groundwater, as well as pipelines for crude oil and oil derivatives (Figure 13. 1). A range of emissions of organic and inorganic substances from traffic settings may reach soils, sediments from drainage systems, or surface waters via both water and air. Some of these may partly reach groundwater.

An online survey was conducted in May 2015 with a sample size of 476 Chinese young drivers from across the country, aged between 18 and 28, including 305 males and 171 females. The results suggest that for participants who reported having a familial political background, more risky driving behaviours were reported among those participants who reported more impact on their life from that political background; while for participants without political background, higher personal income was associated with more risky driving behaviours. The findings are discussed in light of China’s political management system and potential education opportunities for young drivers...|$|R

Though these had been obtained for scrap value in the Spring of 1946, their condition was so poor that the maintenance effort needed to keep the rusty equipment operational proved to be prohibitively expensive. To solve this problem, Humber Mk IVs had to be bought from the UK. The General Staff therefore already in June 1946 considered the question whether it then would not be cheaper to restart production of the DAF M39. For the moment it was however decided to procure the American M8 Greyhound, use the Canadian Lynx version of the Daimler Armoured Car present on the dumps and to combine the turrets of old Humber cars with the more mechanically reliable Canadian Fox Armoured Car hulls, that also could be obtained from army dumps, resulting in the so-called [...] "Humfox" [...] hybrid vehicle.|$|R
