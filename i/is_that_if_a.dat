5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, {{but if the}} frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for}} the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

25|$|Various {{experts on}} the subject tried to {{determine}} what makes a Christian denomination a part of Protestantism.

25|$|Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky {{developed}} Sharkovsky's theorem on {{the periods}} of discrete dynamical systems in 1964. One {{of the implications}} of the theorem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> discrete dynamical system on the real line has a periodic point of period3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.|$|E
25|$|Usually, when composers {{require a}} chord {{that is not}} easily {{described}} using this notation, they indicate the required chord in a footnote or in the header of the music. Alternatively, chords can be specified with more detailed numbers. For example, if the composer wants a C9 chord with no seventh, she can write C9 (no 7th), because the normal rule in jazz <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> ninth chord is requested, the seventh is assumed.|$|E
30|$|The {{principle}} {{is used in}} the above steps to find a candidate 2 â€”itemset C 2 based on L 1 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> itemset <b>is</b> frequent, then all its subsets are also bound to be frequent.|$|R
50|$|The court's {{interpretation}} of this <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> minority union asks for, but does not succeed in acquiring, the organisational rights in question, and if conciliation subsequently fails, the dispute-resolution mechanism is to strike for it.|$|R
50|$|The phrase {{originated}} {{during the}} vaudeville era and was popularized in movies by Groucho Marx. The belief <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> new show <b>was</b> successful in Peoria, a main Midwestern stop for vaudeville acts, {{it would be}} successful anywhere.|$|R
25|$|On 19 April 2006, Ofcom ruled that, {{on request}} of each {{multiplex}} operator, the 'free-to-air channels only' requirement {{put in place}} at the launch of Freeview in 2002 may be lifted on Multiplex B, C and D. The effect of this ruling <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> Mux operator requests the restriction to be lifted, their multiplex may carry pay TV services. Ofcom says that the digital television market has changed significantly since 2002. Consequently, it believes that this restriction is no longer required.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} procedure is simple {{both for the}} surgeon, involving very few risks for the experienced ear surgeon. For the patient, minimal discomfort and pain is reported. Patients may experience numbness of {{the area around the}} implant as small superficial nerves in the skin are sectioned during the procedure. This often disappears after some time. There is no risk of further hearing loss due to the surgery. One important feature of the Baha <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> patient for whatever reason does not want to continue with the arrangement, it takes the surgeon less than a minute to remove it. The Baha does not restrict the wearer from any activities such as outdoor life, sporting activities etc.|$|E
25|$|The Minister of Internal Affairs may {{refuse to}} {{register}} the renunciation of New Zealand citizenship of a person if they are living in New Zealand or if {{a state of war}} exists between New Zealand and another country. The general practice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> New Zealand citizen is in New Zealand at the time of applying to renounce their citizenship, the Minister of Internal Affairs will only register the renunciation if the person would continue to reside in New Zealand lawfully following the renunciation (e.g. if they are also an Australian citizen or has a residence permit) or if the person will leave New Zealand permanently following the registration of the renunciation.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of this system (at least for the theatre management) <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> programme <b>was</b> running a few minutes late for any reason, the projectionist would simply omit one (or more) reels of film to recover the time.|$|R
50|$|For spacecraft, {{the main}} concern <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> {{accident}} <b>were</b> to occur during launch or a subsequent passage of a spacecraft close to Earth, harmful material could be released into the atmosphere; therefore their use in spacecraft and elsewhere has attracted controversy.|$|R
50|$|Some {{examples}} of this in practice <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> patient whose endoscopy did not detect dysplasia on biopsy during screening for Barrett's esophagus, then research shows <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> little chance of any test detecting dysplasia for that patient within three years.|$|R
25|$|It {{initially}} produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and {{headache and}} can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma {{and death in}} 10% of cases. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital. This means that laboratory tests {{may be less likely}} to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is {{based on the idea that}} the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death.|$|E
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E
25|$|Some colleges {{offer this}} type of admission, {{typically}} used by schools {{with large numbers of}} applicants, which means that colleges are continually receiving applications and making decisions, typically within four to six weeks after application. It allows prospective students to apply at any time between the fall and spring and to receive their result a few weeks later. One benefit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> student is accepted early in the school year, there is less anxiety about acceptance {{for the rest of the}} year. Rolling admission schools are also beneficial to students who are rejected from all the schools they applied regularly to, yet still wish to enroll without taking a gap year. Guidance counselors suggest that rolling admissions should not be used late in twelfth grade since financial aid money may have already been distributed, and few slots may be left for September. One advisor suggests that if a college offers rolling admissions and is on a student's list, then it should be applied to as soon as rolling admissions becomes available for that year. Another report suggested that rolling admissions was more characteristic of noncompetitive colleges.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the rules}} of thumb in human {{resources}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> individual who has an ADA-defined disability cannot take a test, then nobody can. As a result, tests <b>that</b> cannot <b>be</b> adapted for use by those individuals will not be used by a company.|$|R
5000|$|Dependency injection: The {{basic idea}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> object depends upon having an {{instance}} of some other object then the needed object is [...] "injected" [...] into the dependent object; for example, being passed a database connection as an argument to the constructor instead of creating one internally.|$|R
50|$|Another {{punishment}} in the Roman Military only applied to {{people involved in}} the prison system; this rule <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> prisoner died due to the {{punishment in}}flicted by Roman legionaries, unless he was given the death penalty, then the leader of the troops would be given the same punishment.|$|R
25|$|Closed mode systems, by definition, {{are closed}} without a vent. When making {{measurement}}s, closed systems take a CO2 measurement of ambient air {{just after the}} soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO2 reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals {{over the next few}} minutes until a final CO2 concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, {{it is important that the}} experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO2 pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO2 from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO2 pressure buildup from being a significant issue.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} {{case of a}} contractual breach, the performance that was owed will merely be the payment of a provable debt (an agreed sum of money). In this case, the Sale of Goods Act 1979 section 49 allows for a summary action for price of goods or services, meaning a quick set of court procedure rules are followed. Consumers also benefit under sections 48A-E, with a specific {{right to have a}} broken product to be repaired. An added benefit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> claimant brings an action for debt, she or he will have no further duty to mitigate his loss. This was another requirement that common law courts had invented, before a claim for breach of contract could be enforced. For instance, in contracts for services that spanned {{a long period of time}} (e.g. 5 years), the courts would often state that because a claimant should be able to find alternative work in a few months, and so should not receive money for the whole contract's duration. However, White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor an advertising company had a contract to display adverts for McGregor's garage business on public dustbins. McGregor said he wished to cancel the deal, but White & Carter Ltd refused, displayed the adverts anyway, and demanded the full sum of money. McGregor argued that they should have attempted to mitigate their loss by finding other clients, but the majority of the Lords held there was no further duty to mitigate. Claims in debt were different from damages.|$|E
500|$|Plantinga {{responds}} that [...] "What {{is important}} {{about the idea}} of transworld depravity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrongâ€”that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil" [...] and that it is logically possible that every person suffers from transworld depravity.|$|E

500|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence {{has been developed}} further to produce more realistic actions from the NPCs.

Another improvement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> player were to use [...] "Force pull" [...] to take weapons away from enemies in Dark Forces II, the enemies would walk around doing nothing; by contrast, in Mysteries of the Sith the enemies attempt to defeat the player by punching them.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} other {{tradition}}s at FIU that are not spirit-related. The [...] "Kissing Bridge" [...] tradition in Turtle Pond in between the Ryder Business Building and Green Library. The tradition {{is that if you}} kiss someone on the bridge you will stay with them forever. The top floor of Green Library is said to be haunted; students have reported a friendly ghost that wanders the halls minutes before the library closes at night. Another superstition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> student steps on the university seal engraved in front of the Graham Center and in the WUC at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the university's student union, it is said that they will delay their graduation for many years, or never graduate at all, and thus even on crowded days, students go around the seal to avoid stepping on it (a variation based on superstitions from hundreds of universities nationwide).|$|E
