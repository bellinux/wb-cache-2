50|$|In a {{possible}} future chronicled in the exclusive comic book available at BotCon 2005, Bumblebee featured as the espionage {{director of the}} Autobots. Having been {{on the trail of}} the Decepticon agent <b>Flamewar</b> for a long time, Bumblebee interrupts a communication between <b>Flamewar</b> and the Tripredacus Council and reveals that his agent, Ricochet, has installed a degenerative virus into Deathsaurus's clone army. With <b>Flamewar</b> now exposed, Bumblebee points out that she {{was nothing more than a}} liability to the Council, who blow her ship up.|$|E
5000|$|Best <b>Flamewar</b> Ever (2007). Best <b>Flamewar</b> Ever is a dual channel {{animation}} work presenting {{conversations between}} Everquest players. Art critic Zehra Jumabhoy describes the players' conversation depicted in ArtForum: [...] "Their {{discussion of the}} game rapidly morphs into an excuse to trade insults, revealing the masculinity-obsessed aggression lurking behind even such seemingly innocent flights of fancy." ...|$|E
50|$|Popular culture {{continues}} to generate {{large amounts of}} flaming and countless <b>flamewars</b> across the Internet, such as the constant debates between fans of Star Trek and Star Wars. Ongoing discussion of current celebrities and television personalities within popular culture also frequently sparks debate.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the comment}} section was open for any {{registered}} user, it was sometimes abused by spammers, attempting {{to promote a}} site’s PageRank by mentioning their sites. However, much of this content was removed by Google's Answers team. The site was also infested with trolls who would use carefully crafted messages to trigger <b>flamewars</b> or make political statements.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known on Usenet for his famous (or infamous) [...] "Happynet Proclamation" [...] (1992), {{circulated}} to many newsgroups, some absurdly unrelated, which satirised the endless <b>flamewars</b> on the network, with Parry posing as a godlike being issuing an edict full of in-jokes and humor targets that claimed to unify all news into one glorious totality, [...] "happynet". In the article, Kibo claimed that: ...|$|R

50|$|Before {{publisher}} Take-Two Interactive released Battlecruiser 3000AD in September 1996, it had generated one of {{the longest}} and largest flame wars in the history of Usenet. This <b>flamewar</b> lasted for several years, garnered over 70,000 posts, and yielded a series of sites that documented and parodied its history.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, author Anne Rice became {{involved}} in a <b>flamewar</b> of sorts on the review boards of online retailer Amazon.com after several reviewers posted scathing comments about her latest novel. Rice responded to the comments with her own lengthy response, which was quickly met with more feedback from users.|$|E
5000|$|A {{technique}} dubbed splat out {{was used}} by Usenet moderators to prevent <b>flamewars,</b> by substituting a [...] "splat" [...] (i.e., asterisk) for some letters, often the vowels, of highly charged words in postings. Examples include Nazi→N*z*, evolution→*v*l*t**n, gun control→g*n c*ntr*l. [...] "The purpose {{is not to make}} the word unrecognizable but to make it a mention rather than a use." [...] The term [...] "disemvoweling" [...] —attested from 1990 — was occasionally used for the splat-out of vowels.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} made in 2002 to use BitKeeper for Linux kernel development was a controversial one. Some, including GNU Project founder Richard Stallman, {{expressed concern about}} proprietary tools being used on a flagship free project. While project leader Linus Torvalds and other core developers adopted BitKeeper, several key developers (including Linux veteran Alan Cox) refused to do so, citing the BitMover license, and voicing concern that the project was ceding some control to a proprietary developer. To mitigate these concerns, BitMover added gateways which allowed limited interoperation between the Linux BitKeeper servers (maintained by BitMover) and developers using CVS and Subversion. Even after this addition, <b>flamewars</b> occasionally broke out on the Linux kernel mailing list, often involving key kernel developers and BitMover CEO Larry McVoy, {{who is also a}} Linux developer.|$|R
50|$|Common {{rules for}} e-mail and Usenet such as {{avoiding}} <b>flamewars</b> and spam are constant across most mediums and communities. Another rule {{is to avoid}} typing in all caps or grossly enlarging script for emphasis, which {{is considered to be}} the equivalent of shouting or yelling. Other commonly shared points, such as remembering that one's posts are (or can easily be made) public, are generally intuitively understood by publishers of Web pages and posters to Usenet, although this rule is somewhat flexible depending on the environment. On more private protocols, however, such as e-mail and SMS, some users take the privacy of their posts for granted. One-on-one communications, such as private messages on chat forums and direct SMSs, may be considered more private than other such protocols, but infamous breaches surround even these relatively private media. For example, Paris Hilton's Sidekick PDA was cracked in 2005, resulting in the publication of her private photos, SMS history, address book, etc.|$|R
5000|$|In Transformers: Legends, Hunting parties led by Slipstream and <b>Flamewar</b> {{managed to}} stop the Female Autobots (referred to in-game as [...] "Elita One's Squadron"). It is unclear what [...] "stopped" [...] means in this context, as in-continuity {{information}} about the Fatal Furies event was limited to two brief blurbs.|$|E
50|$|The Arcee/Ariel toy (Arcees main {{color was}} salmon-pink, while Ariels was Japanese pink) was later repainted green and aqua as the Aerial Paradron Type in Japan, in {{the colors of}} Generation 1 Paradron Medic. She was again repainted (black) as Transformers: Timelines <b>Flamewar</b> and her head remolded as Transformers: Timelines Chromia and Flareup.|$|E
50|$|Slipstream {{appears in}} the iOS card game Transformers Legends, which takes place in an {{alternate}} Generation 1 timeline. Slipstream is a rare card. Though taking place in G1, her bio states she is a clone of Starscream, as in Animated. Slipstream and <b>Flamewar</b> were tasked with hunting down and capturing Elita One's squadron of Female Autobots that was attacking Decepticon bases. They succeeded at stopping the Autobots. Secretly allying herself with the Quintessons, Slipstream entered the Galactic Games {{in an effort to}} disrupt the spirit of cooperation the games represented between the Autobots and their allies. She was eventually found out and stopped by Drift and Cosmos.|$|E
40|$|The Internet Text is an {{extended}} {{analysis of the}} environment of Internet communication, {{an extended}} meditation on the psychology and philosophy of Net exchange. As such, it is concerned primarily with virtual or electronic subjectivity – the simultaneous presence and absence of the user, the sorts of libidinal projections that result, the nature of <b>flamewars,</b> and the ontological or epistemological issues that underlie these processes. Internet Text begins with a brief, almost corrosive, account of the subject – an account based on the concepts of Address, Protocol, and Recognition. This section “reduces” virtual subjectivity to packets of information, Internet sputterings, and an ontology of the self based on Otherness – your recognition of me is responsible for my Net-presence. The reduction then begins to break down {{through a series of}} further texts detailing the nature of this presence; a nature which is both sexualized/gendered, and absenting, the result of an imaginary site. Eventually, it has become clear that everything revolves around issues of the virtual subject, who is only virtual on the Net, but who has a very real body elsewhere. So Internet Text has evolved more and more in a meditation on this subject – a subject which will perhaps be one of the dominant modes of being within the next millennium. Finally, {{it should be noted that}} there are no conclusions to be drawn in Internet Text, no series of protocol statements or declarations creating any sort of ultimate defining or explanatory position. The entire history of philosophy mitigates against this; instead, I side with the Schlegels, with Nietzsche, Bataille, Jabes, and others, for whom the fragment is crucial to an understanding of contemporary life [...] . It is dedicated to Michael Current and Clara Hielo...|$|R
5000|$|During this time, another design idea called EvStack {{also added}} to the <b>flamewar.</b> EvStack was a pretty much {{complete}} redesign of the input and output subsystem that allowed for events (thus the [...] "Ev") to flow through a [...] "Stack" [...] of modules that can be configured to manipulate them. EvStack {{is a very powerful}} concept, allowing e.g. to have two keyboards attached to the same machine, one operating a text console on one graphics adapter and one operating a graphics console on the other (as was demonstrated on the Linux-Kongreß ´97) and even allows for having different keyboard layouts on different virtual consoles or attaching keyboards via network. However this came at the price of a huge patch to the input subsystem which did not seem acceptable. The modern Linux input event system allows programs (e.g. Xorg) to receive keyboard events other than through the console keyboard, allowing multiseat operation.|$|E
5000|$|This project {{started in}} May 2003 from {{an idea of}} DiscreetFX, a firm based in United States (Chicago, Illinois) which {{supports}} still existing Amiga Video Toaster market and produces and sells programs and Digital/FX sample collections for amateur, professional and broadcast studios customers. The AmiZilla project started {{in the form of}} bounty contest (i.e. donors uses internet online funding & money-transfer resources like PayPal to donate a free amount of money, which will be collected as a whole [...] "booty" [...] sum of money and then used to [...] "pay" [...] the person or the team who proves himself to be capable of realizing the whole project). The project was announced on Amigaworld Portal on May 19, 2003 with an amount of 1000 US Dollars, and in only one day it collected 2000 dollars by donations, climbing from 1000 to 3000 dollars. Noteworthy for a very little community of users, by June 11, 2003 it had reached more than 4000 US$, and this enormous effort, and the rapid rampage in collecting money by the Amiga users (who were considered a sparse community) was noted also by Mozillazine online news portal, and by Slashdot.org online magazine.As of 2007, a port of Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine was achieved, while a recompile of NSPR was in pre-alpha development. In the intentions of the support team, the future goals of the project included better support through the cairo 2D graphics library which is slated for integration into the codebase of Firefox 3 (code-named Gran Paradiso), that was already ported to the Amiga platform. The AmiZilla project was closed November 19, 2009 without realizing significant results mainly due to the retirement of a contribution of over $5,000 donated by a former Netscape executive who wanted to keep his anonymity and was tired of waiting for results that never come. The project during its entire life was capable to raise the noteworthy sum of $11,869.64 (as been evidenced in the page of donors at its site). Part of this amount of money was then transferred to TimberWolf browser bounty, and {{the main part of the}} money was given back to the former donors. The abrupt closing of the AmiZilla project caused a vaste echo in Amiga community and started a <b>flamewar</b> on Amiga community discussion sites, because just some day before Amizilla Project ceased its operations, it were released to public the first screenshots of TimberWolf Browser by Friedens bothers. Some members of the Amiga community thought Timberwolf should be considered as the candidate to win the whole booty amount of money collected by the AmiZilla Project. But many others disagreed since Timberwolf had its own Bounty, set of rules and requirements and was only for Amiga OS 4.1.|$|E
