5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to <b>him</b> <b>than</b> his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} the {{legislative}} session, Breckinridge made daily visits with Henry Clay, who lay dying in Lexington, and was chosen to deliver his eulogy in Congress when the next session commenced. The eulogy enhanced his popularity and solidified his position as Clay's political heir apparent. He also campaigned for the election of Democrat Franklin Pierce as president. Although Pierce lost Kentucky by 3,200 votes, Breckinridge wielded more influence with <b>him</b> <b>than</b> he had with outgoing Whig President Millard Fillmore. A week after his inauguration, Pierce offered Breckinridge an appointment as governor of Washington Territory. He had initially sought the appointment, securing letters of recommendation from Powell and Butler, {{but by the time}} it was offered, he had decided to stay in Kentucky and seek re-election to the House.|$|E
5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to <b>him</b> <b>than</b> she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of <b>him</b> <b>than</b> the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman was by far the oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to <b>him</b> <b>than</b> other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) becomes Jack's office assistant, {{replacing}} {{his former}} assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy). Kenneth asks Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{to feed his}} bird, as he is busy with two jobs now. Kenneth asks Tracy not to enter his bedroom, a request that makes Tracy curious. Believing Kenneth might be a serial killer, he tells Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and they decide to investigate Kenneth's bedroom. At Kenneth's apartment, they discover a bug bomb in his room, and reaching the conclusion that Kenneth is trying to poison them and they run out of his apartment. They forget {{to close the door}} and the bug bomb ends up killing the bird. When they tell Kenneth about his bird, he is more upset by the fact that Tracy and Jenna did not trust <b>him,</b> <b>than</b> the death of his bird. Tracy and Jenna, feeling horrible about what they have done, arrange a surprise for Kenneth at his apartment. When Kenneth goes home, he finds an entire collection of birds.|$|E

When Quagmire goes to Vermont to buy him a {{birthday}} present, they decide to shave James as a prank, but it backfires when Peter accidentally kills him. He and Brian decide to hide his body, but are pulled over by the police who, after ignoring Peter's blood stains and beer, arrest Brian when they find him in possession of cannabis. He is bailed out by the family and put on probation for drug use. He attempts to use Stewie's urine when Joe arrives to perform a drug test, only to be caught by Lois, who chastises him for going to such lengths and tells him that he has to change if he intends on doing so. However, Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog. He and Stewie perform an enthusiastic musical number, and soon after the entire town rallies behind them in their cause.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{for this}} period in Kentish history include the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk. Bede was {{interested}} primarily in England's Christianization. Since Æthelberht {{was the first}} Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity, Bede provides more substantial information about <b>him</b> <b>than</b> about any earlier king. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled c. 890 {{in the kingdom of}} Wessex, mentions several events in Kent during Æthelberht's reign. Further mention of events in Kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the Franks by Gregory of Tours. This is the earliest surviving source to mention any Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Some of Pope Gregory the Great's letters concern the mission of St. Augustine to Kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours. Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). Although no originals survive from Æthelberht's reign, later copies exist. A law code from Æthelberht's reign also survives.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with <b>him</b> <b>than</b> their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E
