5000|$|Portugal claims de jure {{sovereignty}} over Olivenza on the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> the Treaty of Badajoz, {{since it was}} revoked by its own terms. The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation, and that happened when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807. Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 (which Spain signed in 1817) that states that the winning countries are [...] "committed to employ the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority" [...] and that the winning countries [...] "recognize that the return of Olivenza and its territories must be done". Thus, {{the border between the}} two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297.|$|R

30|$|The high-resolution, frequency-stepped {{chirp signal}} {{can be applied}} to radar systems {{employing}} narrow-bandwidth chirp pulses, in order to enhance the range resolution, and to implement SAR/ISAR imaging capabilities. This paper analyzes the effect of moving targets on the synthetic high-resolution range profile obtained using this signal waveform. Some constraints are presented for compensation of the radial motion from shift and amplitude depression of the synthetic range profile. By transmitting two chirp pulses with the same carrier frequency in a pulse-set, a method <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> clutter <b>cancellation</b> is designed with respect to this signal format. Finally, our simulation data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.|$|R
25|$|On Monday 12 August 2002, Scillonian III {{could not}} sail {{because of a}} {{technical}} fault, leaving hundreds of tourists temporarily stranded on St Mary's. The ferry had to remain docked in Penzance while engineers worked on the fault. Travellers booked in for the sailing were advised to make alternative arrangements; however British International and Skybus services struggled {{to cope with the}} massive extra demand for seats, the problem made worse by one of British International’s two helicopters being <b>grounded.</b> <b>Cancellation</b> <b>of</b> Scillonian IIIs sailing mainly affected day trip passengers to Scilly and visitors staying in guesthouses, as in many cases they could not be re-accommodated in the same guesthouse. Freight services to St Mary's were also disrupted by the cancellation, so Gry Maritha had to make a re-scheduled Monday night sailing to deliver fruit and vegetables to the Isles of Scilly.|$|R
50|$|Georges Fenech was re-elected in 2007. On 27 March 2008 the Conseil Constitutionnel {{canceled}} {{his re-election}} on the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> violation {{of campaign finance}} laws and made him ineligible for one year. However, the Conseil Constitutionnel said that the violation was of a formal nature and that the automatic penalty <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> might be not appropriate. Georges Fenech protested the decision. Following such cancellation, the Parliament amended the law so {{that this type of}} violation does not imply <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> the election.|$|R
50|$|Peak windspeeds of 150 km/h, were {{recorded}} in Nagasaki upon landfall, including a 162 km/h wind gust in Shikoku town of Muroto just after 05:30 UTC. Strong winds overturned vehicles, collapsed scaffolding, and left 68,500 homes without power in Nagasaki and Kumamoto prefectures; other blackouts occurred in the prefectures of Oita, Miyazaki and Kagoshima. Around 3,000 airline passengers were affected by the <b>grounding</b> and <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> at least 47 flights. Heavy rains and strong winds disrupted numerous train services including the iconic Shinkansen, between Hakata and Kagoshima-Chuo in Kyushu. Evacuation advisories were issued to at least 20,000 residents due to fears of possible flooding and landslides, especially in the Niigata, Toyama and Nagano prefectures that had experienced rainfall accumulations of up to 300 mm (12 in) in the preceding hours. In Hamada, Shimane, over 80 mm (3.1 in) fell in an hour.|$|R

The {{results of this study suggest}} that the number <b>of</b> <b>cancellations</b> on medical <b>grounds</b> would be reduced by closer liaison with general practitioners, and the establishment of preadmission clinics. Ensuring that only consultants book patients for surgery would also reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>cancellations</b> due to incorrect indications for surgery...|$|R
