40|$|Gossypol is {{a yellow}} pigment {{occurring}} {{in all parts}} of cotton plants, with the highest levels found in seeds, and it exhibits a variety of toxic effects. Few data are available on the content of gossypol in the commercial complementary feed and in feed raw materials. The present study was focused on the investigation of the presence of <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> in commercial complementary feed not containing cotton. A total of 50 samples of commercial complementary feed for dairy cows were performed in 29 feed mills both using and not using cotton as feed material. The <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> contamination resulted under the detection limit of the technique (4 mg/kg) in 12 out of 50 samples analysed and ranged from 4 to 20 mg/kg in 28 samples. In 10 samples the level of <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> ranged from 20 to 29. 5 mg/kg. Average contamination of samples was 12. 2 ± 9. 2 SD mg/kg. No significant difference (P= 0. 571) was shown in <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> concentration between feed produced in cotton free plants and in plants where cotton is used as feed material. <b>Free</b> <b>gossypol</b> content detected in the present study allows considering complementary feed for dairy cows not at risk. On the other hand, the detection of <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> in cotton free complementary feed, probably attributable to cross contamination of feed materials upstream of the feed mill, should be further investigated...|$|E

The <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> content of cottonseed meal (CSM) is commonly determined by the American Oil Chemists ’ Society (AOCS) wet chemistry method. The AOCS method, however, is laboratory-intensive, time-consuming, and therefore, not practical for quick field analyses. To determine if the <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> content of CSM could be predicted by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), CSM samples were collected {{from all over the}} world. All CSM samples were ground and a portion of each analyzed for <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> by the AOCS procedure (reference data) and by NIRS (reflectance data). Both reflectance and reference data were combined in a calibration. The coefficient of determination (r 2) and standard error of prediction (SEP) were used to assess the calibration accuracy. The r 2 was 0. 728, and the SEP was 0. 034 for the initial calibration that included samples from all over the world. However, the r 2 and SEP improved to 0. 921 and 0. 014, respectively, if the calibration was made using CSM samples only from the United States. These results indicate that a general prediction equation can be developed to predict the <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> content of CSM by NIRS.

40|$|Ingestion of gossypol, {{depended}} on animal species, age and sex, leads in loss of appetite, diarrhea, infertility, disrupted oestrus cycle in female animals, anemia, erythrocyte osmotic fragility, heart failure and many more. Toxicosis due to gossypol feeding is time and dose depended. The latest European Commission Directive {{has set up}} specific maximum limits for <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> in complete feedingstuffs. Cotton by-products are used widely but thoughtless in our country for the diet of small ruminants despite the possibility of toxicosis. The opinion that prevails between breeders is that {{with the increase of}} quantity of cottonseed or cottonseed meal in the animal feed they will increase also the milk production of sheeps and their fertility due to the big content in proteins. For this reason a lot of breeders prefer to feed the animals before their reproductive period with cottonseed or cottonseed meal in big quantities. The content of feedingstuffs in gossypol that were fixed by the European Union are not toxic for the organism of rams, but there is no data concerning the potential effect of gossypol on the reproductive system. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential effect of <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> content in cottonseed on the reproductive system of Chios rams. According to the requirements, two groups (control and treated) of 6 Chios rams, consisted of 15 -month old animals respectively, were employed throughout. Treated group were fed a meal with the presence of whole cottonseed and estimated to ingest an average 500 ppm <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> per day throughout the trial period of 6 months. The control group were fed a soybean meal free of gossypol for the same period of time. Both supplements were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Scrotal circumference, body weight gain and blood sampling for plasma testosterone determinations was carried out at 2 -week intervals; blood was drawn from each animal at 30 -min intervals for a total period of 6 hours. Semen collection was carried out every week in order to assess the "qualitative" and "quantitative" semen characteristics and the nuclear chromatin instability. Following the termination of the treatment period, all animals were sacrificed and testis, epididymis, kidney suprarenal glands and liver samples were collected for histopathological examination. Statistical analysis of the obtained data yielded the following results: 1. There was no difference is scrotal circumference or body weight gain between the two experimental groups. 2. Gossypol treatment had adverse effect on the "qualitative" semen characteristics (semen density, viability, sperm abnormalities) compared to control animals. 3. Gossypol treatment had no effect on the germ cells contained within the germinal epithelium. 4. Gossypol treatment had a destabilizing effect on nuclear chromatin of ram spermatozoa compared to control animals. 5.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of including cottonseed cake in rations for weaned growing pigs. Thirty-two Landrace x Large White pigs, weighing 20 - 24 kg, were included in four blocks formed on the basis of initial weight within sex in an otherwise completely randomized block design. The pigs were killed when they reached a live weight of 75. 0 +/- 2. 0 kg and the half careases were analysed into cuts and the weights of the organs were recorded. An estimate of the productivity of the pigs on each diet was calculated. Cottonseed cake reduced the voluntary feed intake (p < 0. 001) and live weight gains (p < 0. 001) and increased the heart, kidney and liver weights (p < 0. 01). The pigs on the soya bean-based control diet took the shortest time to reach slaughter weight.

40|$|FOR simple-stomached animals, the {{nutritional}} value of cottonseed meal is determined primarily by its protein value; however, this protein evaluation {{is complicated by}} the fact that the cotton-seed contains gossypol, a yellow pigment that is harmless to ruminants, but toxic to poultry, swine, and rats (Hale and Lyman, 1948). If cottonseeds are sub-jected to heat, moisture, pressure, and shearing action during oil removal, most of the gossypol becomes bound into an unavailable form. The processing tech-niques that are most effective in reducing the available gossypol are, unfortunately, also most harmful to protein quality (Altschul, 1954). In the present work, the protein quality of a number of meal samples was deter-mined by a chick assay procedure in which all the amino acids of the diet came from the sample under study. No whole grains were used since these contribute signifi-cant amounts of amino acids that may affect the evaluation of the cottonseed proteins.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cottonseed coproducts contain {{gossypol}} {{which can}} have specific effects upon the male reproductive system. We evaluated the reproductive development of male lambs close to puberty fed on three cotton coproducts. Twenty-four 5 -month old male lambs received four diets: 20 % of dry matter intake of whole cottonseed (WCS), high oil cottonseed meal (CSC), cottonseed meal (CSM), and {{a control group}} (CTL) without any cottonseed coproducts. <b>Free</b> <b>gossypol</b> intake was 16. 32, 6. 98, 5. 47 and 0 mg kg− 1 BW− 1 d− 1 for WCS, CSC, CSM and CTL, respectively.

The CTL group had higher testosterone concentrations than CSC {{at the end of}} the trial and lower total sperm defects, higher mass movement and higher scores for seminiferous epithelium than other treatments. The WCS and CSC groups showed higher levels of segmental aplasia lesion in sperm than other diets, which showed that high levels of gossypol led to higher occurrence of this lesion.

40|$|Gossypol, a {{polyphenol}} compound {{produced by}} cotton plant, has proven reproductive toxicity, but {{the effects of}} gossypol on sheep ovaries are unknown. This study was aimed to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of gossypol on the ovarian follicles of sheep. This trial was divided into two experiments. In the first one, we used twelve non-pregnant, nulliparous, Santa Inês crossbred ewes, which were randomly distributed into two equal groups and fed diets with and without cottonseed cake. Feed was offered at 1. 5 % of the animal's body weight for 63 days. The concentrations of total and <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> in the cottonseed cake were 3. 28 mg/g and 0. 11 mg/g, respectively. Throughout the trial period, no animal showed clinical signs of toxicity and no effects on body weight were observed. However, there was a significantly lower number of viable ovarian follicles (20. 6 %) and higher number of atretic follicles (79. 4 %) in the gossypol-fed sheep compared to the control (85. 1 and 34. 9 %, respectively). These findings were observed at all stages of follicular development. In the second experiment, eight ovaries from slaughterhouse were cultured with different concentrations of gossypol acetic acid (0, 5, 10 and 20 μg/mL) for 24 hours or seven days. The in vitro action of gossypol resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} viable ovarian follicles, especially the primary and transition follicles, and {{a significant increase in the}} number of atretic follicles after 24 hours of culture.

40|$|A {{series of}} indoor {{experiments}} were conducted at Massey University and AgResearch Grasslands, Palmerston North, New Zealand, {{to study the}} effect of cottonseed condensed tannin (CT) upon the nutritional value of solvent extracted cottonseed meal (CSM) for ruminant and monogastric livestock. Ruminant nutrition experiments were conducted using samples suspended in situ in the rumen of fistulated sheep and by incubating samples with rumen fluid in vitro, to study effects upon solubility and degradability of cottonseed proteins. Monogastric nutrition experiments were done initially with laboratory rats {{as a model for}} production animals such as the pig, and then with pigs. In all cases half of the animals were supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW 3500). PEG specifically binds and inactivates CT and can be used to deduce the effects of CT by comparing control animals (CT acting) with PEG supplemented animals (CT inactivated). 1. Experimental varieties of cottonseed and of industrial CSM were analysed for extractable and bound CT and <b>free</b> <b>gossypol,</b> crude protein, oil and fibre. CT was present in the hulls of all varieties, with higher concentrations recorded for high tannin and glandless selections (55 g kg- 1 and 58 g kg- 1 DM) than for the multiple host plant resistant and high gossypol selections (38 g kg- 1 DM). CT was present in trace amounts in the kernels of high tannin selections, but was not detected in the kernels of all other selections. On average for the hulls of all varieties, approximately 22, 60 and 18 % of total CT was present in the extractable, protein-bound and fibre-bound forms, respectively. <b>Free</b> <b>gossypol</b> was mainly found in the kernels, with negligible amounts being found in the hulls of the experimental varieties. Kernels of high gossypol selections contained higher concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> (18 g kg- 1 DM) than kernels of multiple host plant resistant, high tannin and commercial selections (10 - 12 g kg- 1 DM), with <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> concentration being very low (0. 8 g kg- 1 DM) in the kernels of glandless cottonseed. A negative correlation (r = - 0. 50, P 10, 000) fraction affords an estimate of endogenous loss. Inclusion of hulls in the EHC based diet increased ileal flow of total N (1387 vs. 1623 mg kg- 1 dry matter intake; p< 0. 05), increased ileal flow of total amino acids (23 %; p< 0. 01), and significantly increased ileal flow of several individual amino acids. There was no significant effect of PEG and no PEG x diet interaction, showing that the hull effects could not be explained by action of CT. The presence of some hulls in commercial CSM will contribute to lowering apparent ileal amino acid digestibility, due to its effect in increasing endogenous loss. 5. The effect of adding cottonseed hulls to casein and to cottonseed kernel based diets on the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids, and the proportion of this effect accounted for by CT, was determined using the growing rat. Sixty rats were allocated randomly to 10 semi-synthetic diets, containing either casein (4 diets) or purified unheated solvent-extracted cottonseed kernel (6 diets) as the sole protein sources, with chromic oxide added as an indigestible marker. Two of the casein diets contained no hulls whilst the remaining two diets contained 70 g hulls kg- 1. Two of the cottonseed kernel based diets contained no hulls, with two containing 23 g hulls kg- 1 and the remaining two containing 46 g hulls kg- 1. For each pair of diets, PEG was either included or excluded. Samples of digesta were collected at death from the terminal 15 cm of ileum. The inclusion of hulls depressed the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids, but with the response differing between diets. With the casein based diet the mean apparent and true ileal amino acid digestibilities were significantly depressed from 0. 89 and 0. 96 to 0. 85 and 0. 92, respectively, by the inclusion of hulls in the diet, and addition of PEG then restored these to 0. 89 and 0. 95. All of the depression could be explained by the CT content of the hulls. However, with the cottonseed kernel based diet the response fell into three categories. The apparent and true ileal digestibilities of the essential amino acids cystine and methionine were not affected by hull addition, ileal digestibilities of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, threonine and valine were markedly depressed by hull addition with approximately 50 % of the depression being explained by CT, whilst the ileal digestibilities of histidine, arginine and phenylalanine were depressed by hull addition but little or none of this effect could be explained by CT. With the cottonseed kernel based diet it seems that unknown components of the hulls other than CT also depressed the apparent and true ileal digestibility of N and amino acids. 6. The effects of heat treatment, with or without the addition of cottonseed hulls, on the chemical composition of CSM and upon reactivity of the CT were studied. Heat treatment (100 °C for 2 h, in a forced draught oven) reduced the concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> and fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) available lysine by small amounts, reduced measurable total CT content by 13 %, reduced the solubility of total N, and reduced potential degradability of the 52 and 48 kDa cottonseed storage proteins by mixed rumen micro-organisms. Addition of hulls further depressed solubility of total N and ruminal degradation of the two major storage proteins in cottonseed kernel. The action of PEG in vitro indicated that only part of the depression caused by hull addition could be explained by the presence of CT in the hulls, and that the effects of CT upon N solubility and potential degradability in heated CSM were similar to that in unheated CSM. Addition of hulls also substantially reduced FDNB available lysine. Although application of heat inactivated 13 % of the total CT such that it could no longer be detected with butanol/HCl, it did not seem to change the reversible reactivity of CT with kernel proteins. Commercial CSM produced from the Brisbane mill had a lower total CT content, lower N solubility and ruminal protein degradation rate than CSM produced from the Narrabri mill, but a similar level of FDNB available lysine. 7. The effect of CT from heated and unheated cottonseed on the apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids for the growing rat and pig was determined. In Experiment 1, twenty-four rats were allocated to four semi-synthetic diets, which contained cottonseed kernel/hulls as the sole protein source. Two of the diets contained unheated solvent extracted cottonseed kernel/hulls while the remaining two diets contained similar material but which had been heat-treated by autoclaving at 110 °C for 120 min. In Experiment 2, twelve rats and twelve pigs were fed four semisynthetic diets containing commercial CSM as the sole protein source. Chromic oxide was added to all diets as an indigestible marker. For each pair of diets in both experiments, PEG was either included or excluded. Ileal contents from the terminal 15 and 45 cm of ileum were collected at slaughter for the rats and pigs, respectively. Apparent ileal amino acid digestibility for rats fed the cottonseed kernel/hulls diet was significantly depressed by the heat treatment, particularly for lysine and threonine. On average, apparent ileal amino acid digestibility in the diets without PEG was decreased from 0. 80 to 0. 70 by heat treatment. Dietary cottonseed CT depressed apparent ileal protein digestibility in the pig and in the rat. The addition of PEG to the diets significantly increased the apparent ileal digestibility of N and some amino acids for the pigs and the rats. The mean increase in apparent ileal digestibility due to PEG addition for the 14 amino acids was 2 % units in both species fed the commercial CSM diets, and 2 or 4 % units in rats fed the unheated or the heated cottonseed kernel/hull diets, respectively. The effect of PEG was similar in the heated and unheated cottonseed kernel/hulls for most amino acids, but responses to PEG for lysine, threonine and tyrosine were greater in heated than unheated CSM. For several of the amino acids there were significant animal species differences in apparent ileal digestibility. Studies into the effects of cottonseed CT should be carried out in the target animal species. The commercial CSM had a low apparent ileal amino acid digestibility overall, particularly for the essential amino acids lysine and threonine. It was concluded that effects of heating did not eliminate the reversible reactivity of cottonseed CT on amino acid digestion in rats and pigs but rather appeared to increase it for threonine, tyrosine and lysine in Experiment 1, causing large reductions in apparent ileal digestibility. It was concluded that CT in CSM are mainly in the protein- and fibre-bound forms (80 %), with only 10 - 20 % of CT being extractable. In the absence of heat, adding graded levels of hulls reduced both the solubility and degradability of protein by rumen microorganisms, giving a rumen 'by-pass' effect. However, the magnitude of these effects was small and they are not regarded as being nutritionally significant under practical conditions of ruminant nutrition. Adding hulls significantly depressed the digestion of amino acids in the small intestine of the monogastric animals. This effect is considered large, and {{is probably one of the}} factors responsible for the generally low levels of amino acid availability found for commercially produced CSM. Approximately half of the 'hull effect' is due to their content of CT and the cause of the other 50 % is unknown. As there is no CT in cottonseed kernels, this explains the lack of response to PEG when the diet does not contain cottonseed hulls. The study has also shown that the large amount of heat applied during normal commercial CSM processing reduces the digestion of amino acids by monogastric animals. A combination of heat and CT from hulls is especially damaging for lowing ileal amino acid digestion in monogastric species, particularly for the limiting essential amino acids lysine and threonine...|$|E
40|$|Cotton seed meal (CSM) is an {{alternative}} ingredient in poultry diets but its use is limited due {{to the presence of}} gossypol and the potential effects of gossypol on digestibility of nutrients. Glandless cottonseed is available and contains very low gossypol but there has been a limited amount of poultry nutritional studies completed with glandless cottonseed meal (GCSM).

Thirty 42 -day old Cobb 500 male broilers were precision-fed 30 g of CCSM, GCSM and glucose and excreta collected during a 48 h period. Glucose was fed to serve as a control (no nitrogen or AA content). The chemical composition, gossypol content, True metabolizable energy (TMEn) and digestibility coefficients for AA were calculated for both meals. The crude protein and fat content of GCSM was higher than the CCSM (54 and 51 %, 6 and 2 %, respectively). Both meals were similar in calcium, total phosphorus and phytic acid contents. The CCSM had a higher content of total and <b>free</b> <b>gossypol</b> (1. 52 and 0. 161 %, respectively) when compared to GCSM (0. 02 and. 003 %, respectively).
