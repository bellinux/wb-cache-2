500|$|The seated jury for White's trial {{consisted}} of white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused {{from the jury}} pool. Some {{of the members of}} the jury cried when they heard White's tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty. White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that he was not responsible for his actions, using the legal defense known as diminished capacity: [...] "Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood." [...] Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White's [...] mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk <b>food</b> <b>binge</b> the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the Twinkie defense. White was acquitted of the first degree murder charge on May 21, 1979, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five. He cried when he heard the verdict.|$|E
40|$|Various {{observers}} {{have raised the}} question of how our penal appetite relates to broader patterns of consumption in western societies. Most recently, Ian Loader (2009) has suggested that our appetite for punishment, much like our appetite for ice cream and other high-calorie foods, has been accelerated by broad cultural and policy developments and queried how we might develop strategies to moderate it. The relationship is not simply metaphorical. The prison boom and the <b>food</b> <b>binge,</b> along with the housing bubble, constitute parallel developments in advanced liberal societies. While they may all be reflections of the kind of deeper structural change in these societies often labeled ‘neo-liberalism’, I would suggest their relationships are often more direct—and that they can possibly be analytically reversed, yielding insights as to how restraint in one domain might be mobilized within another. This essay seeks to back out some ideas about moderation in punishment from emerging strategies to fight obesity. Key Words consumption • housing • obesity • punishmen...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The role of {{planning}} in binge eating episodes is unknown. We investigated the characteristics {{of planning}} associated with food cues in binging patients. We studied planning based on backward reasoning, reasoning that determines a sequence of actions back to front from the final outcome. Method: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} 20 healthy participants, 20 bulimia nervosa (BN), 22 restrictive (ANR) and 23 binging anorexia nervosa (ANB), without any concomitant impulsive disorder. In neutral/relaxing, <b>binge</b> <b>food</b> and stressful conditions, backward reasoning was assessed with the Race game, promotion of delayed large rewards with an intertemporal discounting task, attention with the Simon task, and repeating a dominant behavior with the Go/No-go task. Results: BN and to a lower extent ANB patients succeeded more at the Race game in food than in neutral condition. This difference discriminated binging from non-binging participants. Backward reasoning in the food condition was associated with lower approach behavior toward food in BN patients, and higher food avoidance in ANB patients. Enhanced backward reasoning in the food condition related to preferences for delayed large rewards in BN patients. In BN and ANB patients the enhanced success rate at the Race game in the food condition was associated with higher attention paid to <b>binge</b> <b>food.</b> Conclusion: These findings introduce a novel process underlying binges: planning based on backward reasoning is associated with binges. It likely aims to reduce craving for <b>binge</b> <b>foods</b> and extend <b>binge</b> refractory period in BN patients, and avoid binging in ANB patients. Shifts between these goals might explain shifts between eating disorder subtypes...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{binge eating}} {{disorder}} (BED) suffer from regular <b>food</b> <b>binges</b> with loss of control. This {{may be due}} to dysfunctional approach vs. avoidance tendencies towards food in BED. We applied an approach-avoidance task (AAT), in which n = 24 patients with obesity and active BED (OB-BED), n = 32 patients with obesity without current BED (OB), and n = 25 healthy controls (CO) either approached (“pulled”) or avoided (“pushed”) high (HC) vs. low calorie (LC) food pictures. We tested the hypothesis that OB-BED patients would show an approach bias (measured as different response times RT) towards HC food compared to the other groups. While there was no main effect for group or direction of movement, {{a significant main effect for}} calorie (p < 0. 001; RT for HC significantly slower than for LC) was found. Repeated measures ANOVA (rm-ANOVA) for comparison of OB-BED vs. OB vs. CO revealed a significant three-fold interaction group × direction × calorie (p = 0. 02). Against our hypothesis, the OB-BED group showed an avoidance bias for LC. In explicit ratings, OB-BED reported a significantly reduced urge to consume LC food compared to the OB group. Similar to OB-BED, CO also showed an avoidance bias for LC. The implications of our results are discussed and future directions in this field of research are presented...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Data {{regarding}} {{the severity of}} premenstrual symptoms were collected from three groups of women: women over age 24 years seeking care from a gynecological practitioner, undergraduates at OSU living in student dormitories, and graduate students enrolled at OSU. The symptoms evaluated were depression, tiredness, irritability, anxiety, headache, breast swelling and tenderness, craving for sweets, craving for salty <b>foods,</b> <b>binge</b> eating, and acne. Symptoms were rated {{on a scale of}} zero (not present) to three (severe). Multivariate profile analysis was used to evaluate the hypothesis that the profiles formed by the mean vectors of these premenstrual symptoms were parallel with regard to symptom severity, age, consumption of caffeinated beverages and refined sugar, maternal history of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and recent use of oral contraceptives. Parallel profiles were further evaluated for coincidence. Results of the analysis indicated that {{in each of the three}} samples of women studied, the presence of premenstrual symptomatology was indicated by one pattern of symptom severity, and that this pattern remained constant as symptoms became more severe. The variability in the premenstrual symptoms could be explained by the inherent variability of the women studied, a finding which does not support the existence of multiple subtypes of PMS. Evidence of a positive association between age and increasing symptom severity was found only in the graduate student group. High levels of consumption of caffeine were shown to exacerbate premenstrual symptoms among the graduate students, and frequent consumption of refined sugar and "junk food" were shown to exacerbate symptoms among older women. Increased symptom severity of premenstrual symptoms in women whose mothers suffered from PMS was noted only among undergraduate students.

40|$|The {{performances}} of 114 eating disordered females {{on measures of}} individual and family functioning were examined via t-tests, analyses of variance, and chi squares analyses. Subjects met DSM-III-R criteria for anorexia nervosa, anorexia nervosa with bulimia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or eating disorder not otherwise specified. Measures included selected scales of the MMPI, Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Eating Disorder Questionnaire, the Moos Family Environment Scale, and the Berren-Shisslak Family Dynamics Survey. First, performances on the measures were compared to normative samples and across diagnostic groups. As expected, the subjects differed from normative samples on many dependent measures, but the diagnostic groups differed little among themselves. Next, an examination of 45 clinical features suggested that subjects were not as symptomatically distinct as diagnosis might imply. Finally, diagnosis was set aside to examine the relationships of specific clinical features to the measures of individual and family functioning. These features included age, weight history, <b>food</b> <b>binges,</b> vomiting, laxative and diuretic use, food restriction, menstrual history, exercise, drug and alcohol abuse, symptom severity, inpatient treatment history, and additional diagnosis. Surprisingly, a history of anorectic weight {{was not related to}} any of the measures, but amenorrhea emerged as a clinical feature of some import, not just among the anorectic subjects but among subjects generally. Other findings suggested that patients who binge have difficulty with separation, that binges may be a metaphor for unsatisfied cravings for nurturance, and that vomiting and exercise may enhance a sense of separateness while laxative use may represent the private expulsion of anger. The need for family involvement in treatment was highlighted by many relationships between the clinical features and indices of family dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} psychophysiological responses to <b>food</b> exposure in <b>binge</b> eaters. Method: Thirty female volunteers reporting regular binge attacks were compared with 30 nonbinge eaters. Subjects attended individually for the single laboratory session. Continuous measures of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), electroder- mal activity (EDA), and respiration rate were taken during rest and exposure to their favorite <b>binge</b> <b>food.</b> In addition, psychophysiological monitoring continued while subjects were al- lowed to eat after food exposure. Participants also completed inventories assessing restrained eating style (FEV, Revised Restraint Scale). Ratings of nervousness, distress, desire to binge, and hunger were collected repeatedly throughout the experiment. Results: The results indi- cate higher psychophysiological arousal in binge eaters than in nonbinge eaters. Binge eaters maintained a higher arousal level in BP and EDA throughout the food exposure trial than controls. HR during food exposure predicted the relative amount of food consumed during the eating trial across all subjects. This relationship, however, was more pronounced in binge eaters than controls and in restrained compared to unrestrained binge eaters.

This study examines the cognitive profile and psychophysiological reactions of individuals with seasonal depression symptoms, those with disordered eating, and healthy controls {{through the use of a}} modified Stroop task, an incidental recall task, and facial electromyographic (EMG) recording during an image viewing task. Results showed that those with seasonal depression symptoms were distinguished from healthy controls on the basis of higher zygomaticus major peak amplitude when viewing images of food. All three groups rated the summer images and <b>binge</b> <b>food</b> images more positively. Supplementary regression analyses were run on the entire dataset to examine the extent to which seasonality, typical depression symptoms, atypical depression symptoms, and the presence/absence of disordered eating symptoms might predict performance on the experimental tasks. Higher atypical depression symptoms were associated with more nonresponses for nonbinge food words on the modified Stroop task as well as higher zygomaticus major peak amplitude when viewing images of <b>binge</b> <b>foods,</b> non-binge foods, and winter scenes.

The authors used data from a prospective study of 496 adolescent girls who completed a baseline assessment at age 11 – 15 years and 4 annual follow-ups. Self-reported dietary restraint, radical weight-control behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perceived parental obesity—but not high-fat <b>food</b> consumption, <b>binge</b> eating, or exercise frequency—predicted obesity onset. Results provide support for certain etiologic theories of obesity, including the affect regulation model. The fact that self-reported, weight-control behaviors identified girls at risk for obesity implies that high-risk youths are not engaging in effective weight-control methods and suggests the need to promote more effective strategies. Adolescent obesity is associated with serious medical problems, including high blood pressure, adverse lipoprotein profiles, diabe-tes mellitus, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, and death from all causes, as well as lower educational attainment and higher rates of poverty (Dietz, 1998; Pietrobelli et al., 1998).

Valuation of food stimuli is supposed to influence approach or avoidance behaviour towards food. Focusing on self-reported and indirect (facial electromyography) valuation process, motivational aspects in the processing of food stimuli were investigated. We compared an overweight sample with BED (BED+) with an overweight sample without BED (BED-) and with normal weight controls (NWC) regarding their self-reported and indirect (via facial electromyography) valuation of food versus non-food stimuli. Regarding the self-reported valuation, the BED+ sample showed a significantly stronger food-bias compared to the BED- sample, as food stimuli were rated as significantly more positive than the non-food stimuli in the BED+ sample. This self-reported valuation pattern could not be displayed in the indirect valuation. Food stimuli evoked negative indirect valuation in all groups. The BED+ sample showed the plainest approach-avoidance conflict marked by a diverging self-reported (positive) and indirect (negative) valuation of food stimuli. BED+ showed a deviant self-reported valuation of food as compared to BED-. The valuation process of the BED+ sample seems to be characterized by a motivational ambivalence.

40|$|The {{conditioning}} {{model of}} binge eating states that cues {{such as the}} sight, smell and taste of <b>binge</b> <b>food</b> prepare the binger’s body for the intake of large amounts of food.

40|$|ReviewIt is {{important}} that clinicians and researchers understand the possible eating-related difficulties experienced by pre-bariatric surgery candidates, {{as well as their}} expectations of how their eating and hunger will change after surgery. This review examines English-language publications related to the eating-related behaviours, disorders and expectations of bariatric candidates. Seventy-five articles related to binge eating disorder, grazing, night eating syndrome, emotional eating, food cravings and addiction, and pre-surgical expectations of post-surgical eating in this population were critically reviewed. A variety of often problematic eating behaviours appear more common in bariatric candidates than in non-obese populations. The literature suggests that 4 - 45 % of candidates may have binge eating disorder, 20 - 60 % may graze, 2 - 42 % may have night eating syndrome, 38 - 59 % may engage in emotional eating and 17 - 54 % may fit criteria for <b>food</b> addiction. <b>Binge</b> eating may also be more prevalent in bariatric candidates than in similarly obese non-surgical individuals. Expectations of surgery are high, with pre-surgical candidates believing their bariatric procedure will virtually guarantee significantly improved eating behaviours. Study replications are needed, and further investigation into prevalence, impacts and candidate characteristics related to disordered eating behaviours, as well as candidates' expectations of eating after surgery, will be important. Further comparisons of bariatric candidates to similarly obese non-bariatric populations will be important to understand eating-related characteristics of candidates beyond those related to their weight.

40|$|Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are severe eating {{disorders}} whose etiopathogenesis is still unknown. Clinical features suggest that {{eating disorders}} may develop as reward-dependent syndromes, since eating less food {{is perceived as}} rewarding in anorexia nervosa while consumption of large amounts of <b>food</b> during <b>binge</b> episodes in bulimia nervosa aims at reducing the patient's negative emotional states. Therefore, brain reward mechanisms {{have been a major}} focus of research in the attempt to contribute to the comprehension of the pathophysiology of these disorders. Structural brain imaging data provided the evidence that brain reward circuits may be altered in patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Similarly, functional brain imaging studies exploring the activation of brain reward circuits by food stimuli as well as by stimuli recognized to be potentially rewarding for eating disordered patients, such as body image cues or stimuli related to food deprivation and physical hyperactivity, showed several dysfunctions in ED patients. Moreover, very recently, it has been demonstrated that some of the biochemical homeostatic modulators of eating behavior are also implicated in the regulation of food-related and non-food-related reward, representing a possible link between the aberrant behaviors of ED subjects and their hypothesized deranged reward processes. In particular, changes in leptin and ghrelin occur in patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa and have been suggested to represent not only homeostatic adaptations to an altered energy balance but to contribute also to the acquisition and/or maintenance of persistent starvation, binge eating and physical hyperactivity, which are potentially rewarding for ED patients. On the basis of such findings new pathogenetic models of EDs have been proposed, and these models may provide new theoretical basis for the development of innovative treatment strategies, either psychological and pharmacological, with the aim to improve the outcomes of so severe disabling disorders...|$|R

Measurements and Results: In total, 23. 3 % of the patients fulfilled the criteria for a clinical eating disorder, as opposed to none of the control subjects. Most of these were classified as Eating Disorder–Not Otherwise Specified, with an incomplete form of binge eating disorder. On the symptom level, half of the patients reported a persistent craving for food, as well as binge eating. Twenty-five percent of patients even reported binging twice a week or more often. When compared with BMI matched controls, the significant increases persisted in symptoms of eating disorders among patients with narcolepsy. Except for a higher level of interference in daily activities due to eating problems in patients using antidepressants, medication use did not influence our findings. Conclusions: The majority of patients with narcolepsy experience a number of symptoms of eating disorders, with an irresistible craving for <b>food</b> and <b>binge</b> eating as the most prominent features. Eating disorder symptomatology interfered with daily activities. These findings justify more attention for eating disorders in the treatment of patients with narcolepsy...|$|R
40|$|According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), {{binge eating}} {{disorder}} (BED) is {{an eating disorder}} characterized by repetitive episodes of uncontrolled and excessive <b>food</b> consumption (<b>binge</b> eating), {{in a short period}} of time, without the inappropriate compensatory behaviors for limiting weight gain. BED is a stable condition that is associated with elevated psychiatric comorbidity, including depression and anxiety. A large body of evidence supports a contribution of the endocannabinoid system in the modulation of energy balance by controlling food intake through central and peripheral mechanisms. The cannabinoid CB 1 receptor is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and induces inhibition of neurotransmission through modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. CB 1 receptors inverse agonists inhibit food intake through both central and peripheral mechanisms while, in contrast, cannabinoid agonists stimulate food intake in humans and induce beneficial effects in acquired immune deficiency syndrome related to anorexia, suggesting altered endocannabinoid neurotransmission in anorectic conditions. A possible involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of BED and other eating disorders has recently been supported by independent experimental evidence. Elevated plasma levels of anandamide were found in women affected by AN and BED. Moreover, anandamide levels were inversely correlated with plasma leptin concentrations. On the basis of these evidence, the aim of this thesis was to study whether and which elements of the endocannabinoid system might be correlated with the binge eating behavior, which brain areas are specifically involved, and if pharmacological treatments specific for the endocannabinoid system (i. e. agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists of cannabinoid receptors, inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolisms) are be able, besides to modify the state of BED induced in laboratory animals, to restore a correct functionality of the endocannabinoid system. Furthermore an analysis of the behavioral profile of animals with BED has been evaluated before the start of drug treatment by means of different mazes in which is possible to study anxiety and depression. Binge eating behavior was induced in animals by giving them a sporadic (3 days/week) and limited (2 h) access to a high fat diet (margarine) in addition to a continuous access to chow and water. In these animals, the intake of margarine becomes significantly greater than in animals with limited daily access to margarine and remains stable over prolonged periods of time. As revealed by forced swim test, animals with binge eating behavior did not show a depressive like behavior compared to control animals. However, using the elevated plus maze, an anxiety like behavior was highlighted in those animals before access to margarine (Pre - binge phase) that it was significantly reduced after the consumption of this palatable <b>food</b> (Post - <b>binge</b> phase). Results showed that an increase of the endocannabinoid signaling by CB 1 agonists or by inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism did not modify the binge eating behavior presents in our animals. On the contrary, a decrease of the endocannabinoid signaling by CB 1 receptors inverse agonist/antagonist rimonabant, was able to alter this behavior when given chronically. As regards the CB 1 receptor density, no difference has been highlighted between animals showing binge eating behavior and control group. In conclusion, negative modulation of the endocannabinoid signal may represent an important strategy in the treatment of Binge Eating Disorder...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Binge eating {{disorder}} (BED) has been postulated to arise from mesolimbic dopaminergic system changes, presumably homologous to those seen in drug addiction. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) {{is regarded as}} a relatively novel but promising surgical treatment of addiction. Because of potentially similar circuitries underlying drug addiction and BED, we aimed to investigate Nucleus Accumbens DBS as treatment option for BED. Methods: Wistar-rats had electrodes placed in the Nucleus Accumbens core (NAcc core) or lateral shell (NAcc lShell) or medial shell (NAcc mShell) and were adapted for several weeks to high fat <b>food</b> (HFF) <b>binge</b> eating protocol, with one-hour food deprivation preceding a one hour access to HFF (binge) at the penultimate hour before the dark phase. DBS was applied either before and/or during the binge and was varied in stimulation currents and frequencies. Results: With respect to the NAcc core, the most striking results were achieved when stimulating with a current of 250 μA before binge at 10 Hz (intake = 61 %, p= 0. 0076), while no effects were found when stimulation was performed during the binge. DBS in the NAcc lShell showed strongest suppression of the binge when stimulating with either 125 or 250 μA during binge at 50 Hz (intake = 56 %, p= 0. 00331), but no effects were observed when stimulation was performed before the binge. No significant results were achieved when stimulating NAcc mShell. Conclusion: These data indicate that DBS of the NAcc core suppresses the “wanting” aspects of binging whereas DBS of the NAcc lShell suppresses “liking” aspects of binging. “Wanting” changes the food reward potency, and these aspects have indeed been found to reside in the NAcc core. Furthermore, incentive hotspots associated with “liking” have previously been identified in lateral parts of the NA. We conclude that DBS in the NAcc may be a promising tool for the treatment of BED in human patients...|$|R
