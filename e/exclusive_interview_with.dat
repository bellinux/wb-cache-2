500|$|In December 2012, Peer Schneider of IGN {{published}} an article explaining the fate and some production details of the proposed John Woo-directed Metroid movie with an <b>exclusive</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> one of the former producers of the Metroid movie, Brad Foxhoven. The movie with John Woo as director was first pitched in 2004 and initially had Nintendo's full support. Foxhoven stated in the IGN interview, [...] "Nintendo was quite supportive of the idea, as they were all fans of John's previous films" [...] and that production studio Tiger Hill was [...] "in {{it for the long}} haul" [...] and had started a three-year development period. The Metroid movie was originally set for a 2006 release but slipped because Tiger Hill was spending most of the development time attempting to cope with Nintendo's restrictions on the Metroid franchise. [...] The reason for Nintendo's restrictions was the past critical and commercial failure of the Super Mario Bros. movie which, according to IGN, [...] "had left an indelible impression on Nintendo and how it would approach future licensing deals with Hollywood." [...] One writer that was brought in to write a script for the Metroid movie, among [...] "several writers", was David Greenwalt of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Grimm fame, the furthest that the production process reached was [...] "a treatment for a live action film that John would possibly direct." ...|$|E
