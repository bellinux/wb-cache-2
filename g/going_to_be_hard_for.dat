40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the impact of the {{exchange}} rate on the relationship among German exports and its main determinants. Our main aim has been to identify an exchange rate pain threshold for German exporters. We rely on a nonlinear pathdependent model in which suddenly strong spurts of exports occur when changes of the exchange rate go beyond a so called play area (which is similar to the phenotype of play in mechanics). We capture this on-linear dynamics in a simplified linearized way and implement an algorithm describing linear play hysteresis into a suitable regression framework. Our non-linear model including play displays a much better performance than the standard linear model. Thus, the implications of some When Does It Hurt? The Exchange Rate Pain Threshold for German Exports hysteretic macro models concerning the dynamics of aggregate labor demand are corroborated empirically for trade variables as well. Moreover, we are able to show that the frequently mentioned notion of an exactly identified unique pain threshold of the $/ exchange rate simply does not exist. Instead, we come up with an estimate of a path-dependent play area width of 24 US dollar cent per euro for total German exports to the US. Taking into account that the borders of the play area and, thus, also the pain threshold (as the upper border) today depend on the historical path of the RER until today, the location of the play area and the pain threshold is dependent on the observation point in time. For instance, {{at the end of our}} estimation period, our estimation results imply a pain threshold of 1. 55 $/ which continued to hold in October 2009. Compared to the more recent laments of business German business representatives and also to the more recent implicit assessment by the ECB this threshold is slightly but not substantially higher. On October 22 nd, 2009, the dollar hit the 1. 50 level, implying that we are currently not too far away from this threshold  especially if we take into account that macroeconomic uncertainty has shrunk slightly but steadily since the turn-of-the-year 2008 / 09. However, laments appeared to be quite contained these days until very recently. The interesting question then is why this time it was so different. We feel legitimized to preliminarily argue that maybe the awareness of appreciation of the euro has been overlaid and dominated by the public reception of the economic and financial crisis. But as in recent episodes of local maxima of the $/ exchange rate, also the ECB is also now apparently becoming increasingly aware that a stronger euro must absolutely be avoided. Further euro strengthening in the remainder of the year will have a significant impact on 2010 economic growth, for instance, in export dependent Germany, and make the ECBs own pessimistic forecasts for this year even more probable. Hence, this may become a new era of the ECBs rhetoric on exchange rates because (i) it will be the euro area which will have to bear the burden of the global adjustment and (ii) voting majorities in the ECB Council have changed in the meantime to the benefit of former weak currency countries which are inclined to enact central bank interventions in the FX markets in order to weaken their home currencies. What does all this lead us? If, as a result of global imbalances, the external value of the euro increases even further, the demand for German exports will fall dramatically and (units of) German firms reduce or even stop trading internationally, then reentrance into international trade will be severely hampered, even if the euro will devaluate again in the future. So, once there will be a zero entry in any export good category, the concern is that it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> exporters in this goods category to re-establish their export nodes and get back in. A German firm may even be likely to decide not to re-establish global trading networks again, or, at a minimum, it might take some time before it well be capable of doing so. Hence, the ever rising euro may have consequences that go well beyond the prediction of any standard economic model incorporating a unique exports equilibrium, when the presence of global trading networks and sunk costs of for German exporters is acknowledged...|$|E
40|$|AFTER an {{election}} in which Labor looked like having a reasonable chance {{right up to the}} last few days, the outcome, a net gain of seats to the government, has produced a good deal of shock on the Labor side of politics. Why did things goes so badly? Right across the country, state-level issues ran against Labor. This partly reflects the fact that Labor is in office in every state, and in some cases, has been in office too long. But mostly, it was idiosyncratic stuff, that could have gone either way, but happened to go against Labor. Even popular Labor governments ran into strife. Second, Labor suffered again from holding off too long on key policy issues. The tax policy went reasonably well (but would have done just as well if it had been announced earlier), but the forest policy was clearly a disaster in political terms - the substantive merits are more complex, but precisely for that reason needed more argument and explanation. Instead the whole thing was left until the last few days of the campaign. The Labor planners ought {{to have been able to}} work out well in advance whether they could work out a deal which would satisfy the unions while achieving enough protection for the forests to keep the Greens onside. If it couldn’t be done, a political strategy to deal with the consequences needed to be worked out. Instead, they seem to have floated the policy and hoped for the best. This allowed Howard to announce a non-policy in response, without any time for Labor to do anything about it. Third, and contrary to a lot of post-election claims, the campaign showed that health and education can win elections. The problem for Labor was that Howard was willing to outbid them, putting a heap of money into both bulk billing and state schools, even if it was poorly targeted (in policy rather than electoral terms) and hedged about with all sorts of silliness, like the idea of channelling funds through through parent bodies. As I said several times during the campaign, Howard’s concessions, on Medicare in particular, mean that he has admitted defeat on the core ideological issue of the size of government. Fourth, there’s economic management and the scare campaign on interest rates. Undoubtedly these were the winning issues for Howard, as he had hoped. Contrary to some claims, I don’t think the two issues can be separated. And it was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Labor to make the case that Howard’s reputation as an economic manager is overblown. (I did so here, but I’d hate to try and condense it into a 30 -second spot). A big problem here is the continuing memory of Keating, which makes the mistakes of fifteen years ago still powerful electoral ammunition for the government - it’s as if Gough Whitlam had been able to run against the 1961 credit squeeze. Finally, there are the prospects for Howard’s next term. It’s clear enough that he will be able to push through the remaining elements of his 1996 program, the full privatisation of Telstra and a final instalment of industrial relations reform. Assuming that the Coalition wins half the seats in the Senate, this will require the support of either Family First, or one of the Democrats. Neither can be taken for granted (for example, Family First does not support the privatisation of Telstra), but the government’s position is so strong that some sort of deal will almost certainly be struck. For the rest, the government’s campaign platform was designed to match Labor - so it doesn’t imply a mandate for anything much in the way of free-market reform. It’s possible that, as on some previous occasions, Howard will repudiate his promises as ‘non-core’ and embark on a new round of radical reforms. This is, however, the less likely outcome. Even the Telstra privatisation will cause a lot of political pain. In any case, there aren’t that many options on the table. Tax reform is unlikely to be affordable, the government is now committed to saving Medicare and bulk billing, and pushing privatisation on to Australia Post seems most unlikely. The big issue is whether Australian can continue continue to avoid a recession. The imbalances we’ve piled up in terms of household debt, the trade and current account deficits and the inflated price of houses can only be sustained, if at all, with low world interest rates, and those rates depend on the willingness of the Chinese and Japanese central banks to sustain them. Howard’s reputation as a good manager owes a lot to luck, and luck always runs out in the end. But Howard’s luck has lasted longer than most.
