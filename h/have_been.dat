5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{found on}} all continents except Australia and Antarctica, {{giving them a}} nearly {{worldwide}} distribution during the Late Triassic. Many aetosaur remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found from the Chinle Group in the southwestern United States. Most fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found from Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Some remains have also been found from Utah, particularly in Canyonlands National Park and Zion National Park. Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark Supergroup along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been found from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco. During the Late Triassic, Morocco would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in close proximity with the Newark Supergroup of North America in the supercontinent of Pangaea. It {{is also possible that}} Desmatosuchus was present in Africa, as fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found from the Zarzaitine Series in Algeria that were referred to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found {{since the}} early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics that may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E
