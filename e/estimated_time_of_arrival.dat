5|$|Xerxes's <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> at Thermopylae {{coincided with}} both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was {{considered}} sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies {{picked up on the}} way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications {{to be able to}} transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E

40|$|A {{concept for}} {{multiple}} operations during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) at non-tower, non-radar airports is described. The {{objective is to}} provide an automated service which will support separation assurance for aircraft operating in the airport airspace. This type of service will enable {{the use of a}} large number of airfields which currently have limited use in IMC. The service must be provided with minimal infrastructure and at low cost. The concept is based on a centralized automated airport management module and distributed, on-board navigation tools. The airport management module serves as an arbiter and sequencer. It receives requests from aircraft via a data link and grants or denies access. The airport management module also provides <b>estimated</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> when access is granted and an “expect further clearance ” time when access is denied. On-board avionics tools provide situational awareness and generate advisories to be able to meet <b>estimated</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The concept is being developed such that operations into and out of the non-tower, non-radar airport are compatible with the existing National Airspace System (NAS). A system simulation has been developed based on this concept. This paper describes the system functionality, system requirements, and operations. Preliminary results of the system simulation with various aircraft mixes, wind speed and directions, and arrival rates are presented.

40|$|Abstract. The Blackbeard {{instrument}} is a broadband radio receiver on the ALEXIS (Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) satellite. It detects and records transient VHF radio signals. During November and December of 1996, the Los Alamos Portable Pulser (LAPP) facility {{was used to}} transmit 31 broadband pulses to Blackbeard to evaluate the instrument's time tagging accuracy. LAPP firing times were {{used in conjunction with}} propagation delays to compute <b>estimated</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (ETOAs) for pulses reaching Blackbeard. ETOAs were compared to Blackbeard reported <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (RTOAs), which were computed using information returned by Blackbeard and an algorithm presented in this paper. For the 31 pulser shots received by Blackbeard, the mean difference between ETOA and RTOA was 1. 97 milliseconds, with RTOAs occurring later than ETOAs. The standard deviation of the difference was 0. 43 milliseconds. As a result of the study, the algorithm used for accurate Blackbeard time tag studies has been modified to subtract 1. 97 milliseconds from reported <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The 0. 43 ms error standard deviation is now used to describe the uncertainty <b>of</b> Blackbeard <b>time</b> tags...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{describes}} the challenges confronting local authorities who must decide if and when to initiate evacuations from tropical cyclones. This problem can be decomposed into {{the behavior of the}} hurricane that is relevant to evacuation and the behavior of evacuees that is relevant to the hurricane. The uncertain behavior of these two systems can be modeled in an evacuation management deci-sion support system (EMDSS). The hurricane EMDSS described here displays information about the minimum, most, and maximum probable evacuation <b>time</b> <b>estimates</b> (ETEs) in comparison to the earliest, most, and latest probable <b>estimated</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (ETAs) for storm conditions. In addition, EMDSS calculates the cost of false positive (the economic cost of an evacuation) and false negative (lives lost in a late evacuation) decision errors. EMDSS is being used in experiments to assess different information displays, team compositions, community characteristics, and hurricane scenarios. In addition, it will be used in training and actual hurricane operations. Finally, definition of the program’s requirements has identified further research needed to build a better empirical base for its input data...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive Network (CN) {{paradigm}} and Machine Learning (ML) {{techniques are}} increasingly becoming popular in Wireless network design. CN allows to efficiently arrange the network stack parameters among the nodes {{involved in the}} data transmission. It {{can be divided into}} two modules: the former permits to retrieve the ISO/OSI protocol stack parameters and the latter optimizes the transmission through a Cognitive Engine entity. This engine usually adopts ML algorithms to extract important features regarding the network, with the objective of either maximizing the global throughput or predicting relevant network behaviors. This paper analyzes how common ML algorithms are able to model transmissions occurring in a typical wireless network scenario. In particular, we test the algorithms with our CN testbed to predict transmission <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrivals</b> (ETAs) in different network setups. We compare these results with those obtained via scp, which is the typical Unix/Linux shell program used to exchange files.

40|$|The {{air traffic}} control {{subsystem}} that performs scheduling is discussed. The function of the scheduling algorithms is to plan automatically the most efficient landing order and to assign optimally spaced landing times to all arrivals. Several important scheduling algorithms are described and the statistical performance of the scheduling algorithms is examined. Scheduling brings order to an arrival sequence for aircraft. First-come-first-served scheduling (FCFS) establishes a fair order, based on <b>estimated</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival,</b> and determines proper separations. Because of the randomness of the traffic, gaps {{will remain in the}} scheduled sequence of aircraft. These gaps are filled, or partially filled, by time-advancing the leading aircraft after a gap while still preserving the FCFS order. Tightly scheduled groups of aircraft remain with a mix of heavy and large aircraft. Separation requirements differ for different types of aircraft trailing each other. Advantage is taken of this fact through mild reordering of the traffic, thus shortening the groups and reducing average delays. Actual delays for different samples with the same statistical parameters vary widely, especially for heavy traffic...|$|R
