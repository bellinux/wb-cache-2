40|$|Introduction: Due to {{ever-increasing}} {{need for}} diagnostic radiographs in dentistry, {{it is necessary}} to observe techniques to minimize the absorbed patient dose. The aim of this study was the comparative evaluation of inherent visual characteristics such as contrast and density and the gross fog of standard occlusal films with those of occlusal films taken with <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens.</b> Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, standard occlusal films and occlusal films prepared by cutting extraoral films to the size of occlusal films and placing them between <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> were used. After determination of the most appropriate exposure time and maximum kVp and mA, radiographs were taken from one step wedge and processed using the same condition. A total of 25 radiographs were taken from each of the two film types and then the radiographs underwent densitometry at similar points. In order to evaluate the gross fog, densitometry was carried out at 5 similar points on one unexposed film from each type. Data were analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and Mann-Whitney test (Î± = 0. 05). Results: Based on the results of this study, the density of the standard occlusal film was more than that of the occlusal film with <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> (p value < 0. 001). The contrast of the film with <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> was more than that of the standard occlusal film (p value < 0. 001). The gross fog of the film with <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> was less than that of the standard occlusal film (p value = 0. 006). Conclusion: Occlusal films with <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> have higher contrast and lower gross fog and density, but in the diagnostic range, in comparison with standard occlusal films; therefore, films with <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> are recommended because they decrease patient absorbed dose by decreasing exposure time.

Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients participated and a total of 90 radiographs were obtained in the study. The patients were divided into three groups (regular-medium <b>intensifying</b> <b>screen,</b> regular <b>intensifying</b> screen-digital radiography, and medium intensifying screen-digital radiography) that consisted of 15 people each. All radiographs were assessed by three oral radiologists independently. The observers evaluated the images using a 3 -point scale (1 =well visible, 0 =partly visible, - 1 =not or hardly visible) for anatomical structures and pathological findings that are commonly found on panoramic radiographs. Subjective image quality of the groups and comparison of the observers were assessed by using non parametric Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: For all groups and observers, no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found for both anatomical structures and pathologies and between anatomical structures and pathologies according to the Mann Whitney U test. In comparison with observers, no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found for both anatomical structures and pathologies and between anatomical structures and pathologies for all groups according to the Kruskal Wallis test.

40|$|Background: Accurate film {{processing}} is {{of paramount importance}} in acquiring a good diagnostic radiograph. Radiographic films show variations in densities and contrast, with changes in processing conditions, and also film type, all of which are interdependent. Therefore, this research was conducted to recognize the effect of time and temperature variations of automatic processor on the sensitometric properties of blue and green light sensitive screen films. The study also aimed to note the effect on sensitometric properties when mismatch occurred when using between the screen and film belonging to different manufacturers. Materials and Methods: Sixty green light sensitive and 60 blue light sensitive spectrally matched screen film combinations were used in the study. However, the films and the <b>intensifying</b> <b>screens</b> employed belonged to different manufacturers. These films were exposed to five different exposure times and subsequently processed in an automatic processor, using two different protocols.

40|$|A {{prototype}} proton-cone-beam-computed-tomography (PCB-CT) system {{utilizing a}} proton radiatiotherapy beam has been developed. The system acquires CT {{data in the}} cone-beam geometry. The cone-beam is produced by scattering a 158. 6 MeV narrow parallel proton beam on a range modifier {{in the form of}} a linear modulating wheel. The wheel is a PMMA propeller of variable thickness that rotates about its axis parallel to the beam line. The energy spectrum generated by the wheel is designed to result in a monotonically decreasing linear signal versus energy deposited in the detector system. Protons are detected by a system using an <b>intensifying</b> <b>screen</b> and CCD digital camera. The PCB-CT scanner measures relative stopping power of protons in 3 D with equal resolution in each dimension. It operates at clinically relevant energies and geometries and in this way facilitates proton therapy planning techniques. The Feldkamp-Davis-Kress cone-beam reconstruction algorithm is applied to obtain the proton stopping powers. ^ Calibration of the proton CT projections is performed with the aid of a stack of PMMA plates positioned in front of the <b>intensifying</b> <b>screen.</b> Contrast and spatial resolution of the PCB-CT scan is evaluated from CT reconstructions of a contrast-resolution phantom. Artifacts in the reconstruction due to neutron noise in the detector system are corrected by a subtraction technique. ^ In addition, computer-simulations of proton CT projection data have been performed. For this purpose, a macroscopic proton transport algorithm has been developed. The algorithm derives from the Boltzmann equation. Energy loss is modeled by using experimental energy-range tables for specific materials, while energy deposition is modeled by using a measured dependence of dose on depth in water (the Bragg curve) and the concept of water equivalent thickness (WET). Nuclear collisions are accounted for by the inclusion of the experimental Bragg curve data in water. The small-angle-approximation is assumed in treating the multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS). Limitations of the PCB-CT in characterizing the relative proton stopping power due to the MCS phenomena are examined. A method of removing the MCS artifacts from the projection data is employed to obtain more accurate reconstructed proton stopping powers. ...|$|R

All of the films were exposed using a conventional diagnostic x-ray machine and processed in an automatic processor. The sensitometric data were tested by producing radiographs with the various films and film-screen combinations using the basic exposure technique and the exposure factors obtained from the relative speeds. The radiographic subject was a phantom made of tissue equivalent plastic which encased human skeletal parts. The radiographic results of the testing indicated that adequate radiographs can be obtained using this data. Assuming that the basic radiograph has an average density of 1. 0, a second radiograph using a different film-screen combination will have an average density which will not deviate from 1. 0 by more than Â± 0. 15...|$|R

Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza A virus was detected in Norwegian pigs in October 2009. Until then, Norway was regarded free of swine influenza. <b>Intensified</b> <b>screening</b> revealed 91 positive herds within three months. The virus was rapidly transmitted to the susceptible population, including closed breeding herds with high biosecurity. Humans were important for the introduction as well as spread of the virus to pigs. Mild or no clinical signs were observed in infected pigs. Surveillance of SIV in 2010 revealed that 41 % of all the Norwegian pig herds had antibodies to pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus. Furthermore, this surveillance indicated that pigs born in positive herds after the active phase did not seroconvert, suggesting no ongoing infection in the herds. However, results from surveillance in 2011 show a continuing spread of the infection in many herds, either caused by new introduction or by virus circulation since 2009. 1...|$|R

The results obtained from preliminary trials are presented, indicating that suitable alternatives to dieldrin are available for use in sugarcane to control both the larval and adult stages of H. ficas...|$|R
