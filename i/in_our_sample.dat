5000|$|Chemical {{enrichment}} in galaxies: When new hot {{massive stars}} are born they radiate very energetic photons that ionize the remnant parent gaseous nebula {{that has not}} formed stars; this craddle of new stars and ionized gas is known as an HII region. HII regions are very important because they are very luminous, {{so they can be}} used to study the star formation in far away galaxies. Also, their emission line spectrum can be used to computed the chemical abundances of the different atomic elements, thus tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies in their most recent epochs. We have developed new tools to detect and extract the spectroscopic information from HII regions (Sánchez et al., 2012b), building the largest catalog currently available (~10.000 HII regions and aggregations). This catalog has been used to define a new oxygen abundance (the abundance of oxygen is used as a reference in HII regions) calibrator anchored with electron temperature measurements (Marino et al., 2013). From these, we explored the proposed dependence of the Mass-Metallicity relation with the star formation rate (SFR; Sánchez et al., 2013), and the local Mass-Metallicity relation (Rosales-Ortega et al. 2012). We found that all galaxies <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>sample</b> present an abundance radial gradient with a common slope (when normalized to the effective radius; Sánchez et al., 2014); this agrees with the proposed inside-out scenario for galaxy growth. This characteristic slope is independent of the properties of the galaxies, and in particular of {{the presence or absence of}} dynamical structures such as stellar bars. This result has been confirmed by the analysis of the stellar abundance gradient in the same sample (Sánchez-Blázquez et al., 2014).|$|E
