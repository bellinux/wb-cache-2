40|$|Statistics of <b>drawdowns</b> (loss {{from the}} last local maximum to the next local minimum) plays an {{important}} role in risk assessment of investment strategies. As they incorporate higher ($>$ two) order correlations, they offer a better measure of real market risks than the variance or other cumulants of daily (or some other fixed time scale) of returns. Previous results have shown that the vast majority of <b>drawdowns</b> occurring on the major financial markets have a distribution which is well-represented by a stretched exponential, while the largest <b>drawdowns</b> are occurring with a significantly larger rate than predicted by the bulk of the distribution and should thus be characterized as outliers. In the present analysis, the definition of <b>drawdowns</b> is generalised to coarse-grained <b>drawdowns</b> or so-called epsilon-drawdowns and a link between such epsilon-outliers and preceding log-periodic power law bubbles previously identified is established.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the statistical properties of <b>drawdowns</b> and drawups {{in interest rates}} (US$) using over 10 years' worth of daily data. We analyse {{the nature of the}} <b>drawdowns</b> in terms of length of runs, magnitude of the individual price moves and coincidence of their occurrence across the maturity spectrum. We document significant positive autocorrelation for several holding periods, pronounced term structure effects and an unexpectedly low degree of coincidence in the occurrence of <b>drawdowns</b> across the maturity spectrum (despite high correlation in daily moves). By drawing on previous work by Rebonato et al. (2005) we try to provide a coherent explanation for a complex set of empirical observations. An essential ingredient of this explanation appears to be the existence of at least two distinct types (normal and excited) of price dynamics, with different serial correlation properties. We concur with the results by Sornette and Johansen (Significance of log-periodic precursors to financial crashes. Quant. Finance, 2001, 1, 452 - 471) for different asset classes that very large <b>drawdowns</b> belong to the 'undemocratic' case, and may therefore result from an amplification mechanism. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe Gorleben {{salt dome}} is {{considered}} as a potential disposal site for radioactive waste. In the safety assessment study, a number of pumping tests are {{carried out in the}} geohydrological system surrounding the salt dome. The Gorleben pumping test is simulated in a number of subsequent steps. In the first modelling step the analytical Theis solution is applied. Significant differences between the calculated and observed <b>drawdowns</b> show that the Theis solution assumptions are inappropriate to describe the Gorleben geohydrological system. In the second modelling attempt, the pumping test is simulated numerically with the METROPOL computer code. Geological borelog data and geohydrological profiles and maps are interpreted to obtain information on the aquifer geometry, anisotropy and possible heterogeneity. Under the assumptions of an anisotropic and heterogeneous geohydrological system, simulations of the Weisses Moor pumping test provide calculated <b>drawdowns</b> which match the observed <b>drawdowns</b> reasonably...|$|R

We find for the major financial markets that approximately 98 % of the distributions of <b>drawdowns</b> is well-represented by an exponential (or a minor modification of it with a slightly fatter tail), while the largest to the few ten largest <b>drawdowns</b> are occurring with a significantly larger rate than predicted by the exponential: the largest drops thus constitute genuine outliers.

For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred <b>Drawdown</b> Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred <b>Drawdown</b> Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{division}} remained on mainland Japan. It occupied Kyūshū from 1945 until 1950. During this time, the US Army shrank. At the end of World War II it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force. It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan. The others were the 1st Cavalry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 25th Infantry Division, all under control of the Eighth United States Army. The 24th Division retained the 19th, 21st, and 34th regiments, but the formations were undermanned and ill-equipped due to the post-war <b>drawdown</b> and reduction in military spending.|$|E

40|$|The Groundwater Availability Model (GAM) for the Igneous {{and parts}} of the West Texas Bolsons (Salt Basin) {{aquifers}} was used to estimate <b>drawdowns</b> over a fifty year time period in Jeff Davis and Presidio counties when pumping at the year 2000 rates. <b>Drawdowns</b> for average and drought-of-record recharge conditions were also compared. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this modeling study. • The use of drought-of-record recharge has negligible impact on the results of the modeling in the Salt Basin aquifer when compared to the use of average recharge. This is because the GAM assumes that the Salt Basin aquifer receives no direct recharge from precipitation; therefore, drought-of-record recharge has virtually no effect on water levels in this aquifer. • The use of drought-of-record recharge has minimal impact on the results of the modeling in the Igneous aquifer when compared to the use of average recharge. The difference in water levels and <b>drawdowns</b> between the average and drought-of-record recharge runs was less than ten feet for most of the area, except {{in the heart of the}} Davis Mountains where there is no pumpage in the model. • <b>Drawdowns</b> in the Salt Basin aquifer were much higher in Jeff Davis County than in Presidio County.
