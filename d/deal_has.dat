5|$|The club {{plans to}} sell the stadium naming rights for R$400million for 20 years. A study by Brunoro Sports Business {{estimated}} that the value should be R$21million per year. Companies Petrobras, Ambev, Grupo Petrópolis, Etihad Airways, Qatar Foundation, Caixa Econômica Federal, Emirates Airlines, Bradesco, Telefonica, BMG, Itaú Unibanco, Santander Group, Kalunga and Zurich Insurance Group have all been named as possible buyers, but no <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> been announced yet.|$|E
25|$|Though still {{a matter}} for debate, the {{indemnity}} <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> complicated the question of ultimate blame. For decades the Government and Department of Education were to blame for lack of oversight, {{various parts of the}} Catholic Church refused to reform internal systems, the police generally ignored complaints, and the courts sent small children to the institutions with little concern for their rights. The 2002 <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> appeared in hindsight to be a well-intentioned but unsatisfactory attempt at a quick fix. In May 2009 CORI agreed to contribute more to the envisaged higher compensation amounts.|$|E

25|$|Prior to this series, the {{two teams}} {{made a deal with}} the match referees to ensure good conduct. The nature of the <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> been contested by the two sides. The Australians insist that the deal stated {{that there would be no}} racism, {{including}} calling others monkeys, and Harbhajan was accused of breaking his promise to Symonds. The Indian officials believed that the deal also obligated the pair to additionally avoid exchanging words. According to Justice John Hansen who carried out the appeal for Harbhajan, the pact was broken by Symonds who swore at Harbhajan at the end of the 116th over.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015 {{the company}} was semi-privatised and became majority-owned by the Atlantic Gateway Consortium, led by David Neeleman, who founded JetBlue, Azul and co-founded WestJet Airlines, {{together}} with Portuguese entrepreneur Humberto Pedrosa. The Atlantic Gateway Consortium purchased 61% of the carrier from the government of Portugal on 24 June 2015, with an option to buy the Portuguese government's remaining 34 percent stake in 2018. This <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> been surrounded in controversy because it was completed {{at the end of}} the center-right government's mandate with wide opposition from TAP employees. On October 2015, a new left-wing government has sought to return majority control of the airline to the state, having signed in February 2016 a deal with the private consortium, which indicates that the company is 50% owned by the Portuguese state, 45% by the Atlantic Gateway Consortium and 5% available shareholder to collaborators and employees of TAP.|$|E
25|$|Though a great <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> been destroyed, {{there are}} still major remains of the abbey and Place House to be seen.

To {{the east of the}} gatehouse ruins, the barest outline of the former church can be seen, including the choir and transepts. Fragments of the cloister buildings survive, including the entrance arches to the chapter house and library in the east range. In the abbey's grounds, the fishponds have been maintained and are used regularly for fishing. In addition, {{to the west of the}} abbey, and outside of the wall ringing the English Heritage site, there is a fragment of an outlying abbey building, the use of which is not recorded.|$|E

25|$|The $500 million ten-year {{contract}} between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and BP (formerly BP Amoco), {{one of the}} world's largest energy production companies, officially went into effect Wednesday November 14, 2007 following approval {{by a majority of}} the faculty. The grant is the largest in the University's history. The <b>deal</b> <b>has</b> garnered criticism from some students and faculty who claim the agreement was negotiated in secret, and that it threatens Berkeley's reputation as an autonomous and democratic institution of higher learning. Supporters of the deal, on the other hand, assert that the infusion of capital from the venture will benefit the campus as a whole at a time when public universities are dealing with increasing cuts in State and Federal funding. They also point out that the BP deal focuses on developing alternative energy, an important issue in today's world.|$|E

The album's mastering was also done using analog processes, by Albini and Steve Rook, at Abbey Road Studios in London.|$|E
