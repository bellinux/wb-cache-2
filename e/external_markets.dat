40|$|The {{concept of}} {{internal}} marketing {{has been discussed}} in marketing literature for over 30 years.

On the other hand, there is considerable empirical evidence concerning the impact of the <b>external</b> <b>market</b> orientation on market and financial performance. Consequently, very few research projects have dealt with the impact of both market orientations on the performance of companies. In this paper a structural model was constructed, consisting of the internal <b>market</b> orientation, <b>external</b> <b>market</b> orientation, market performance and financial performance. With the help of the structural equation model the hypothesis that the internal market orientation is a significant predecessor of the <b>external</b> <b>market</b> orientation was confirmed.

40|$|Research in {{services}} has long {{recognized the need}} for managers to focus internally on employees as well as externally on customers. This internal focus is the domain of internal marketing. Despite over 2 decades of discussion of internal marketing, most operationalizations of marketing are grounded in ideas of product markets and remain resolutely focused on the <b>external</b> <b>market,</b> ignoring the internal focus necessary {{in services}} markets. Such operationalizations of marketing are outdated in modern markets where most purchases involve a combination of product and service elements, and, in the long term, service quality {{may be more important}} than product quality to the consumer. This paper reconceptualizes marketing and develops a new construct, ‘internal market orientation’ (IMO), which closely parallels and complements existing models of <b>external</b> <b>market</b> orientation. The relationship between internal and <b>external</b> <b>market</b> orientations is explored, and the performance implications of IMO are discussed.

40|$|In {{the field}} of service marketing, {{balancing}} internal and <b>external</b> <b>market</b> have been a critical management issue in pursuing service quality excellence. The objective of internal market orientation (IMO) is to more effectively facilitate the activities of internal marketing effectively and hence motivate employee to create value for the company through service excellence. However, in {{the field of}} the strategic marketing, competence /capability-based view is used to illustrate the implementation of marketing-related activities. Day(1994) proposed the concept of <b>marketing</b> capability (<b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability) that describes the integration of knowledge, skills and physical resources in a company. Through this integrated process, all the marketing input would be transformed into real output. Organizational learning is regarded as a source of sustainable competitive advantage of the company. Furthermore, Organizational learning theory derives the concept of learning orientation to navigate learning activities in company. Reviewing past literatures on <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability, we find that most researches are limited to conceptual contribution, rarely examine benefits of <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability that brings to company empirically. This article use Taiwanese service industry data to empirically examine (1) whether executing IMO would aid the development of <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability？(2) whether learning orientation(LO) plays a role of catalyst in the development of <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability？(3) whether positive relationship exist between <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability and company's performance. From the results of this research, we can conclude that (1) IMO definitely contribute to the formation of <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability (2) LO have enforcing effect on the development of <b>external</b> <b>market</b> capability (3) <b>External</b> <b>market</b> capability simultaneously improve the financial, market and innovative performance of corporation. 在服務行銷研究領域中，平衡內、外部市場已被認為是服務公司追求卓越服務品質的重要管理概念，而內部市場導向概念提出的目的，乃希望能進一步協助服務公司在落實內部行銷活動上更能展現出成效，最終激勵員工致力於提供優越的服務品質來為公司創造價值。此外，在策略行銷領域中，也採用能力觀點來詮釋公司整體行銷活動的執行。Day(1994) 率先提出行銷能力(本研究稱之為外部市場能力) 概念，說明公司內部的知識、技能與實體資源進行結合，進而形成公司的整合性流程，最終將行銷投入要素轉換成實質產出。組織學習一直以來被許多學者認為是公司享有持續性競爭優勢的來源之一，而組織學習理論也從公司價值觀的角度切入，發展出學習導向概念，冀望透過學習價值觀來引領公司內部整體的學習活動。 回顧過去在外部市場能力相關議題上，大多數研究只停留在概念性的貢獻，甚少採用實證研究檢視外部市場能力對公司帶來的助益。本研究同樣從內、外部市場平衡觀點出發，但不同於過去的研究內容，本研究主要鎖定台灣地區的服務產業，期望透過實證方式來檢視公司落實內部市場導向，是否真能有助於公司整體外部市場能力的發展？此外，本研究納入學習導向概念，討論公司的學習價值觀是否為公司發展外部市場能力的催化劑？並探討公司的外部市場能力，最終能否提升公司的財務、市場、創新績效？ 本研究整體研究結果也顯示內部市場導向的確有助於外部市場能力的發展，且學習導向具有強化外部市場能力形成的作用。公司投入資源於發展外部市場能力，經由實證結果也證明可為公司帶來財務、非財務績效實質效益，且亦能提升服務公司整體的創新績效。目錄 第一章 緒論	 1 第一節	研究動機	 1 第二節	研究目的	 3 第三節	研究流程	 5 第二章 文獻探討	 6 第一節	市場導向的能力觀點	 6 第二節	內部市場導向概念發展	 13 第三節	學習導向概念發展	 19 第四節	公司績效概念發展	 24 第五節	文獻評論	 25 第三章 研究方法	 26 第一節	研究架構	 26 第二節	假說推論	 27 第三節	研究變數與操作型定義	 31 第四節 研究設計	 37 第五節 資料分析方法	 40 第四章 資料分析與結果	 44 第一節 敘述性統計分析	 44 第二節 抽樣誤差檢定	 53 第三節 驗證型因素分析	 56 第四節 信度與效度分析	 60 第五節 實證分析	 63 第六節 學習導向之調節效果檢定	 67 第七節 整體研究模式之分析	 69 第五章 結論與建議	 72 第一節 研究結論	 72 第二節	理論意涵與實務建議	 76 第三節 研究限制與建議	 80 參考文獻	 82 附錄 研究問卷	 95 表目錄 表 2 - 1 - 1 ：市場導向概念發展	 7 表 2 - 2 - 1 ：內部行銷概念的演變	 14 表 2 - 3 - 1 ：組織學習的定義	 19 表 2 - 3 - 2 ：學習導向概念的介紹	 22 表 3 - 3 - 1 ：內部市場導向之操作型定義與衡量題項	 32 表 3 - 3 - 2 ：學習導向之操作型定義與衡量題項	 34 表 3 - 3 - 3 ：外部市場能力之操作型定義與衡量題項	 35 表 3 - 3 - 4 ：公司績效之操作型定義與衡量題項	 36 表 3 - 3 - 5 ：控制變數之操作型定義與衡量題項	 36 表 4 - 1 - 1 ：基本資料分析	 45 表 4 - 1 - 2 ：學習導向之敘述性統計分析	 47 表 4 - 1 - 3 ：內部市場導向之敘述性統計分析	 49 表 4 - 1 - 4 ：外部市場能力之敘述性統計分析	 51 表 4 - 1 - 5 ：公司績效之敘述性統計分析	 52 表 4 - 2 - 1 ：無反應偏差之T檢定值	 54 表 4 - 2 - 2 ：HARMAN單一因素檢定	 55 表 4 - 3 - 1 ：一階驗證型因素分析模式	 57 表 4 - 3 - 2 ：二階驗證型因素分析模式	 59 表 4 - 4 - 1 ：本研究各構面之信度值	 60 表 4 - 4 - 2 ：學習導向、內部市場導向、外部市場能力與公司績效的 相關係數與AVE值	 62 表 4 - 5 - 1 ：內部市場導向與外部市場能力之複迴歸表	 64 表 4 - 5 - 2 ：外部市場能力與公司績效之複迴歸表	 66 表 4 - 6 - 1 ：學習導向為調節變項之階層回歸分析	 68 表 5 - 1 - 1 ：各研究假說之驗證結果	 72 表 4 - 7 - 2 ：整體理論模型之配適指標與實際值	 71 圖目錄 圖 1 - 1 - 1 ：(發展平衡的內、外部市場導向) 2 圖 1 - 3 - 1 ： 研究流程	 5 圖 2 - 1 - 1 ：能力與公司績效的連結	 10 圖 2 - 1 - 2 ：解構市場意識能力概念	 12 圖 2 - 2 - 1 ：內部市場導向概念的解構	 18 圖 4 - 7 - 1 ：理論模式結構	 70 圖 3 - 1 - 1 ：研究架構	 2...|$|R

Moreover, during these times firms diversify their investment needs and cash flow across industries. We also find similar phenomena outside diversified public firms. Examining the mergers and acquisitions activity of stand-alone and diversified private firms, we uncover similar patterns. In aggregate data, we find that the composition of mergers shifts from focused to diversifying and back with changes in <b>external</b> <b>market</b> conditions.
