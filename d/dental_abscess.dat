50|$|A <b>dental</b> <b>abscess</b> (also {{termed a}} dentoalveolar abscess, tooth abscess or root abscess), is a {{localized}} collection of pus {{associated with a}} tooth. The {{most common type of}} <b>dental</b> <b>abscess</b> is a periapical abscess, and the second most common is a periodontal abscess. In a periapical abscess, usually the origin is a bacterial infection that has accumulated in the soft, often dead, pulp of the tooth. This can be caused by tooth decay, broken teeth or extensive periodontal disease (or combinations of these factors). A failed root canal treatment may also create a similar abscess.|$|E
50|$|Localised <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> may be {{appropriately}} {{treated by}} intra-oral drainage via tooth extraction, opening of root canals and/or intra-oral incision and drainage.

50|$|Intraoral dental sinus (also {{termed a}} parulis and commonly, a gumboil) is an oral lesion {{characterized}} by a soft erythematous papule (red spot) that develops on the alveolar process in association with a non-vital tooth and accompanying <b>dental</b> <b>abscess.</b> A parulis {{is made up of}} inflamed granulation tissue.|$|E
50|$|Successful {{treatment}} of a <b>dental</b> <b>abscess</b> centers on the reduction and elimination of the offending organisms. This can include treatment with antibiotics and drainage. If the tooth can be restored, root canal therapy can be performed. Non-restorable teeth must be extracted, followed by curettage of all apical soft tissue.|$|E
50|$|Anaerobes involve {{almost all}} dental infections. These include <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses,</b> endodontal pulpitis and {{periodontal}} (gingivitis and periodontitis) infections, and perimandibular space infection.

In addition to strict anaerobic bacteria, microaerophilic streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius can also be present.|$|R
40|$|Patients with Vitamin D-resistant rickets have {{abnormal}} tooth morphology such as thin globular dentin and enlarged pulp horns {{that extend}} into the dentino-enamel junction. Invasion of the pulp by microorganisms and toxins is inevitable. The increased fibrotic {{content of the}} pulp, together with a reduced number of odontoblasts, decreases the response to pulp infection. The most important oral findings are characterized by spontaneous gingival and <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> occuring without history of trauma or caries. Radiographic examinations revealed large pulp chambers, short roots, poorly defined lamina dura and hypoplastic alveolar ridge. These <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> are common and therefore the extraction and pulpectomy are the treatment of choice.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> in children originate from dental caries or trauma, a few are associated with unusual conditions which challenge diagnosis and management. Recent research findings have shed light on these unusual entities and greatly improved understanding of their clinical implications. These conditions include developmental abnormalities such as dens invaginatus {{in which there is}} an invagination of dental tissues into the pulp chamber and dens evaginatus in which a tubercle containing pulp is found on the external surface of a tooth crown. In addition, inherited conditions which show abnormal dentine such as dentine dysplasia, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and osteogenesis imperfecta predispose the dentition to abscess formation. Furthermore, 2 ̆ 7 spontaneous 2 ̆ 7 <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> are frequently encountered in familial hypophosphataemia, also known as vitamin D-resistant rickets, in which there is hypomineralization of dentine and enlargement of the pulp. In addition to developmental conditions, there are also acquired conditions which may cause unusual <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses,.</b> These include pre-eruptive intracoronal resorption which was previously known as 2 ̆ 7 pre-eruptive caries 2 ̆ 7 or the 2 ̆ 7 fluoride bomb 2 ̆ 7. In addition, some undiagnosed infections associated with developing teeth are now thought to be the mandibular infected buccal cysts which originate from infection of the developing dental follicles.

The results of the scan as show a swelling of her left upper jaw, and a 3-D image inside her skull revealed a <b>dental</b> <b>abscess,</b> approximately one inch in diameter, which was caused by a diseased upper left incisor. It is likely that the abscess was there for several weeks prior to erupting and that the infection had spread to her upper left jaw bone, as the scan indicated that the bone was pitted with small holes. Additionally, high-resolution scans show tracks on the jawbone that are believed to be a result of unsuccessful attempts to drain the abscess.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{improper}} tooth development, TDO patients {{suffer from}} {{high rates of}} dental caries causing <b>dental</b> <b>abscess.</b> The under maturation of the enamel causes the tooth structure to be softer, and more susceptible {{to the effects of}} bruxism due to abnormalities in skeletal development. The oral abnormalities are evaluated by radiographs and visual examination. Oral radiographs are frequently repeated due to the high incidence of infection due to abnormal biting patterns seen in TDO cases.|$|E
50|$|Teeth {{were another}} {{skeletal}} body part that was modified. Teeth were remodeled by reshaping {{the bottom of}} the teeth, usually by filing the tooth. Precious stones were often placed into bored holes in the teeth; some precious stones were jadeite, pyrite, or turquoise. This practice was most likely done when an individual was reaching young adulthood, as can be told through the dating of the teeth found with these stones placed inside them. These alterations of the teeth most likely caused <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> and possibly infection.|$|R
500|$|Common causes include {{inflammation}} of the pulp, usually in response to tooth decay, dental trauma, or other factors, dentin hypersensitivity (short, sharp pain, usually associated with exposed root surfaces), apical periodontitis ({{inflammation of}} the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone around the root apex), <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses</b> (localized collections of pus, such as apical abscess, pericoronal abscess, and periodontal abscess), alveolar osteitis ("dry socket", a possible complication of tooth extraction, with loss of the blood clot and exposure of bone), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection, also called [...] "trenchmouth"), temporomandibular disorder and others.|$|R

40|$|This study uses paleopathological {{approaches}} to investigate patterns of skeletal stress between individuals of differing ancestry from nineteenth and twentieth century St. Louis, Missouri. The time period from {{early nineteenth century}} through the mid-twentieth century saw St. Louis grow from a small trading post {{to one of the}} largest industrial cities in the United States with large numbers of immigrants, the majority of these immigrants being of Euro-American and African American ancestry. This study involved data collected from a sample of 112 individuals from the Robert J. Terry Skeletal Collection to compare stress between Euro-Americans and African Americans. It was hypothesized that skeletal indicators of stress would appear at higher levels in the African Americans, indicating more stress and poorer health. Skeletal indicators of stress in the form of stature, cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, periostitis, and evidence of rickets were examined assess differences in skeletal stress between ancestry groups. Types of dental disease including linear enamel hypoplasia, <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses,</b> <b>dental</b> caries, and antemortem tooth loss were also examined. The frequency of indicators of stress was compared between groups to identify differences in stress between ancestry groups. The study???s hypothesis was not accepted. Dental diseases were the only indicators of stress with statistical associations. Euro-Americans, specifically older adult females, have significantly higher rates of edentulism. African Americans, primarily the older adults but also the middle adults in one case, have significantly higher rates of <b>dental</b> <b>abscesses,</b> caries, and antemortem tooth loss. It is possible that the low socioeconomic status found across both groups, as well as other factors such as diet or community support equalized the exposure to and manifestation of stress.
