25|$|An ionospheric {{model is}} a {{mathematical}} description of the ionosphere {{as a function of}} location, altitude, day of year, phase of the sunspot cycle and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity.</b> Geophysically, the state of the ionospheric plasma may be described by four parameters: electron density, electron and ion temperature and, since several species of ions are present, ionic composition. Radio propagation depends uniquely on electron density.|$|E
25|$|The <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity</b> {{levels of}} the Earth are {{measured}} by the fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field in SI units called teslas (or in non-SI gauss, especially in older literature). The Earth's magnetic field is measured around the planet by many observatories. The data retrieved is processed and turned into measurement indices. Daily measurements for the entire planet are made available through {{an estimate of the}} Ap-index, called the planetary A-index (PAI).|$|E
25|$|One of Persinger's lifelong endeavors {{has been}} to {{establish}} a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations. The Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) developed by Persinger and John S. Derr predicted that luminous phenomena and associated physical effects were produced by manifestations of tectonic strain that often precedes by weeks to months seismic events within the region. Persinger argues that the labeling of these manifestations such as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) {{has changed over the}} centuries and reflects the characteristics of the culture. The support for the theory was primarily correlational. The temporal contiguity of reports of unidentified luminous phenomena preceding local seismicity due to injections of fluids was considered a quasi-experimental support for the hypothesis. Alternative models, developed by Persinger and David Vares, were quantified for interaction between quantum values and specific magnitude earthquakes, global climate variations, interactions with population densities, discrete energies as mediators of disease, and processes by which human cognition could be covertly affected by Schumann Resonances and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity.</b> The hypothesis was recently criticized by a prominent blogger. Persinger has estimated that the total biomass of the planet was equivalent to the accumulated solar energy (solar constant) on the Earth’s surface. The shared photon origin was considered one source for “entanglement” between living systems.|$|E

2500|$|Persinger {{has stated}} that he studied parapsychological {{phenomena}} because “the ultimate subject matter of science is the unknown”. He thought that verifiable spontaneous and experimental types of parapsychological phenomena were physical and associated with non-local interactions between human brain activity and geophysical processes. For example, Persinge presented evidence that the moderate strength correlation between <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity</b> {{at the time of}} a precognitive experience and what the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity</b> would be two to three days before the event was considered supportive evidence that energetic antecedents before the event [...] not the event was being discerned. [...] Review of the physical properties with W. G. Roll of verified poltergeist phenomena indicated the prevalence of physical properties coupled to increases in <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity</b> due to minute changes in the Earth’s rotational (angular) momentum. During the 1980s he showed both experimental and spontaneous cases of “telepathy and clairvoyance (“remote viewing”) were more likely when the global <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity</b> was lower than the days before or afterwards. [...] Measurement of the brain activity of “psychic” individuals such as Ingo Swann and Sean Harribance revealed unusual electrical brain patterns in the right hemisphere (parahippocampal region), increased photon emissions from the right cerebral hemisphere and small decreases in the intensity of the geomagnetic field when the details of their experiences were most accurate.|$|E
2500|$|His most {{well-known}} hypotheses include the temporal lobes {{as the central}} correlate for mystical (god) experiences, subtle changes in <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity</b> as mediators of parapsychological phenomena, the tectonic strain within the Earth’s crust {{as the source of}} luminous phenomena attributed to unidentified aerial objects, and the importance of specific quantifications for energy (10−20 Joules), [...] photon flux density (picoWatt per meter squared), and small shifts in magnetic field intensities (picoTesla to nanoTesla range) for integrating cellular activity as well as human thought with universal phenomena.|$|E
2500|$|The Earth is {{constantly}} {{immersed in the}} solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, {{a result of the}} two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger. Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activity.</b> [...] Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{geomagnetic}} disturbances {{have been}} indicated as a remote cause of myocardial infarction or stroke. However, {{the mechanism of}} this effect remains unclear. We identified <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> to be a cosmic synchronizer of biological clocks and investigated the effects of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> on heart rate variability (HRV). The effect of geomagnetic disturbances on HRV was longitudinally examined using 7 -day successive records obtained by Holter ECG in 19 adult healthy subjects living in a subarctic area (Alta, Norway, 70 degrees N), where the biological effects of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> have been suggested to be stronger than in other areas. A geomagnetic record (one-minute interval between data acquisition) {{was obtained from the}} Auroral Observatory of the University of Tromso in Tromso, Norway (69 degrees N). HRV decreased in a dose-dependent fashion with geomagnetic disturbances. In the cross-spectral analysis, geomagnetic Pc 6 pulsations observed on magnetically disturbed days were correlated with HRV for the 2 ̆ 7 very low frequency (VLF) 2 ̆ 7 spectral power. The response of HRV to <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> was influenced by the light/dark cycle. The power-law scaling of the power spectra (1 /f fluctuation) became steeper on days with increased geomagnetic disturbance, and the alterations persisted for long periods after the geomagnetic storms. To evaluate whether an artificially generated magnetic field modeled on geomagnetic disturbances would similarly affect the HRV of subjects living in a subarctic area (Winnipeg, Canada, 50 degree N), three healthy volunteers (a Japanese student living in Winnipeg and two Canadians living in the same dormitory as the Japanese student; mean age, 29 years) underwent twelve 8 -hour periods of exposure and sham exposure to the ultra low frequency magnetic fields (ULF-MFs; approximately 30 nT, 1. 6 mHz) in a room shielded from extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low frequency (VLF) magnetic fields. The blood pressure and HRV of the subjects were monitored for 24 hours, including the 8 -hour periods of exposure or sham exposure. Exposure to ULF-MFs influenced HRV, though individual or circadian variations were observed. These results suggest that concomitant longitudinal monitoring of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> and clinical data, especially HRV, may provide useful information for the design of adverse vascular events countermeasures...|$|R

40|$|Energetic {{particle}} {{species with}} emphasis on singly charged oxygen ions in the tail and their related <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> are investigated by using GEOTAIL, CRRES, as well as Cluster data. The O+ ions are a tracer of the ionospheric population in the magnetotail during dynamic process. More ionospheric origin ions participate in magnetospheric storms/substorms than solar wind origin ions during strong <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> The solar wind source is saturated in providing ions into magnetosphere during very intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> (|Dst |> 180 nT, Kp> 7). When the near-Earth recon-nection occurs and expands from the central plasma sheet to the plasma sheet boundary layer or even to the lobe region, more ionosphere origin O+ ions could participate and be energized in the magnetospheric dynamic process. This leads to oxygen-rich injections in the near earth tail region and plasmoids in the distant tail. The ionospheric outflow oxygen ions (initial accelerated at the topside auroral ionosphere) are subsequently energized in the plasmoid. The low O+ abundance observed in some plasmoids {{is consistent with the}} idea that only pre-existing ions in the near-Earth plasma sheet are acceler-ated thus a rather low abundance of O+ ions can be observed. Multiple flux ropes/plasmoids observed in the tail plasma sheet can be interpreted as strong evidence for multiple X-lines. 1...|$|R

30|$|To {{study the}} {{climatology}} of the mid-latitude ionosphere over Korean Peninsula, we analyzed the ionosonde NmF 2 and hmF 2 data measured at Anyang station {{during the period}} of 1998 – 2008 and compared them with model values of IRI- 2007. The variations of NmF 2 values and hmF 2 values with the solar activities, seasons, and local times were investigated for the 9 combined cases of solar and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> When the NmF 2 data were sorted in seasonal and local time bins, correlations of NmF 2 values with the solar activities are apparent for low and moderate <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> The responses of noon NmF 2 values to the solar activity are higher in January than in July, while the solar activity responses of hmF 2 do not show the significant differences over seasons. Those responses are little dependent on <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> Both monthly averaged NmF 2 values and hmF 2 values show clear semi-annual variations at noon and annual variations at midnight. Noontime NmF 2 values are larger in winter than summer, confirming the winter anomaly. Magnitudes of NmF 2 local time variation increase with increasing solar activities except in July when the local time variation is barely seen. The Anyang hmF 2 decreases rapidly at sunrise during all seasons, and shows marginal semidiurnal variation. The IRI- 2007 model NmF 2 values are mostly consistent with the Anyang data, but the model hmF 2 values at midnight are significantly lower than the Anyang data, especially for high solar activities. This hmF 2 discrepancy should be recognized when IRI model is updated for mid-latitude regions. Parameterized results of our climatology analysis may significantly contribute to improving GPS correction algorithms used in Korean peninsula, particularly because accurate estimates of hmF 2 as ionospheric pierce points of GPS signal paths are important for GPS correction procedures.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} die aurora was still active with {{occasional}} pseudo breakup events when die solar wind density diminished to unusually small densities during May 10 - 12, 1999. The aurora {{was observed at}} high magnetic latitudes indicating that the electron precipitation source moved northward as die soar wind and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> decreased. These features are well known and seen at other times when the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities</b> are weak. Intense auroral events accompanied other periods of low solar wind density (for example, February 10, 1997 and May 5, 1998) indicating that the solar wind density alone is not die primary parameter that controls die auroral activity. However, a new auroral feature was observed on May, 11, 1999 during approx. 09 - 20 LIT hours. The electron precipitation was energetic, uniform and covered the polar latitudes commonly identified as die polar cap region. This precipitation lasted form ore that 10 hours and was stable over time scales of tens of minutes. On May 12, as the solar wind began to recover, a prolonged period of dayside activity occurred and was subsequently followed by a "typical" aurora at approx. 05 UT.

Using ICE (Instrument Champ Electrique) and IMSC (Instrument Magnetic Search Coil) experiments onboard the DEMETER (Detection of Electromagnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) satellite we have surveyed possible variations in electromagnetic signals transmitted by the ground-based VLF transmitter NPM in Hawaii and in HF plasma waves close to the Samoa earthquake during the seismic activity. The indices D st and K p were used to distinguish pre-earthquake anomalies from the other anomalies related to the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> In a previous study we have shown that anomalies in IAP (plasma analyzer) and ISL (Langmuir probe) experiments onboard the DEMETER and also TEC (Total Electron Content) data appear 1 to 5 days before the Samoa earthquake.
