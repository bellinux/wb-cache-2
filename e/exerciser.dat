40|$|Introduction We {{evaluated}} {{physical activity}} patterns and trail use among new and habitually active <b>exercisers</b> using onsite trail interviews. Methods Using a cross-sectional study design, 414 adults who accessed two new trails that bisect a rural community of 26, 809 residents were interviewed {{during the first}} summer of the trails official operation (2001). The trails comprise 12 miles of level and paved surface and run parallel to adjacent water sheds, businesses, and neighborhoods. Recent trail activity patterns were obtained, including the following: frequency of use, mode of activity, duration, distance traveled on trail, access points, time of day used, use of exercise companions, and distance traveled to get to trail. Perceived enablers and barriers related to trail use were also obtained. Data were compared between newly adopted <b>exercisers</b> (new <b>exercisers)</b> and individuals active prior to development of the trails (habitually active <b>exercisers).</b> Results Twenty-three percent of the trail users were new <b>exercisers.</b> New <b>exercisers</b> were more dependent on the trails as a primary outlet for physical activity than were habitually active <b>exercisers</b> (P <. 001). New <b>exercisers</b> traveled shorter distances to access the trails and rated convenience as a primary reason for using them. Both safety and terrain issues emerged as enablers for trail use, and unsafe conditions emerged as a concern among new <b>exercisers.</b> Conclusion A community trail {{may be an important}} vehicle for promoting physically active lifestyles. However, new <b>exercisers</b> must overcome issues of proximal and safe access from residential areas in addition to other safety concerns to achieve regular physical activity...|$|R

The sample consists of 12 regular <b>exercisers</b> (7 men & 5 women; age: M = 25. 4  5. 9). A semi-structured interview guide was created for this study, and based on earlier research and the working model.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} training state on cardiac autonomic control in a naturalistic setting. Twenty-four vigorous <b>exercisers</b> were compared to age- and sex-matched sedentary controls. The regular <b>exercisers</b> were subjected to a 6 -week training program after which they were randomized to 2 weeks of continued training or 2 weeks of detraining. Cardiac autonomic control was measured over a 24 -h period by ambulatory recording, using the preejection period (PEP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Nonexercising controls had a significantly higher ambulatory heart rate (HR) compared to the regular <b>exercisers</b> but comparable 24 -h levels of PEP and RSA. In regular <b>exercisers,</b> 2 weeks of detraining did not significantly change the 24 -h levels of HR, PEP, or RSA.

40|$|Body image {{refers to}} an individual's {{internal}} representation ofhis/her outer self (Cash, 1994; Thompson, Heinberg, Altabe, & Tantleff-Dunn, 1999). It is a multidimensional construct which includes an individual's attitudes towards hislher own physical characteristics (Bane & McAuley, 1998; Cash, 1994; Cash, 2004; Davison & McCabe, 2005; Muth & Cash, 1997; Sabiston, Crocker, & Munroe-Chandler, 2005). Social comparison {{is the process of}} thinking about the self in relation to others in order to determine if one's opinions and abilities are adequate and to assess one's social status (Festinger, 1954; Wood, 1996). Research investigating the role of social comparisons on body image has provided some information on the types and nature of the comparisons that are made. The act of making social comparisons may {{have a negative impact on}} body image (van den Berg et ai., 2007). Although exercise may improve body image, the impact of social comparisons in exercise settings may be less positive, and there may be differences in the social comparison tendencies between non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> and <b>exercisers.</b> The present study examined the nature of social comparisons that female collegeaged non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> and <b>exercisers</b> made with respect to their bodies, and the relationship of these social comparisons to body image attitudes. Specifically, the frequency and direction of comparisons on specific tal-gets and body dimensions were examined in both non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> and <b>exercisers.</b> Finally, the relationship between body-image attitudes and the frequency and direction with which body-related social comparisons were made for non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> and <b>exercisers</b> were examined. One hundred and fifty-two participants completed the study (n = 70 non or ill infrequent exercisers; n = 82 <b>exercisers).</b> Participants completed measures of social physique anxiety (SPA), body dissatisfaction, body esteem, body image cognitions, leisure time physical activity, and social comparisons. Results suggested that both groups (non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> and <b>exercisers)</b> generally made social comparisons and most frequently made comparisons with same-sex friends, and least frequently with same-sex parents. Also, both groups made more appearance-related comparisons than non-appearance-related comparisons. Further, both groups made more negative comparisons with almost all targets. However, non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> generally made more negative comparisons on all body dimensions, while <b>exercisers</b> made negative comparisons only on weight and body shape dimensions. MANOV As were conducted to examine if any differences on social comparisons between the two groups existed. Results of the MANOVAs indicated that frequency of comparisons with targets, the frequency of comparisons on body dimensions, and direction of comparisons with targets did not differ based on exercise status. However, the direction of comparison of specific body dimensions revealed a significant (F (7, 144) = 3. 26,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 132) difference based on exercise status. Follow-up ANOVAs showed significant differences on five variables: physical attractiveness (F (1, 150) = 6. 33,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 041); fitness (F(l, 150) = 11. 89,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 073); co-ordination (F(I, 150) = 5. 61,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 036); strength (F(I, dO) = 12. 83,p <. 05; 1] 2 =. 079); muscle mass or tone (F(l, 150) = 17. 34,p <. 05; 1] 2 = 1. 04), with <b>exercisers</b> making more positive comparisons than non or infrequent <b>exercisers.</b> The results from the regression analyses for non or infrequent <b>exercisers</b> showed appearance orientation was a significant predictor of the frequency of social comparisons N (B =. 429, SEB =. 154, / 3 =. 312,p <. 01). Also, trait body image measures accounted for significant variance in the direction of social comparisons (F(9, 57) = 13. 43,p <. 001, R 2 adj =. 68). Specifically, SPA (B = -. 583, SEB =. 186, / 3 = -. 446,p <. 01) and body esteem-weight concerns (B =. 522, SEB =. 207, / 3 =. 432,p <. 01) were significant predictors of the direction of comparisons. For <b>exercisers,</b> regressions revealed that specific trait measures of body image significantly predicted the frequency of comparisons (F(9, 71) = 8. 67,p <. 001, R 2 adj =. 463). Specifically, SPA (B =. 508, SEB =. 147, / 3 =. 497,p <. 01) and appearance orientation (B =. 457, SEB =. 134, / 3 =. 335,p <. 01) were significant predictors of the frequency of social comparisons. Lastly, for <b>exercisers,</b> the results for the regression of body image measures on the direction of social comparisons were also significant (F(9, 70) = 14. 65,p <. 001, R 2 adj =. 609) with body dissatisfaction (B =. 368, SEB =. 143, / 3 =. 362,p <. 05), appearan. ce orientation (B =. 256, SEB =. 123, / 3 =. 175,p <. 05), and fitness orientation (B =. 423, SEB =. 194, / 3 =. 266,p <. 05) significant predictors of the direction of social comparison. The results indicated that young women made frequent social comparisons regardless of exercise status. However, <b>exercisers</b> m,a de more positive comparisons on all the body dimensions than non or infrequent <b>exercisers.</b> Also, certain trait body image measures may be good predictors of one's body comp~son tendencies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether the favourable cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor profile of habitual <b>exercisers</b> {{is attributable to}} exercise or leanness. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 113 nonsmoking men aged 30 - 45 y. CVD risk factors were compared in <b>exercisers</b> (n= 39) and sedentary men (n= 74), and in subgroups of lean <b>exercisers</b> (n= 37), lean sedentary men (n= 46) and obese sedentary men (n= 28). Waist girth was used to identify lean ( or = 100 cm) subgroups. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure, physical activity (7 -day recall), physical fitness (maximum oxygen consumption) and fasted lipoproteins, apolipoprotein (apo) B, triglycerides, glucose and fibrinogen. RESULTS: <b>Exercisers</b> were fitter and leaner than sedentary men and had a better CVD risk factor profile. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo B concentrations were lower in lean <b>exercisers</b> than in lean sedentary men, suggesting that exercise influences these risk factors. Indeed, time spent in vigorous activity was the only significant predictor of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in multiple linear regression models. Exercise status had little influence on triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and unfavourable levels were only evident among obese sedentary men. Waist girth was the sole predictor of triglycerides and HDL-C, explaining 44 and 31 % of the variance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These {{findings suggest that the}} CVD risk factor profile of habitual <b>exercisers</b> is attributable to leanness and exercise.

40|$|Recent {{concerns}} over the impact of antidepressant medications, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on cardiovascular function highlight the importance {{of research on the}} moderating effects of specific lifestyle factors such as physical activity. Studies in affective neuroscience have demonstrated robust acute effects of SSRIs, yet the impact of SSRIs on cardiovascular stress responses and the moderating effects of physical activity remain to be determined. This was the goal of the present study, which involved a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of a single-dose of escitalopram (20 mg) in 44 healthy females; outcomes were heart rate and its variability. Participants engaging in at least 30 minutes of vigorous physical activity at least 3 times per week (regular <b>exercisers)</b> showed a more resilient cardiovascular stress response than irregular vigorous <b>exercisers,</b> a finding associated with a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d= 0. 48). Escitalopram attenuated the cardiovascular stress response in irregular <b>exercisers</b> only (heart rate decreased: Cohen’s d= 0. 80; heart rate variability increased: Cohen’s d= 0. 33).

40|$|Background: Fitness {{exercise}} is popular and associated with improved {{health and social}} status. Taken to extremes, however, exercise can become an addiction. One suggested symptom of exercise addiction is âconflictsâ with family and friends. However, {{it may be difficult}} to recognize excessive exercise patterns if they are accepted and encouraged by relatives. The aim of this study was to explore if fitness <b>exercisers</b> with a high risk of addiction experienced the same level of exercise support as <b>exercisers</b> with a low risk of addiction. Furthermore, we wanted to examine if social support affected the subjective reporting of âconflictsâ. Method: A total of 577 fitness <b>exercisers</b> completed the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and two questions asking about âexercise support from family and friendsâ and âpresent eating disorderâ. Results: <b>Exercisers</b> at high risk of exercise addiction reported the same level of support from relatives as those at low risk. <b>Exercisers</b> with high levels of exercise support reported significantly fewer conflicts, even if they were at high risk of addiction. If an eating disorder was present, the level of exercise support was significantly reduced. Conclusion: Exercise addiction might be difficult to identify with the general behavioral addiction symptom âconflictâ, since {{exercise is}} socially accepted even in subjects with high risk of exercise addiction. If an eating disorder is present, the exercise routines seem to be interpreted as socially undesirable. Screening for exercise addiction with the EAI should take into account that fitness <b>exercisers</b> rarely report conflicts, which could result in false negative cases...|$|R

It included questions about factors influencing food choices, exercise behavior questions, and a food frequency questionnaire. The final sample of 57 <b>exercisers</b> and 70 non-exercisers was examined for differences in opinion about the healthfulness of specific foods, relatedness between opinions and consumption of these foods, and general adequacy of dietary intake. Factor analysis demonstrated a relationship between the constructs "not fattening/fattening" and "good for my health/not good for my health", which we called the "healthfulness" factor and examined further. Opinion about the healthfulness of 20 foods was evaluated. <b>Exercisers</b> were similar to non-exercisers, and in general did not have stronger opinions about the healthfulness of certain foods than the non-exercisers. There were more differences among <b>exercisers</b> stratified by those exercising more frequently, and those exercising less frequently. Consumption of most foods was not related to opinions about the healthfulness of the food for <b>exercisers</b> or nonexercisers. It may be that opinions about the healthfulness of a food, influence a young adult's consumption of that food, but only for foods not considered very tasty. Neither <b>exercisers</b> nor non-exercisers had dietary intakes which compared well with Food Guide Pyramid minimum recommendations, although <b>exercisers</b> did come closer to eating 2 fruits per day than did non-exercisers. For other food groups the trend was for more <b>exercisers</b> to meet the minimum recommendations than non-exercisers, and more males to meet the minimum intakes than females. Overall, consumption of the meat/meat alternate group was closest to recommendations, followed by fruits, grains, dairy, and vegetables. Both groups rated highly the importance of eating nutritious foods, while <b>exercisers</b> felt more confident in their ability to read nutrition labels. Young adults perceive time to be their scarcest resource in matters of food consumption...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to qualitatively examine weight stigma in {{individuals}} who exercise frequently. In total, six focus groups, comprising 30 participants aged 18 – 25 [*]years, were conducted using convenience sampling. All participants were frequent <b>exercisers.</b> Five themes emerged in the data with participants discussing bullying, the consequences of obesity, causes of obesity, lack of willpower and interventions to reduce obesity. This study is the first qualitative examination of weight stigmatisation in frequent <b>exercisers,</b> where the beliefs reported by focus group participants suggest that frequent <b>exercisers</b> stigmatise, discriminate and dehumanise obese people. Future research to examine the impact of weight stigma on exercise motivation and behaviour of obese people appears warranted...|$|R
