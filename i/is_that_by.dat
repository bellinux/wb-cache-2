5|$|The {{degree to}} which {{any one of these}} forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The cumulative effect of these dynamics <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> the beginning of the 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} book on {{kinetic theory}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> Chapman and Cowling. An important {{approach to the}} subject is called Chapman–Enskog theory. There have been many modern developments {{and there is an}} alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.|$|E
25|$|The chief benefit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> {{avoiding}} drawing-off domestic {{hot water}} directly, the tank is not continually fed with cold water, which in 'hard' water areas reduces the deposit of limescale to whatever is dissolved in the original charge of water plus relatively trivial amounts added to replace losses due to seepage.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{commentary}} on the Śiśupālavadha <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> Vallabhadeva, known as the Sandehaviṣauṣadhi. The commentary by Mallinātha {{is known as the}} Sarvaṅkaṣā, and, as on the other five mahakavyas, is considered the pre-eminent one. There are numerous other commentaries on it from different parts of the country, illustrating its importance.|$|E
25|$|The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> nightfall {{nearly the}} entire Cuban {{battalion}} had been destroyed, killing around 150 Cuban soldiers, accounting for that country's biggest single-day casualty rate during its military involvement in Angola.|$|R

50|$|The outcome <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> a {{judgment}} of the House of Lords (5 August 1842) three Congregationalists, three orthodox Presbyterians, and one Baptist were appointed trustees. The income of the trust was then £2,830.|$|R
25|$|The {{objective}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> {{the time}} they leave college, the pupil controls {{the tools of the}} language which are the vocabulary, grammar and the orthography, to be able to read, understand and write texts in various contexts. The teaching of grammar examines texts, and develops awareness that language constitutes a system which can be analyzed.|$|E
25|$|Restoration is {{underway}} {{in the forest}} through careful planning, cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.|$|E
25|$|The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> {{reading his}} writings, one {{can become a}} true {{strategist}} from ability and tactical skill that Musashi had learned in his lifetime. He argues that strategy and virtue are {{something that can be}} earned by knowing the ways of life, the professions around, and perhaps to learn the skills and knowledge of people and the skills of their particular professions.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the episode when Kryten is knocked offline, his CPU plays him a musak version of Copacabana. On the first {{transmission}} of this episode the recording used <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> James Last and his orchestra, but subsequent showings used <b>that</b> <b>by</b> Victor Silvester Junior.|$|R
50|$|Other {{excellent}} recordings, {{according to}} Hans Roelofs, <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> i.a. Karl Richter (Schalk first edition), Colin Davis, Heinz Rögner and Franz Welser-Möst, {{and the more}} recent recordings by Ricardo Luna, Robin Ticciati and Gerd Schaller.|$|R

25|$|The wavy {{waters in}} the picture are {{symbolic}} of Karma; the lotus, of Bhakti; and the rising-sun, of Jnana. The encircling serpent is indicative of Yoga and the awakened Kundalini Shakti, while the swan in the picture stands for Paramatman (Supreme Self). Therefore, {{the idea of the}} picture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> the union of Karma, Jnana, Bhakti and Yoga, the vision of Paramatman is obtained.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of postcolonial literature <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> focusing {{much on the}} distinct culture of the colonized, it seems to ignore the vast human rights violation {{that many of the}} cultural practices contain in them. Culture cannot be unquestionable as there are universal human rights, which should be respected, and to term everything that has emerged in the West, such as the ideals of liberty, as a negative colonial legacy, is a far-fetched proposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} Google Flu Trends (GFT) <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> {{monitoring}} millions of users’ health tracking behaviors online, {{the large number}} of Google search queries gathered can be analyzed to reveal if there is the presence of flu-like illness in a population. Google Flu Trends compared these findings to a historic baseline level of influenza activity for its corresponding region and then reports the activity level as either minimal, low, moderate, high, or intense. These estimates have been generally consistent with conventional surveillance data collected by health agencies, both nationally and regionally.|$|E
30|$|The {{production}} of IAA by isolates from the organic farming system after 96  h ranged from 8 to 180  µg mL− 1, the OD being 1.3 (Fig.  5). The lowest production observed <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> B. cepacia O (8  µg mL− 1) (Fig.  5 b), while the highest <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> Leclercia sp. O (180  µg/mL) (Fig.  5 h). The colonies {{of the other}} isolates (B. vietnamiensis O, Klebsiella sp. O 1 Klebsiella sp. O 2, Klebsiella sp. O 3 and Klebsiella sp. O 4) presented, after 96  h, IAA productions of 14, 20, 12, 27 and 14  µg/mL respectively, with an OD of 1.3 (Fig.  5 b–g).|$|R

50|$|A {{key idea}} in {{cognitive}} psychology <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> studying and developing successful functions in artificial intelligence and computer science, it becomes {{possible to make}} testable inferences about human mental processes. This {{has been called the}} reverse-engineering approach.|$|R
25|$|Carbon {{retirement}} involves retiring allowances from emission trading schemes as {{a method}} for offsetting carbon emissions. Under schemes such as the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, EU Emission Allowances (EUAs), which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, are issued to all the largest polluters. The theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> buying these allowances and permanently removing them, the price of EUAs increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce their emissions.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{a second}} {{extraction}} agent, octyl(phenyl)-N, N-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide(CMPO) {{in combination with}} tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process {{can be turned into}} the TRUEX (TRansUranic EXtraction) process. TRUEX was invented in the USA by Argonne National Laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> lowering the alpha activity of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|E
25|$|These time {{intervals}} {{would seem}} to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.|$|E
50|$|As a {{new century}} {{approached}} Berghaus introduced the Simplex concept in 1997: the idea <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> minimising the layers of fabric in a garment and getting rid of any unnecessary styling you achieve a more breathable, lightweight product.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{positive}} {{review of}} the album <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. from AllMusic, who said [...] "Reflections of Rosemary is well sung and tasteful, and should quickly find its place on mainstream jazz's heavy rotation play lists".|$|R
50|$|Lawmakers and {{the public}} alike had some initial {{concerns}} about changing rape laws. One of the biggest fears <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> changing the law, more accusations would arise and that wrongful convictions would be made. Another concern <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> providing women with more control during the trial, they might become overwhelmed {{in the process and}} end up dropping the case even though a conviction may have been possible. As of now, evidence has shown that there has only been a slight {{increase in the number of}} accusations, but for the most part, the probability of coming to a conviction has remained relatively stable. One of the biggest changes <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the penalties <b>are</b> harsher now than they have been historically.|$|R
25|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> having a single toll road system for the state that controls the major commuter routes into Chicago and the major circumferential route around the city, commuters and long-haul truckers who use the original system that was built in 1958 are subsidizing the subsequent routes, I-88 to Dixon and I-355 in DuPage County. As a result, instead of the original routes becoming freeway, the revenues from the original system subsidized less intensively used routes {{that could not be}} financed on a stand-alone basis.|$|E
25|$|Famous {{players and}} {{football}} figures often give their {{opinion on the}} Maradona and Pelé rivalry, sometimes choosing one over the other. Others prefer not to compare them, as they played in very different times. Perhaps {{one of the most}} reliable comparisons available <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> the Ballon d'Or winners (elected since 1956 by voters of several countries, and arguably greatest ones to properly appreciate both players). Pelé was elected Best Player of the Century for Ballon d'Or winners and Maradona was the runner-up.|$|E
25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Domesday Book <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> this time the native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, particularly Harold Godwinson himself. However, the Bodmin manumissions show that two leading Cornish figures nominally had Saxon names, but these were both glossed with native Cornish names. Naming evidence cited by medievalist Edith Ditmas suggests that many post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans and further proposed this period for the early composition of the Tristan and Iseult cycle by poets such as Beroul from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition.|$|E
25|$|If {{the rates}} were set more reasonably, taxpayers would have less {{incentive}} to avoid paying. His theory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> lowering the tax rates across the board, he {{could increase the}} overall tax revenue. This {{is similar to the}} Laffer curve.|$|R
