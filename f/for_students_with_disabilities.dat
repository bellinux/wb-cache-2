25|$|A written {{document}} that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> who {{are required by}} law to have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E

50|$|Schools are {{required}} to provide special education services but may not be given additional financial resources. The per-student cost of special education is high.
