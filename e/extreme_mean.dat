40|$|From a {{viewpoint}} {{of establishing a}} rational design formula for wind loads for buildings, the reference wind pressure {{is not to be}} based on the largest instantaneous wind speed experienced so far, but on analysis of an annual series of extreme wind speeds. The paper deals with analysis of annual <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> wind speeds obtained at seven meteorological stations in topographically isolated islands of Okinawa, and presents a tentative discussion for the reference wind pressure. The series of annual <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> wind speeds at each station has shown to be well fitted by double exponential distribution. The statistically expected annual <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> wind speeds in 50 years of return period at each station have been calculated, and result in 53. 6, 51. 5 and 61. 0 m/s for Naha, Ishigaki and Miyako, respectively. As a consequence of this study, the reference pressures (kg/m^ 2) of 120 √^ 4, 200 √^ 4 and 260 √^ 4 (h; height in meter) have been tentatively proposed for Daitoh, main island of Okinawa and Ishigaki, and Miyako, respectively, taking the same value of 2. 0 for gust effect factor as in Canadian Code for the consideration of the effects of gusty winds...|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which the leaves of woody dicots encode in their {{physiognomy}} the climatic conditions that exist during dormancy was tested by sampling 20 sites along an approximately west-east transect across European Russia, the Crimean Peninsula, Western Siberia, and central Eastern Siberia. This transect encompassed the most <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> annual temperature range recorded in the modern world where vegetation exists. Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) revealed little change in calibration of the warm month mean temperature compared with the PHYSG 3 AR data set derived from less extreme sites primarily in North America and Japan, but significant change with respect to the cold month mean temperature (CMMT) calibration. Although CLAMP underestimated the CMMT by up to 9 °C in the coldest sites, the addition of the transect sites improved CLAMP's performance at low temperatures. This suggests that winter cold is encoded in foliar physiognomy even though the leaves are functional only during the late spring and summer months. This increase in performance was, however, at the cost of decreasing precision. Precipitation predictive capabilities were only slightly affected, but calibration of key climatic variables such as enthalpy, used in determining palaeoaltitude, remained more or less unchanged after the inclusion of the cold transect samples. © 2004 by The University of Chicago.

Their cores are likely to contain deconfined quarks, hyperons and other exotic phases of matter in which the strong interaction is the dominant force. The inner region of their solid crust is penetrated by superfluid neutrons and their magnetic fields may reach well over 1012 Gauss. Moreover, their <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> densities, well above the densities of nuclei, and their rapid rotation rates makes them truly relativistic both in the special as well as in the general sense.

It is shown that the standard condition R < 3 M is not essential to the trapping mechanism. This point is illustrated using the elegant tool provided by the optical geometry. It is also shown that a realistic equation of state proposed in the literature allows stable neutron star models with closed circular null orbits, something which is closely related to trapped gravitational waves. Furthermore, the general relativistic theory of elasticity is reviewed and applied to stellar models. Both static equilibrium as well as radially oscillating configurations with elasticsources are examined.

In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, carotid IMT, {{an index of}} generalized atherosclerosis, {{was defined as the}} mean of IMT measured by B-mode ultrasonography at six sites of the carotid arteries. The authors assessed the relation of mean IMT to stroke incidence over 6 - 9 years ' follow-up (1987 - 1995) among 7, 865 women and 6, 349 men aged 45 - 64 years without prior stroke at baseline in four US communities. There were 90 incident ischemic stroke events for women and 109 for men. In sex-specific Cox proportional hazards models adjusting only for age, race, and community, the hazard rate ratios comparing <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> IMT values (£ 1 mm) to values less than 0. 6 mm were 8. 5 for women (95 % confidence interval: 3. 5, 20. 7) and 3. 6 for men (95 % confidence interval: 1. 5, 9. 2). The relation was graded, and models with cubic splines indicated significant nonlinearity, with hazards increasing more rapidly at lower IMTs than at higher IMTs. Thus, models using linear IMT values substantially underestimate the strength of the association at lower IMTs. The strength of the association was reduced by the inclusion of putative stroke risk factors, but it remained elevated at higher IMTs. Hence, mean carotid IMT is a noninvasive predictor of future ischemic stroke incidence.

The unweighted multipoint maximum logarithm of odds score (MLS) was 3. 08 on 20 p (location, x̂ = 19. 5 cM) under an additive model, whereas the weighted MLS was 2. 06 on 20 q (x̂ = 57 cM, recurrence risk, λ̂s = 1. 25, P = 0. 009). Weighted logarithm of odds scores of 2. 00 (x̂ = 69. 5 cM, P = 0. 010) and 1. 92 (x̂ = 18. 5 cM, P = 0. 013) were also observed.

Discussion of the hydraulic principles of gauging in tranquil and rapid flow shows why the latter is to be favored for glacier streams. The concept of the station at Vernagtbach, the original stream bed, considerations of proper dimensioning and characteristics of the construction of the gauging channel are described in detail. A brief history is given of planning, organization and technology involved. The water level is recorded by two floats and one pneumatic gauge which together provide uninterrupted and trouble-free records. The rating curve was determined with current meters and shows an unambiguous relation between water level and discharge with little scattering of calibration values. Temporary changes of flow conditions up-stream of the station do not have any noticeable effect on the water level in the channel.

Generally, as grazing treatment intensity increased from light to <b>extreme,</b> <b>mean</b> vegetation structural values decreased for visual obstruction readings, tallest plants of grasses, forbs, and shrubs, and litter depth. Nineteen species of non-game birds were detected during 2001 and 2002. Overall breeding bird densities were negatively affected by increasing levels of grazing intensity in mixed-grass prairie. Claycolored sparrows (Spizella pallida), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and savannah sparrows (Passrculus sandwichensis) reached their highest densities in the light and moderate grazing intensity treatments whereas they occurred at very low densities or were absent from extreme grazing intensity treatments. In contrast, densities of chestnut-collared longspurs (Calcarius omatus), horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), and willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) were highest in the heavy and extreme grazing treatment plots. Livestock average daily weight gains and body condition scores decreased directly with increasing grazing intensity. In contrast, average red meat production gains per unit of pasture had a quadratic relationship to stocking rates, increasing with increased grazing intensity (more animals per unit of pasture) until it reached a peak and then declined. Results from {{this study suggest that}} management of grassland habitats can be manipulated under specific grazing intensities to provide predictable conditions of nesting habitat for grassland bird species of management concern.

Energy balance models, used {{in association with}} satellite observations, are beneficial to map spatial variability of evapotranspiration which is mainly governed by different vegetation practices and local environmental conditions. This study utilize the Surface Energy Balance System model to estimate actual evapotranspiration and water scarcity footprints under complex landscape of Korean peninsula using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for a complete hydrological year of 2012. The modeled evapotranspiration was compared with flux tower measurements obtained from a subhumid cropland and temperate forest sites for the accuracy assessment. This accuracy comparison at daily scale had good agreement yielding reasonable coefficient of determination (0. 72, 0. 51), bias (0. 41 mm day− 1, 1. 01 mm day− 1) and root mean squared error (0. 92 mm day− 1, 1. 53 mm day− 1) at two observation (cropland, forest) sites, respectively. Furthermore, the monthly aggregated evapotranspiration from Surface Energy Balance System showed promising results than those of obtained from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer based readymade global evapotranspiration product, i. e., MOD 16, when both products were compared with unclosed and closed flux tower measurements. However, the variations in monthly evapotranspiration obtained from both products were significantly controlled by several climate factors and vegetation characteristics. Water stress mapping at regional and monthly scale also revealed strong contrast between the products of two approaches. Highest mean water stress (0. 74) was observed for land use areas associated with evergreen forest and under sparsely vegetation condition by using estimated evapotranspiration from Surface Energy Balance System while an <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> water stress value of 0. 56 by using end product of MOD 16 evapotranspiration was raised from cropland regions.

We created a platform where electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed in public hospitals for the safety assessment of DHA/PPQ, at baseline before the use of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (Eurartesim®), and on day 3 (before and after administration of the final dose) and day 7 post-administration. Laboratory analyses included haematology and clinical chemistry. The main objective of the ECG assessment in this study was to evaluate the effect of administration of DHA/PPQ on QTc intervals and the association of QTc intervals with changes in blood biochemistry, full and differential blood count over time after the DHA/PPQ administration. A total of 1315 patients gave consent and were enrolled of which 1147 (87 %) had complete information for analyses. Of the enrolled patients 488 (42 %), 323 (28 %), 213 (19 %) and 123 (11 %) were from Ghana, Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Mozambique, respectively. Median (lower-upper quartile) age was 8 (5 - 14) years and a quarter of the patients were children under five years of age (n = 287). Changes in blood biochemistry, full and differential blood count were temporal which remained within clinical thresholds and did not require any intervention. The mean QTcF values were significantly higher than on day 1 when measured on day 3 before and after administration of the treatment as well as on day 7, four days after completion of treatment (12, 22 and 4 higher, p < 0. 001). In all age groups the values of QT, QTcF and QTcB were highest on day 3 after drug intake. The mean extreme QTcF prolongation from baseline was lowest on day 3 before drug intake (33 ms, SD = 19) and highest on day 3 after the last dose (60 ms, SD = 31). There were 79 (7 %) events of <b>extreme</b> <b>mean</b> QTcF prolongation which were not clinically significant. Nearly a half of them (n = 37) were grade 3 and mainly among males (33 / 37).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveClinical and {{anatomic}} factors {{predictive of}} a favorable response to renal revascularization performed for renal function salvage remain poorly defined. To clarify {{decision making in}} such patients we reviewed a contemporary experience of surgical renal artery revascularization (RAR) performed primarily for preservation of renal function. MethodsBetween June 1990 and March 2001 (ensuring 1 year minimum follow-up), 96 patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine [Cr] concentration ≥ 1. 5 mg/dL) and hypertension underwent RAR for preservation of renal function. Study end points included early and late renal function response, progression to dialysis dependence, and long-term survival. Variables potentially associated with these end points were assessed with univariate analysis, Cox regression analysis, and logistic regression analysis, and survival was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method. ResultsPerioperative failure of RAR occurred in 3 patients (3 %), with perioperative mortality in 4 patients (4. 1 %); thus 92 patients were available for long-term follow-up (mean, 39 months). Mean patient age was 70 ± 9 years with a mean baseline Cr of 2. 6 mg/dL (range, 1. 5 - 7. 8 mg/dL). Operative management consisted of aortorenal bypass in 38 % of patients, extraanatomic bypass in 38 % of patients, and endarterectomy in 24 % of patients; 32 % of patients required combined aortic revascularization and RAR, and 27 % underwent bilateral RAR. At hospital discharge renal function had improved (20 % decrement in Cr) in 41 (43 %) patients, including 7 patients who were removed from dialysis; remained unchanged in 40 (41 %) patients; and declined (20 % increase in Cr) in 15 (16 %) patients. At last follow-up renal function was either improved or unchanged in 72 % of patients. Predictors of a favorable response to RAR at last follow-up included stable Cr at hospital discharge (odds ratio [OR], 7. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 5 - 21. 8; P =. 0004) and decreased Cr at hospital discharge (OR, 16; 95 % CI, 1. 6 - 307. 8; P <. 0001); bilateral renal artery repair (OR, 3. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 9 - 10. 6; P =. 07) approached clinical significance. Predictors of worsened excretory function at last follow-up included decline of renal function at hospital discharge (OR, 28. 9; 95 % CI, 5. 0 - 165. 4; P =. 0002), intervention to treat unilateral renal artery stenosis (OR, 3. 8; 95 % CI, 0. 8 - 16. 6; P =. 05), and level of baseline Cr (OR, 3. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 4. 0; P =. 04). Progression to dialysis occurred in 16 (17 %) patients. Dialysis-free survival at 5 years was 50 %, and overall actuarial survival at 5 years was 59 %. Predictors of progression to dialysis during follow-up included treatment of complete renal artery occlusion (OR, 6. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 29. 5; P =. 02), early failure of RAR (OR, 3. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 7 - 14. 2; P =. 04) and baseline Cr (OR, 2. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 6. 1; P =. 006). ConclusionLong-term clinical success in the preservation of renal function, noted in 70 % of patients, can be predicted by the initial response to RAR and by anatomic factors, in particular, bilateral repair. While <b>extreme</b> (<b>mean</b> Cr ≥ 3. 2 mg/dL) renal dysfunction generally is predictive of poor long-term outcome, a subset of patients will experience favorable results, even {{to the extent of}} rescue from dialysis.

The first of these has been built by Richard Packard {{and his colleagues at}} the University of California, Berkeley. The <b>extreme</b> sensitivity <b>means</b> that theoretically a larger version could detect effects like minute changes in the rotational rate of the Earth.|$|R
40|$|Although many {{statistical}} methods focus on representing the mean tendencies {{of a process}} or population, often the connection to a scientific context is best served by considering extreme values of a distribution. By <b>extremes</b> we <b>mean</b> observations or outcomes that have low probability of occurrence but which can be very large. Often such events are said t...|$|R
50|$|Temperatures are low {{year round}} but without extreme minimum {{temperature}}s. The mean temperature in summer is 8.3 C with <b>mean</b> <b>extremes</b> of 16.2 C and 3.0 C while in winter, the mean temperature is 3.3 C with <b>mean</b> <b>extremes</b> of 7.7 C and -4 C. Mean temperatures are lower in Tierra del Fuego {{but due to}} the moderating influence of the ocean, extreme minimum temperatures are higher than in Tierra del Fuego. Coastal areas have average temperatures above 0 C in the coldest month while higher altitude locations may average below 0 C.|$|R

In {{a letter}} to his former professor Michael Mästlin, he wrote, [...] "If on a line which is divided in <b>extreme</b> and <b>mean</b> ratio one constructs a right angled triangle, such that the right angle is on the perpendicular put at the section point, then the smaller leg will equal the larger segment of the divided line." ...|$|R
