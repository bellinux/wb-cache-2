5|$|In 2010, a team {{of doctors}} from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of {{training}} at the cystic <b>fibrosis</b> clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic <b>fibrosis</b> center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. <b>Fibrosis</b> in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} SP-A1 to total SP-A has been {{correlated}} with lung disease (e.g. asthma, cystic <b>fibrosis)</b> and aging. Methylation of SFTPA1 promoter sequences {{has also been}} found in lung cancer tissue.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{disorders}} include cystic <b>fibrosis,</b> pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete {{development of}} the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency in SP-A {{levels is}} {{associated}} with infant respiratory distress syndrome in prematurely born infants with developmental insufficiency of surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. Alterations of the relative levels of SP-A1 and SP-A2 {{have been found in}} BALF from patients with cystic <b>fibrosis,</b> asthma, and infection.|$|E
25|$|Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause <b>fibrosis</b> {{anywhere}} in the body, particularly the syndrome of retroperitoneal <b>fibrosis,</b> as well as cardiac valve <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Role of Thy-1 in <b>fibrosis</b> and {{fibroblast}} differention {{may have}} some tissue variation. In lung <b>fibrosis</b> Thy-1 level is suppressed in stimulated fibroblasts. Thy1 knock out mice have increased <b>fibrosis</b> in the lung. <b>Fibrosis</b> induced by radiation mimicking chemotherapeutic agent Bleomycin is also increased in these mice.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons of cystic <b>fibrosis</b> against non-cystic <b>fibrosis</b> airway {{epithelial}} cells shows that various miRNAs are differentially regulated {{in response to}} the disease. mir-126 is suspected {{to play a role in}} regulating the innate immune responses within Cystic <b>Fibrosis</b> affected lungs.|$|E
25|$|CFTR, the {{transporter}} {{involved in}} the disease Cystic <b>Fibrosis,</b> is also considered part of this subfamily. Cystic <b>fibrosis</b> occurs upon mutation and loss of function of CFTR.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes idiopathic pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy {{is usually not}} necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of <b>fibrosis</b> indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
25|$|The cystic <b>fibrosis</b> genetic {{mutation}} known as delta-F508 in humans {{has been said}} to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic <b>fibrosis)</b> are more resistant to V. cholerae infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic <b>fibrosis</b> transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} and renowned CF programs in the city, the Saint Vincent's Cystic <b>Fibrosis</b> therapy program offered care for patients with cystic <b>fibrosis</b> and attracted patients from around the region.|$|E
25|$|So far, no {{large-scale}} research {{involving the}} incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in adults with cystic <b>fibrosis</b> has been conducted. This is likely because {{the vast majority of}} people with cystic <b>fibrosis</b> do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|In Europe E. dermatitidis {{tends to}} be {{associated}} with cystic <b>fibrosis,</b> and is frequently found to have colonized the lungs of CF patients. In one study, E. dermatitidis could be isolated from 6.2% of cystic <b>fibrosis</b> patients using erythritol-chloramphenicol agar culture dishes. Exophiala dermatitidis has also been reported as the etiological agent of lung infections causing pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Hastings died of {{pulmonary}} <b>fibrosis</b> on August 6, 2014 at Lexington, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|SOD {{may reduce}} free radical damage to skin—for example, to reduce <b>fibrosis</b> {{following}} radiation for breast cancer. Studies {{of this kind}} must be regarded as tentative, however, as there were not adequate controls in the study including a lack of randomization, double-blinding, or placebo. Superoxide dismutase is known to reverse <b>fibrosis,</b> possibly through de-differentiation of myofibroblasts back to fibroblasts.|$|E
25|$|The large {{intestine}} also secretes K+ and Cl-. Chloride secretion increases in cystic <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cystic <b>fibrosis</b> {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the CFTR gene, which is a chloride channel.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 {{he married}} Shirley Anne Webb. Their two {{children}} died in childhood from cystic <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Elevated CTGF (a.k.a. CCN2) {{which is}} a matricellular protein known to be {{reliable}} for <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|FibroTest is a {{biomarker}} for <b>fibrosis</b> {{that can}} be done instead of a biopsy.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no strong}} {{evidence}} that people with cystic <b>fibrosis</b> can prevent osteoporosis by increasing their intake of vitamin D. Bisphosphonates taken by mouth or intravenously {{can be used to}} improve the bone mineral density in people with cystic <b>fibrosis.</b> When taking bisphosphates intravenously, adverse effects such as pain and flu-like symptoms can be an issue. The adverse effects of bisphosphates taken by mouth on the gastrointestinal tract are not known.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes diffuse {{inflammation}} {{results in}} complete loss of villi, involvement of multiple layers, submucosal oedema and <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Occasionally {{tamoxifen}} is used {{in treatment}} of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal <b>fibrosis</b> and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Addison's disease, {{pituitary}} insufficiency, or cystic <b>fibrosis</b> {{sometimes have}} a hyper-sensitivity {{to the five}} primary tastes.|$|E
25|$|William Miller died on March 17, 2006 from {{idiopathic}} pulmonary <b>fibrosis,</b> a lung condition, {{at the age}} of 81.|$|E
25|$|Bush is the honorary {{chairman}} of the Annual AT Jeb Bush Florida Golf Classic, a fundraiser that benefits the Cystic <b>Fibrosis</b> Foundation. He first {{became involved in the}} benefit after meeting with committee member Lawson Dutton, whose child suffered from cystic <b>fibrosis.</b> Supporters raised more than 722,000 in 2014 at the , exceeding their goals in attendance and revenues raised. Since the event’s inception 19 years ago, the total revenue netted has reached over 7.478 million.|$|E
25|$|Once {{dilation}} of the atria has occurred, this {{begins a}} chain of events that leads to the activation of the renin aldosterone angiotensin system (RAAS) and subsequent increase in matrix metalloproteinases and disintegrin, which leads to atrial remodeling and <b>fibrosis,</b> with loss of atrial muscle mass. This process is not immediate, and experimental studies have revealed patchy atrial <b>fibrosis</b> may precede the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and may progress with prolonged durations of atrial fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{completed}} {{on the effectiveness of}} introducing inhaled glutathione to people with cystic <b>fibrosis</b> with mixed results.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases (panbronchiolitis, asthma, cystic <b>fibrosis,</b> bronchitis). Both doxycycline and minocycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects.|$|E
25|$|Cystic <b>fibrosis</b> transmembrane {{conductance}} regulator (CFTR) is a {{membrane protein}} and chloride channel in vertebrates that is encoded by the CFTR gene.|$|E
25|$|Some {{diseases}} are hereditary and run in families; others, such as infectious diseases, {{are caused by}} the environment. Other diseases come {{from a combination of}} genes and the environment. Genetic disorders are diseases that are caused by a single allele of a gene and are inherited in families. These include Huntington's disease, Cystic <b>fibrosis</b> or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Cystic <b>fibrosis,</b> for example, is caused by mutations in a single gene called CFTR and is inherited as a recessive trait.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} with this syndrome {{have also been}} found to have ocular abnormalities, including bilateral <b>fibrosis</b> upon the optic disc and dilated capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound, CT, and MRI can all {{identify}} steatosis (fatty changes) of {{the liver}} tissue and nodularity {{of the liver}} surface suggestive of cirrhosis. CT and especially MRI are able to provide {{a higher level of}} detail, allowing visualization and characterize such structures as vessels and tumors within the liver. Unlike steatosis and cirrhosis, no imaging test is able to detect liver inflammation (i.e. hepatitis) or <b>fibrosis.</b> Liver biopsy is the only definitive diagnostic test that is able to assess inflammation and <b>fibrosis</b> of the liver.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis is a late {{stage of}} serious liver disease marked by {{inflammation}} (swelling), <b>fibrosis</b> (cellular hardening) and damaged membranes preventing detoxification of {{chemicals in the}} body, ending in scarring and necrosis (cell death). Between 10% to 20% of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis of the liver (NIAAA, 1993). Acetaldehyde {{may be responsible for}} alcohol-induced <b>fibrosis</b> by stimulating collagen deposition by hepatic stellate cells. The production of oxidants derived from NADPH oxi- dase and/or cytochrome P-450 2E1 and the formation of acetaldehyde-protein adducts damage the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} no {{clinically}} approved agents that can reduce pulmonary and airway cell dropout and avert the transition to pulmonary and /or airway <b>fibrosis.</b>|$|E
