5|$|The {{plan that}} the Union {{officers}} devised was called Moss 3, {{named after the}} Pittston’s Moss 3 Preparation Plant which was its primary coal processing plant at the time. The officials were very secretive about planning this act of nonviolent strike. They wanted Pittston to <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> {{what was about to}} take place. Officials selected 99 union members out of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky to participate in Moss 3 and the selected miners met in Virginia and were told about the plan.|$|E

Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of the}} conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E

5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E

25|$|Using the Gauss {{algorithm}} {{for years}} prior to 1583 is historically pointless since the Gregorian calendar was not utilised for determining Easter before that year.

Easter calculations are based on agreements and conventions, not on the actual celestial movements nor on indisputable facts of history.|$|E
25|$|Sa Pa is a {{frontier}} township and capital of Sa Pa District in Lào Cai Province in north-west Vietnam. It was first inhabited by people we <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about.</b> They {{left in the}} entire valley hundreds of petroglyphs, mostly composed of lines, which experts think date from the 15th century and represent local cadastres. Then came the highland minorities of the Hmong and Yao. The township {{is one of the}} main market ones in the area, where several ethnic minority groups such as Hmong, Dao (Yao), Giáy, Pho Lu, and Tày live. These are the four main minority groups still present in Sa Pa district today. The Kinh (lowland Vietnamese) never originally colonised this highest of Việt Nam’s valleys, which lies in the shadow of Phan-Xi-Pǎng (Fansipan, 3143m), the highest peak in the country.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, {{implemented}} a grade deflation policy {{to curb the}} number of A-range grades undergraduates received. Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as {{a larger percentage of}} the student body received them. While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school. Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally, but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades, Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated. The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped {{down at the end of}} the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.|$|E

500|$|Andranik is {{generally}} {{seen as a}} pro-Russian/Soviet figure. During the Soviet period, his legacy {{and those of other}} Armenian national heroes were diminished and [...] "any reference to them would be dangerous since they represented the strive for independence", especially prior to the Khrushchev Thaw. Paruyr Sevak, a prominent Soviet Armenian author, wrote an essay about Andranik in 1963 after reading one of his soldier's notes. Sevak wrote that his generation knew [...] "little about Andranik, almost nothing." [...] He continued, [...] "knowing nothing about Andranik means to <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> modern Armenian history." [...] In 1965, Andranik's 100th anniversary was celebrated in Soviet Armenia.|$|E

The apartment also echoes the film The Man Who Fell to Earth, with a book prop named Masterpieces in Paint and Poetry and a tennis courtroom with similar wallpaper. Set designers selected four Kansas City sculptors' works for use on the set of Dr. Manhattan's apartment, after discovering their works on the Internet. Filming ended on February 19, 2008.|$|E

The best groove {{so far this}} year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it should be done, a one-sided, one-track 12inch (it doesn't need any dub or instrumentals). 'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the band it could easily be a piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)." ...|$|E

500|$|The band wasn't {{without a}} guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a {{replacement}} for McKnight in teenage guitarist, John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band.

500|$|The outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Aletta {{produced}} torrential {{rains and}} high winds over Central America for several days, and precipitation totals were {{as high as}} [...] in some areas with a peak of [...] in Chinandega. A red cross official stated that [...] "Entire families were swept away by [...] and we <b>know</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> them". Because all sewers in Nicaragua were damaged, the water was contaminated. Ninety percent of the banana crop and 60percent of the corn crop was completely destroyed. Throughout the country, 108 people were killed, (10 of which drowned in floodwaters). Roughly 20,000people were homeless and total damage was estimated at $365million (1982USD); damage to highways, factories, and farms exceeded $100 million. In the northern portion of the country, a mudslide buried three small mountain villages, leaving 270missing and only 29survivors. About 15,000 sought to two emergency shelters. Many bridges were damaged. Since {{the capital city of}} Leon was hardest hit, a disaster area was declared for the nearby area.
