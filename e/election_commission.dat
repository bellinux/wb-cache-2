5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old.

Elections are supervised by an independent Central <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E

Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E
