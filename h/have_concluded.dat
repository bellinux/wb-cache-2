5|$|In {{another version}} of the script, the film was to <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> with the Maitlands, Deetzes, and Otho {{conducting}} an exorcism ritual that destroys Betelgeuse, and the Maitlands transforming into miniature versions of themselves and moving into Adam's model of their home, which they refurbish to look like their house before the Deetzes moved in.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} {{controversial}} because many historians and writers <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> {{that it was}} failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. To resist the offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited the initiative to the Allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} to <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> with Homer eating a pizza in his {{hospital}} bed following the operation, and with Marge asking a nurse where the pizza had come from. This reflects the earlier flashback scene where Grampa Simpson watches Homer as an infant, chewing on a slice of pizza in the hospital. The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care.|$|E

5|$|According to the 9th century History of the Britons, a man {{listed as}} Guillem Guercha {{was the first}} of his line to rule as king of the East Angles. The History of the Britons lists Guillem Guercha's {{descendants}} and ancestors: 'Woden begat Casser, who begat Titinon, who begat Trigil, who begat Rodmunt, who begat Rippa, who begat Guillem Guercha, who was the first king of the East Angles'. According to the 19th-century historian Sir Francis Palgrave, Guercha was a distortion of Wuffa. D. P. Kirby is among those historians who <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> from this information that Wuffa's father was the founder of the Wuffingas line.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E

5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2009, exactly 15 {{years after}} the SL9 impacts, a new black spot {{about the size of}} the Pacific Ocean {{appeared}} in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and spectroscopic analysis detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich dust in the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.|$|E

5|$|Shada was a six-part serial {{written by}} Douglas Adams {{that was to}} <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> Series 17 in 1980. Production was halted during filming due to a strike and never resumed, {{although}} a reconstruction of the serial using narration and existing footage was later released on VHS in 1992. The story was later adapted by Big Finish in 2003 as a webcast production featuring Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor (and later released as an audio story that same year), while Adams himself reused elements from the serial for his first Dirk Gently novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. The story was novelized by Gareth Roberts in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Some {{solar power}} plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come under {{scrutiny}} for bird mortality. In general, these facilities are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out. However, {{in the case of}} concentrated {{solar power plants}} such as the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, studies <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> that a significant number of birds and bats are injured or killed either by colliding into the heliostat mirrors or from burning in solar flux created by the mirror field. Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that art and architecture historians <b>have</b> <b>concluded</b> that van Eyck must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the painting with a particular building. Yet, and as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This is evident {{from a number of}} features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed colonnade.|$|E
