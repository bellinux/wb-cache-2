25|$|Federal {{ownership}} brought Petro-Canada {{into conflict}} with the provincial governments which had control over the largest and lowest cost oil production in the country. They objected to federal intrusion into their constitutional jurisdiction, and tried to block federal incursions. For instance, when Petro-Canada attempted to buy Husky Oil in 1978, the Alberta government surreptitiously got control of Husky stock through Alberta <b>Gas</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line,</b> and successfully blocked the takeover. In 1979 Petro-Canada acquired Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. and Pacific Petroleums Ltd., its parent company, as a fully integrated oil company for the then-record purchase price of $1.5 billion.|$|E
2500|$|Accordingly, Alberta {{passed the}} Alberta <b>Gas</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> Act. Alberta <b>Gas</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> (later known as NOVA Corporation’s Gas Transmission Division) would gather gas within the province, [...] {{delivering}} the commodity to federally regulated TransCanada PipeLines and other export pipelines {{just inside the}} Alberta border.

40|$|In this paper, a {{real-world}} {{case study of}} a natural gas supply chain is investigated. By using concepts related to natural gas industry and the relations among the components of transmission and distribution network, a six-level supply chain has been introduced and presented schematically. The defined supply chain is a single-objective, multi-period, and single-product problem that is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming model, which can easily be linearized. The objective of this model is to minimize direct or indirect distribution costs. There are six groups of constraints including capacity, input and output balancing, demand satisfaction, network flow continuity, and relative constraints to the required binary variables. The solution algorithm {{of the problem is}} hierarchical; in each step, one section of the problem is solved using an exact method; the outputs of this section are passed to the next relative section as inputs. Finally, it is shown that the problem has been solved in a reasonable time and desirable results are attained. The use of proposed model and its solution approach have been studied in two <b>gas</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>lines,</b> to present the priority of its cost saving.

As such, Peace River Oil’s 20-inch pipeline from Zama to Valleyview (Northwest System) had difficulty delivering profitability, and in 1971, the Peace River Oil Pipe Line sold the Northwest system to Alberta <b>Gas</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> for approximately $25 million.

The simplest devised constructing a branch from the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> at a location north of Jessheim Station which would run to the airport. Alternatively, and ultimately selected, was construction of a tunnel eastwards from Oslo to Lillestrøm and an upgrade of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> and a new route from a point at Asper to the airport. Two more direct routes were proposed; the one branching off from north of Grefsen Station on the Gjøvik Line, the other diverting from the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> close to Grorud Station.

25|$|Several routes were {{considered}} for the Loenga–Alnabru Line.

When the load of <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> was unbalanced, the controller will switch the connected single-phase loads from one phase to another to balance it.
