40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} hydrolytic processing of sheep wool in two stages (alkaline pre-processing and enzymatic hydrolysis) into keratin hydrolysate. Employed proteolytic enzymes were Esperase 6. 0 T and Everlase 6. 0 T. Modeling technological conditions for breakdown proceeded applying {{the method of}} factor tests of 2 3 type, in which factors under study were additions of Ca(OH) 2 (3 - 9 %, w/w), temperatures in first processing stage (40 - 80 °C) and temperatures in second processing stage (40 - 60 °C) <b>influencing</b> <b>quantity</b> of broken down wool (determined through gravimetric analysis). When using enzyme Esperase 6. 0 T quantities of broken down wool were 8. 4 - 59. 2 % wool; with enzyme Everlase 6. 0 T 4. 7 - 39. 6 % wool (depending on conditions of hydrolysis). Results were statistically processed and statistic significance of factors under study was analyzed. Results of sheep wool breakdown presented graphically in contour charts indicate the influence of two most significant factors with a selected level of third factor and show the possibility to model breakdown conditions in such manner that keratin hydrolysate of required properties is obtained. © 2011 RASĀYAN.

40|$|AbstractThe {{quality of}} any {{laboratory}} intercomparison depends {{to a large}} extent on the performance of the used flow meter. To find a flow meter that is capable of reaching a reproducibility better than 0. 05 % requires bounding all involved <b>influence</b> <b>quantities</b> down to the required level. The present paper describes the efforts performed while qualifying a time-of-flight ultrasonic flow meter as a transfer standard. It was determined that the most relevant <b>influence</b> <b>quantity</b> besides the flow profile within the bulk flow is the effect caused by the transducer pockets in the meter body. By taking advantage of a specially designed window chamber, it was possible to determine the magnitude of the errors introduced by the transducer pockets and to define, based on the findings, a procedure to perform a bilateral comparison between the hot water calibration facilities of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an a priori simuation {{process of the}} uncertainty that will be achieved using a validated procedure for an analyte in a matrix. for this, a valid model equation is built, where the different <b>influence</b> <b>quantities</b> are allowed to vary within a wide robust tolerance window. For these <b>influence</b> <b>quantities</b> an approximate measurement uncertainty contribution relative to the measured (i. e. quantity to be measured) is calculated and only those that significantly affect the measurement uncertainty (expanded k = 2, relative) at the target level are taken into account. A target value of uncertainty of 2 % is used here as an example since it is deemed to be achievable by experienced laboratories that are not primarily concerned with measuring at a lower uncertainty level. The approach is demonstrated on the determination of nickel in low-alloy steel and copper in fresh water. However this basic approach using target uncertainty and wide tolerance windows is general and can easily be adapted for other applications. JRC. D. 4 -Isotope measurement...|$|R

In CT the measurement process is influenced by the X-ray source, the specimen, the detector, the scanning geometry, the environment, the user, the software and the data evaluation.

40|$|Webs are {{fundamental}} to the ecology of Nephila clavipes, the golden orb-weaver spider, because they serve as sites for prey capture, reproduction, competition, predation, and parasitism. In addition {{to the presence of}} the female N. clavipes, males and kleptoparasites reside on the web in varying numbers. Webs are also found in clusters with conspecific females. Web site selection and length of web tenure is a behavioral decision vital to the spider’s fitness and the ecology of her species. I conducted a field census to quantify these factors and analyze their influence on web tenure, compare web ecology between a forest and non-forest habitat, as well as explain the significance of N. clavipes’ web as central to many interactions. Web tenure, as well, was influenced differently by the factors between both environments. In the forest habitat, increase in prey capture rate decreased web tenure and inclusion in cluster increased web tenure. In the non-forest habitat, only increase in spider size was related to increased web tenure. There were {{significant differences between the two}} habitats in the sizes of the female spider and quantity of males and kleptoparasites.

40|$|In {{coordinate}} measurement metrology, {{assessment of}} the measurement uncertainty of a particular measurement is not a straight forward task. A feasible way for calculation of the measurement uncertainty {{seems to be the}} use of a Monte Carlo method. In recent years, a number of Monte Carlo methods have been developed for this purpose, we have developed a Monte Carlo method that can be used on CMM’s that takes into account, among other factors, the auto correlation of the error signal. We have separated the errors in linearity errors, rotational errors, straightness errors and squareness errors. Special measurement tools have been developed and applied to measure the required parameters. The short-wave as well as the long-wave behavior of the errors of a specific machine have been calibrated. A machine model that takes these effects into account is presented here. The relevant errors of a Zeiss Prismo were measured, and these data were used to calculate the measurement uncertainty of a measurement of a ring gauge. These calculations were compared to real measurements. 1. UNCERTAINTY CALCULATION Assessing measurement uncertainty implies assessing the distribution of the possible measurement results.
