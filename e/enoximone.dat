40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of low-dose <b>enoximone</b> on exercise capacity. BACKGROUNDAt higher doses the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, <b>enoximone,</b> has been shown to increase exercise capacity and decrease symptoms in heart failure patients but also to increase mortality. The effects of lower doses of <b>enoximone</b> on exercise capacity and adverse events have not been evaluated. METHODSThis is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (nine U. S. centers) conducted in 105 patients with New York Heart Association class II to III, ischemic or nonischemic chronic heart failure (CHF). Patients were randomized to placebo or <b>enoximone</b> at 25 or 50 mg orally three times a day. Treadmill maximal exercise testing was done at baseline and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment, using a modified Naughton protocol. Patients were also evaluated for changes in quality of life and for increased arrhythmias by Holter monitoring. RESULTSBy the protocol-specified method of statistical analysis (the last observation carried-forward method), <b>enoximone</b> at 50 mg three times a day improved exercise capacity by 117 s at 12 weeks (p = 0. 003). <b>Enoximone</b> at 25 mg three times a day also improved exercise capacity at 12 weeks by 115 s (p = 0. 013). No increases in ventricular arrhythmias were noted. There were four deaths in the placebo group and 2 and 0 deaths in the <b>enoximone</b> 25 mg three times a day and <b>enoximone</b> 50 mg three times a day groups, respectively. Effects on degree of dyspnea and patient and physician assessments of clinical status favored the <b>enoximone</b> groups.

40|$|<b>Enoximone</b> {{is a new}} inotropic agent, {{which acts}} by the {{inhibition}} of the type III phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme. The present report describes a 81 -year-old female patient with severe heart failure following aortic valve replacement. Her cardiac activity was paced. The addition of <b>enoximone</b> (two doses of 0. 5 mg/kg) to an intravenous infusion of dobutamine (8 mcg/kg/min) and sodium nitroprusside significantly increased cardiac output (CO) from 3. 2 to 3. 9 l/min and decreased pulmonary artery occlusive pressure (PAOP) from 22 to 16 mmHg. Another dose of <b>enoximone</b> 12 h later had similar effects. However, another 12 h later, after dobutamine had been discontinued, two successive injections of 0. 5 mg/kg of <b>enoximone</b> were totally ineffective (CO from 2. 6 to 2. 5 l/min, PAOP 23 mmHg). When the dobutamine infusion was restarted (at 8 mcg/kg/min), {{the positive effects of}} 0. 5 mg/kg of <b>enoximone</b> were again present (CO from 3. 0 to 3. 6 l/min, PAOP from 19 to 14 mmHg).

Eighty patients selected by chance were allocated ran-domly to two groups: 40 patients received en-oximone 1. 0 mg kg~ ' approximately 10 min before weaning from CPB and 40 served as a control group. Additional pharmacological therapy (adren-aline, noradrena/ine, nitroglycerin) was given, when necessary, by anaesthetists who were not involved in the study. In addition to standard monitoring, skin capillary blood flow was assessed using a laser Dopp/er technique before, during and after CPB until 2 h {{after the end of the}} operation. In the period after bypass, cardiac index was always significantly greater in the <b>enoximone</b> than in the control group. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance were less in the enoximone-treated patients, indicating a reduction in right and left ventricular wall stress. Oxygen consumption in the <b>enoximone</b> patients was significantly greater after CPB, whereas intra-pulmonary shunting was comparable in the two groups. In comparison with baseline values, skin capillary blood flow in the <b>enoximone</b> patients was always greater than that in the control group. In comparison with the control patients, significantly fewer <b>enoximone</b> patients needed adrenaline, and in a smaller dose, even 2 h after operation, whereas more <b>enoximone</b> patients required noradrenaline therapy for a short period. We conclude that the use of <b>enoximone</b> before weaning from CPB improved overall cardiac function, reduced the need of catecholaminergic inotropic support, and provided increased organ perfusion up to 2 h after operation...|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>enoximone,</b> a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, to adrenergic agents {{has been found}} useful in increasing cardiac output in severe heart failure. In one study of 13 patients in cardiogenic shock already receiving adrenergic support, <b>enoximone</b> was adminstered as a bolus of 0. 5 mg/kg over 20 minutes. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure decreased significantly from 21. 7 ± 5. 8 mm Hg to 19. 8 ± 6. 0 mm Hg (P < 0. 01) and cardiac index increased markedly. A second study investigated {{the effects of the}} {{addition of}} small boluses of <b>enoximone</b> to adrenergic agents in low flow states associated with heart failure (n = 8) or postoperative states after cardiac surgery (n = 10). Each of the 18 patients was treated with dobutamine; 12 patients were also treated with dopamine and 4 with noradrenaline. <b>Enoximone</b> was administered as small but increasing intravenous boluses. No significant change in mean arterial pressure was observed, but on 0. 5 mg/kg of <b>enoximone</b> pulmonary artery occlusion pressure decreased significantly from 24. 6 ± 8. 7 mm Hg to 19. 4 ± 9. 9 mm Hg (heart failure) and from 18. 2 ± 3. 3 mm Hg to 15. 3 ± 3. 8 mm Hg (cardiac surgery) after the initial dose of 0. 125 mg/kg. Cardiac index increased markedly after <b>enoximone,</b> 0. 25 mg/kg. These changes were significant after the initial dose of 0. 125 mg/kg. Thus, the addition of even small doses of <b>enoximone</b> to adrenergic agents can markedly increase cardiac index without significant effect on arterial pressure in medical or surgical cardiac patients.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an extensive contractile reserve identified recognised by means of dobutamine stress echocardiography may predict a better prognosis in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction at rest. However, the clinical use of dobutamine stress echocardiography may be limited in patients with chronic heart failure by the substantial proportion of such patients treated with beta-blockers, since the inotropic response to adrenergic stimulation is known to be attenuated in patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor blockers. <b>Enoximone</b> is a positive inotropic agent that inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphosdiesterase. We therefore tested the hypothesis that <b>enoximone</b> may be an alternative to dobutamine in evaluating left ventricular contractile reserve in patients with systolic dysfunction on chronic beta-blocker therapy. Methods We studied 26 patients (21 males and five females) {{with a mean age of}} 58 ± 10 years: 11 were not receiving beta-blockers (noBB group); 15 were receiving carvedilol at a mean dose of 34 mg/day (BB group). Dobutamine was infused at doses of 5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, and <b>enoximone</b> at a dose of 1. 5 mg/kg. Results The ejection fraction in the noBB group increased by 9 % with dobutamine and 8. 73 % with <b>enoximone</b> (p = 0. 86); in the BB group, it increased by 6 % with dobutamine and 8. 94 % with <b>enoximone</b> (p = 0. 03). Regional peak systolic velocities were evaluated by means of tissue Doppler imaging in four basal and four medium level segments. In the noBB group, they increased more with dobutamine than with <b>enoximone</b> in three of the eight segments; no significant differences were found in the BB group. Dobutamine induced non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in three patients and supraventricular tachycardia in one, whereas <b>enoximone</b> did not induce any repetitive arrhythmias. Conclusions <b>Enoximone</b> might be preferable to low-dose dobutamine for evaluating left ventricular contractile reserve in chronically beta-blocked heart failure patients as it is slightly more potent and has a better safety profile. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pediatric {{cardiopulmonary}} arrest is {{rare and}} poses an extreme situation. Nevertheless, well-founded decisions are required. The guideline of the ERC shows an algorithm explaining necessary measures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children. Standardly, adrenaline is given. Amiodarone remains reserved when having a shockable rhythm. In contrast, sodium bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium are only indicated in definite situations. Sometimes, additional medications are applied as an expanded access following an unsuccessful resuscitation. One of these medications is <b>enoximone.</b> Objective: Aiming {{the evaluation of}} measures considering the application of <b>enoximone</b> during CPR, their success and effects together with additional parameters should be investigated with regard to “return of a spontaneous circulation” (ROSC) and “neurocognitive outcome” - using the “Glasgow Outcome Scale” (GOS). Methods: All patients with a CPR during the time period 2000 to 2010 at {{the intensive care unit}} of the children’s hospital Charité - Campus Virchow Klinikum or an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an immediate admission were included. Matching patients were recruited retrospectively by use of the logbook of the intensive care unit and SAP system. Results: Altogether, 145 patients were included. 31. 7 % of the patients had a beginning CPR outside of the hospital. Most of the patients had a respiratory induced arrest. 80 % of all patients had preexisting illnesses. 83. 4 % of all patients achieved a ROSC. Patients with ROSC were resuscitated more often inside the hospital and had a shorter duration of CPR. After every measure - according to the algorithm - increasingly more patients reached a ROSC. At the end of the algorithm the rate of ROSC accounted 71. 7 %. After the additional application of <b>enoximone</b> 83. 4 % ROSC was realized. Altogether, 26. 8 % of the patients achieved a GOS 4 / 5. Patients with a GOS 4 / 5 had a shorter duration of resuscitation than patients with a GOS 1 - 3. 15. 2 % of the patients with a GOS 4 / 5 received <b>enoximone.</b> Every surviving patient who got <b>enoximone</b> had a GOS 4 / 5. Conclusion: The rate of achieved ROSC without <b>enoximone</b> matched to previous findings having a similar compound of patients. After the application of <b>enoximone</b> more than additional 10 % reached a ROSC. Each surviving patient with <b>enoximone</b> achieved a GOS 4 / 5.

40|$|Background: Perioperative {{administration}} of <b>enoximone</b> {{has been shown}} to improve hemodynamics, organ function, and inflammatory response. Aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of <b>enoximone</b> on postoperative renal function after on-pump cardiac surgery. Methods: A total of 3727 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at one Institution between May 2004 and November 2010 were reviewed. A propensity score was built and a 1 : 1 perfect matching was performed, providing two fairly comparable cohorts of 712 patients each, receiving or not <b>enoximone</b> after surgery. Renal function was evaluated by lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) value reached postoperatively. Results: Overall 30 -day mortality rate was 4. 3 % (62 / 1424). Cumulative incidence of postoperative renal failure (RF) was 157 / 1424 (11 %), of which 99 / 1424 (7 %) needed renal replacement therapy. Mean lower postoperative GFR in patients who received or not <b>enoximone</b> was 63 +/- 30. 1 and 53. 5 +/- 26. 1 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) (p< 0. 0001), respectively. At multivariable analysis age (OR 2. 75, p= 0. 0004), diabetes (OR 1. 82, p= 0. 006), preoperative GFR (OR 3. 81, p< 0. 0001), preoperative cardiogenic shock (OR 1. 65, p= 0. 004), previous cardiac surgery (OR 2. 12, p= 0. 0002), type of intervention (OR 1. 96, p= 0. 005), and <b>enoximone</b> (OR 0. 38, p= 0. 001) were found to be independently associated with postoperative RF.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{compared}} the hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and <b>enoximone</b> administration {{before and after}} long-term beta-blocker therapy with metoprolol or carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). BackgroundPatients with HF on beta-blocker therapy may need hemodynamic support with inotropic agents, and the hemodynamic response {{may be influenced by}} both the inotropic agent and the beta-blocker used. MethodsThe hemodynamic effects of dobutamine (5 to 20 μg/kg/min intravenously) and <b>enoximone</b> (0. 5 to 2 mg/kg intravenously) were assessed by pulmonary artery catheterization in 29 patients with chronic HF before and after 9 to 12 months of treatment with metoprolol or carvedilol at standard target maintenance oral doses. Hemodynamic studies were performed after ≥ 12 h of wash-out from all cardiovascular medications, except the beta-blockers that were administered 3 h before the second study. ResultsCompared with before beta-blocker therapy, metoprolol treatment decreased the magnitude of mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) decline during dobutamine infusion and increased the cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI) response to <b>enoximone</b> administration, without any effect on other hemodynamic parameters. Carvedilol treatment abolished the increase in heart rate, SVI, and CI and caused a rise, rather than a decline, in PAP, PWP, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance during dobutamine infusion. The hemodynamic response to <b>enoximone,</b> however, was maintained or enhanced in the presence of carvedilol. ConclusionsIn contrast with its effects on <b>enoximone,</b> carvedilol and, to a lesser extent, metoprolol treatment may significantly inhibit the favorable hemodynamic response to dobutamine.

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} end-systolic pressure-volume {{analysis was}} employed to assess the inotropic effect of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor <b>enoximone</b> (formerly MDL- 17, 043) in nine patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, mean ejection fraction = 0. 22). Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were constructed using high fidelity left ventricular pressure measured with micromanometer-tipped catheters and simultaneous left ventricular volume obtained by gated blood pool imaging. Afterload was reduced with the vasodilator nitroprusside to generate the baseline left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation, a relatively load-independent measure of contractile function. The intravenous administration of <b>enoximone</b> (mean dose 75 mg) shifted the end-systolic pressure-volume point upward and leftward from the baseline pressure-volume relation in eight of the nine patients, demonstrating a positive inotropic effect of this agent. The maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development (peak positive dP/dt) increased from 1, 030 ± 142 to 1, 381 ± 219 mm Hg/s (p < 0. 01) on <b>enoximone</b> despite {{a significant decrease in}} preload (as assessed by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume) and a small, insignificant decrease in mean arterial pressure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Left {{ventricular}} (LV) hypertrophy {{is associated}} with increased diastolic chamber stiffness early after aortic valve replacement for valve stenosis. <b>Enoximone,</b> a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, {{has been shown to}} improve myocardial contractility and relaxation when administered as a single dose after cardiac surgery. The present study investigated, by analysis of transmitral flow velocity patterns and end-diastolic pressure-area relations, whether <b>enoximone</b> administered before aortic valve surgery has an effect on LV diastolic properties. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: Referral center for cardiothoracic surgery at a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the <b>enoximone</b> group (n = 17) received a bolus dose of 0. 35 mg/kg (0. 15 mg/kg before aortic cross-clamping and 0. 2 mg/kg added to the cardioplegic solution). Individual pressure-area relations (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure v left ventricular end-diastolic area) were obtained by using volume loading by leg elevation before and after surgery with closed chest. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pressure-area relation on the pressure-area plot was shifted to the left after surgery, indicating decreased LV diastolic distensibility in the <b>enoximone</b> and control groups and providing evidence of decreased LV diastolic function. Indices of LV diastolic chamber stiffness, LV operating stiffness (K(LV)) derived from the deceleration time of early ventricular filling, and the constant of chamber stiffness (beta) derived from pressure-area relations were not different after <b>enoximone</b> treatment. Systolic LV function was unaltered after cardiac surgery in both groups. Analysis of changes in transmitral flow patterns identified an increased atrial filling fraction in enoximone-treated patients, suggesting increased atrial systolic function. The unaltered systolic pulmonary venous flow velocity compared with the decrease in the control group after volume loading further supports preservation of left atrial reservoir function with <b>enoximone</b> in the absence of evidence for decreased LV stiffness. CONCLUSION: Preemptive <b>enoximone</b> did not change LV diastolic function based on diastolic filling patterns or LV stiffness indices (K(LV) and beta) derived from Doppler early filling deceleration time and pressure-area relations.

40|$|Inotropic {{support for}} the failing {{myocardium}} as the therapy for xi congestive heart failure (CHF) is intended to achieve an increase in cardiac output via positive responses in myocardial contractility and vasodilation. A novel approach to differentiate these two responses {{is the use of}} an animal with an implanted total artificial heart (TAH). Three inotropic drugs, dobutamine, <b>enoximone,</b> and pimobendan, were tested in eight animals with their natural heart intact and five animals implanted with a TAH. Baseline values of the TAH and natural heart (NH) were compared to determine their hemodynamic similarities. Each of the three drugs was given randomly to the animals in dosages similar to human clinical doses. Peak responses were recorded and analyzed. All three drugs caused an increase in contractility and cardiac output in the NH animals. Dobutamine and pimobendan also caused a significant increase in heart rate at higher dosages whereas <b>enoximone</b> did not. Dobutamine caused an increase in left ventricle work, as did pimobendan at the first dose given; at higher doses of pimobendan, the left ventricular work returned to baseline. However, at the doses tested, the left ventricular stroke work during <b>enoximone</b> administration decreased. Vasodilation (the only drug stimulation response in the TAH model) was also observed with the administration of the drugs in T AH animals, and all three caused decreases in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Dobutamine and pimobendan caused an increase in left and right atrial pressures (because of the mechanical heart not being adjusted to compensate the increased return). There was also a reduction in systemic and pulmonary resistance. <b>Enoximone</b> caused severe pulmonary hypertension in the TAH animals, possibly due to stimulus of platelets to release vasoconstrictive substances. Thus, dobutamine, <b>enoximone,</b> and pimobendan significantly contribute to increases in output by vasodilation in animals with a natural heart.

We enrolled 22 patients with previous Q-wave myocardial infarction and regional wall motion abnormalities related to left anterior descending arterial disease, left ventricular election fraction < 40 %, and all scheduled for myocardial revascularization.

After revascularization, recovery of function was observed in 31 of 112 severely hypokinetic, 49 of 117 akinetic, and 21 of 38 dyskinetic segments. Overall, there was a significant correlation between absolute score changes of segments which were abnormal at baseline (n = 267) to <b>enoximone</b> peak effects (r = 0. 49, p < 0. 001) to predict absolute changes after revascularization; after dobutamine there was progress toward identify (r = 0. 62, p < 0. 001) and the difference wets significant among correlation slopes of dobutamine alone, <b>enoximone</b> alone, and <b>enoximone</b> plus very low dose dobutamine echocardiography (0. 45 +/- 0. 04, 0. 51 +/- 0. 04, and 0. 63 +/- 0. 04, respectively, F = 5. 25, p = 0. 005).

Objective: To examine whether <b>enoximone</b> improves cardiovascular function and reduces dobutamine requirement in anaesthetised colic horses. Methods: Forty-eight mature colic horses were enrolled in this prospective, randomised clinical trial. After sedation (xylazine 0. 7 mg/kg bwt) and induction (midazolam 0. 06 mg/kg bwt, ketamine 2. 2 mg/kg bwt), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen and a lidocaine constant rate infusion (1. 5 mg/kg bwt, 2 mg/kg/h). Horses were ventilated (PaCO 2 < 8. 00 kPa). If hypotension occurred, dobutamine and/or colloids were administered. Ten minutes after skin incision, horses randomly received an i. v. bolus of <b>enoximone</b> (0. 5 mg/kg bwt) or saline. Monitoring included respiratory and arterial blood gases, heart rate (HR), arterial pressure and cardiac index (CI). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR), stroke index (SI) and oxygen delivery index (DO 2 I) were calculated. For each variable, changes between baseline and T 10 within each treatment group and/or colic type (small intestines, large intestines or mixed) were analysed and compared between treatments in a fixed effects model. Differences between treatments until T 30 were investigated using a mixed model (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Ten minutes after <b>enoximone</b> treatment, CI (P = 0. 0010), HR (P = 0. 0033) and DO 2 I (P = 0. 0007) were higher and SVR lower (P = 0. 0043) than at baseline. The changes in CI, HR and SVR were significantly different from those after saline treatment. During the first 30 min after <b>enoximone</b> treatment, DO 2 I (P = 0. 0224) and HR (P = 0. 0003) were higher than after saline administration. Because the difference in HR between treatments was much clearer in large intestine colic cases, an interaction was detected between treatment and colic type in both analyses (P = 0. 0076 and 0. 0038, respectively).

40|$|Objective: <b>Enoximone</b> is a {{phosphodiesterase}} III inhibitor {{frequently used}} to improve cardiac output (CC) in man. As the use of <b>enoximone</b> has not been reported in horses, {{the effects of this}} inodilator were examined in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies. Study design: Prospective, randomised, experimental study. Animals: Six healthy ponies, weighing 286 (212367) 52 kg, aged 5. 0 +/- 1. 6 years (4 - 6. 5). Methods: After sedation with romifidine [80 mu g kg(- 1) intravenously (IV) ], general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0. 06 mg kg(- 1) IV) and ketamine (2. 2 mg kg(- 1) IV) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen (Et Iso 1. 7 %). The ponies were ventilated to maintain eucapnia (PaCO 2 4. 66 - 6. 00 kPa). Each pony was anaesthetized twice with an interval of 3 weeks; receiving <b>enoximone</b> 0. 5 mg kg(- 1) IV (E) or saline (S) 90 minutes postinduction. Heart rate (HR), arterial (AP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were measured before treatment, every 5 minutes between TO (treatment) and T 30 and then every 10 minutes until T 120. Cardiac output measurements (lithium dilution technique) and blood gas analysis (arterial and central venous samples) were performed before T 0 and at T 5, T 10, T 20, T 40, T 60, T 80, T 100 and T 120. Stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), venous admixture (Qs/Qt) and oxygen delivery DO 2 were calculated. Results: <b>Enoximone</b> induced significant increases in FIR, CO, SV, Qs/Qt and DO 2 and a significant decrease in RAP. No significant differences were detected for AP, SVR and blood gases.

Left ventricular stroke work did not change, 16 ± 1 to 17 ± 3 g/m (P is not significant). Mean arterial pressure decreased to below 60 mm Hg in five patients at various times up to 30 minutes after the last IV <b>enoximone</b> bolus, and this hypotension had to be treated with dopamine alone (n = 3), in combination with 600 mL IV colloids (n = 1), or with norepinephrine alone (n = 1).

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Studies of Oral <b>Enoximone</b> Therapy in Advanced HF (ESSENTIAL) programme consisted of two identical, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that differed only by geographic location (North and South America: ESSENTIAL-I; Europe: ESSENTIAL-II). Patients with New York Heart Association class III-IV HF symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 30 %, and one hospitalization or two ambulatory visits for worsening HF {{in the previous year}} were eligible for participation in the trials. The trials had three co-primary endpoints: (i) the composite of time to all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, analysed in the two ESSENTIAL trials combined; (ii) the 6 month change from baseline in the 6 min walk test distance (6 MWTD); and (iii) the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) at 6 months, both analysed in each trial separately. ESSENTIAL-I and -II randomized 1854 subjects at 211 sites in 16 countries. In the combined trials, all-cause mortality and the composite, first co-primary endpoint did not differ between the two treatment groups [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 97; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 80 - 1. 17; and HR 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 86 - 1. 12, respectively, for <b>enoximone</b> vs. placebo].

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} assess the effects of {{combined}} oral positive inotropic and beta-blocker therapy in patients with severe heart failure. Background. Patients with severe, class IV heart failure who receive standard medical therapy exhibit a 1 -year mortality rate > 50 %. Moreover, such patients generally do not tolerate beta-blockade, a promising new therapy for chronic heart failure. Positive inotropes, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, are associated with increased mortality when administered {{over the long term}} in these patients. The addition of a beta-blocker to positive inotropic therapy might attenuate this adverse effect, although long-term oral inotropic therapy might serve as a bridge to beta-blockade. Methods. Thirty patients with severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 17. 2 ± 1. 2 %, cardiac index 1. 6 ± 0. 1 liter/min per m 2) were treated with the combination of oral <b>enoximone</b> (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and oral metoprolol at two institutions. <b>Enoximone</b> was given at a dose of ≤ 1 mg/kg body weight three times a day. After clinical stabilization, metoprolol was initiated at 6. 25 mg twice a day and slowly titrated up to a target dose of 100 to 200 mg/day. Results. Ninety-six percent of the patients tolerated <b>enoximone,</b> whereas 80 % tolerated the addition of metoprolol. The mean duration of combination therapy was 9. 4 ± 1. 8 months. The mean length of follow-up was 20. 9 ± 3. 9 months. Of the 23 patients receiving the combination therapy, 48 % were weaned off <b>enoximone</b> over the long term. The LVEF increased significantly, from 17. 7 ± 1. 6 % to 27. 6 ± 3. 4 % (p = 0. 01), whereas the New York Heart Association functional class improved from 4 ± 0 to 2. 8 ± 0. 1 (p = 0. 0001). The number of hospital admissions tended to decrease during therapy (p = 0. 06). The estimated probability of survival at 1 year was 81 ± 9 %. Heart transplantation was performed successfully in nine patients (30 %). Conclusions. Combination therapy with a positive inotrope and a beta-blocker appears to be useful in the treatment of severe, class IV heart failure.

In 17 patients, age range 56 - 76 years (two females, 15 male), undergoing routine coronary surgery, informed consent was obtained for implantation of a needle transducer for measurement of wall force. At the end of coronary surgery, developed myocardial force and aorto-coronary bypass flow were measured electromagnetically. After control measurements, 0. 03, 0. 06 and 0. 1 mg/kg <b>enoximone</b> were injected slowly (3 min per dose) into the aorto-coronary bypass. Eight to 18 h after surgery, and again 18 - 48 h after surgery, the following measurements were made, first as a control, and then after 1. 5 mg/kg <b>enoximone</b> i. v. : aortic pressure (AoP), central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), cardiac output (CO), and heart rate (HR).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether clonidine, <b>enoximone,</b> and enalaprilat reduce ischaemia-related myocardial cell damage in cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Clinical investigation in a cardiac anaesthesia department {{of a university}} hospital. PATIENTS: 88 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. INTERVENTIONS: After induction of anaesthesia patients continuously received the alpha 2 agonist clonidine (group 1, n = 22), the phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitor <b>enoximone</b> (group 2, n = 22), the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat (group 3, n = 22), or saline solution as placebo (control group, n = 22). The infusion was stopped immediately {{before the start of}} cardiopulmonary bypass. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ST segment was analysed and the activity of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CKMB), cardiac troponin T (TnT), and the BB isoenzyme of glycogen phosphorylase (GPBB) were measured before the start of infusion (baseline), after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), at the end of surgery, 5 h after CPB, and {{on the morning of the}} first and third postoperative days. RESULTS: Biometric data and time of cross-clamping were not significantly different in the four groups. Changes in the ST segment indicating ischaemia were least common in the enalaprilat group (P < 0. 05). Postoperatively, CKMB activity was significantly higher in the clonidine and the control groups. Both new markers of myocardial cell damage increased more after CPB and postoperatively in the control patients (TnT peak: (mean (SD)) 3. 99 (0. 35) microgram/ 1; GPBB peak: 82 (15) ng/ml) and the clonidine-treated group (TnT peak: 3. 80 (0. 3) microgram/ 1; GPBB peak: 85 (14) ng/ml). Enalaprilat-treated patients showed the smallest overall changes in standard (CKMB) and new serological markers of myocardial ischaemia (TnT peak: 0. 71 (0. 1) microgram/ 1; GPBB peak: 44 (14) ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with enalaprilat before CPB, both new, more sensitive markers of ischaemic myocardial tissue damage increased significantly less than in an untreated control group. Those treated with <b>enoximone</b> also had lower plasma concentration of TnT and GPBB than the control group, whereas clonidine did not reduce the concentration of these markers of myocardial ischaemia.
