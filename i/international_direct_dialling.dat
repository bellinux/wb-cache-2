50|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> in the 1970s, Gibraltar was allocated its own IDD code, +350, by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which was accessible from any telephone network outside Spain. However, although physical connectivity existed between Gibraltar and Spain, the Spanish government prohibited its national operators from recognising this code.|$|E
50|$|Having {{completed}} the switchover to numbers rather than letters, the six British cities on the Director system were first {{given access to}} transatlantic dialling in 1971 which enabled callers from Manchester to ring directly to any US mainline number by prefixing the call with ‘0101’. <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> (IDD) was not made available nationwide until 1982.|$|E
50|$|International {{direct dialing}} (IDD) or {{international}} subscriber dialling (ISD) is placing an international telephone call that is dialed directly by a telephone subscriber, rather than by an telephone operator. The term {{international subscriber dialling}} {{was used in the}} United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to <b>international</b> <b>direct</b> <b>dialling.</b> Since the late 20th century, most international calls are dialed directly.|$|E

5000|$|... ln 1975, the International Telex Exchange was opened, {{allowing}} {{businesses to}} send telexes. Four years later, <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> (IDD) services were introduced {{and the first}} electronic exchange was commissioned in Johor Bahru. The volume of new development was such that, in the early 1980s, the Department was compelled to appoint contractors to help build new lines and extend the cable network.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of names}} was {{intended}} to provide a mnemonic for the exchange {{in the same way}} as for the Director system, but as more and more places were given STD codes the mnemonic link became more and more obscure, and this system became unworkable. Also, <b>international</b> <b>direct</b> <b>dialling</b> was being introduced and as other countries (such as the USA) had different assignments of letters to digits the opportunity for confusion existed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> from London to Paris {{was first}} offered in March 1963, with Amsterdam {{following}} {{by the end}} of 1963. Simultaneously, operator-dialed transatlantic calling began March 30, 1963 with the originating international operator in Western Europe or the USA able to complete calls to the terminal station without further operator assistance via the gateway exchanges at White Plains, NY and London. [...] Operator-dialed transpacific calling to Hawaii, Japan, and Australia began with the completion of the COMPAC cable, also in 1963.|$|E

50|$|However, Gibraltar {{remained}} {{subject to}} restrictions after that date, which affected the expansion and modernisation of Gibraltar's telecommunications infrastructure. These included a refusal to recognise Gibraltar's <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> (IDD) code (+350) which restricted the expansion of Gibraltar's telephone numbering plan, and the prevention of roaming arrangements for Gibraltar GSM mobile phones in Spain and vice versa. Following {{the signing of the}} Córdoba Accord between the Governments of Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Spain in September 2006, these restrictions were removed with effect from 10 February 2007.|$|E
50|$|International {{telephone}} calls are those made between different countries. These {{telephone calls}} are processed by international gateway exchanges (switches). Charges for these calls were high initially but declined greatly during the 20th century due to {{advances in technology}} and liberalization. Originally they were placed via long-distance operators. The calls were transmitted by cable, communications satellite, radio, and more recently, fiber optics and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> {{was introduced in the}} 1970s, so calls can be dialed by country code without an operator.|$|E
50|$|Until 10 February 2007, Spain {{continued}} to impose restrictions on Gibraltar's ability {{to expand and}} modernise its telecommunications infrastructure. These included a refusal to recognise Gibraltar's <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> (IDD) code (+350) which restricted {{the expansion of the}} Gibraltar telephone numbering plan, and the prevention of roaming arrangements for Gibraltar GSM mobile phones in Spain and vice versa.

50|$|In July 2012, {{there were}} about 7,500 main line telephones, which covers about 98% of the country's population, while there were {{approximately}} 7,800 mobile phones in 2009. Telecom Cook Islands, owned by Spark New Zealand, is the islands' main telephone system and offers <b>international</b> <b>direct</b> <b>dialling,</b> Internet, email, fax, and Telex. The individual islands are connected {{by a combination of}} satellite earth stations, microwave systems, and very high frequency and high frequency radiotelephone; within the islands, service is provided by small exchanges connected to subscribers by open wire, cable, and fibre optic cable. For international communication, they rely on the satellite earth station Intelsat.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s {{the number of}} {{possible}} exchange names were running out in London and the potential expansion of <b>international</b> <b>direct</b> <b>dialling</b> (where different letters were assigned to alternate numbers than those on UK phones) called {{for the creation of}} an alternative, modern system of numbering. Called All-figure dialling, the first three letters of the exchange name (e.g. CENtral) were to be permanently replaced by digits (in this example: 236). The first six places to introduce the system were the Director cities including Manchester - the process began in 1966. London was allocated the simplest primary code of ‘01’. Manchester was then given a new dialling code of ‘061’, the number 6 corresponded with the letter ‘M’ on the dial (The 2 of Birmingham’s 021 corresponded with B, Edinburgh’s 031 with E, Glasgow’s 041 the G and Liverpool's L with the 5 giving 051).|$|E
5000|$|Until the Transit System was {{introduced}} in 1971, directly dialled call routings could only involve one intermediate GSC due to transmission requirements, all other calls requiring an operator assisted routing. GSC's were initially based on the Strowger step-by-step system as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on Strowger systems. Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group Switching Centres which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of <b>International</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Dialling</b> (IDD), initially referred to as International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) within the UK, Group Switching Centres were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|E
