50|$|Many early rockets {{had burned}} kerosene, but as burn times, {{combustion}} efficiencies, and combustion-chamber pressures grew, and as <b>engine</b> <b>masses</b> shrank, the <b>engine</b> temperatures became unmanageable. Raw kerosene used as coolant would dissociate and polymerize.

The coolant starvation raised temperatures further, accelerating breakdown. This cycle would escalate rapidly (i.e., thermal runaway would occur) until an engine wall ruptured, occurring even with the entire flow of kerosene used as coolant.

The engine's size meant it had to be located lower in the chassis, which also had to be designed to its widest permitted dimensions in order to incorporate larger fuel tanks.

This technical improvement would be incorporated in the subsequent prototypes. The 287 was intended to be powered by four Heinkel-Hirth HeS 011 engines, but because of the development problems experienced with that engine, the BMW 003 was selected in its place. The second and third prototypes, V2 and V3, were to have employed six of these engines, in a triple cluster under each wing.
