6000|$|It wasn't {{either that}} John Bancroft tossed {{the ball of}} talk--which but for the {{presence}} of the supremely retentive agent just commemorated would have appeared on occasion to remain in his keeping by a preference, on its own part, not to be outwitted; this more or less at all times too, but especially during the first weeks of his dawning on us straight out of Germany and France, flushed with the alarm, as one might have read it, of having to justify rare opportunities and account for the time he had inordinately, obscurely, or at least not a little mysteriously, spent--the implication of every inch of him being that he had spent it seriously. Odd enough it certainly was that we should have been appointed to unveil, so far as we might, a pair of such marked monuments to modesty, marble statues, as they might have been, {{on either side of the}} portal of talk; what I at any rate preserve of my immediate vision of Bancroft--whose very promptest identity indeed had been <b>his</b> <b>sonship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eminent historian of our country and earlier and later diplomatist--was an opposition, trying to me rather than engaging as its like had been in the composition of Vanderpool, between what we somehow wanted from him (or what I at least did) and what we too scantly gathered. This excellent friend, as he was later on to become, with his handsome high head, large colourable brow and eyes widely divided--brave contribution ever to a fine countenance--sat there in a sort of glory of experience which, had he been capable of anything so akin to a demonstration, he would have appeared all unsociably to repudiate. It was bruited of him that, like John La Farge, whose friend he was admiringly to become--for he too had a Newport connection--he [...] "painted," [...] that is persisted (which was the wondrous thing!) in painting; and that this practice had grown upon him in France, where, en province, his brother had entirely taken root and where the whole art-life, as well as the rural life, of the country had been opened to him; besides its a little later coming to light that he had romantically practised at Dusseldorf, where too he had personally known and tremendously liked George du Maurier, whose first so distinguished appearances as an illustrator had already engaged our fondest attention--were they most dawningly in the early Cornhill, or in Punch, or in Once a Week? They glimmer upon me, darkly and richly, as from the pages of the last named. Not to be rendered, I may again parenthesise, our little thrilled awareness, William's and mine, though mine indeed but panting after his, of such peeping phenomena of the European day as the outbreak of a [...] "new man" [...] upon our yearning view of the field of letters and of the arts. I am moved to wonder at how we came by it, shifting all for ourselves, and with the parental flair, so far as the sensibility of home was concerned, turned but to directions of its own and much less restless on the whole than ours. More touching to me now than I can say, at all events, this recapture of the hour at which Du Maurier, consecrated to much later, to then still far-off intimate affection, became the new man so significantly as to make a great importance of John Bancroft's news of him, which already bore, among many marvels, upon the supreme wonder of his working, as he was all his life bravely to work, under impaired and gravely menaced eyesight. When I speak, as just above, of what, through so many veils, [...] "came to light," [...] I should further add, I use a figure representing a considerable lapse of time and shading off, for full evocation, into more associations than I can here make place for. Nothing in this connection came soon to light at least but that endless amazement might lie in the strange facts of difference between our companion and his distinguished sire--the latter so supremely, so quaintly yet so brilliantly, social a figure, I apprehended, when gaped at, a still more angular, but more polished and pacific Don Quixote, on the sleekest of Rosinantes, with white-tipped chin protrusive, with high sharp elbows raised and long straight legs beautifully pointed, all after the gallantest fashion, against the clear sunset sky of old Newport cavalcades. Mr. Bancroft the elder, the [...] "great," [...] was a comfort, that is a fine high identity, a cluster of strong accents, the sort of thing one's vision followed, in the light of history, if not of mere misguided fancy, for illustration of conceived type--type, say in this case, of superior person of the ancient and the more or less alien public order, the world of affairs transacted at courts and chancelleries, in which renown, one had gathered from the perusal of memoirs, allowed for much development of detail and much incision of outline, when not even directly resting on them. As it had been a positive bliss to me that words and names might prove in extremity sources of support, so it comes back to me that I had drawn mystic strength from just obscurely sighing [...] "Metternich!" [...] or [...] "Talleyrand!" [...] as Mr. Bancroft bounced by me--so far as a pair of widely-opened compasses might bounce--in the August gloaming. The value of which, for reflection, moreover, was not in the least in its being that if his son remained so long pleadingly inscrutable any derived Metternich suggestion had contributed to keep him so--for quite there was the curiosity of the case, that among the imputations John appeared most to repudiate was that of having at any moment breathed the air either of records or of protocols. If he persisted in painting for years after his return to America without, as the legend grew, the smallest disclosure of his work or confession of his progress to human eye or ear, he drew the rigour of this course wholly from his singleness of nature, in the aftertime to be so much approved to us. However, I pause before the aftertime, into the lap of which more than one sort of stored soundness and sweetness was to fall from him drop by drop.|$|E
50|$|As per the Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology {{with regards}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> views of Albert Schweitzer, Schweitzer {{did not believe}} that Paul {{represents}} an appropriation of Hellenistic or Greek ideas into Christianity. Pauline mysticism is not about “being one with God or being in God” (Schweitzer, 1930, 3) and <b>sonship</b> <b>to</b> God is not conceived as “an immediate mystical relation to God, but as mediated and effected by means of a mystical union with Christ”.|$|R
2500|$|Matthew {{has taken}} over his key Christological texts from Mark, but {{sometimes}} he has changed the stories he found in Mark, giving evidence of his own concerns.

2500|$|In {{the early}} Christian era, there was {{considerable}} disagreement amongst Christians regarding the nature of Christ's Incarnation. [...] While all Christians believed that Jesus was indeed the Son of God, {{the exact nature of}} <b>his</b> <b>Sonship</b> was contested, together with the precise relationship of the [...] "Father," [...] "Son" [...] and [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] referred <b>to</b> in <b>the</b> New Testament. [...] Though Jesus was clearly the [...] "Son," [...] what exactly did this mean? Debate on this subject raged most especially during the first four centuries of Christianity, involving Jewish Christians, Gnostics, followers of the Presbyter Arius of Alexandra, and adherents of St. Athanasius the Great, among others.|$|R
25|$|The divine {{nature of}} Jesus {{was a major}} issue for the Matthaean community, the crucial element marking them from their Jewish neighbors; while Mark begins with baptism and transfiguration, Matthew goes back further still, showing Jesus as the Son of God from his birth, the {{fulfillment}} of Old Testament messianic prophecies. The title Son of David identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel (it is used exclusively in relation to miracles), sent to Israel alone. As Son of Man he will return <b>to</b> judge <b>the</b> world, an expectation which his disciples recognise but of which his enemies are unaware. As Son of God he is God revealing himself through his son, and Jesus proving <b>his</b> <b>sonship</b> through <b>his</b> obedience and example.|$|R
2500|$|Next, Schweitzer {{poses the}} question: [...] "Of what precise kind {{then is the}} mysticism of Paul?" [...] He locates Paul between the two {{extremes}} of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of <b>sonship</b> <b>to</b> God as [...] "mediated and effected {{by means of the}} mystical union with Christ."

2500|$|The temptations Christ faced {{focused upon}} his person and {{identity}} as the incarnate Son of God. [...] MacLeod writes, [...] "Christ could be tempted through his sonship." [...] The temptation {{in the wilderness}} and again in Gethsemane exemplifies this arena of temptation. [...] Regarding the temptation of performing a sign that would affirm <b>his</b> <b>sonship</b> by throwing himself from the pinnacle of the temple, MacLeod observes, [...] "The sign was for himself: a temptation to seek reassurance, as if to say, ‘the real question is my own sonship. [...] I must forget all else and all others and all further service until that is clear.’" [...] MacLeod places this struggle {{in the context of}} the incarnation, [...] "...he has become a man and must accept not only the appearance but the reality." ...|$|R

50|$|Christologies {{from above}} {{start with the}} Logos, the second Person of the Trinity, {{establish}} his eternality, his agency in creation, and <b>his</b> economic <b>Sonship.</b> Jesus' unity with God is established by the Incarnation as the divine Logos assumes a human nature. This approach was common {{in the early church}} - e.g., St. Paul and St. John in the Gospels. The attribution of full humanity to Jesus is resolved by stating that the two natures mutually share their properties (a concept termed communicatio idiomatum).|$|R

40|$|The present work is an exegetical and {{theological}} {{study of the}} antitheses in Galatians 5. 2 - 6. Chapter 1 justifies the present work by pointing {{out the fact that}} both the six "antitheses" in 5. 2 - 6 and the passage itself have not been given sufficient recognition in the history of interpretation of Galatians. First, Paul contrasts circumcision and Christ in terms of "benefit" in 5. 2 - 3; the salvific benefit of Christ is contrasted with the uselessness of circumcision (ch. 2). The salvific benefit of Christ is Paul's ultimate theological basis for his opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agitators' theological rationale for circumcision, in particular the salvific efficacy and benefit of circumcision. Second, the law is contrasted to Christ in terms of the sphere of justification (5. 4 b vs. 5. 4 a), not as two antithetical means of justification (ch 3). With God’s eschatological transfer from <b>the</b> law <b>to</b> Christ as <b>the</b> sphere of justification Paul redefines the boundary of God's people and replaces it from <b>the</b> law <b>to</b> Christ. Third, Paul contrasts the law with grace as two mutually exclusive foundations of justification (5. 4 b vs. 5. 4 c - ch. 4). Paul rejects the law as the soteriological basis of justification because God's saving grace brought the salvific effects (e. g. righteousness, the Abrahamic blessing, <b>sonship,</b> election) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gentiles without Torah-observance. Fourth, Paul sets the law in antithesis with the Spirit as two antithetical bases of justification (5. 4 b vs. 5. 5 - ch. 5). For Paul the Spirit is the means of righteousness, the medium of the blessing of Abraham, and the agent and basis of sonship. Fifth, the law and Christ's faithfulness is contrasted as two antithetical means of justification (5. 4 b vs. 5. 5 - ch. 6). The πίστις references in 5. 5 and 5. 6 refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faithfulness of Christ, not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Christian's act of faith in Christ. Paul's antithesis between єργα νόμου and Xριοτού should be understood as shorthand for the incompatibility between ethnocentnc covenantalism and the gospel of Christ's faithfulness in terms of two mutually exclusive soteriological belief-systems. Sixth, Paul sets πєριτομτνάκροβνατία in antithesis with πίστις δι’ άγάπης ένεργουμένη (i. e. Christ's faithfulness working through his love) as two antithetical bases of justification (5. 6 - ch. 7). The antithesis between "circumcision vs. uncircumcision" and Christ's faithfulness working through his love should be interpreted as a microcosm of the two incompatible belief-systems between the agitators' ethnocentric covenantalism and Paul's gospel of the cross. Chapter 8 consists of the summary and implications for Pauline interpretation. The antitheses function as a summary of Paul's argument <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Galatians, <b>the</b> answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pivotal issues at stake in Galatians, the solution of the crisis in Galatia, the rationale for Paul’s opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agitators' gospel, and interpretive clues for understanding Paul’s theology in Galatians. In conclusion, Gal 5. 2 - 6, where the six antitheses appear, is the truth- claim of Paul's gospel, the summary and climax of Paul's argument <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Galatians, and a hermeneutical key to Paul's letter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Galatians...|$|R
40|$|Autor u članku razrađuje tematiku implicitne (neizravne) kristologije. Temeljeći svoj govor na evanđeoskim izvješćima, iznosi argumente u prilog tvrdnji da razna događanja vezana uz Isusa neizravno govore o njegovu božanskom identitetu i sinovstvu. Tako, analiziranjem Isusova propovijedanja i poučavanja, uspoređivanjem Isusa sa starozavjetnim prorocima, preko njegova ponašanja prema Zakonu, hramu i nekim grupama ljudi, odnosno prema »javnim grešnicima«, upućuje na neke događaje i na njegove izričaje koji implicitno govore o Isusovu božanstvu. Jednako tako, Isusov odnos prema Bogu, kojega on naziva Abba, te neki njegovi »ja« - izričaji također aludiraju na njegovo božansko sinovstvo. Uzimajući sve to u obzir, dolazi se do zaključka da - iako Kristov pashalni događaj, odnosno njegovo uskrsnuće jesu i ostaju glavni temelji vjere koji konačno otkrivaju osobu Isusa Krista - i predpashalna događanja imaju veliku važnost za kristološko razmišljanje, jer također otkrivaju - implicitno — i Isusov božanski identitet. The {{author of}} this article {{examines}} the theme of implicit (indirect) Christology. Basing his presentation on Gospel accounts, he delivers his arguments in favour of the various events associated with the Jesus of Nazareth which indirectly speak of his divine identity and <b>sonship.</b> <b>To</b> begin with, <b>the</b> article examines the most common aspect of the preresurrected Christ; his preaching and teaching. Even though it seemed to many that Jesus was one of many iterant preachers and teachers, or that he was just another prophet, the content, method and originality of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 words and expressions indirectly lead to a conclusion of his divinity. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 behaviour towards Jewish Law, the temple and certain segments of the population, in others words, the »public sinners«, also implicitly awakens faith of him as the Son of God. Namely, with many of his expressions and gestures Jesus gives the impression that he is »above« the Law and temple, or that he brings and declares a new law with which he desires to lead all people to God. Equally so, his behaviour towards people, especially towards the weak and <b>the</b> sinful <b>to</b> whom he forgives sin, indirectly supports that he is God, in other words, the Son of God who has »authority tο forgive sins» (Mk 2 : 10). Therefore, Jesus 2 ̆ 7 behaviour towards fundamental Jewish institutions and his call for conversion and his forgiveness of sins prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paschal event represents a solid Christological foundation on which faith in Jesus Christ is built. The same applies of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 relationship towards God, whom he calls Abba, in a way that no one of the Jewish faithful would have called him. That expression, which translated means Dad, reveals an original and intimate (»family«) relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. It reveals Jesus 2 ̆ 7 divine <b>sonship</b> and <b>his</b> consciousness of that sonship. Also included are some of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 »I« sayings (»I tell you«, »I command you«, »I am [...] . «) which indirectly leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that divine authority is expressed by the one who uses it. In other words, it recalls the revelation of the names of Yahweh from the Old Testament (cf. Ex 3 : 14; Jn 8 : 12, 57 - 58). The conclusion is that even though Christ 2 ̆ 7 s Paschal event and his Resurrection are and remain the principle foundations of faith, which eventually reveal the person of Jesus Christ, the pre-Paschal events have a great importance for Christological reflection, for they also implicitly reveal Jesus 2 ̆ 7 divine identity...|$|R
40|$|This study interprets and appraises Pannenberg’s intertrinitarian {{concept of}} reconciliation, {{as it relates}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lordship of God over the world. It is argued that within the {{framework}} of the reciprocal self-differentiation of Father, Son, and Spirit as <b>the</b> interpretative key <b>to</b> his doctrine of reconciliation, Jesus’ death is the Son’s reconciling action as a prolepsis of the coming Lordship of God. After an introduction presenting the purpose and method of study, chapter one explores the formation of his christology as a background for the subsequent inquiries. The historical and theological contexts of his christology, its significance in the history of the doctrine, and the influence of Barth and other theological and philosophical influences on its shape are concentrated. Chapters two and three establish the intertrinitarian character of Jesus’ divine <b>sonship</b> in relation <b>to</b> God’s Lordship. Jesus, by his subordination <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Father and his Lordship on the cross, anticipates the future realisation of the deity and Lordship of God, and thus is the Son. Chapter two examines the historical method, the concept of Jesus’ personal unity with God, and Jesus’ self-differentiation from the Father as the inner basis of <b>his</b> divine <b>sonship.</b> Chapter three analyses the eternal and universal sonship of Jesus, and the historical confirmation of Jesus’ divine <b>sonship</b> by <b>his</b> earthly claim to authority and his resurrection. Chapter four defines the concept of reconciliation as the action of <b>the</b> triune God <b>to</b> achieve his Lordship in universal history. After a clarification of the doctrine of reconciliation in its relationship to soteriology and christology, the intertrinitarian character of reconciliation is examined in terms of the intertrinitarian activity bringing about God’s Lordship in Universalgeschichte. Chapter five focuses on the Son’s reconciling office. The cross is argued as the active performing by the Son of his reconciling office...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the lost}} {{ending of the}} Poema de Fernán González and the {{question}} of its content, this paper argues that an ideology of judgement and salvation is evoked in the introductory stanzas of the poem which inheres {{in the body of the}} work, and may have reached completion in the lost conclusion. Attention is paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early description of the conversion of the poet's Spanish ancestors from estrangement from Christ to an acceptance of his law. The legalistic theme which underpins this narrative invites the theme of judgement into the heart of the poem, where it parallels the theological process of justification. The description of ancestral conversion also outlines stages of salvation, thus asserting the meaningful, teleological role of time in the poem and situating the career of the hero within an eschatological framework which attaches special importance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attainment of moral, not just material, worth. I argue that in conflating legal and temporal discourses the poem represents the hero within a model of divine <b>sonship,</b> according <b>to</b> which he would have represented, conclusively, the culmination of the lost moral and territorial worth of the Visigoths, but also the prospect of <b>the</b> eternal heritage <b>to</b> come. <b>The</b> full-text of this article is not currently available in ORA, but you may be able <b>to</b> access <b>the</b> article via the publisher copy link on this record page.

50|$|In {{the version}} of the myth told by Ovid in the Metamorphoses, Phaethon ascends into heaven, {{the home of his}} {{suspected}} father. His mother Clymene had boasted that his father was the Sun-God or Phoebus. Phaethon went to his father who swore by <b>the</b> river Styx <b>to</b> give Phaethon anything he would ask for in order <b>to</b> prove <b>his</b> divine <b>sonship.</b> Phaethon wanted <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> chariot of the sun for a day. Phoebus tried {{to talk him out of}} it by telling him that not even Jupiter (the king of the gods) would dare to drive it, as the chariot was fiery hot and the horses breathed out flames. He said:"The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb. In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me, and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear. The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control. Then even Tethys herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong. Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits. I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation. Suppose you are given the chariot. What will you do? Will you be able <b>to</b> counter <b>the</b> turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts. The way runs through ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and the Lion's jaw, Scorpio's cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side, and Cancer's crab-claws reaching out from the other. You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests. They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their necks resist the reins. Beware my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!"Phaethon was adamant. When the day came, the fierce horses that drew the chariot felt that it was empty because of the lack of the sun-god's weight and went out of control. Terrified, Phaethon dropped the reins. The horses veered from their course, scorching the earth, burning the vegetation, bringing the blood of <b>the</b> Ethiopians <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface of their skin and so turning it black, changing much of Africa into desert, drying up rivers and lakes and shrinking the sea. Earth cried out to Jupiter who was forced to intervene by striking Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Like a falling star, Phaethon plunged blazing into the river Eridanos.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> work aims <b>to</b> {{demonstrate}} {{that at the}} heart of Eriugena’s approach to Christian theology there lies a profoundly philosophical interest in the necessity of a cardinal shift in the paradigms of thinking – namely, that from <b>the</b> metaphysical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dialectical one, which wins him a reputation of the ‘Hegel of the ninth century,’ as scholars in Post-Hegelian Germany called him. The prime concern of Eriugena’s discourse is <b>to</b> prove that <b>the</b> actual adoption of the salvific truth of Christ’s revelation about all humans’ <b>Sonship</b> <b>to</b> God (resulting in their return to union with Him) directly depends on the way the truth of God’s Oneness is consistently thought of. It is exactly the dialectic of the universal and particular which allows Eriugena both <b>to</b> tackle <b>the</b> dichotomy between being and non-being (called by him the fundamental division) and to proceed towards raising a question how the totality of God’s being can be approached so as to let him radically reconsider a predominantly metaphysical view of creation the theological reflection traditionally relies on. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dialectical understanding of unity (with a strong appeal to a dialectically coherent treatment of contradiction) that Eriugena does adhere <b>to,</b> <b>the</b> reality of creation cannot be thought of, and therefore known, otherwise than in the way of being inseparable from the universal Principle of all. This is the Principle abandoned by nothing, unless the mind corrupted by the senses thinks otherwise and, following the metaphysical pattern of dichotomy (as that of the fundamental division), improperly sets the creation and its Principle apart. Restoration of <b>the</b> mind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proper rational motion of recta ratio (right reason) freed, as Eriugena argues, from the dictates of senses therefore becomes the way of both <b>the</b> epistemological breakthrough <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infinite whole and practical return (reditus) from the world of finite things (the corrupt mind’s construct) <b>to</b> living in <b>the</b> divine reality of creation. The work’s argument {{is based on the assumption}} of close affinity between Eriugena’s discourse and that of his Islamic contemporaries (Allaf, al-Nazzam, al-Kindi, and others), who developed their dialectical ideas within the Mu’tazilah tradition of a philosophically disciplined approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth of God’s Oneness. In particular, al-Nazzam’s engagement with Parmenides’ Periphyseon and his resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> danger of a dualistic interpretation of its ontology seem to provoke Eriugena’s innovative approach to Christian theology with a view to suggesting a mode of overcoming dualism as the main obstacle on <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Truth revealed. This vision of the meaning of Eriugena’s undertaking allows us not only <b>to</b> better understand <b>the</b> novelty of his approach to Christian theology, but also reconsider some of the key points of his discourse that seem to have become a sort of commonplace in Eriugenian studies: 1. 	Unlike the prevalent opinion, not the forms of the division of Nature but the modes of interpreting being and non-being are to be understood <b>to</b> constitute <b>the</b> genuine subject-matter of each book of the Periphyseon and, hence, of the five parts of his system. 2. 	The fourfold division of Nature is to be interpreted not as a basic structure of the system offered by Eriugena, but as a means of introducing dialectic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body of theology by refuting Augustine’s metaphysical vision of a hierarchical model of the universe and indicating the way of resolution of the cardinally theological contradiction – God does and does not create at the same time. 3. 	All this gives reason to disagree with a general tendency of associating Eriugena’s work with exploration of the division of God’s Nature and to reinterpret it as an immense anti-division project to be understood as an important turn in the history of Christian thought entirely focused on the truth of God’s Oneness and human life in conformity to it. *** I affirm that this thesis is entirely my own work and has not been submitted for examination in any form elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{so-called}} divinity of Jesus Christ, an important issue in face of the risen importance of dialogue between christians en muslims, en {{also because of the}} diffuse images of divinity in western society. In that context the widespread prejudice that Jesus’ divinity is an invention of some Greekminded theologians needs constant revision. There are several possibilities <b>to</b> enquire <b>the</b> meaning of Jesus’ divinity’. I choose the following question as leading for my investigation: how <b>to</b> think about <b>the</b> relationship between the Eternal Son and the historical Jesus. That question suits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theology of two theologians I analyse: Ulrich Dalferth (born in 1948) and Wolfhart Pannenberg (born in 1928). And it also exemplifies the much felt clash between tradition and modernity, between the Christ of dogma and the human being Jesus of Nazareth as presented by modern exegesis. After determining a central question, I create a path of questions to reach an answer. First, as an introduction, I ask for the interpretation Dalferth en Pannenberg give of the christological dogma of the church. The second question is what explanation Dalferth en Pannenberg give <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confession that Jesus is ‘Son of God’. The third question is what they think about the notion of the ‘eternal Son’, what they say about the subjectivity and divinity of the Son as a person of the trinity. My fourth question is pointed at the meaning they give to ‘incarnation’ (which in traditional christology is the connection between Jesus and the eternal Son). Fifth question is whether they ultimately speak about one or about two subjects: are Jesus Christ and the Eternal Son one and the same? Sixth and last step is the now following answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central question. Dalferth en Pannenberg both give an extensive re-examination of the christological dogma, and the historical christology before and after the dogma. The have a different vision on the key problems concerning the dogma. Dalferth criticizes the focus on Jesus, and alleges that the ‘divine nature’ must point to God who acts in en through Jesus. For Pannenberg, the focus on Jesus is all right, but he thinks the relationship between God and man in Jesus’ person has not been thought well in classical christology. The fundamental problem for him is the connection between incarnation and the birth of Jesus, that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presupposition that the relationship between God and man in Jesus is constituted independent of his concrete life as a human being. Dalferth en Pannenberg both assert that the Jesus’ resurrection has fundamental importance for his being the Son of God, though for different reasons. Dalferth states Jesus’ cross en resurrection have their ultimate meaning in their revealing of Gods acting. Through cross en resurrection Gods identifies with Jesus’ proclamation, and also gives an ultimate interpretation of it: He is love. Even in death He did not leave Jesus, and in the resurrection He lets Jesus participate in his own divine life. So God identifies himself for eternity through this living Jesus. Dalferths analysis of the development of the christological image ‘Son of God’ in the New Testament is meant to show that this development is an unfolding of the meaning of this action of God through Jesus’ cross en resurrection. In Dalferths conception it is in this way implied that Jesus’ Sonship is a relationship between Jesus and God. That’s also a fundamental idea in Pannenberg’s christology, be it in a different way. Dalferth gives a strong accent on Gods initiative in this relationship, whereas Pannenberg has a greater place for the mutuality in the relationship between God and Jesus. This difference is grounded in a different view on the Sonship of Jesus: in Pannenberg’s view Jesus is the Son of God because he fulfils the destiny of man. In distinguishing himself from God, as a creature from the Creator, Jesus’ life as a human life can be totally connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> life of God. This leads to our following question: the meaning of ‘trinity’, especially the meaning of the Son for Gods identity. For Pannenberg the total connection of Jesus’ human life with God has its definitive base in the resurrection. And the resurrection also has its significance for Gods own life: through resurrecting Jesus from the dead He explains that the relation of <b>Sonship</b> belongs <b>to</b> <b>his</b> eternal identity. This means the Son also precedes the historical life of Jesus, and we must speak about the eternal Son of God. For Dalferth the Sonship of Jesus is also decisive for God’s identity, but in another way. He says God identifies with the person of Jesus in that He binds his own being to this person to reveal his essence. This essence is to be described as creative love, which is near even into death. This love also implies that God’s relationship to Jesus and to all other creatures has its base in God’s essence, but Gods essence cannot be interpreted as divine persons in mutual relationships (as Pannenberg does). The notion of pre-existence does say something about the soteriological meaning of God’s acting in en through Jesus Christ. The notion of incarnation also has a secondary place in Dalferths theological conception. It is an image that explains some of the implications of Jesus’ resurrection, namely the integration of his life in God’s life. Dalferth asserts this points to God giving room to creation in his own uncreated life, ands so reveals the great nearness of God to our reality. For Pannenberg incarnation is about a person of God’s being, the eternal Son, assuming human life. He asserts that the totality of Jesus’ life and person is the incarnation of the eternal Son. Jesus’ human person and life is the medium for the appearance of the eternal Son in human history. Next I come to my fifth question, namely the relationship of Jesus as a subject <b>to</b> God (<b>the</b> Son) as a subject. Dalferth stresses that Jesus’ subjectivity is grounded in God’s activity, and has an important role in that greater context. Through Jesus’ proclamation we can understand the meaning of the cross and the resurrection, and trough Jesus’ cross en resurrection God gives a definitive revelation of his being. The activity of the resurrected Jesus is a not very pronounced element in Dalferth’s theology, all stress is on God’s activity. Pannenberg also gives the human being Jesus {{an important role in the}} acting of God. But he sees in that activity of Jesus the acting of an incarnated divine subject: the eternal Son. It seems the eternal Son is a greater subject than Jesus, according to Pannenberg. This especially comes true in his thoughts about Jesus’ suffering, when he speaks about the eternal Son as acting while Jesus is passive. Having answered the preceding questions, an answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central question can be formulated. It turns out that Dalferth doesn’t speak about an eternal divine Son, but is giving the person of Jesus Christ a crucial place in God’s identity. This fundamental relationship between God en the person of Jesus is characterized by the words ‘identification’ and ‘incorporation’. By raising Jesus from the dead, God identifies with Jesus’ proclamation, and so identifies himself as love. God binds his own identity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> most extreme situation of mankind, namely the Godforsaken death. And he ‘incorporates’ Jesus’ life in his own divine life, and through Jesus reveals that He is near to all reality. Pannenberg sees an indirect identity between the eternal Son and Jesus. In the concrete historical relationship between Jesus and God the Father we learn to know that Jesus’ history and person is the medium of appearance in human history for the eternal Son. After the analysis and comparision of Dalferth and Pannenberg, I try to develop my own view. In many points I mainly agree with Pannenberg. Important points of agreement are: thinking the Sonship of Jesus as a mutual relationship between Jesus and the Father, and the conclusion <b>the</b> <b>Sonship</b> must belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eternal identity of God, so that there must be spoken of different persons in God. This makes it possible <b>to</b> speak about <b>the</b> incarnation of the eternal Son in the history and person of Jesus. I disagree with Pannenberg the way he thinks the incarnation. I claim the incarnation can be defended better when the relationship between Father and Son is understood without general qualifications, except that it is a relationship of love, whereby the goal is focussed at the Kingdom of God. Pannenberg gives to much qualifications <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> man Jesus and the eternal Son: the man Jesus has <b>to</b> fulfil <b>the</b> general structure of a human being, the eternal Son is bound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infinity of God. When the only condition for the Sonship, both of Jesus and of the eternal Son, is <b>the</b> loving relationship <b>to</b> and from God the Father, then the unity of Jesus and the eternal Son can be thought more fully. Which attributes Jesus has, as ‘God’ or as ‘man’, can’t be said in abstraction from the concrete relationship between Son and Father as told in the gospels. In the end, I come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposal that it’s hardly possible to discern what belongs to Jesus ‘divine nature’ and what to his ‘human nature’. The four qualifications whereby Chalcedon speaks about the relationship between divine and human nature are pointing to an indescribable fact: that God (the Son) became a human being. So I think Jesus is divine, because He is one of the subjects of the eternal divine life. This doesn’t mean the ‘divine nature’ is something of Jesus own person, it exists in his relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Father through the Spirit. In this way I avoid the classical christological trap Dalferth rightly discerns, of focussing too much on Jesus on his own. Simultaneously I claim Dalferths position can be strengthened when he would speak about personal relationships in the being of God. When this is strictly bound to Jesus’ person, and is soberly described, then an implausible mythological and metaphysical figure doesn’t have <b>to</b> appear on <b>the</b> scene...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} {{a cultural and}} social history of the rise and legitimation {{of the concept of}} dynastic continuity in the early history of the Ptolemaic Empire. The scope of the study is therefore neither to provide a general overview of third-century Ptolemaic history, nor to discuss in detail the administrative and economic structures of the Ptolemaic state. Rather, its purpose is <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> ways by which the first Ptolemies negotiated and constructed a representation of their power as a dynastic house aspiring to universal dominion, protected by the gods and legitimately continuing the heritage of the Macedonian and Egyptian monarchies. It is argued that they managed to do so by operating within different socio-cultural and ethnic milieus and by pursuing their strategies on a two-fold level: on the one hand, by continuously reshaping the relationship between the present events of the ruling house and its historical and mythical past, so as to adapt it to new political and cultural agendas; on the other hand, by shifting the border between the spheres of human and divine power in order <b>to</b> ensure themselves <b>the</b> legitimacy and loyalty stemming from religious thought and practice. Discussed evidence comprises Greek and Egyptian sources, literary and documentary texts, iconographic and archaeological evidence from the Macedonian conquest of Egypt under Alexander <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ascension of Ptolemy III Euergetes. Whenever possible, a new, encompassing evaluation of old evidence has gained new impetus from the intensive analysis of newly published sources. Secondly, the complex cultural and social factors operating in the construction and legitimation of the Ptolemaic dynasty have been discussed by drawing on the contribution of up-to-date scholarship in cultural and religious history as well as in sociology. The rooting of Ptolemaic power in Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean is studied as the movement from the immediate but unstable right of conquest established by Alexander, and subsequently claimed by <b>the</b> satrap Ptolemy, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of a mature and coherent system of power practices and representations. The structure of the book is meant to provide readers with a chronological and thematic discussion ranging from Alexander’s conquest of Egypt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first years of Ptolemy III. However, the six chapters that constitute this study can also be read separately as they are conceived as the monographic treatment of major moments or aspects of the cultural, political, and religious history of the early Hellenistic period. Chapter 1 deals with the premises of Ptolemaic power in Egypt by focusing on the time of Alexander’s conquest. The implications of Alexander’s <b>sonship</b> <b>to</b> Zeus Ammon in propaganda and in religion are reviewed by drawing attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plurality of audiences (Macedonians, Greeks, Egyptians) for which this motif was conceived and used. Chapter 2 discusses the conflicting patterns of legitimation {{in the age of the}} Successors and how Ptolemy exploited them in his rise from satrap to king. Some seminal moments of Ptolemy’s career are re-examined: the acquisition of Alexander’s corpse as a source of embodied legitimacy; the interactions between the leader and pre-existing Macedonian and Egyptian elites as they appear in assembly scenes of Greek historiography and in the hieroglyphic Satrap stele; Ptolemy’s help <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rhodians against Antigonus and Demetrius and the entanglement between royal charisma and religious honours. Chapter 3 focuses on the figure of Dionysus in Ptolemaic religion and culture from a twofold perspective. Firstly, the chapter {{provides a}}n innovative analysis of the religious and ideological role of Dionysus in Ptolemy II’s Alexandrian procession described by Callixeinus of Rhodes. Secondly, it aims at offering a contribution for a reappraisal of the figure of Dionysus, of his cults and of the role of his figure within the larger context of the Ptolemaic Empire in the third century BC. Chapter 4 discusses the patterns of divinization of Arsinoe II within the royal couple through the most complete documentary dossier collected thus far on the subject. Rather than constituting the aim of the research, the debate concerning the chronology of Arsinoe’s death and divinization has provided the rough framework for a new investigation of how the image of a solid royal couple was invented and spread in religious life and in propaganda. Diachronic developments in the configurations of the dynastic couple are traced through Greek and Egyptian evidence and discussed in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changing of political agendas during the reign of Ptolemy II. Chapter 5 studies the contribution of Ptolemy III <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of Ptolemaic dynastic continuity through old and new evidence, notably by providing fresh observations concerning the recently published decree of Alexandria (243 BC) for the understanding of Ptolemaic royal festivals in general and, more in particular, for the history of the festival Ptolemaia in the second half of the 3 rd century BC. Chapter 6 breaks with chronological continuity to trace, through literary and documentary evidence from the Roman period, the development of the tradition envisaging Alexander’s body as a talismanic relic protecting the city of Alexandria. The purpose of this epilogue is to provide a methodological essay of interpretation of cultural traditions in the longue durée, when patterns of continuity developed under the Ptolemies were separated from their original context of diffusion and consequently were re-used <b>to</b> shape <b>the</b> civic identity of Alexandria within the new and broader framework of the Roman Empire. Although focus on the construction of a dynasty as a sequence of legitimate, kindred holders of monarchic power makes Ptolemaic kings and queens the central object of this study, it is argued that sovereigns cannot be considered as the sole holders of the initiative in the political, ideological and religious processes relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of royal and dynastic imagery. On the contrary, it appears that social agents other than the holders of supreme leadership not only reacted to top-down stimulation, but they also constructed, for their own use, representations of the monarchs that interacted with the message issued by the central power. From this perspective, therefore, dynastic continuity results from the intertextual combination of a variety of ideological and religious motifs stemming from different agents and occasions of communication...|$|R
40|$|The phrase Third Article Theology {{is used in}} two senses: {{first to}} characterise a methodological {{approach}} that intentionally starts with the Spirit; and second as the theological understanding that emerges from this approach. Over recent decades, Spirit Christology has utilised the approach of Third Article Theology to gain insight into the person and life of Christ. This thesis extends the methodology in order <b>to</b> construct <b>the</b> constituent features of a Third Article Ecclesiology. The research divides into three parts. In part one, following a description of Third Article Theology and its application to Christology, {{it is argued that}} the Spirit informs the connection between other theological doctrines and ecclesiology. Following this insight, a methodological framework is developed that examines ecclesiology {{from the vantage point of}} other doctrines, through a pneumatological lens. Given their advanced state of development, the doctrines of Christology and the Trinity were chosen as the initial vantage points from which to observe ecclesiology. Part two examines ecclesiology from the perspective of Christology, through the lens of the Spirit. By critically utilising the ecclesiologies of Barth and Zizioulas as complementary starting points, it is argued that coherently accounting for the Church’s humanity and divinity requires both the Son and Spirit’s ecclesial roles to be logically distinguished without being existentially separated. This leads <b>to</b> analogically comparing <b>the</b> Spirit’s involvement in Christ and the Church. Five pneumatological parallels between Spirit Christology and the Church inform the development of a Christological Third Article Ecclesiology, which is determined as being tripartite in nature, relational in identity, unique in context, Christ-centred in orientation, Christotelic in momentum, indivisible in constitution, cruciform in shape, missional in purpose, and narrative in character. These constituent features are contrasted with other ecclesiologies that over- or under-emphasise the roles of the Son and the Spirit in the Church. Part three examines ecclesiology from a Trinitarian perspective. It is first argued (with Habets and Weinandy) that Spirit Christology implies a Trinitarian understanding where the Father (the originating person) begets the Son (the personed person) in or by the Spirit (the personing person), and the Son returns love <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Father by the Spirit of <b>Sonship</b> given <b>to</b> him. Second, it is demonstrated that the analogical link between the Trinity and the Church is not reflective (cf. Volf’s approach) but intrinsically pneumatological—the Spirit’s ecclesial role parallels the Spirit’s immanent identity. Based on these initial determinations, this thesis explores the implications of the immanent identities of the Spirit and the Son (as identified above) being reprised on a series of expanding stages: Christologically, soteriologically, and most pertinently here ecclesiologically. The resulting Trinitarian Third Article Ecclesiology characterises the Church as existing in any and all relationships where by the Spirit the love of Christ is offered and returned. The constituent features of this understanding are contrasted with ecclesiologies derived from alternative Trinitarian starting points. A concluding discussion explores extending this research to other doctrinal vantage points—particularly eschatology and the world—and examines how the various pneumato-ecclesiological perspectives gained could be integrated to construct a comprehensive Third Article Ecclesiology...|$|R
