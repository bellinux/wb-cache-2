40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} the role that {{personal}} cultural orientations play in <b>customer</b> <b>attributions</b> in intercultural service encounters. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed depicting the relationships between service delivery outcome, personal cultural orientations and <b>customer</b> <b>attributions.</b> Data were collected from 640 Chinese and Western customers using scenario-based experiments in a restaurant context to assess the hypothesized relationships in the model. Findings: The findings show that compared to service delivery success, customers tend to hold service employee and firm responsible for service delivery failure rather than themselves and cultural differences. Moreover, personal cultural orientations partially moderated {{the influence of the}} service delivery outcome on <b>customer</b> <b>attributions.</b> Research limitations/implications: Future research could adopt different methodologies such as critical incident techniques and surveys to replicate the study. Practical implications: Service firms are recommended to design programs to influence <b>customer</b> <b>attributions</b> such as “customer education programs” and “customer appreciation programs” to achieve high customer satisfaction. Originality/value: This study examines the differences in <b>customer</b> <b>attributions</b> between successful vs unsuccessful service delivery. It also sheds light on the potential moderating role of personal cultural orientations on the relationship between service delivery outcome and <b>customer</b> <b>attributions.</b> Department of Management and Marketin...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{consumer}} psychology shows that customers seek reasons for service failures and that attributions of blame moderate {{the effects of}} failure {{on the level of}} customer satisfaction. This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by <b>customer</b> <b>attributions</b> of blame for service failures. We use the U. S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i. e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of <b>customer</b> <b>attributions</b> during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction. service operations, <b>customer</b> satisfaction, <b>attribution</b> theory, failure recovery, airline industry...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} the private rationale {{and the social}} {{costs and benefits of}} market foreclosure, here defined as a firm's restriction of output in one market through the use of market power in another market. The chapter first focuses on vertical foreclosure (in which full access to a bottleneck input is denied to competitors) and provides an overview of the theory of access to an essential facility in an unregulated environment. It considers a wide array of contexts: possibility of bypass of the bottleneck facility, upstream vs downstream location of this facility, and various exclusionary activities such as vertical integration and exclusive dealing. It identifies a number of robust conclusions as to the social and private costs and benefits of foreclosure. The chapter then turns to horizontal foreclosure, where the monopoly good is sold directly to the end-users, and analyzes recent theories of anti-competitive bundling aimed at reducing competition in the adjacent markets or at protecting the monopoly market. Finally, the chapter tackles <b>exclusive</b> <b>customer</b> contracts and discusses potential efficiency defenses for exclusionary behavior. industrial organization...|$|R
40|$|Relationship Marketing is {{evolving}} from an almost <b>exclusive</b> <b>customer</b> orientation to a stakeholder orientation including employees, suppliers, shareholders, the community, {{as well as}} customers. Business philosophy is also evolving from the traditional single business objective of achieving a single bottom line of maximum economic returns to shareholder stakeholders, to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) philosophy of a tripartite sustainable business objective of achieving optimum economic, social, and environmental returns to all stakeholders. At {{the same time there}} is an increasing requirement that marketing performance be linked to profitability. This paper examines whether a stakeholder and Triple Bottom Line augmentation of relationship marketing enhances profitability. The Stakeholder Business Model is the measurement model used to measure present stakeholder attitudes as timely, early warning signals of emerging stakeholder behaviour and concomitant emerging business performance in a Stakeholder Performance Appraisal. Appraisal results to date indicate that a stakeholder relationship marketing orientation significantly enhances business profitability beyond that achieved by a customer relationship marketing orientation. A further augmentation with TBL philosophy provides a very significant additional enhancement to business profitability...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose – The authors aim to: 1) {{propose a}} causal model to {{understand}} the process of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perception formation among customers; and 2) identify differences among innovative and conservative customers in that process. Design/methodology/approach – A structural equation model is tested {{in a sample of}} 1, 124 banking services customers in Spain. Also, a multisampling analysis is implemented in order to determine how novelty seeking moderates the process of CSR perception formation among customers. Findings – Results confirm that customer CSR perceptions are directly and positively influenced by: 1) the congruence between CSR initiatives and corporate profile; 2) <b>customer</b> <b>attributions</b> of corporate motivations to engage in CSR; and 3) corporate credibility in developing CSR initiatives. Nonetheless, while innovative customers pay greater attention to corporate credibility than conservative customers when evaluating CSR initiatives, conservative customers evaluate the congruence of CSR initiatives and their attribution of altruistic motivations to a larger extent than innovative customers. Practical implications – These findings suggest that companies should take into account customer novelty seeking when planning their CSR and communication strategies because highlighting different qualities of their CSR initiatives can have diverse effects for the success of corporate investments. Originality/value – The greatest contribution of the paper is the study of the moderating role of novelty seeking in the process of customer CSR perception formation; previous scholars had long ignored this variable when evaluating customer perceptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{last few}} decades have {{witnessed}} a scientific revolution {{in the field of}} industrial organization in the form of transaction cost economics (TCE). This revolution has radically altered economists’ understanding and interpretation of both partial and complete economic integration. Not surprisingly, this sea change has substantially influenced antitrust law and policy, impelling the Supreme Court to reverse or greatly modify various precedents. This essay supplements the received historiography of the TCE revolution. It contends that Robert Bork played a hitherto underappreciated role in that revolution. In particular, the essay contends that in 1966, before the official onset of the transaction cost revolution, Bork helped rediscover Ronald Coase’s 1937 article, The Nature of the Firm, and employed Coase’s reasoning to offer TCE justifications for various forms of partial integration. Bork explained how <b>exclusive</b> territories, <b>customer</b> restrictions, and horizontal minimum price fixing that accompanied otherwise valid joint ventures were voluntary efforts to overcome the social costs of reliance on atomistic markets. In so doing, Bork articulated and applied numerous tools of TCE, tools that reflected departures from the then-dominant applied price theory version of industrial organization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of relationship quality (RQ) on customers’ desires to retaliate after service failures. We posit that {{the effects of}} RQ are contingent upon the <b>attributions</b> <b>customers</b> make about the firm’s controllability over a service failure. Two competing hypotheses are examined and reconciled. The “love is blind ” hypothesis posits that when low controllability is inferred, high RQ customers experience a lesser desire for retaliation than low RQ customers. On the other hand, the “love becomes hate ” hypothesis specifies that when high controllability is inferred, high RQ customers experience a greater desire for retaliation than low RQ customers. The hypotheses are tested with a survey-based design and a partial least squares (PLS) model that incorporates a multiplicative latent construct...|$|R
5000|$|Dispositional {{attribution}} is {{a tendency}} to attribute people's behaviors to their dispositions; that is, to their personality, character, and ability.For example, when a normally pleasant waiter is being rude to his/her customer, the customer may assume he/she has a bad temper. The customer, just by looking at the attitude that the waiter is giving him/her, instantly decides that the waiter is a bad person. The customer oversimplifies the situation by not taking into account all the unfortunate events that might have happened to the waiter which made him/her become rude at that moment. Therefore, the <b>customer</b> made dispositional <b>attribution</b> by attributing the waiter's behavior directly to his/her personality rather than considering situational factors that might have caused the whole [...] "rudeness".|$|R
40|$|When banks incur {{sunk costs}} to provide ex-ante {{information}} about <b>customers,</b> <b>exclusive</b> banking relations will occur under intense price competition when monitoring costs are low. When monitoring costs are sufficiently high, only non-monitored finance will be provided, typically, by multiple lenders. While multiple lending generally is (second-best) efficient when it emerges, relationship lending typically is not. In our framework, the informational rents in relationships {{of a single}} financier (house bank) typically exceed the risk premium required for financing projects from the unscreened pool of applicants. Accordingly, when entrepreneurs can affect repayment probabilities by sunk ex-ante investments prior to the financing stage, in a house bank regime investment incentives are typically lower than under conditions of competitive non-monitored lending. relationship banking, multiple lending, monitoring, research incentives...|$|R
