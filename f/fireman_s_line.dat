50|$|In December 2013, the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> {{streetcar}} (formerly {{known as}} Sugar House Streetcar) opened for service. The <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> was built along an existing rail line {{just south of}} 2100 South (the northern border of the city) from the Central Pointe station to the Sugar House neighborhood in southeastern Salt Lake City. In addition to Central Pointe station, the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> will include stops at South Main Street (South Salt Lake City station), South 300 East (300 East station), and South 500 East (500 East station) before leaving the city. Although operated by UTA, the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> is a joint project between South Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, and UTA.|$|R

30|$|Actin {{promoter}} {{is reported}} to induce generally stronger expression than 35 S promoter when introduced into graminaceous plants such as rice (McElroy et al. 1990). Therefore, we produced not only 35 <b>S</b> <b>lines</b> but also AN lines {{in order to obtain}} new lines with higher Fe and Zn concentrations. However, 35 <b>S</b> <b>line</b> accumulated more NA, DMA than AN lines (Fig.  3). Fe and Zn concentration in seeds were also higher in 35 <b>S</b> <b>line</b> than AN lines (Fig.  4). Nevertheless, AN lines also showed higher Fe and Zn concentrations in seeds than NT line.|$|R

In this study, we assessed the radiological evaluation of the level of Tuffier%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>line</b> with changes in age and gender in pediatric population. Material and Method: In this study, standing anteroposterior lumbar radiographs of 519 patients aged 16 and younger were analyzed retrospectively.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} variability, heritability and {{correlations of}} agronomic traits in an onion (Allium cepa L.) landrace and derived <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> after a single selfing generation. Bulbs {{used to develop}} <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> were selected for shape, colour and high number of skins. Fifty-one <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> and the original population were evaluated using an incomplete random block design. The original population and <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> were highly diverse for quantitative and qualitative traits. <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> were significantly different, with transgressive segregation for number and maximum leaf length, bulbing index, bulb weight, diameter, and dry matter content. Variances within <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> were greater than among <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> for all traits. Bulb colour and number of skins responded to selection. Heritabilities for dry matter and soluble solids were 52. 6 % and 36. 1 % respectively. Both traits were highly correlated.

5000|$|While fairly {{similar to}} UTA's TRAX light rail the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> {{operates}} at a substantially slower speed, {{with a top}} speed of 25 mph. The <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> also differs from TRAX in that, for the most part, it only has a single track (with passing tracks) and it operates with more frequent stops for easy pedestrian access. Other differences are that the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> operates with a single car, rather than a [...] "train" [...] of cars. Because of its slower speed, some S-line at-grade road crossings do not have barrier arms that stop vehicular traffic. Instead many streetcar crossings have traffic lights, while several are controlled by stop signs. Accordingly, the streetcars may be required to slow down or even stop prior to crossing roadways. (These road crossing also include crosswalks that parallel the tracks, and pedestrian traffic lights as well.) The fare for the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> is the same as for TRAX and the same methods of payment (including the FAREPAY card) are accepted.|$|R

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the potential for selection of maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes that produce grain resistant to physical injury. The materials evaluated were S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> derived from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> derived from BS 1 (HS) C 1 in hybrid combinations with B 73 and MO 17. Eight plant and grain traits (kernel shear strength, visual endosperm rating, date of anthesis, harvest moisture, grain breakage, 300 -kernel weight, 300 -kernel volume, and kernel density) were evaluated for the S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1. Also, five plant and grain traits (root lodging, stalk lodging, grain breakage, harvest moisture, and grain yield) of BS 1 (HS) C 1 <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> and <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> testcross hybrids were evaluated. All materials were grown at two locations, one year for each generation (visual endosperm rating and date of anthesis were evaluated only at Ames);Statistical analyses revealed significant genetic variability in BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 for all traits. Estimated genotype-by-environment variance components for physical grain quality traits were 0 to 66 % as large as the estimated genotypic variance components. Heritability estimates (entry mean basis) for grain breakage ranged from 0. 48 to 0. 67. Nonadditive gene action for grain breakage was indicated by a highly significant S 2 line-by-tester interaction. Because the means of <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> and <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> testcross hybrids for grain breakage were similar in magnitude, the presence of nonadditive gene action may be the consequence of bi-directional dominance;The optimum harvest moisture range for physical grain quality preservation was 19 to 26 %. Increasing deviations from this optimum range resulted in increasing grain breakage. Grain resistant to breakage tended to be smaller, denser, and higher in shear strength. Correlations of the same traits between generations indicated that S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> means would have predictive value for <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> and <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> testcross hybrid means, respectively. The data indicated that selection of <b>S</b> 1 <b>lines</b> with breakage-resistant grain would result in earlier flowering <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> with smaller kernels. A small, positive correlation between <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> grain breakage and <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> testcross hybrid yield revealed that selection of <b>S</b> 2 <b>lines</b> with superior physical grain quality could result in lower yielding <b>S</b> 2 <b>line</b> testcross hybrids...|$|R

Five R and <b>S</b> <b>line</b> lambs that were immunised by repeated oxfendazole-abbreviated infections and 5 non-immunised R and <b>S</b> <b>line</b> lambs were used. All lambs grazed nematode infected pasture for 107 days. Immunisation enhanced the resistant status in both R and S lambs. MLNC obtained from slaughtered animals were stimulated with Con A or T. colubriformis specific antigen. Non-stimulated MLNC of immunised lambs expressed higher levels of IL- 4 mRNA {{and lower levels of}} IL- 2 mRNA than non-immunised lambs. MLNC of immunised R and <b>S</b> <b>line</b> lambs stimulated with antigen for 24 h expressed detectable amounts of IL- 4 mRNA that was not seen in non-immunised controls. CD 4 + T cell enriched cell populations of immunised R and S lambs and non-immunised R lambs expressed moderate to high levels of IL- 4 mRNA. Con A stimulated MLNC of immunised R and S lambs expressed high levels IFN-γ mRNA and produced high amounts of IFN-γ. Lower levels were present in non-immunised controls. The results indicate that R line lambs and immunised <b>S</b> <b>line</b> lambs respond to natural nematode challenge with a predominating IL- 4 cytokine response when compared to non-immunised S lambs...|$|R
