40|$|Wage {{levels and}} {{turnover}} rates are negatively correlated across types of employment, and {{this fact is}} often interpreted as evidence that high-wage jobs are rationed. A simple training model illustrates, however, that this correlation may arise because able workers {{have an incentive to}} choose highly specialized jobs. In any job, the most able workers possess the most valuable stocks of specific skills and therefore face the highest mobility costs. Thus, able workers may have a comparative advantage in specialized <b>employments.</b> <b>Data</b> from the national Longitudinal Survey of Youth provide an opportunity to evaluate the merits of the training model developed here. Data on worker training and mobility provide support for several implications of the model. The model also provides new ways to interpret existing results in the literature on interindustry wage differentials. ...|$|R
40|$|Workforce {{planning}} {{is a process}} of identifying {{the quantity and quality of}} employees required to achieve strategic goals and objectives, ensuring that the right number of people is in the right jobs at the right time. At the national level, a well-planned workforce is seen as the foundation for economic growth. The government of Sri Lanka has drafted a ten year development plan from 2006 to 2016 targeting an approximated Gross Domestic Product of 8. 5 %. This demands a systematic forecasting of the workforce based on investments. For effective workforce planning, the foundation is the identification of supply and demand of labour. Then measures could be taken to address surplus and shortage in the short-run and long-run. Though forecasting quantity and quality of human resource based on a model is essential, up to date, no study has been carried out to estimate workforce requirements at the national level in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this study is an attempt to address this research gap. It is expected that the findings of the study will have broader relevance at national level policy planning. The purpose of the research was to estimate workforce demand of the industrial sector for the years 2007 to 2011 based on past investment and employment generation-data. A model was developed to forecast work,force for the years 2007 to 2011 based on the investment and <b>employment</b> generation <b>data</b> for the years 1985 to 2006. Investment and <b>employment</b> generation <b>data</b> were collected from the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotions. Investment and <b>employment</b> generation <b>data</b> for the years 1985 to 2006 was used for the modeling and forecasting of the required workforce at export processing zone level and industrial sector level for the years 2007 to 2011. For the study an indicator called Employments Created per Investment was created (ECI) and. investment and <b>employment</b> generation <b>data</b> were correlated with ECI. The least square method was employed to derive the best fitted model. Both linear and quadratic models and double exponential smoothing method were derived. It is found that double exponential smoothing method give the best performance.
