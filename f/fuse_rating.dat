5000|$|The larger end cap (the [...] "bottom" [...] of the bottle) has at its centre a small {{spring-loaded}} button {{retained by}} a thin wire, {{which serves as a}} [...] "fuse blown" [...] indicator.

5000|$|The {{four-wire}} wye {{system is}} used when ground referenced voltages or {{the flexibility of}} more voltage selections are required. Faults on one phase to ground will cause a protection event (fuse or breaker open) locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipment. An example of application is local distribution in Europe (and elsewhere), where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral (which is common to the three phases). When a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents, the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances. Electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced {{as much as possible}} within premises where 3-phase power is used. [...] These same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises. Hence, every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that, on average, as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply.For domestic use, some countries such as the UK may supply one phase and neutral at a high current (up to 100A) to one property, while others such as Germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer, but at a lower <b>fuse</b> <b>rating,</b> typically 32 A per phase, and [...] "shuffled" [...] to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase.|$|E

40|$|Keywords:hybrid current {{limiting}} fuse, arc trigger, {{fault current}} limiter, current density Abstract. With conventional high voltage current limiting <b>fuse,</b> the <b>rated</b> current is usually below 200 A. The rated current {{of the state}} of the art arc triggering hybrid current limiting fuse is only 600 A, with its interrupting capability being 25 kA, and still can’t meet the requirements of modern industrial application. With the arc triggering hybrid current limiting fuses, the major obstacle to higher rated current and interrupting capability lies in the long operation time of the arc trigger. Increasing the current density of arc trigger notches can effectively improve the operation speed of the trigger. Simulation and parameter optimization of the arc trigger are conducted by using ANSYS 11. 0 to attain the optimal fuse element structure. In this study, the notch current density of the arc trigger was as high as 3300 A/mm 2, and the trigger can be used in the hybrid current limiting <b>fuse</b> of <b>rated</b> 35 kV, 2 kA and 40 kA interrupting capability...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring circuit system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a <b>fuse</b> <b>rated</b> between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably <b>rated</b> <b>fuse.</b> The ring circuit in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|R
