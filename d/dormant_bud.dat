500|$|Drosera regia {{plants are}} fairly large herbs that produce {{horizontal}} woody rhizomes and {{a crown of}} large, linear leaves up to [...] long and [...] wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly {{the entire length of}} the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and stipules, emerging by circinate vernation (uncurling) and tapering to a filiform point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D.regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies.

The nematodes overwintered as juveniles and adults in soil, dry leaves, and <b>dormant</b> <b>buds,</b> but not in roots. Nematode winter survival was higher in <b>dormant</b> <b>buds</b> and soil from the polyhouse than in an open home garden. Of the nematodes found in the <b>dormant</b> <b>buds,</b> 35 % to 79 % were located between the first two outside layers of the buds.

The presence of nematodes only on the outer surface of foliage (leaves and petioles) confirmed the migration of A. fragariae {{on the surface of}} the plants. Of the total number of nematodes found on the foliage, 25 % to 46 % and 66 % to 77 % were alive at 90 % and 100 % relative humidity, respectively, suggesting that high moisture is required for the survival and upward movement of nematodes.

40|$|Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata Royle) is {{an exotic}} aquatic {{angiosperm}} {{which has become}} a problematic weed throughout the southern United States. Infestation by aquatic weeds like hydrilla increase loss of valuable water through evapotranspiration, choke waterways used for transportation, depress real estate values, and may present health hazards. Control strategies including herbicide treatment and mechanical harvesting have proven costly and of short term benefit. One reason for this is the vegetative dormant buds which allow the plant to overwinter and reestablish rapidly after attempts at control. This research focuses on elucidation of the bud formation process in hydrilla to provide the basis for development of a control strategy which combines use of herbicides with disruption of bud formation and hence the capacity for regrowth. The environmental and hormonal control of vegetative <b>dormant</b> <b>bud</b> formation was studied in the laboratory using algal-free cultures of hydrilla. Bud formation is stimulated by a photoperiod of less than 12 hours. This environmental stimulus appears to be sensed by the phytochrome system and hormonally induced by abscisic acid. Field sampling at Lake Conroe, Texas, confirmed, where possible, laboratory results and indicated that artificially prolonged photoperiods prevent bud formation. Ethylene, both in laboratory and greenhouse cultures, significantly reduced bud formation at a dose rate of 0. 1 mg/l every two days. Coumarin significantly reduced bud formation when applied at 10 ('- 6) M but information in the literature indicates that the mode of action of coumarin may be induced ethylene formation in the plant (Morgan and Cowell, 1970). Growth characteristics of hydrilla make it suitable for use in a bioassay for the assessment of the relative phytotoxicity of aquatic pollutants. Algae-free cultures of hydrilla were grown in the laboratory in 10 % Hoagland's medium. Evaluation of chemical toxicity was obtained starting from two different life stages of the plant: dormant buds and apical fragments. <b>Dormant</b> <b>bud</b> production was also monitored in order to evaluate the potential for life cycle and chronic studies. Hydrilla appeared more sensitive to ammonium carbamate than were duckweeds and more sensitive to phenol than was a unicellular green alga.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the advances {{made over the}} last decade in cryopreservation of economically important vegetatively propagated fruit trees. Cryopreservation protocols have been established using both <b>dormant</b> <b>buds</b> sampled on field-grown plants and shoot tips sampled on in vitro plantlets. In the case of <b>dormant</b> <b>buds,</b> scions are partially dehydrated by storage at - 5 degrees C, and then cooled slowly to - 30 degrees C using low cooling rates (c. a. 1 degrees C/h) before immersion in liquid nitrogen. After slow rewarming and rehydration of samples, regrowth takes place either through grafting of buds on rootstocks or excision of apices and inoculation in vitro. In the case of shoot tips of in vitro plantlets, the cryopreservation techniques employed are the following: controlled rate cooling procedures involving slow prefreezing followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen or vitrification-based procedures including encapsulation-dehydration, vitrification, encapsulation-vitrification and droplet-vitrification. The current status of cryopreservation for a series of fruit tree species including Actinidia, Diospyros, Mobs, Olea, Prunus, Pyrus and Vitis is presented. Routine application of cryopreservation for long-term germplasm storage in genebanks is currently limited to apple and pear, for which large cryopreserved collections have been established at NCGRP, Fort Collins (USA), using <b>dormant</b> <b>buds</b> and in vitro shoot tips, respectively. However, there are a growing number of examples of pilot scale testing experiments under way for different species in various countries.

40|$|Winter {{dormancy}} is a {{well known}} mechanism adopted by temperate plants, to mitigate the chilling temperature of winters. However, acquisition of sufficient chilling during winter dormancy ensures the normal phenological traits in subsequent growing period. Thus, low temperature appears to play crucial roles in growth and development of temperate plants. Apple, being an important temperate fruit crop, also requires sufficient chilling to release winter dormancy and normal phenological traits, which are often associated with yield and quality of fruits. DNA cytosine methylation {{is one of the}} important epigenetic modifications which remarkably affect the gene expression during various developmental and adaptive processes. In present study, methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism was employed to assess the changes in cytosine methylation during dormancy, active growth and fruit set in apple, under differential chilling conditions. Under high chill conditions, total methylation was decreased from 27. 2 % in <b>dormant</b> <b>bud</b> to 21. 0 % in fruit set stage, while no significant reduction was found under low chill conditions. Moreover, the demethylation was found to be decreased, while methylation increased from <b>dormant</b> <b>bud</b> to fruit set stage under low chill as compared to high chill conditions. In addition, RNA-Seq analysis showed high expression of DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases during dormancy and fruit set, and low expression of DNA glcosylases during active growth under low chill conditions, which was in accordance with changes in methylation patterns. The RNA-Seq data of 47 genes associated with MSAP fragments involved in cellular metabolism, stress response, antioxidant system and transcriptional regulation showed correlation between methylation and their expression. Similarly, bisulfite sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes also showed correlation between gene body methylation and gene expression. Moreover, significant association between chilling and methylation changes was observed, which suggested that chilling acquisition during dormancy in apple is likely to affect the epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation...|$|E

Kinetin not only totally inhibits the induction of turions by ABA but also alleviates ABA-induced growth inhibition. This antagonism of an ABA-induced gene by a cytokinin correlates with an easily observable antagonistic effect of these two hormones on plant morphogenesis. These data contribute to a growing body of evidence linking growth regulators with changes in peroxidase gene expression and to the concept of pairs of hormones playing antagonistic roles during plant development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scions (either at their original moisture content of 48 to 60 % or dried to 30 %) were slowly cooled to - 35 °C, transferred to the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (LNV, - 160 °C), and warmed before determining survival.
