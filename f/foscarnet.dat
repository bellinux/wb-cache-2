50|$|All three {{currently}} licensed anti-HCMV drugs {{target the}} viral DNA polymerase, pUL54. Ganciclovir (GCV) acts as nucleoside analogue. Its antiviral activity requires phosphorylation by the HCMV protein kinase, pUL97. The second drug, Cidofovir (CDV), is a nucleotide analogue, {{which is already}} phosphorylated and thus active. Finally, <b>Foscarnet</b> (FOS) has a different mode of action. It directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the pyrophosphate binding site of pUL54 (note: investigational drug letermovir acts through a mechanism that involves viral terminase).Two HCMV proteins are implicated in antiviral resistance against these three drugs: pUL97 and pUL54. Specific mutations in pUL97 can cause reduced phosphorylation activity of this viral protein kinase. Thus, fewer monophosphorylated - and thus active - GCV can be synthesized, leading to antiviral resistance against GCV. About 90% of all GCV resistances are caused by such mutations in UL97. Mutations in pUL54 may have different effects leading to antiviral drug resistance: A. They can lead to decreased affinity to antiviral compounds. This resistance mechanism concerns GCV, CDV and FOS and may lead to multidrug resistance. B. Some mutations in pUL54 can increase the polymerase’s exonuclease activity. This causes enhanced recognition of incorporated GCV and CDV. As a result, these dNTP analogues are excised more efficiently.Major risk factors for HCMV drug resistance are the residual capacity of the host’s immune system to control viral replication and the overall amount and duration of viral replication.HCMV antiviral drug resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by genotypic drug resistance testing. Phenotypic resistance testing involves cultivation of the virus in cell culture and testing its susceptibility using different antiviral drug concentrations {{in order to determine}} EC50 values. In contrast, genotypic resistance testing means the detection of resistance associated mutations in UL97 and UL54 by sequencing. Genotypic resistance testing is becoming the method of choice because it is faster, but requires previous phenotypic characterisation of each newly found mutation. This can be performed via a web-based search tool that links a patient’s HCMV sequence to a database containing all published UL97 and UL54 mutations and corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes.|$|E

Thirty-seven samples were obtained. The median concentration of <b>foscarnet</b> in CSF was 80 mumol/liter (range, 0 to 500 mumol/liter). The CSF <b>foscarnet</b> concentration was greater than the 50 % inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and was equal to or greater than the 50 % inhibitory concentration for cytomegalovirus in most cases. The penetration of <b>foscarnet</b> into CSF, as expressed by the ratio of the concentration in CSF to the simultaneous concentration in plasma, ranged from 0 to 3. 4 (median, 0. 27) and was highly correlated with the presence of cells within CSF and the length of <b>foscarnet</b> therapy.

40|$|Therapy with <b>foscarnet</b> is {{associated}} with acute renal failure. Prior studies have emphasized foscarnet's proximal tubular toxicity, {{but there have been}} isolated reports of foscarnet-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. As a phosphate analog, <b>foscarnet</b> is a competitive inhibitor of NaPO 4 cotransport. However, foscarnet's effect on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) -induced transport has not been previously investigated. We studied foscarnet's modulation of transport in the toad urinary bladder. <b>Foscarnet</b> at 10 microM to 10 mM did not alter basal water or urea flux. Urea transport induced by a maximal dose of ADH (24 mIU/ml) was inhibited by 0. 1 to 5. 0 mM <b>foscarnet.</b> In tissues challenged with 0. 5 to 1. 0 mIU of ADH per ml, 1. 0 to 10 mM <b>foscarnet</b> increased water flow but did not alter urea flux. <b>Foscarnet</b> also increased water flow induced by 1. 0 to 10 microM forskolin. In tissues pretreated with 10 microM naproxen, <b>foscarnet</b> did not alter water flow induced by 0. 5 to 1. 0 mIU of ADH per ml or forskolin. These results indicate that <b>foscarnet</b> stimulates water flow induced by 0. 5 to 1. 0 mIU of ADH per ml at a site proximal to that of the generation of cyclic AMP and inhibits urea flux induced by a maximal dose of ADH at a separate site. In humans, <b>foscarnet</b> nephrotoxicity is likely not limited to the proximal nephron, but extends to the collecting duct.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of toxicity of <b>foscarnet</b> was studied by monitoring {{its effects on}} the cell cycle of exponentially growing, semisynchronous human embryo cells in culture. The effects of <b>foscarnet</b> on the cell cycle were dependent on the concentration of drug used. At 1 mM, cell division was reduced by 50 %, whereas the cell flow was mainly reduced in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle, leading {{to an increase in}} the proportion of G 2 +M cells. The minor reduction of thymidine incorporation in S phase cells provided additional evidence that 1 mM <b>foscarnet</b> did not specifically inhibit DNA synthesis. Cell division was greatly reduced at 2. 5 mM <b>foscarnet,</b> and the G 2 phase was markedly affected, whereas S cell flow was less reduced. S cell flow was 10 % per h and thymidine incorporation was 25 % that of control cells, while a block in the G 2 +M phase was evident. On the other hand, at a concentration of 5 mM <b>foscarnet,</b> the cell flow was greatly reduced in the G 1 and S phases, with less reduction of G 2 cell flow and cells accumulated in the S phase. The effects of <b>foscarnet</b> on the cell cycle were more pronounced with increasing times up to 72 h, which could not be explained by the slow penetration of <b>foscarnet</b> which required only 4 to 8 h to achieve constant levels. At 2. 5 and 5 mM <b>foscarnet,</b> there was the additional effect of the cell membranes becoming more leaky as a result of <b>foscarnet</b> toxicity which might contribute to the toxic effects of the drug at high concentrations. When <b>foscarnet</b> was removed from the medium, the effects on the cell cycle were rapidly reversed, in the time needed for <b>foscarnet</b> to diffuse out from the cells, which indicates the reversible nature of the toxic effects of <b>foscarnet...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (SLS) on the efficacies of topical gel formulations of <b>foscarnet</b> against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) cutaneous infection has been evaluated in mice. A single application of the gel formulation containing 3 % <b>foscarnet</b> given 24 h postinfection exerted only a modest effect {{on the development of}} herpetic skin lesions. Of prime interest, the addition of 5 % SLS to this gel formulation markedly reduced the mean lesion score. The improved efficacy of the <b>foscarnet</b> formulation containing SLS could be attributed to an increased penetration of the antiviral agent into the epidermis. In vitro, SLS decreased in a concentration-dependent manner the infectivities of herpesviruses for Vero cells. SLS also inhibited the HSV- 1 strain F-induced cytopathic effect. Combinations of <b>foscarnet</b> and SLS resulted in subsynergistic to subantagonistic effects, depending on the concentration used. <b>Foscarnet</b> in phosphate-buffered saline decreased in a dose-dependent manner the viability of cultured human skin fibroblasts. This toxic effect was markedly decreased when <b>foscarnet</b> was incorporated into the polymer matrix. The presence of SLS in the gel formulations did not alter the viabilities of these cells. The use of gel formulations containing <b>foscarnet</b> and SLS could represent an attractive approach to the treatment of herpetic mucocutaneous lesions, especially those caused by acyclovir-resistant strains...|$|E

40|$|<b>Foscarnet</b> (phosphonoformic acid) is a {{pyrophosphate}} analog that inhibits the {{replication of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) in vitro and in patients with AIDS. HIV- 1 resistance to <b>foscarnet</b> has not been reported despite long-term <b>foscarnet</b> therapy of AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus disease. We therefore attempted to select foscarnet-resistant HIV- 1 in vitro by serial endpoint passage of virus in 400 microM <b>foscarnet.</b> After 13 cycles of passage in MT- 2 cells, virus exhibiting > or = 8. 5 -fold <b>foscarnet</b> resistance was isolated. The reverse transcriptase (RT) from resistant virions exhibited a similar level of <b>foscarnet</b> resistance in enzyme inhibition assays (approximately 10 -fold resistance). Foscarnet-resistant virus showed increased susceptibility to 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (90 -fold) and to the HIV- 1 -specific RT inhibitors TIBO R 82150 (30 -fold) and nevirapine (20 -fold). DNA sequence analysis of RT clones from resistant virus revealed the coexistence of two mutations in all clones: Gln- 161 to Leu (CAA to CTA) and His- 208 to Tyr (CAT to TAT). Sequence analysis of six clinical HIV- 1 isolates showing reduced susceptibility to <b>foscarnet</b> revealed the Tyr- 208 mutation in two, the Leu- 161 mutation in one, and a Trp- 88 -to-Ser or -Gly mutation in four isolates.

40|$|AbstractFoscarnet {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} viral DNA polymerase inhibitor active in vitro and in vivo against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Strains of HIV- 1 resistant to <b>foscarnet</b> were selected by in vitro passage in increasing concentrations of drug. Reduced susceptibility to <b>foscarnet</b> was evident at the levels of both HIV- 1 replication and reverse transcriptase. Biologically cloned, foscarnet-resistant strains with distinct genotypes were hypersensitive to zidovudine, azidodeoxyuridine, nevirapine, and R 82913 but had unchanged susceptibility to zalcitibine and didanosine. The reverse transcriptase of foscarnet-resistant strains had unique substitutions Glu 89 -Lys, Leu 92 -Ile, or Ser 156 -Ala, the third being associated with six polymorphic changes. Introduction of these mutations into wild-type HIV- 1 by site-directed mutagenesis confirmed their role in <b>foscarnet</b> resistance. In the three-dimensional structure of the reverse transcriptase enzyme these amino acids are located close to the template strand of the template primer and {{far away from the}} putative pyrophosphate binding site, suggesting that the mechanism by which HIV- 1 becomes resistant to <b>foscarnet</b> is indirect. <b>Foscarnet</b> resistance is thus likely to be mediated through an altered interaction of the mutant enzyme with the template strand of the template primer which distorts the geometry of the polymerase active site and thereby decreases <b>foscarnet</b> binding...|$|E

40|$|<b>Foscarnet</b> (phosphonoformate) is {{a potent}} virustatic drug against herpes-like viruses and is widely used in the therapy of {{cytomegalovirus}} infections in immunosuppressed patients. To obtain data on its penetration across the blood-brain barrier, we determined concentrations of <b>foscarnet</b> in cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma specimens from 26 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (stages 2 to 6 by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research classification) after a single infusion of 90 mg of <b>foscarnet</b> per kg of body weight and at steady state by electrochemical detection by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

After a single infusion of <b>foscarnet,</b> levels in plasma ranged from 297 to 1, 775 micrograms/ml (990 to 5, 920 mumol/liter), with a mean of 766 +/- 400 micrograms/ml. Corresponding levels in cerebrospinal fluid were 57 to 225 micrograms/ml (190 to 750 mumol/liter), with a mean of 131 +/- 52 micrograms/ml. The penetration coefficient was 0. 05 to 0. 72 (mean, 0. 23 +/- 0. 16). At steady state, mean <b>foscarnet</b> levels in plasma were 464 +/- 219 micrograms/ml (1, 553 mumol/liter) and mean levels in cerebrospinal fluid were 308 +/- 155 micrograms/ml (1, 023 mumol/liter).
