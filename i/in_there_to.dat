However, one of the plant's owners, who did not know about Irgun's unauthorized use of his property, naively convinced them there was nothing <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> concern them.

Ferrari supplied the code immediately, but McLaren and Benetton only handed over the code after the FIA's deadline, {{for which they were}} fined $100,000.|$|E

500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I {{think at the end of}} the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> <b>to</b> just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E

500|$|Several of the {{characters}} are given [...] "I am" [...] songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am Going to Like It Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... put <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> get a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E

TVWeek viewed the album as [...] "a raw and revealing collection" [...] with [...] "themes of family, lost love and longing for home". Tianna Nadalin of the Geelong Advertiser wrote that it features Henderson's [...] "signature brand of melodic folk, buttery vocals and heartfelt lyrics." [...] In {{an interview with}} The Newcastle Herald, Henderson described the type of songs on Burnt Letters, saying: [...] "There are songs that are fragile and some are your typical heart-throb songs." [...] He further added, [...] "There are no throwaway songs <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> bulk it up. Every song I've written there has meaning behind it." ...|$|E

[...] Avey explains: [...] "The sad irony was that I went <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> find out the truth, so I could tell everybody about the horrors of the Nazi regime. But I was so traumatised at my whole experience of the Auschwitz camps it took me 60 years to be able to recount the horrors I saw." ...|$|E

2500|$|When casting for the film, Iliadis {{wanted to}} find actors who would not portray these {{characters}} in a stereotypical way. As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would not—they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete sense of commitment to that character without making it silly and not be afraid to go <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you got bad in you?' You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E
2500|$|Noel {{admits that}} certain {{lines from the}} song are lifted from John Lennon: [...] "I got this tape in the United States that had {{apparently}} been burgled from the Dakota Hotel and someone had found these cassettes. Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?" [...] Gallagher also admits that he was under the influence of illegal substances when he wrote the song and to this day he claims he does not know what it means.|$|E
