Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of <b>erbia</b> (Er2O3). [...] Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after Thule, an Ancient Greek place name associated with Scandinavia or Iceland. Thulium's atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{elements}} which were discovered {{as a consequence}} of the lengthy analysis and breakdown of the ore Gadolinite.

50|$|The {{principal}} commercial {{sources of}} erbium {{are from the}} minerals xenotime and euxenite, and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China; in consequence, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is {{about two-thirds of the}} total by weight, and <b>erbia</b> is about 4-5%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the <b>erbia</b> liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.|$|E

5000|$|Erbium (for Ytterby, {{a village}} in Sweden) was {{discovered}} by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843. Mosander was working {{with a sample of}} what was thought to be the single metal oxide yttria, derived from the mineral gadolinite. He discovered that the sample contained at least two metal oxides in addition to pure yttria, which he named [...] "erbia" [...] and [...] "terbia" [...] after the village of Ytterby where the gadolinite had been found. Mosander was not certain of the purity of the oxides and later tests confirmed his uncertainty. Not only did the [...] "yttria" [...] contain yttrium, erbium, and terbium; in the ensuing years, chemists, geologists and spectroscopists discovered five additional elements: ytterbium, scandium, thulium, holmium, and gadolinium. [...] <b>Erbia</b> and terbia, however, were confused at this time. A spectroscopist mistakenly switched the names of the two elements during spectroscopy. After 1860, terbia was renamed <b>erbia</b> and after 1877 what had been known as <b>erbia</b> was renamed terbia. Fairly pure Er2O3 was independently isolated in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. Reasonably pure metal wasn't produced until 1934 when Klemm and Bommer reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor. It was only in the 1990s that the price for Chinese-derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass.|$|E

50|$|A {{trivalent}} element, pure erbium metal is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet {{stable in}} air, {{and does not}} oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals. Its salts are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp absorption spectra bands in visible light, ultraviolet, and near infrared. Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its sesquioxide is called <b>erbia.</b> Erbium's properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present.

Throughout his life he paid great attention to the rare earths and the problem of separating and distinguishing them; in 1878 he extracted ytterbium from {{what was supposed to be}} pure <b>erbia,</b> and two years later found gadolinium and samarium in the samarskite earths.|$|E

5000|$|Later {{workers had}} {{difficulty}} in observing the minor colorless [...] "erbia," [...] but the soluble pink fraction {{was impossible to}} miss.

In the confusion, the original names got reversed, and the exchange of names stuck, so that the pink fraction referred eventually to the solution containing erbium (which in solution, is pink). It is now thought that workers using double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium into the ceria-containing precipitate. What is now known as terbium was only about 1% of the original yttria, but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the yttrium oxide. Thus, terbium was a minor component in the original fraction containing it, where it was dominated by its immediate neighbors, gadolinium and dysprosium.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the development of}} isothermal selective emitters for harvesting thermal energy {{to be used in}} conjunction with photovoltaic cells. The selective emitters were Erbium doped Titania nanofibers and Erbium and Yttrium doped Titania nanofibers that may be used with a Gallium Antimonide photovoltaic cell. The ultimate aim of this research was to develop Erbium doped Yttrium Titanate nanofibers. This research is of importance in recovering heat from a number of resources including power plant boilers. The thermal energy lost in the boilers can be as high as 20 % of the input fuel energy and a recovery of this energy would boost the thermal performance of the power plants. It has been observed that the temperatures of the flue gas reaching the heat recovery region may be higher than 1600 K and the radiation and convective losses in the burner occurs at even higher temperatures. Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) offer a solution in terms of converting the thermal energy to electricity without any moving parts. The efficiencies of conventional TPVs are very small (10 - 20 %) and thus not a solution as the primary electric generator. However, in the field of the harvesting of waste energy, TPVs have tremendous potential. In order to improve efficiencies, <b>Erbia</b> (which can absorb thermal energy and convert it to electromagnetic radiation with a narrow wavelength spectrum with mean wavelength of 1500 nm) {{can be used as a}} selective emitter with GaSb PV cells (which have its maximum efficiency in the same wavelength range) as the collector. In order to further improve its performance, the <b>Erbia</b> was proposed to be supported by Titania, which is transparent to IR in this range. However, past research has shown that the <b>Erbia</b> doped Titania nanofibers essentially have Erbium in the form of pyrochlore Erbium Titanate. Thus the research focused on a way to synthesize ErxY 2 -xTi 2 O 7 pyrochlore structure to act as the selective emitter. The self-supporting composite was designed to be nanostructured to ensure isothermal operation and a high surface to volume ratio to minimize re-adsorption and to have a compact design.

The electrical resistivity, hydrogen/deuterium permeation reduction property, liquid metal corrosion, radiation effects and deposition techniques are major areas of research on <b>erbia</b> coating. Though it is having a single stable phase of cubic structure up to 2300 °C, it is known to develop metastable monoclinic phase especially in sputter coating methods. We grow <b>erbia</b> by reactive magnetron sputter coating method and study the phase formation, electrical, microstructural and optical dielectric properties. The effects of erbium metal pre-layer deposition, post annealing in oxygen rich vacuum and oxygen to argon gas feed ratio are studied keeping other parameters constant. The film grows in mixed phase of cubic and monoclinic structures when erbium metal pre-layer is deposited on the P 91 steel substrate and in pure monoclinic phase in absence of the pre-layer. Post annealing seems to partially convert monoclinic into cubic phase in the mixed phase coating. Better crystallization and slightly more surface roughness is observed in the sample processed with higher oxygen to argon ratio. DC resistivity is found in 1015 Ω*cm range and it is marginally more in the sample processed with more oxygen. The spectroscopic ellipsometry on these films to obtain optical dielectric properties gives encouraging results in terms of close match of the thickness and roughness values with those obtained from SEM and AFM respectively. Systematic study of optical dielectric property suggests a trend consistent with DC resistivity...|$|E
