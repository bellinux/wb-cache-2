40|$|Background: The {{host species}} {{composition}} {{in a household}} and their relative availability affect the host-feeding choices of blood-sucking insects and parasite transmission risks. We investigated four hypotheses regarding factors that affect blood-feeding rates, proportion of human-fed bugs (<b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index),</b> and daily human-feeding rates of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease. Methods: A cross-sectional survey collected triatomines in human sleeping quarters (domiciles) of 49 of 270 rural houses in northwestern Argentina. We developed an improved way of estimating the human-feeding rate of domestic T. infestans populations. We fitted generalized linear mixed-effects models to a global model with six explanatory variables (chicken blood index, dog blood index, bug stage, numbers of human residents, bug abundance, and maximum temperature during the night preceding bug catch) and three response variables (daily blood-feeding rate, <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index,</b> and daily human-feeding rate).

Abundance of An. punctulatus and An. koliensis decreased with distance from the main waterway and probably from a sago swamp forest at 6 villages in North Wosera. Abundance of An. punctulatus was associated negatively with those of An. farauti s. l., An. longirostris, and An. bancroftii. The latter 3 species also had relatively low ratios of indoor-to-outdoor biting rates, and earlier biting times than An. punctulatus. <b>Human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>indices</b> of at least 0. 79 were observed for all species except An. bancroftii.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{coverage}} of personal protection measures that kill mosquitoes dramatically reduce malaria transmission where vector populations depend upon human blood. However, most primary malaria vectors outside of sub-Saharan Africa {{can be classified}} as "very zoophagic," meaning they feed occasionally (< 10 % of blood meals) upon humans, so personal protection interventions have negligible impact upon their survival. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We extended a published malaria transmission model {{to examine the relationship}} between transmission, control, and the baseline proportion of bloodmeals obtained from humans (<b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index).</b> The lower limit of the <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index</b> enables derivation of simplified models for zoophagic vectors that (1) Rely on only three field-measurable parameters. (2) Predict immediate and delayed (with and without assuming reduced human infectivity, respectively) impacts of personal protection measures upon transmission. (3) Illustrate how appreciable indirect communal-level protection for non-users can be accrued through direct personal protection of users. (4) Suggest the coverage and efficacy thresholds required to attain epidemiological impact. The findings suggest that immediate, indirect, community-wide protection of users and non-users alike may linearly relate to the efficacy of a user's direct personal protection, regardless of whether that is achieved by killing or repelling mosquitoes. High protective coverage and efficacy (≥ 80 %) are important to achieve epidemiologically meaningful impact. Non-users are indirectly protected because the two most common species of human malaria are strict anthroponoses. Therefore, the small proportion of mosquitoes that are killed or diverted while attacking humans can represent a large proportion of those actually transmitting malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Simplified models of malaria transmission by very zoophagic vectors may be used by control practitioners to predict intervention impact interventions using three field-measurable parameters; the proportion of human exposure to mosquitoes occurring when an intervention can be practically used, its protective efficacy when used, and the proportion of people using it...|$|E
40|$|Anopheles darlingi, {{the main}} malaria vector in the Neotropics, has been {{considered}} to be highly anthropophilic. However, many behavioral aspects of this species remain unknown, such as the range of blood-meal sources. Barrier screens were used to collect resting Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes from 2013 to 2015 in three riverine localities (Lupuna, Cahuide and Santa Emilia) in Amazonian Peru. Overall, the <b>Human</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>Index</b> (HBI) ranged from 0. 58 - 0. 87, with no significant variation among years or sites. Blood-meal analysis revealed that humans {{are the most common}} blood source, followed by avian hosts (Galliformes-chickens and turkeys), and human/Galliforme mixed-meals. The Forage Ratio and Selection Index both show a strong preference for Galliformes over humans in blood-fed mosquitoes. Our data show that 30 % of An. darlingi fed on more than one host, including combinations of dogs, pigs, goats and rats. There appears to be a pattern of host choice in An. darlingi, with varying proportions of mosquitoes feeding only on humans, only on Galliformes and some taking mixed-meals of blood (human plus Galliforme), which was detected in the three sites in different years, indicating {{that there could be a}} structure to these populations based on blood-feeding preferences. Mosquito age, estimated in two localities, Lupuna and Cahuide, ranged widely between sites and years.

This paper describes {{the development of a}} radioimmunoassay for FPB and the use of both assays in the demonstration of distinctive patterns of cleavage of the amino terminal ends of the A (alha) and B (beta) chains of fibrinogen by various enzymes. Antisera were raised in rabbits to a synthetic analogue of FPB coupled to bovine serum albumin. FPB analogue was couple to desaminotyrosine and radiolabeled with 125 I by the chloramine-T technique. The radiolabeled peptide was bound by the antiserum, and binding was inhibited by synthetic or native FPB. Unbound tracer was separated from bound tracer by charcoal adsorption. The senistivity of the assay was such that 50 % inhibition of binding of the tracer was caused by 1. 25 ng of the native FPB. Fibrinogen was treated with thrombin, plasmin, trypsin, Reptilase, and an extract of the venom from Ancistrodon contortrix contortrix (ACC). After ethanol precipitation and centrifugation, dialysates of enzymatically altered fibrinogen were assayed for FPA and FPB. The action of thrombin on fibrinogen resulted in a rapid release of FPA and a slower release of FPB. Plasmin cleaved a segment(s) of the B (beta) chain which included FPB but cleaved no detectable FPA-containing material for the first 2 h of incubation. In the case of plasmin-treated fibrinogen, the dialysates had been further treated with thrombin before being assayed for FPA and FPB. Trypsin rapidly cleaved both peptides, the B before the A.

40|$|Abstract. Malaria in {{migrant workers}} {{is always a}} major problem to control due to their {{temporary}} stay in shelters, and other operational constraints. Hence, a study was undertaken in brick kilns in Bharuch district, Gujarat state, India to study the problem of malaria in the work force. Mass blood surveys were carried out in 15 brick kilns. Blood slides were collected from both febrile and afebrile cases. Positive cases were treated as per the national drug policy and were followed up. Mosquito collections were carried out by pyrethrum spray collection in early morning hours. <b>Human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index</b> and sporozoite rates were determined as per standard procedures. All age groups were found affected with malaria at brick kilns. Prevalence of malaria was significantly higher in 50 % in migrant population. In stable population in villages, overall decline in malaria cases was observed in 2008 - 2010. The sporozoite rate of 4. 2 % in Anopheles culicifacies indicates active malaria transmission at brick kilns. The investigation demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{trial of}} the efficacy of indoor spraying with malathion on morbidity and mortality in refugee camps in eastern Sudan was conducted {{during the rainy season}} of 1997. The interior walls of houses from a randomly selected group of five camps were sprayed with malathion in mid-September and morbidity and mortality rates in the camps for the months October to December compared with rates in five controls. Pyrethrum spray collection and human landing catches were performed in two collection rounds. An exophagic but endophilic population of Anopheles arabiensis was the most common mosquito collected. The mean <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index</b> of 242 mosquitoes from eight camps was 0. 51. Only two of 1040 mosquitoes examined harboured sporozoites. Blood samples of 83 putative malaria patients were examined for parasites by PCR. Mortality rates in the 3 months following spraying were significantly lower in sprayed camps although differences in clinical malaria incidence between sprayed and non-sprayed camps were not significant.

40|$|A {{synoptic}} view is given {{of the data}} amassed by WHO, with technical assistance from the Imperial College of Science and Technology, {{on the origins of}} blood-meals in Anopheles samples collected from 1971 to 1978. Attention is focused on the proportion of each sample found to contain human blood and on the problems of interpreting from this the <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index</b> or degree of biting-contact with man exhibited by vector populations. The difficulties of overcoming bias in sampling, which are formidable in unsprayed areas, are further compounded where the dwellings are treated with a slow-acting residual insecticide which knocks down many engorged mosquitoes before they can be collected from their daytime resting places. There is evidence to suggest that the host-selection patterns of those vectors which are ‘opportunistic' feeders may be heavily influenced, even from village to village or from month to month, by the changing availability of alternative hosts, particularly cattle. This suggests in turn that the possibilities of manipulating the degree of mosquito-man contact by encouraging deflection to animals (zooprophylaxis) or by measures to afford a degree of personal protection should not be under-estimated by malaria strategists. It may sometimes be found less difficult to reduce the vector's <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> <b>index</b> than it is to measure it, but in view of the epidemiological importance of this parameter, suggestions are put forward for improving entomological field practice in this area. They include a quantitative survey of the biotopes available to the mosquito population as diurnal shelters, a longitudinal survey of the densities of blood-fed females per biotope, and a survey of the numbers and the respective distribution of people and domestic animals available as hosts. The work-load entailed by such a thorough form of investigation, to be repeated where necessary at different seasons of the year, underlines the necessity to concentrate efforts on a small number of localities, carefully chosen for the malaria situations they represent and the vector populations they support. A large-scale blood-meal sampling programme, confined to these selected localities, is most likely in our estimation to yield information of value for controlling malaria vector...|$|E
40|$|Following Fibrin Plate Method of SZOLLOSY and RENGEI², and ASTRUP and MULLERTZ³, {{the author}} {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments in an attempt to identify <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> by detecting the proactivator believed {{to be one of the}} enzyme proteins contained abundantly in <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> As the results it has been found that with 0. 1 mg. % SK-solution <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> alone responds to the reaction, showing almost absolute species-specificity within 4 hours but not with blood of monkey. In addition, the sensitivity is so high that it responds positively up to the dilution of 1 : 8, 000 to 1 : 10, 000 (human blood: physiological saline solution). By means of this method using 0. 1 mg% SK-solution it has been clearly demonstated that the identification of <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> is possible in a variety of conditions and states as may be encountered in practical legal medicine such as with blood stains in cloth, wood, stone, leaves of tree even with a trace of <b>blood</b> stain, old <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> stain left standing for 20 to 30 years, old blood mixed with iron rust, blood stains soaked in various oils, and even the blood stained cloth washed thoroughly and left standing in room temperature for 6 months.
