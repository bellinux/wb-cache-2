Peugeot's choice of a closed cockpit is possibly intended to allow the 908 to run a larger air restrictor due to rules mandating the use of air conditioning on closed cockpit designs.Peugeot also felt that weight, centre of gravity, and operational drawbacks were able to be overcome by better chassis rigidity and aerodynamics with using a closed cockpit design. The cockpit uses a unique 2 part door system with {{the upper part of}} the door (the window) swinging forward and out with a <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> (part of the sidepod) forming the lower part of the door that can be either swung out or removed completely, this was reportedly done to allow the car to conform to current regulations regarding door size. The body is a carbon fibre monocoque instead of a conventional open structure to offer better rigidity and lower weight. Front and rear suspension are linked, steering is electrically powered, magnesium wheels come from BBS. The car measures 4.65 m ×2 m and weighs 925 kg minimum.

40|$|AbstractFourth order <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> type {{problems}} are usually solved via {{a system of}} two second order equations. For smooth domains such an approach can be justified. However, when the domain has a concave corner the bi-Laplace problem with Navier boundary conditions may have {{two different types of}} solutions, namely u 1 with u 1,Δu 1 ∈H˚ 1 and u 2 ∈H 2 ∩H˚ 1. We will compare these two solutions. A striking difference is that in general only the first solution, obtained by decoupling into a system, preserves positivity, that is, a positive source implies that the solution is positive. The other type of solution is more relevant {{in the context of the}} <b>hinged</b> <b>plate.</b> We will also address the higher-dimensional case. Our main analytical tools will be the weighted Sobolev spaces that originate from Kondratiev. In two dimensions we will show an alternative that uses conformal transformation.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the study of the Kirchhoff-Love model for thin, transversally loaded plates with corner {{singularities}} on the boundary. The former consists in finding a real valued function u, defined in a bounded, planar set. The latter represents the shape of the plate and u(x) its vertical deflection at the point x. This makes sense since we are in the framework of linear elasticity, that is, the model assumes that no horizontal deformation takes place. The function u is found as the minimizer of the Kirchhoff energy functional in different subsets of a suitable Sobolev space, incorporating the boundary conditions. One can distinguish the following cases: (i) clamped: the function u and its exterior normal derivative are assumed to be zero on the boundary of the plate, (ii) hinged: we assume only u= 0 on the boundary and (iii) supported: u is assumed nonnegative on the boundary. A <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> will additionally satisfy a set of natural boundary conditions, whereas a solution in the supported case will exist only if we assume that the load f pushes the plate down effectively; in that case a set of natural boundary conditions will be again fulfilled. It is however common within the mathematical and engineering literature to confuse the hinged and supported plates. This originates from the expectation that when pressed down, a supported plate, like a supported beam, will have a zero deflection on the boundary. Here we prove the contrary: If the domain has a corner, then a <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> cannot be in general a minimizer of the energy functional if we allow variations with positive boundary values. Moreover, we illustrate that a <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> with a sufficiently smooth boundary satisfies a comparison principle. In the last chapter we consider the problem of decoupling a clamped plate into a system of second order equations. This approach is very important for numerical procedures, since one can then use standard piecewise linear elements. We show that such a decomposition yields the correct solutions only if the domain has convex corners; when a concave corner is present then the system has no solution...|$|E

40|$|Usually {{multiple}} MEMS or IC {{devices are}} fabricated on a single silicon wafer. Manually separating the components from each other involves scribing and fracturing the silicon. This thesis presents a design for a tool to aid in controlling the fracturing process. An earlier prototype of this tool was examined and new functional requirements were described. One of the functional requirements is that the tool cannot touch {{the top of the}} wafer because the top might have delicate components. The wafer breaker was designed to hold the wafer on two plates, where one of them is hinged. The wafer is scribed above the hinge line, and the <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> is pushed down to fracture the wafer. Several methods of holding the wafer down with vacuum were investigated. Bench level prototypes were constructed to test the feasibility of the methods. The prototype with a grid of pockets and flow restrictors performed the best. Even when the wafer only partially covered the grid, the covered pockets maintained a high vacuum. A clamped flexure was used as the hinge for the tool. The instant center of the hinge was calculated for small deflections, and was aligned with a scribe guide. This forces the scribed notch to be directly above the hinge line. A prototype wafer breaker was constructed and tested. The prototype worked, but in many cases where the (111) silicon plane was not parallel or orthogonal to the scribe line, the crack line would leave the scribe line and follow the crystal plane. This problem would also be encountered by those manually breaking wafers. by Kabir James Mukaddam. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2005.

40|$|Concrete and asphalt are {{the most}} common {{materials}} used in permanent roadway pavements. Roadways are also constructed for temporary use in the resource industry, for remote site construction, and for disaster relief. Although temporary roads have been used for almost as long as permanent ones, little research has been done to optimize their design in view of their relatively short service lives or to investigate the advantages of constructing them with reusable materials or employing structural systems that require minimal subgrade preparation. With this in mind, {{the purpose of this study}} is to conduct research to determine the feasibility of a reusable, modular road plate system requiring minimal preparation of the subgrade. This thesis presents a literature review, summarizing the currently available products that perform a similar function and the methods currently available to design such products, including terramechanics and foundation design. Alternative concept designs for a modular road plate system are then introduced. Following this, a simple structural steel plate system is designed to resist vertical, traffic-induced loads using several methods. Specifically, an equivalent thickness method and finite element (FE) analysis are employed. Different loading conditions, soil conditions, and plate assemblies (i. e. boundary conditions) are compared. The different loading conditions include: single and multi-wheel loading, and centre versus edge loading of the plate. The different modelled plate assemblies include: single plates, four plates assembled with fixed connections, and four plates assembled with hinged connections. Structural steel plates are considered in the FE analysis study, in order to develop the design methodology, prior to applying it to the other materials or structural systems. Soil properties and panel thicknesses are studied covering a broad range of conditions under which temporary roadways may be built. Thirty scenarios are created from five soil types and six panel thicknesses. With the different loading and boundary conditions investigated, a total of 120 scenarios are analyzed in total, using several different FE models. The results from the FE analysis studies show that there is a significant difference between hinged and fixed connected panels, and that these different boundary conditions can be considered by modelling a single plate that is centre loaded (to represent a multi-plate system with fixed plate connections) or a single plate that is edge loaded (to represent a multi-plate system with <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> connections). The results of this research in general provide a practical framework for developing a modular road plate system constructed using any material or structural system under a range of soil and loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety issue}} has been raised with regards to {{potential}} molten metal detachments from the weld pool and cold filler wire during electron beam welding in space. This investigation was undertaken to evaluate if molten metal could detach and {{come in contact with}} astronauts and burn through the fabric of the astronauts' Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) during electron beam welding in space. Molten metal detachments from either the weld/cut substrate or weld wire could present harm to a astronaut if the detachment was to burn through the fabric of the EMU. Theoretical models were developed to predict the possibility and size of the molten metal detachment hazards during the electron beam welding exercises at Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The primary molten metal detachment concerns were those cases of molten metal separation from the metal surface due to metal cutting, weld pool splashing, entrainment and release of molten metal due to filler wire snap-out from the weld puddle, and molten metal accumulation and release {{from the end of the}} weld wire. Some possible ways of obtaining molten metal drop detachments would include an impulse force, or bump, to the weld sample, cut surface, or filler wire. Theoretical models were developed for these detachment concerns from principles of impact and kinetic energies, surface tension, drop geometry, surface energies, and particle dynamics. The surface tension represents the force opposing the liquid metal drop from detaching whereas the weight of the liquid metal droplet represents a force that is tending to detach the molten metal drop. Theoretical calculations have indicated that only a small amount of energy is required to detach a liquid metal drop; however, much of the energy of an impact is absorbed in the sample or weld plate before it reaches the metal drop on the cut edge or surface. The tendency for detachment is directly proportional to the weld pool radius and metal density and inversely proportional to the surface tension of the liquid metal. For a detachment the initial kinetic energy of the weld pool with respect to the plate has to exceed the energy to form the extra surface required for the detachment of the pool. The difficulty is in transferring the energy from the point of impact through the plate and sample to the cut edge. It is likely that not all of the kinetic energy is available for detaching the pool; some may be sequestered in weld pool oscillations. The coefficient of restitution for the collision will be lower than one if irreversible deformation, for example plastic flow deformation, takes place during the collision. Thus determining the amount of energy from an impact that actually reaches the molten metal droplet is critical. Various molten metal detachment scenarios were tested experimentally in an enclosed vacuum chamber using the Ukrainian Universal Hand Tool, an electron beam welder designed for space welding. The experimental testing was performed in a 4 ft. X 4 ft. vacuum chamber at Marshall Space Flight Center, evacuated to vacuum levels of at least 50 microTorr, and also some welding garment material was utilized to observe the effect of the molten metal detachments on the material. A "carillon" apparatus consisting of four pendulum hammer strikers, each weighing approximately 3. 65 lbs, raised to predetermined specific heights was used to apply an impact force to the weld sample/plate during electron beam welding and cutting exercises. The strikers were released by switching on an electric motor to rotate a pin holding wires retaining the strikers at desired heights. The specimens were suspended so as to be free to respond to the blows with a sudden velocity increment. The specimens were mounted on a <b>hinged</b> <b>plate</b> for minimizing effective mass with the option to fasten it down so as to raise its effective mass closer to that anticipated for an actual space welding scenario. Measurements were made of the impact energy and the horizontal fling distances of the detached metal drops. It was not particularly easy to generate the detachments for this experiment. This document presents the details of the theoretical modeling effort and a summary of the experimental effort to measure molten metal drop detachments from terrestrial electron beam welding in the enclosed vacuum chamber. The results of the experimental effort have shown that molten metal detachments can occur from the sample/weld plate only if a sufficiently large impact force is applied to the weld plate. A "weld pool detachment parameter" was determined to indicate whether detachment would occur. Detachment can be either full or partial (dripping), Partial detachment means that the weld pool detached from one side of the liquid-solid boundary so as to leave a hole at the puddle site but remained attached over part of the liquid-solid boundary and dripped down the plate with no fully detached material detected. Full detachment, however, does not necessarily mean that the whole pool fully detached; in some cases only a smaller portion of the pool detached, the remainder dripping down the plate. The weld pool detachment parameter according to theory and according to the empirical data allows a determination of whether full detachments might occur. Theoretical calculations indicated titanium alloy would be the most difficult from which to detach molten metal droplets followed by stainless steel and then by aluminum. The experimental results were for the most part consistent with the theoretical analysis and predictions. The above theory is applicable to other situations as desired for assessing the potential for molten metal detachments...|$|E
