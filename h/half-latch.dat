40|$|Abstract—Dual-supply voltage design using a {{clustered}} voltage scaling (CVS) {{scheme is}} an effective approach to reduce chip power. The optimal CVS design relies on a level converter implemented in a flip-flop to minimize energy, delay, and area penalties due to level conversion. Additionally, circuit robustness against supply bounce is a key property that differentiates good level converter design. Novel flip-flops {{presented in this paper}} incorporate a <b>half-latch</b> level converter and a precharged level converter. These flip-flops are optimized in the energy-delay design space to achieve over 30 % reduction of energy-delay product and about 10 % savings of total power in a CVS design as compared to the conventional flip-flop. These benefits are accompanied by 24 % flip-flop robustness improvement leading to 13 % delay spread reduction in a CVS critical path. The proposed flip-flops also show 18 % layout area reduction. Advantages of level conversion in a flip-flop over asynchronous level conversion in combinational logic are also discussed in terms of delay penalty and its sensitivity to supply bounce.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} novel {{methods of}} exploiting the partial, dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of Xilinx Virtex V 1000 FPGAs to manage single-event upset (SEU) faults due to radiation in space environments. The on-orbit fault detection scheme uses radiation-hardened reconfiguration controllers to continuously monitor the configuration bitstreams of 9 Virtex FPGAs and to correct errors by partial, dynamic reconfiguration of the FPGAs while {{they continue to}} execute. To study the SEU impact on our signal processing applications, we use a novel fault injection technique to corrupt configuration bits, thereby simulating SEU faults. By using dynamic reconfiguration, we can run the corrupted designs directly on the FPGA hardware, giving many orders of magnitude speed-up over purely software techniques. The fault injection method has been validated against proton beam testing, showing 97. 6 % agreement. Our work highlights the benefits of dynamic reconfiguration for space-based reconfigurable computing. Index Terms — radiation effects, SEUs, FPGAs, proton accelerator, <b>half-latches.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based {{compression}} techniques play {{an important}} role in today's digital applications such as high definition television (HDTV) and teleconferencing which require high speed transmission of digital video signals. In this thesis, a high-performance VLSI implementation of a DSP chip which computes the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform and its inverse (2 -D DCT/IDCT) is presented. The chip is based on the fully-pipelined time recursive IIR structure and employs a highly modular and hierarchical design strategy. Architectural model simulations are performed for determining system parameters required to achieve a high-speed and high-performance implementation. Based on these simulations, ROM and internal bus precision are chosen to ensure a minimum PSNR of 40 dB which is required for most digital imaging applications. High speed design is obtained by using distributed arithmetic to achieve fast multiplication through table lookups. A two-phase nonoverlapping clock is employed to perform computations in both phases, resulting in twice the throughput. Various submodules like ROM lookup tables. adders, <b>half-latches,</b> delay-units and multiplexors are implemented. Timing simulations of critical path modules indicate a clock frequency of 50 MHz corresponding to a data rate of 400 Mb/s. The chip dimensions are 24550 l x 27094 l and its area is 240 mm 2. The chip has been submitted for fabrication in 1. 2 CMOS N-well double-metal single-poly technology...|$|R
