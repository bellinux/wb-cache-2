40|$|Data of the {{physical}} and chemical properties of soils from three vineyards located in Vale dos Vinhedos, Bento Gonc &# 807;alves, Rio Grande do Sul state, in southern Brazil, were processed. Soil mapping was performed by means of four profiles and the digital elevation model in detailed scale. Then, superficial soils (0 ? 20 cm) were sampled according to a grid pattern. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), kriging, and unsupervised classification methods were applied on physical and chemical data of superficial soils sampled according to grid pattern. This study aimed to compare both methods, the conventional soil mapping and the map produced with superficial soil sampling, about their potential for definition of the management zones, as an approach for precision agriculture. Maps elaborated by conventional soil mapping overlapped partially with the maps derived from superficial sampling, probably due to the specific methodological differences of each case. Anyway, both methods are complementary because of the focus on vertical variability and horizontal variability, respectively. In that sense, slope appears as significant <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameter,</b> due to its control on water circulation in the profile of soil. 201...|$|E
40|$|Patterns of {{variation}} in plant and animal diversity along precipitation gradients have been extensively studied, but much less is known about how {{and to what extent}} precipitation affects the biogeographic distribution of microbial diversity in arid areas across large spatial scales. Here we collected soils from 54 sites along a 3700 km transect covering a wide range of grassland ecosystems with distinct aridity gradients. We quantified the bacterial community diversity and the effects of climate, <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameter</b> and geographic distance on the bacterial community structure using high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 35 phyla detected, 6 were dominant: Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes. Aridity was a major factor influencing bacterial diversity, community composition and taxon abundance. Although the pattern of bacterial species richness is markedly different from that of plant species richness, most soil bacteria were endemic to particular bioregions like macro-organisms. Community similarity significantly declined with environmental distance and geographic distance (r = - 0. 579 and - 0. 773, respectively). Geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (36. 02 %) than combined environmental factors (24. 06 %). Overall, our results showed that geographic distance and climatic factors concurrently govern bacterial biogeographic patterns in arid and semi-arid grassland...|$|E

These types of soils are notably characterised by low nutrient content and high heavy metal concentrations. Ultramafic outcrops harbour diverse vegetation types and remarkable plant diversity. In this study, we aimed to assess soil bacterial and fungal diversity in New Caledonian ultramafic substrates and to determine whether floristic composition, <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> and geographical factors affect this microbial diversity. Therefore, four plant formation types at two distinct sites were studied. These formations represent different stages in a potential chronosequence. Soil cores, according to a given sampling procedure, were collected to assess microbial diversity using a metagenomic approach, and to characterise the physico-chemical parameters. A botanical inventory was also performed. Our results indicated that microbial richness, composition and abundance were linked to the plant cover type and the dominant plant species. Furthermore, a large proportion of Ascomycota phylum (fungi), mostly in non-rainforest formations, and Planctomycetes phylum (bacteria) in all formations were observed. Interestingly, such patterns could be indicators of past disturbances that occurred on different time scales. Furthermore, the bacteria and fungi were influenced by diverse <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> {{as well as by the}} interplay between these two soil communities. Another striking finding was the existence of a site effect. Differences in microbial communities between geographical locations may be explained by dispersal limitation in the context of the biogeographical island theory. In conclusion, each plant formation at each site possesses is own microbial community resulting from multiple interactions between abiotic and biotic factors. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the underlying environmental factors contributing to the floristic composition of Banksia woodlands should improve the effective management of Banksia woodland communities of the Swan Coastal Plain. Although {{a number of studies}} have examined the vegetation on the Banksia woodlands on detail there have been few studies aimed at identifying the specific environmental parameters influencing the floristic gradients on the Swan Coastal Plain. A comprehensive local scale study was undertaken on the northern Swan Coastal Plain to determine the environmental correlates influencing floristic communities in an area of Banks/a woodland known as the Wallingup Plain. Vegetation communities of the Wallingup Plain were defined on the basis of their floristic composition and it was found that these communities varied markedly between upland and dampland areas. Floristic differences between all communities on the Wallingup Plain were found to be related to a combination of geomorphic and <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters.</b> In comparison, upland communities and floristic gradients were delineated largely by geomorphic and geographic factors, whilst dampland communities were determined by <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters,</b> particularly soil moisture and nutrient levels.

40|$|International audienceSoil and climatic {{conditions}} {{as well as}} land cover and land management {{have been shown to}} strongly impact the structure and diversity of the soil bacterial communities. Here, we addressed under a same land cover the potential effect of the <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> on the soil bacterial communities, excluding potential confounding factors as climate. To do this, we characterized two natural soil sequences occurring in the Montiers experimental site. Spatially distant soil samples were collected below Fagus sylvatica tree stands to assess the effect of soil sequences on the <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters,</b> as well as the structure and diversity of the bacterial communities. Soil analyses revealed that the two soil sequences were characterized by higher pH and calcium and magnesium contents in the lower plots. Metabolic assays based on Biolog Ecoplates highlighted higher intensity and richness in usable carbon substrates in the lower plots than in the middle and upper plots, although no significant differences occurred in the abundance of bacterial and fungal communities along the soil sequences as assessed using quantitative PCR. Pyrosequencing analysis of 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons revealed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundantly represented phyla. Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria and Chlamydiae were significantly enriched in the most acidic and nutrient-poor soils compared to the Bacteroidetes, which were significantly enriched in the soils presenting the higher pH and nutrient contents. Interestingly, aluminium, nitrogen, calcium, nutrient availability and pH appeared to be the best predictors of the bacterial community structures along the soil sequences...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}} - In Katanga (D. R. Congo), {{outcrops}} of bedrocks naturally enriched in Cu and Co ("copper hills"), host unique plant communities. The spatial variation of vegetation {{has long been}} attributed almost exclusively to variation in Cu concentration in the soil, but this assumption has not been experimentally tested. We analysed the variation in plant communities and the niches of selected species in relation to edaphic factors within a copper hill. Methods - Forty-eight 1 m 2 plots were sampled for plant community and soil mineral element composition, and classifed with Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) using the Bray-Curtis distance. Plant-edaphic relationships were examined using a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Species niches were modelled with Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Mean edaphic factors between the soil of plant communities were compared with one-way Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA. Key results - The diversity of communities at the site scale was higher than observed in previous studies at a larger scale. Cu was the most discriminating edaphic factor of plant communities. However, detailed comparisons of mean edaphic factors among communities revealed individual combinations of <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> for each community, as well as differences in soil Cu content. High covariation {{appears to be an}} essential trait of the edaphic factor variation of Katangan Cu-rich soils. This makes it diffcult to examine separately the effect of these factors on plant community structures. A bimodal pattern of niche distribution was found for Cu and pH. For physical parameters, niche optima were normally distributed. Conclusions - Global variation in edaphic factors associated with variation in combinations of <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> generates a highly heterogeneous environment favourable to a high diversity of plant communities over limited areas. Conservation strategies or restoration actions to limit the impact of mining activities on Cu-enriched ecosystems should pay special attention to recreate heterogeneity, taking into account the covariation of edaphic factors. © 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.

40|$|Abstract. Saltmarshes on peat {{substrate}} {{are common}} {{along the western}} Atlantic coast of Ireland. The peat which underlies these marshes was formed under freshwater conditions in post glacial times, after which these systems were subjected to a marine transgression. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the relationship between edaphic factors, substrate type and saltmarsh vegetation, specifically investigating the role of edaphic factors in determining the distribution of saltmarsh species Atriplex portulacoides in Ireland. <b>Edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> measured for each substrate included pH, moisture content, ammonium and nitrate. The peat was found to differ markedly from other substrates. Using canonical correspondence analysis it was found that pH and ammonium were the major drivers in influencing saltmarsh vegetation on peat substrate. Under both in situ and ex situ conditions Atriplex portulacoides showed an affinity for drier substrate and its absence from fringe marshes in Ireland is likely due to a combination of both biotic and abiotic factors, including intolerance to high soil moisture levels...|$|R

To learn more about this relationship we used methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) as model organisms and performed soil microcosm experiments comprised of identical soil substrates, hosting distinct overall microbial diversities (i. e., full, reduced and zero total microbial and MOB diversities). After inoculation with undisturbed soil, the recovery of MOB activity, MOB diversity and total bacterial diversity were followed over 3 months by methane oxidation potential measurements and analyses targeting pmoA and 16 S rRNA genes. Measurement of methane oxidation potential demonstrated different recovery rates across the different treatments. Despite different starting microbial diversities, the recovery and succession of the MOB communities followed a similar pattern across the different treatment microcosms. In this study we found that <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> were the dominant factor shaping microbial communities over time and that the starting microbial community played only a minor role in shaping MOB microbial communit...|$|R

Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sets showed that each dune zone presented a unique phylogenetic profile, suggesting a high degree of environmental selection. The combined results strongly infer that habitat filtering is an important factor shaping Namib Desert dune bacterial communities, with habitat stability, soil texture and mineral and nutrient contents being the main environmental drivers of bacterial community structures.

Two distinct sites were studied: a more-flooded (low marsh) and a less-flooded zone (high marsh). AM root colonization, AM fungal spore number and inoculum potential, soil <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> and tidal flooding time periods were analysed.

Fungal diversity was very low, with Glomus geosporum dominant at both marsh zones. Colonization showed no spatial variation within marsh zones but temporal variation was observed in the high marsh, dependent on plant phenological phases. In the low marsh, no significantly seasonal variation was observed. Apparently, plant phenological events were diluted by stressful conditions (e. g. flooding, salinity).

The method adopted in this study consists in OMW storage and progressive supply in weekly small doses. In field experiment, results of three years application of crude OMW at relatively high dose (150 m 3 ha - 1 year - 1) reveal no important perturbations as regard to <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> notably salinity, pH and phenolic content, thus asserting OMW biodegradation in the studied calcareous soil. Besides, plants growth was efficiently raised by OMW inputs. Significant amelioration was obtained notably in term of shoots weight, trunk height and crown circumference (145, 40 and 32 %, respectively). In addition, date palm cellular detoxifying capacities were also evidenced by pots trials. Quantitative and qualitative accumulation of phenolics and their oxidation provide evidence of their protective role against the physiological stress induced by OMW. These results highlight the importance of OMW storage and amendment fractioning for toxicity mitigation.

Good adaptation of Pinus pinaster was observed in soils developed over biotitic schist, granitic rocks, gneiss and migmatites, in which growth of the species was highest. Foliar Ca and K, soil depth and average annual temperature explained around 52 % of the variability in site index. Needle length, width and thickness were closely related to climate conditions, year of formation and also foliar concentrations of N and Mg. Foliage biomass and leaf area index were negatively correlated with needle age and positively correlated with site index and foliar nutrients. In the soil over biotitic schist, the concentrations of oxalate and pyrophosphate Al were higher than in other soils and tended to form highly stable organic–aluminium complexes.

This study investigates the edaphic bacterial communities of three contrasting desert terrain types (gravel plains, sand dunes and ephemeral rivers) with different surface geologies in the Central Namib Desert. For each site, we evaluated surface soil physicochemistries and used explorative T-RFLP methodology to get an indication of bacterial community diversities. While grain size was an important parameter in separating the three terrain types physicochemically and specific surface soil types could be distinguished, the desert edaphic bacterial communities displayed a high level of local spatial heterogeneity. Ten variables contributed significantly (P < 0. 05) to the variance in the T-RFLP data sets: fine silt, medium and fine sand content, pH, S, Na, Zn, Al, V and Fe concentrations, and 40 % of the total variance could be explained by these constraining variables.

Global means of carbon stock (78. 0 ± 64. 5 tC. ha- 1) and sequestration (2. 9 ± 2. 2 tC. ha- 1. yr- 1) showed that mangroves are among the forest ecosystems with greater capacity of carbon storage in AGB per area. On the global scale, carbon stock increases toward the equator (R²= 0. 22) and is dependent on 13 climatic parameters, which can be integrated in the following predictive equation: Carbon Stock in AGB = - 16. 342 + (8. 341 x Isothermality) + (0. 021 x Annual Precipitation) [R²= 0. 34; p < 0. 05].

The present study determined whether soil chemical properties affect spatial distribution and abundance of alpine plants in an altitudinal gradient in the Andes of central Chile, emphasizing metal content. A direct gradient analysis took place at Yerba Loca Natural Sanctuary (YLNS), based on a geobotanical sampling conducted in 73 sites distributed from 1970 to 3330 m a. s. l.

In addition, with the more detailed subsystems, cAMP signaling in bacteria (3. 24 ± 0. 27 % of the annotated reads) and the Ton and Tol transport systems (1. 69 ± 0. 11 %) were relatively highly represented. The most highly represented genome from the database was that for a Bradyrhizobium species. The metagenomic variance created by integrating natural and methodological fluctuations represents a global picture of the Rothamsted soil metagenome {{that can be used}} for specific questions and future inter-environmental metagenomic comparisons. However, only 1 % of annotated sequences correspond to already sequenced genomes at 96 % similarity and E values of < 10 (- 5), thus, considerable genomic reconstructions efforts still have to be performed...|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that water stress and soil nutrient availability drive leaf-litter quality for decomposers and detritivores by relating chemical and physical leaf-litter properties and decomposability of Alnus glutinosa and Quercus robur, sampled together with <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters,</b> across wide European climatic gradients. By regressing principal components analysis of leaf traits [N, P, condensed tannins, lignin, specific leaf area (SLA) ] against environmental and soil parameters, we found that: (1) In Q. robur the condensed tannin and lignin contents increased and SLA decreased with precipitation, annual range of temperature, and soil N content, whereas leaf P increased with soil P and temperature; (2) In A. glutinosa leaves N, P, and SLA decreased and condensed tannins increased with temperature, annual range of temperature, and decreasing soil P. On the other hand, leaf P and condensed tannins increased and SLA decreased with minimum annual precipitation and towards sites with low temperature. We selected contrasting leaves in terms of quality to test decomposition and invertebrate consumption. There were intraspecific differences in microbial decomposition rates (field, Q. robur) and consumption by shredders (laboratory, A. glutinosa). We conclude that decomposition rates across ecosystems could be partially governed by climate and soil properties, affecting litter quality and therefore decomposers and detritivores. Under scenarios of global warming and increased nutrients, these results suggest we can expect species-specific changes in leaf-litter properties most likely resulting in slow decomposition with increased variance in temperatures and accelerated decomposition with P increase.

40|$|Monitoring of rehabilitated sites {{following}} sand mining {{was conducted}} since 2005 within the Amity, Bayside, Gordon and Ibis mining areas located across North Stradbroke Island, southeast Queensland, Australia. Based on a chronosequence of land revegetation spanning 4 to 20 years post-rehabilitation, the density {{and composition of}} revegetated species assemblages was assessed by distinguishing between historical periods of 2 ̆ 7 older 2 ̆ 7 (pre- 1995) and 2 ̆ 7 younger 2 ̆ 7 (post- 1995) rehabilitation practices and compared with proximal reference communities. The general rehabilitation outlook appeared promising whereby a functional forest structure and suitable level of vegetation biodiversity (compared to remnant ecosystems) had been achieved across most rehabilitated locations over a relatively short time. However, the specific development of 2 ̆ 7 older 2 ̆ 7 sites appeared to deviate from the desired natural analogues {{as indicated by the}} decrease in under-storey heath and the notable emergence of Black Sheoak (Allocasuarina littoralis) as a mono-dominant species therein. In these locations, changes in the vegetation composition coincided with differences among various <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> suggesting that altered edaphic conditions could have facilitated and (or) resulted from of an opportunistic colonization by this species. Meanwhile, it is suggested that its above- and belowground ecological behaviour (i. e., relating to leaf-litter allelopathy and soil-nitrogen fixation) may have further perpetuated its mono-dominant distribution. From these findings, it is recommended that considerations be made regarding the ecological context for species re-colonization when planning for post-disturbance land rehabilitation to avoid potentially unintended rehabilitation outcomes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{mycorrhizal}} colonisation {{of plants}} grown in unmanaged soils from two restoration sites {{with a fire}} history in Northern Portugal was evaluated {{from the perspective of}} supporting restoration programmes. To promote restoration of original tree stands, Quercus ilex L. and Pinus pinaster Ait. were used as target species on two sites, denoted Site 1 and 2 respectively. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess whether mycorrhizal propagules that survived fire episodes could serve as in situ inoculum sources, and to analyse the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and mycorrhizal parameters. In a laboratory bioassay, P. pinaster and Q. ilex seedlings were grown on soils from the target sites and root colonisation by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was determined. The ECM root colonisation levels found indicated that soil from Site 2 contained sufficient ECM propagules to serve as a primary source of inoculum for P pinaster. The low levels of ECM and AM colonisation obtained on the roots of plants grown in soil from Site 1 indicated that the existing mycorrhizal propagules might be insufficient for effective root colonisation of Q. ilex. Different ECM morphotypes were found in plants grown in soil from the two sites. At Site 2 mycorrhizal parameters were found to be spatially structured, with significant differences in ECM colonisation and soil P concentrations between regions of either side of an existing watercourse. The spatial distribution of mycorrhizal propagules was related to <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> (total C and extractable P), and correlations between soil nutrients and mycorrhizal parameters were found...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{phosphorus}} (P) fertilizers {{to agricultural}} soils {{should be based}} on sound knowledge about soil P reserves, availability and lability to optimize conditions for plant uptake while limiting P transport to surface waters. This study investigated relationships between parent material (PM), land use and P fractions in agricultural soils at a regional scale. Surface and deep (100 – 120 cm) soil samples were collected from 120 agricultural sites (240 total samples) and analysed for three P forms (inorganic, organic and available) as well as for additional key properties. Land uses within the study area were continuous cropland, permanent pasture and temporary grassland. The area covered the 12 most common parent types in Wallonia. Mean total P contents were 904 and 401 mg/kg in surface and deep samples, respectively, with a 33 % coefficient of variation for both horizons. The organic P fraction represented, on average, 30 % of total P, while available P corresponded to 9 % of total P. The influence of PM was apparent in both the surface and deep soil samples, while land use influenced only surface properties. The pattern in total P content relative to land use was pasture ≥ cropland ≥ temporary grassland. Correlation analyses highlighted significant relationships between <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> viz Alox, Feox, CEC, TOC, pH and P content, the main soil parameter being Alox which determines P sorption capacity. An enrichment factor was used to distinguish between geogenic sources and human activities in terms of topsoil P content. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In July and August 1999, we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} skiing on the catchment hydrology and soil (erosion) in the surroundings of Sölden, Tyrol, Austria. Sölden is a ski village located in the Ötztal valley in between the Ötztaler and Stubaier Alps. During this research, we conducted 122 rainfall simulations, often in combination with measurements {{of the most important}} <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters.</b> Also, continuous discharge measurements were carried out in three headwaters. We analyzed the output data, subjected them to statistical investigations in order to reveal differences and relationships and, if necessary, interpolated. With the interpolated data and the erosion- and runoff model EUROSEM {{we investigated}} where the soil is sensitive to rill erosion. It appears from the analyses that skiing only indirectly leads to compaction of the soil (via vegetation damage) but directly leads to a lowering of the soil moisture content, which may cause vegetation stress and damage. The vertical conductivity and the porosity of the soil are not affected by skiing. However, skiing increases the chance of overland flow, which, under circumstances with low vegetation cover, can lead to soil erosion. This is supported by the model results and field observations, which show the artificial soils without vegetation cover to be vulnerable to soil erosion. We recommended that the vegetation cover should be kept sufficiently high as to protect the soil from compaction and to minimize the erosion hazard. When the present policy of the skiing companies in the area is maintained, they sufficiently secure sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Site index {{curves and}} an edaphic {{discriminant}} rule for Scots pine {{stands in the}} High Ebro Basin (northern Spain) are presented to estimate site index under different silvicultural situations. High‐grading practices strongly modify the forestry structure by the means of bias in the dominant height and stand density. In order to achieve the silvicultural and site variability of Scots pine stands in the studied area, 75 plots from the National Forest Inventory of Spain (NFI) were selected. In these plots 46 dominant trees were cut down and 104 trees were bored at stump and at breast height (1. 3 m). In each plot a soil sample from the first 10 cm of soil was taken and signs of dimensional cutting were recorded. Site index curves and the edaphic discriminant rule were developed. The site index curve model used {{is an extension of}} the Richards model. The site factors selected in the discriminant rule represent the most important <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> for forest productivity (texture and the assimilability of the nutrients). Site quality of the studied stands was medium‐low as compared with other site index curves for Scots pine around the world. The edaphic discriminant rule presented is useful for estimating site index classes in stands exposed to dimensional cutting and in young stands of Scots pine in the the High Ebro Basin (northern Spain). Site index curves were fitted to allow an estimate of the site index of undisturbed and stands which were not high‐graded. Instituto Universitario de Gestión Forestal Sostenibl...|$|R
40|$|Filamentous and {{phosphate}} solubilizing fungi {{relationships with}} some <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters</b> and coffee plantations management. Soil properties {{and the environment}} have multiple outcomes on fungal communities. Although, the interaction effects between management intensity, pH, available phosphorus, organic carbon, soil texture and different fractions of water stable macro-aggregates on the communities of microscopic filamentous fungi (MFF), iron phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSF-Fe), and iron and calcium phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSF-(Fe+Ca)), have been previously evaluated in field conditions, this has never been performed {{in terms of their}} combined effects, neither with phosphate solubilizing fungi. To assess this, we collected 40 composite soil samples from eight Mexican and Colombian coffee plantations, with different management intensities and physico-chemical <b>edaphic</b> <b>parameters,</b> during 2008 - 2009. We isolated different communities of MFF, PSFFe and PSF-(Fe+Ca), by wet sieving and soil particles culture in Potato-Dextrose-Agar from soil samples, and we classified isolates in terms of their phosphate solubilizing ability. Following the principal component analysis results, we decided to analyze fungal communities and abiotic factors interactions for each country separately. Structural Equation Models revealed that organic carbon was positively associated to MFF richness and number of isolates (λ> 0. 58), but its relationship with PSF-Fe and PSF-(Fe+Ca) were variable; while the available phosphorus, pH and water stable macro-aggregate fractions did not show a clear pattern. Management intensity was negatively related to PSF-Fe (λ≤- 0. 21) morphotype richness and the number of isolates in Colombian coffee plantations. We found that the relationships of clay and organic carbon content, and available phosphorus and soil pH, with the species richness and number of isolates of MFF, PSF-Fe and PSF-(Fe+Ca) were highly variable; this made impossible to generalize the responses between saprotrophic fungal groups and geographic zones. The management intensity was not related to species richness and number of isolates of MFF in any coffee areas, while for PSF the relationship could not be defined. The different water stable macro-aggregates fractions did not show a defined pattern in relation to the species richness and the number of isolates of saprophytic and phosphate solubilizing fungi (PSF). This study highlights the need to take into account edaphic and geographic context in order to reach {{a better understanding of the}} intensity management effects on MFF and PSF function in agroecosystems. El suelo y sus propiedades tienen múltiples relaciones con las comunidades fúngicas. El efecto conjunto de la intensidad de manejo y las variables edáficas, incluida laestabilidad de agregados sobre las comunidades de hongos microscópicos filamentosos (HMF), solubilizadores de fosfato de hierro (HSP-Fe) y solubilizadores tanto de fosfato de hierro como de calcio (HSP-(Fe+Ca)) no han sido evaluadas en campo. A partir de 40 muestras edáficas de ocho plantaciones de café de Colombia y México, con diferentes intensidades de manejo (IMPC) y con diferencias en sus variables edáficas, se aislaron y evaluaron las comunidades de HMF, HSP-Fe y HSP-(Fe+Ca) durante 2008 - 2009. Empleando modelos basados en ecuaciones estructurales se encontró que el carbono orgánico se relacionó positivamente con la riqueza y abundancia de HMF (λ> 0. 58) y fue variable en su relación con HSP-Fe y HSP- (Fe+Ca). Las relaciones del fósforo disponible, pH y las fracciones de macro-agregados fueron altamente variables. El IMPC se relacionó negativamente con HSP-Fe (λ≤- 0. 21) en cafetales colombianos. Se discuten las interacciones para cada conjunto de variables (químicas, estabilidad de macro-agregados y de manejo de plantación) y se explican las relaciones resultantes.
