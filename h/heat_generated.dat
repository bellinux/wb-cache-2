The heat gen-erating rate of electromagnetic field has been discussed {{in order to improve}} the efficiency and accuracy in the solution of induction heating. A new <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate model was proposed and derived from the calculated results by FEM software in consideration of work frequency, source current density, and the air gap between induction coil and slab. The calculated distribution of <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate in the skin depth by the model is satisfying and reliable compared with that of FEM software. Then, the mathematic model of the <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate model is considered as the density of heat reservoir to solve the temperature in induction heating.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the numerical {{results of the}} heat transfer from <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> wire at different conditions by finite element method. The parametric effects on heat transfer were investigated. The varied parameters included ambient conditions, {{as well as the}} shape of the cross-section. The numerical results show that the type of the medium where the <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> wire immerges has strong effects on the heatdissipation rate. As the size of the diameter the heat dissipation to the ambient is decreased. The effects of free convection conditions on the wire surface are also significant.

5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0Â°C and 30Â°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature.

The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630Â°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend.

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E

At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38â€“45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts.
