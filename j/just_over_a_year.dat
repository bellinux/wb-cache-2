Kathy contacted the Canyon Road Contemporary Art gallery {{to see if}} they had interest in carrying her paintings.

50|$|At {{about the}} same time as the Cross family, Jesse Mulkey and his {{brother-in-law}} Baltus Malone located in the township after a long journey from Kentucky at what would become known as Mulkey's Point. Mulkey and Malone's stay in the area would be short, abandoning their cabin after <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year's</b> time. Soon however, Felix Jones took possession of the old Mulkey cabin and constructed the first orchard in the township. Mulkey's Point also contained significant evidence of Indian camps and hunting grounds. Many of the trinkets and items found were shown to visitors of another early township resident, J. W.

It stands as Isis' last full-length album, as the band split <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> after its release. The album continues Isis' history of lengthy songwriting, yet presents a slight departure from the soft-loud dynamics and post-metal aesthetic which characterized previous releases.|$|E

Anderson, {{described by}} Heikkinen as the “greatest line technician in football today,” also resigned as line coach. Asked about rumors that players {{did not like}} Kipke, Heikkinen said those reports were probably originated by disgruntled players who {{did not make the}} squad or were in other ways dissatisfied. However, <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later, in February 1939, Heikkinen led the opposition when Kipke ran for the University’s Board of Regents and campaigned actively for Kipke’s opponent.|$|E

5|$|After <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in office, Cook {{was forced}} to call a new election, the first double dissolution.

Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66.

Further funding was secured from charitable trusts and foundations, notably the Friends of the William Morris Gallery, and through an ongoing public fundraising campaign. Redevelopment {{of the building and}} collections finally started in 2011 and after <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year's</b> closure, reopened on 2 August 2012.

All three ships were ultimately ceded to Great Britain following the end of the war; they were sold to Italian ship-breakers and scrapped in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA {{to fly in}} Yerevan {{for the first time}} in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E

This first became possible when, in 1997, the island was no longer used as a prison and the National Park of the Asinara was founded. After <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year’s</b> research from September 2003 to October 2004, the list of collected Neuroptera, from the previously recorded 3 species, has reached about 20, Chrysopa dorsalis Burmeister, 1839 (new to Sardinia), Dichochrysa iberica (Navás, 1903), and Hemerobius stigma Stephens, 1836 (quite rare and stenotopic in Sardinia) were recognized on the coastal Juniperus formation of Cala Arena.

The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E
