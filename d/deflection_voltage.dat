50|$|The CPLEE had {{a mass of}} 2.7 kg, a stowed {{volume of}} 2540 cubic cm, and used 3.0 W power {{normally}} and 6.0 W at night when the survival heater was on. The {{main part of the}} instrumentation consisted of two electrostatic analyzers. One of these (analyzer A) pointed toward local lunar vertical, and the other (analyzer B) to a point 60 deg from vertical toward lunar west. Both detectors had fields of view of 4 x 20 degrees; for analyzer A the long axis of the field of view was oriented N-S, and for analyzer B, E-W. As a first approximation, both detectors could be considered to point in the ecliptic plane. Each analyzer consisted of a set of direction-defining slits, deflection plates, five small-aperture (1 mm nominal) C-shaped channel electron multipliers, one large-aperture (8 mm nominal) helical channel electron multiplier and 6 accumulators. For a given voltage applied to the deflection plates, the five small-aperture multipliers were arranged to count particles of one polarity with differing energies, while the large-aperture multiplier simultaneously made a wide-band measurement of particles of the opposite polarity. During each 19.2-s interval in the automatic mode of experiment operation, deflection voltages of zero (twice, for background and calibration) and plus and minus 35, 350, and 3500 were applied to the deflection plates for 2.4 s at each voltage. Each analyzer would make measurements for 1.2 s and transmit while the other analyzer was operating. The little-used manual mode permitted the continuous application of a single <b>deflection</b> <b>voltage,</b> thus increasing temporal resolution for particles in a limited portion of the spectrum. Useful data obtained during each 19.2-s interval (automatic mode) where, for each analyzer, 1.2-s accumulated counts of electrons and ions in 18 energy windows between 40 eV and 20 keV. The windows utilizing all 6 detectors at 35 V are centered roughly at 40, 50, 65, 70, 95, and 200 eV, the windows at 350 V are 10x and at 3500 V are 100x these values. A dust cover with a 63Ni radioactive source on the underside over each aperture for calibration protected the instrument.|$|E

50|$|The timebase is an {{electronic}} circuit that generates a ramp voltage. This is a voltage that changes continuously and linearly with time.

The instability parameters of the actuator are determined analytically under the assumption of a second-degree shape function for the beam during deflection. The influence of surface effects, the Casimir force and the fringing field effects on the pull-in parameters is investigated.

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); IEEE Nanotechnology Council (NTC); National Cheng Kung University; National Tsing Hua University; Chinese International NEMS Socity (CINS) A bulk micromachined {{vibratory}} tunneling gyroscope, {{which employs}} the high displacement sensitivity of quantum tunneling {{to obtain the}} desired resolution and is fabricated with silicon-glass wafer bonding and DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching), has been developed. The device structure consists of a proof mass which can oscillate due to electrostatic comb driving and an out-of-plane silicon frame linked up to substrate by suspended springs. Because of adopting the silicon frame structure to get larger proof mass and putting tunneling tip {{at the end of}} silicon frame to obtain remarkable deformation induced by Coriolis force, the new ultracompact devices can provide extremely high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Based on the modal analysis of gyroscope by FEM method, the structure dimensions are optimized according to resonant frequency matching of driving mode and detection mode.

40|$|AbstractIn any Hadamard {{multiplexing}} technique, {{discrepancies between}} the intended and the applied encoding sequences {{may reduce the}} intensity of real spectral features and create discrete, artificial signals. In our implementation of Hadamard transform time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HT-TOFMS), the encoding sequence {{is applied to the}} ion beam by means of an interleaved comb of wires (Bradbury-Nielson gate), which shutters the ion beam on and off. By isolating and exaggerating individual skewing effects in simulating the HT-TOFMS process, we determined the nature of errors that arise from various defects. In particular, we find that the most damaging defects are: mismatched voltages between the wire sets and the acceleration voltage of the instrument, which cause positive and negative peaks throughout mass spectra; insufficient <b>deflection</b> <b>voltage,</b> which reduces the intensity of real peaks and causes negative peaks that are spread across the entire mass range; and voltage errors as the wire sets return from their <b>deflection</b> <b>voltage</b> to their transmission value, which yield significant reductions in peak intensities, create artificial peaks throughout mass spectra, and broaden real peaks by causing positive peaks to grow in the bins adjacent to them. Because the magnitude of the modulation defects grows as the applied modulation voltage is increased, Bradbury-Nielson gates with finer wire spacing, and hence stronger effective fields for a given applied voltage, were produced and installed. Operating at 10 to 15 V where errors in the electronics are essentially absent, the most finely spaced gate (100 μm) yielded signal-to-noise ratios that were more than two times higher than those achieved with more widely spaced gates. As an alternative method for minimizing skewing effects, HT-TOFMS data were post processed using an exact knowledge of the modulation defects. Nonbinary matrices that mimic the actual encoding process were built by measuring voltage versus time traces and then translating these traces to transmission versus time. Use of these matrices in the deconvolution step led to marked improvements in spectral resolution but require full knowledge of the encoding defects...|$|E

40|$|A {{change in}} the voltage and {{character}} of the His bundle deflection following premature atrial stimuli was observed and analysed in 5 of 95 patients having intracardiac conduction studies because of AV conduction disturbances. Of these 5 patients, 3 had spontaneous block within the His bundle, 2 of them showing block in other segments of the conduction system.

40|$|Determination {{of neutral}} winds and ion drifts in low-Earth-orbit {{missions}} requires {{measurements of the}} angular and energy distributions of the flux of neutrals and ions entering the satellite from the ram direction. The magnitude {{and direction of the}} neutral-wind (or ion-drift) determine the location of the maximum in the angular distribution of the flux. Knowledge of the angle of maximum flux with respect to satellite coordinates (pointing) is essential to determine the wind (or ion-drift) vector. The crossed Small-Deflection Energy Analyzer (SDEA) spectrometer (see Figure 1) occupies minimal volume and consumes minimal power. Designed for upper atmosphere/ionosphere investigations at Earth altitudes above 100 km, the spectrometer operates by detecting the angular and energy distributions of neutral atoms/molecules and ions in two mutually perpendicular planes. In this configuration, the two detection planes actually cross at the spectrometer center. It is possible to merge two SDEAs so they share a common optical axis and alternate measurements between two perpendicular planes, and reduce the number of ion sources from two to one. This minimizes the volume and footprint significantly and reduces the ion source power by a factor of two. The area of the entrance aperture affects the number of ions detected/second and also determines the energy resolution. Thermionic emitters require heater power of about 100 mW to produce 1 mA of electron beam current. Typically, electron energy is about 100 eV and requires a 100 -V supply for electron acceleration to supply an additional 100 mW of power. Thus, ion source power is at most 200 mW. If two ion sources were to be used, the ion source power would be, at most, 400 mW. Detector power, <b>deflection</b> <b>voltage</b> power, and microcontroller and other functions require less than 150 mW. A WTS (wind/ temperature spectrometer) with two separate optical axes would consume about 650 mW, while the crossed SDEA described here consumes about 350 mW. The entrance aperture has a diameter of 0. 004 in. (0. 10 mm) to provide the required energy resolution between 0. 05 and 0. 15. This design (see Figure 2) provides a WTS occupying a volume less than 40 cm(sup 3), on a footprint of diameter about 1. 5 in. (38 mm). The Crossed SDEA offers many advantages in the measurements of neutral wind and ion drifts in the Earth's thermosphere.
