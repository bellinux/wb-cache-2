40|$|A {{welding head}} is under {{development}} with integrated sensory systems for robotic laser welding applications. Robotic laser welding requires sensory {{systems that are}} capable to accurately guide the welding head over a seam in three-dimensional space and provide information about the welding process {{as well as the}} quality of the welding result. In this paper the focus is on seam tracking. It is difficult to measure three-dimensional parameters of a ream during a robotic laser welding task, especially when sharp corners are present. The proposed sensory system is capable to provide the three dimensional parameters of a seam in one measurement and <b>guide</b> robots <b>over</b> sharp <b>corners...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Some 1950s American [...] "full size" [...] cars responded {{very slowly}} to {{steering}} changes {{because of their}} very large angular inertia, softly tuned suspension which made ride quality a priority <b>over</b> <b>cornering,</b> and comfort oriented cross bias tires.
