5|$|In geodesy, {{the exact}} shape that Earth's oceans would adopt {{in the absence}} of land and {{perturbations}} such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational <b>equipotential</b> at mean sea level.|$|E
25|$|The ocean's {{surface is}} closely {{approximated}} by an <b>equipotential</b> surface, (ignoring ocean currents) {{commonly referred to}} as the geoid. Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's gradient, there are no tangential forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an <b>equipotential</b> surface on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. Gravitational forces follow an inverse-square law (force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance), but tidal forces are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal <b>equipotential,</b> rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal <b>equipotential</b> changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the <b>equipotential</b> has risen.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{different}} formulations for converting a prefabricated {{vertical drain}} with a rectangular cross section to an equivalent diameter {{well have been}} developed. In addi-tion to equivalent diameter, engineers must also consider the impact of smear when design-ing a system that utilizes prefabricated vertical drains. An experiment and mathematical modeling were used to study the validity of using a reduced equivalent diameter to account for smear. Mathematical modeling of the fourmost commonly used equivalent diameter for-mulations yielded nearly the same <b>equipotentials.</b> In addition, the <b>equipotentials</b> calculated for the equivalent diameter wells differed substantially from a prefabricated vertical drain modeled with and without smear. This indicates that <b>equipotentials</b> are not the best means to evaluate equivalent diameter formulations because the change in shape from a rectangle to a circle impacts the head values {{to such a degree}} that the <b>equipotentials</b> will never be simi...|$|R

The thickness of copper specified for roofing materials is usually adequate for lightning protection. A dedicated lightning protection system may be recommended to adequate lightning protection with an installed copper roof system. The system would include air terminals and intercepting conductors on the roof, a system of ground electrodes, and a system of down-conductors connecting the roof and ground components. It is recommended that the copper roof be bonded to the system of conductors. Bonding ensures that the conductors and roof remain at <b>equipotential</b> and reduce side flashing and possible roof damage.|$|E

We study the most relevant resonances and related bifurcations. We find that the 1 : 1 resonance is associated only to {{the appearance of the}} loops and leads to the destabilization of either one or the other normal modes, depending on the ellipticity of <b>equipotentials.</b> Inclined orbits are never present and may appear only when the <b>equipotentials</b> are heavily deformed. The 1 : 2 resonance determines the appearance of bananas and anti-banana orbits: the first family is stable and always appears at a lower energy than the second, which is unstable. The bifurcation sequence also produces the variations in the stability character of the major axis orbit and is modified only by very large deformations of the <b>equipotentials.</b> Higher-order resonances appear at intermediate or higher energies and can be described with good accuracy.

25|$|Stray voltage is {{a result}} of the design of a 4 wire {{distribution}} system and as such has existed as long as such systems have been used. Stray voltage became a problem for the dairy industry some time after electric milking machines were introduced, and large numbers of animals were simultaneously in contact with metal objects grounded to the electric distribution system and the earth. Numerous studies document the causes, physiological effects, and prevention, of stray voltage in the farm environment. Today, stray voltage on farms is regulated by state governments and controlled by the design of <b>equipotential</b> planes in areas where livestock eat, drink or give milk. Commercially available neutral isolators also prevent elevated potentials on the utility system neutral from raising the voltage of farm neutral or ground wires.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as <b>equipotentials)</b> may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The <b>equipotentials</b> cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|R

40|$|Improvements in {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} of structural and functional MRI {{are beginning to}} enable analysis of intracortical structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3 D, a prerequisite for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains. This parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles used in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles are often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to computed laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these laminae. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate models for cortical laminae used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to model the laminae used so far include constructing laminae that keep a constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute <b>equipotentials</b> between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation. The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the <b>equipotentials</b> were often-used because of their nice mathematical properties. However, the <b>equipotentials</b> these Laplacian profiles are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow the anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of cadaver brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel equi-volume model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued that cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer thickness changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate this preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to generate a three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate system of the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted coordinate system, cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We compare isocontours from these cortical depth values to locations of myelinated bands on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo three-dimensional MR images. A similar comparison was performed with <b>equipotentials</b> computed with the Laplace equation and with equidistant isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the equi-volume model using measured image intensities confirms that it provides a much better fit to observed cortical layering...|$|R

2500|$|The Wylex {{standard}} {{consumer unit}} was {{very popular in}} the United Kingdom until the wiring regulations started demanding residual-current devices (RCDs) for sockets that could feasibly supply equipment outside the <b>equipotential</b> zone.

[...] Some Wylex standard models were made with an RCD instead of the main switch, but (for consumer units supplying the entire installation) this is no longer compliant with the wiring regulations as alarm systems should not be RCD-protected. [...] There are two styles of fuse base that can be screwed into these units: one designed for rewirable fusewire carriers and one designed for cartridge fuse carriers. Over the years MCBs have been made for both styles of base. In both cases, higher rated carriers had wider pins, so a carrier couldn't be changed for a higher rated one without also changing the base.
