5|$|At about 04:30 on May 18, the Syrian 1st Brigade, now {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Husni al-Za'im and consisting of about 30 vehicles, including tanks, advanced west towards Samakh (Tzemah) in two columns—one across the coast, and another <b>flanking</b> from the south. A contingent was allocated further south, {{in order to}} secure the safety of the main force by <b>flanking</b> Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada from the west. It entered a stalemate with a new Israeli position northwest of the two villages.|$|E
5|$|Dairjan {{would make}} a <b>flanking</b> movement—moving between the coast and Aleppo's road—and {{approach}} Emesa from the west, striking at the Muslims' left flank while they were being held frontally by Jabalah.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's <b>flanking</b> {{maneuver}} {{was successfully}} deflected and the Battle of Chantilly was fought to a stalemate. But the 21st had suffered severely with 35 percent casualties (38 killed, 76 wounded, 26 missing).|$|E
50|$|Drilling {{commenced}} on the South <b>Flank</b> by West Epsilon in October 2002 {{and continued}} until August 2003 when it moved to drill the North <b>Flank.</b> The South <b>Flank</b> started production 8 May 2003. While the North <b>Flank</b> came on stream 7 January 2004.|$|R
50|$|A running {{play that}} is run from a set with a <b>flanker</b> {{receiver}} split {{out to the}} side away from the play, often run with the <b>flanker</b> in motion. The quarterback receives the snap and runs out to the <b>flanker</b> side, the <b>flanker</b> in turn makes a deep arc into the backfield behind the quarterback, and then there is an exchange either by handoff or by pitching the ball to the <b>flanker.</b> <b>Flanker</b> Sweep typically resembles the Student Body Right in that every available blocker blocks to the playside.|$|R

5|$|The Pevsner City Guide to Manchester {{described}} the cenotaph {{as one of}} the few impressive war memorials in Manchester but lamented its original cluttered setting and its proximity to overhead wires. The cenotaph, obelisks, and stone are features typical of Lutyens' war memorial work, although Manchester's is one of only two with <b>flanking</b> obelisks—Northampton's has a similar pair of obelisks <b>flanking</b> a Stone of Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|The entire land {{front is}} {{surrounded}} by a deep ditch. Remains of a <b>flanking</b> battery within the ditch were unearthed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck on 4 April 1945. On the night of 7/8 April they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a <b>flanking</b> manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese, catching them by surprise.|$|E
5000|$|In {{parts of}} central Canada, a ground meat patty wrapped in <b>flank</b> or round steak {{is known as}} a London broil. Some butchers will wrap the <b>flank</b> steak around a {{concoction}} of seasoned and ground or tenderized <b>flank</b> steak. Others sell a pork sausage patty wrapped in <b>flank</b> or top round steak labelled as London broil. Another variant, popular in Southern Ontario, is a London broil [...] "loaf", wherein the tenderized <b>flank</b> steak exterior is wrapped around minced and spiced veal as the filler. In some regions, bacon will be added between the <b>flank</b> steak and the veal grind.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the left}} and right <b>flanks</b> of the {{starting}} setup are symmetrical, it is customary to make the first move on the right <b>flank.</b> Starting on the left <b>flank</b> is considered needlessly confusing.|$|R

5|$|By about noon, the Confederates {{had formed}} an attack line {{and were in}} {{position}} to advance on the works. Because of the forest {{on the west side}} of the Mauckport Road, a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a <b>flanking</b> maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial <b>flanking</b> attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading, and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Later in the war, {{when the}} Allies started a <b>flanking</b> {{movement}} to the southeast of Humaitá, López sent and had the Chaco explored, and gave orders to build a road through the Chaco from Timbó (the nearest place on the coast opposite Humaitá where a landing could be effected).|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the walls}} and {{structures}} within the gardens, such as the central flight of steps, {{were built in the}} late 17th century. The gatepiers and <b>flanking</b> walls north east of the house were added in the mid 19th century. The gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 10–11 November a Russian column under Strik's command began its passage through the narrow canyons, intent on {{arriving}} at Dürenstein by noon; two more columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, moved in wider semicircles, planning {{to pass through the}} mountains and attack the French, who were extended along the river bank. According to the plan, in late morning Strik's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a <b>flanking</b> assault on the French right. This <b>flanking</b> attack, combined with Miloradovich's frontal assault from Stein, would force the French into a vise; encircled, they would have no option but to surrender—or die. To ensure the success of the plan, the second and third columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, would arrive in early and mid-afternoon and support the earlier assaults. In this way, even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach, they would not escape the vise-like grip of the Coalition army.|$|E
5|$|The link up {{occurred}} on 3 December {{and the following}} day a composite force from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions took over the advance to the Christmas Hills, which were secured on 7 December after the Japanese abandoned the position {{in the wake of}} a series of <b>flanking</b> moves by the Australians, an intense artillery and mortar bombardment and a frontal assault.|$|E

30|$|In the MIS {{reservoir}} model, {{the aquifer}} is very weak. The Fetkovitch analytical aquifer model was used. The aquifer {{size and strength}} were specified. Aquifer influx and pressure were calculated for each time step by the simulator. For MIS, two unsteady state aquifers in the model were used, one aquifer attached to the South <b>flank</b> {{and the other one}} to the North <b>flank.</b> In the history match, aquifer strength (aquifer productivity index, PI) and aquifer volume were adjusted until the regional datum pressures for the South <b>flank</b> and the North <b>flank</b> were matched. The aquifer attached to the South <b>flank</b> is much weaker than that to the North <b>flank.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A orthogonal-shaft {{face gear}} drive with spur {{involute}} pinion is considered. The mathematical {{model of the}} face gear tooth <b>flank</b> was studied and the correction parameters was taken into account. The measurement grid schema was accomplished on the rotary projection of theoretical tooth <b>flank,</b> with the real tooth <b>flank</b> data from three-dimensional measuring machine or gear measuring center, the tooth <b>flank</b> deviation could be calculated. The effect of correction parameters on tooth <b>flank</b> deviation was investigated and the correction method for the single index generating grinding was proposed. Finally a numerical example was presented and {{the results show that}} the method proposed can decrease the tooth <b>flank</b> deviation...|$|R
5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters <b>flanking</b> a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. <b>Flanking</b> the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|The third {{stages of}} the <b>flanking</b> towers were both built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th century, {{to the design of}} William Wynford; that on the north-west was not begun until about 1425. The design {{maintains}} the general proportions, and continues the strong projection of the buttresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a <b>flanking</b> attack.|$|E
5000|$|... “By {{standing}} close, the five-eighth {{ensures that}} he draws the open-side <b>flanker.</b> Any five-eighth standing close {{will look like}} a sitting duck to the <b>flanker,</b> who is therefore keyed up to flatten him. This is just what the five-eighth wants. Provided he runs fairly straight, the <b>flanker</b> {{will not be able}} to resist coming at him, and at the appropriate moment, having drawn the <b>flanker,</b> the five-eighth passes to the inside-centre. The moment this happens the <b>flanker</b> is out of the game, for he now has to turn around and chase. On the other hand, if the five-eighth stands wide or if he does not run fairly straight, the <b>flanker</b> can approach him at an angle. If the five-eighth then unloads, the <b>flanker</b> can continue on the same angle and nail the inside centre.” ...|$|R

5|$|Warner {{had both}} halfbacks {{close to the}} line and <b>flanking</b> the {{defensive}} tackles. That {{was the start of}} the double wingback offense, which enjoyed tremendous popularity until the T formation was modernized with the man in motion. The double wing became the most effective of all systems for effective forward passing since it permitted the quick release of four receivers down the field.|$|E
