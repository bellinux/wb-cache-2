5|$|Many of Canberra's suburbs {{are named}} after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.

In 1948, the family moved again to 12 Ardwick Road (also in Speke) which was part of a new estate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> <b>of</b> Liverpool. The frequent moves to better areas were Mary's idea, as she wanted to raise her children in the best neighbourhood possible.|$|E

5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> <b>of</b> Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, an {{outbreak}} of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into cannibalistic monsters known as infected. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> <b>of</b> Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes).

5|$|New {{migrants}} {{began moving}} from Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries to more industrialized regions {{around the world}} {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Although these migrants possessed a Chinese heritage, they were often not identified as such; this trend has continued into the modern day. There have been several independent estimates made on the Chinese Indonesian population living in other countries. James Jupp's The Australian People encyclopedia estimated that half of over 30,000 Indonesians living in Australia in the late 1990s are ethnic Chinese, and they have since merged with other Chinese communities. In New Zealand, many migrants reside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburbs</b> <b>of</b> Auckland after some 1,500 sought asylum from the 1998 upheaval, of which two-thirds were granted residency.|$|E
