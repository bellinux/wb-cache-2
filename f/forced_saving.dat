Under schemes of deferred compensation, workers are overpaid when old, {{at the cost of}} being underpaid when young. Salop and Salop (1976) argue that this derives from the need to attract workers more likely to stay at the firm for longer periods, since turnover is costly. Alternatively, delays in evaluating the performance of workers may lead to compensation being weighted to later periods, when better and poorer workers have to a greater extent been distinguished. (Workers may even prefer to have wages increasing over time, perhaps as a method of <b>forced</b> <b>saving,</b> or as an indicator of personal development. e.g., Loewenstein and Sicherman 1991, Frank and Hutchens 1993.) For example Akerlof and Katz 1989: if older workers receive efficiency wages, younger workers may be prepared to work for less in order to receive those later. Overall, the evidence suggests the use of deferred compensation (e.g., Freeman and Medoff 1984, and Spilerman 1986—seniority provisions are often included in pay, promotion and retention decisions, irrespective of productivity.) ...|$|E

40|$|After {{reaching}} its peak at {{the year of}} 1987, the saving rate of Taiwan dropped quickly in the late 1980 ’s. At the same time, the real average housing prices in Taiwan had increased almost three times from 1987 to 1990. Why did the saving rated in Taiwan drop so quickly after 1987 ? Does it relate to the dramatic increase in housing prices? Though it has been confirmed {{that there is a}} negative wealth effect of housing price appreciation on savings, the estimated wealth effect on savings could be biased if the effect of mortgage payment (also known as forced savings) on saving is neglected. Applying quarterly data from 1981 to 2000 in Taiwan, we employ a time series analysis to compare two saving models, the traditional one and the one with <b>forced</b> <b>saving.</b> Our major findings include: First, as we expected, the negative wealth effect of housing price appreciation on saving is smaller in the <b>forced</b> <b>saving</b> model than in the traditional saving model. Secondly, by the estimated ECMs, ignoring the impact of housing price appreciation on <b>forced</b> <b>saving,</b> the speed of short-run adjustment in total saving would be significantly slower.

40|$|A common puzzling {{phenomenon}} {{over the}} household survey of Taiwan {{is that the}} renters' saving rate is {{higher than that of}} the owners', while the latter has a higher average income than the former. One reason for this feature is that certain housing owners have to pay a greater amount of mortgage payment that is not included in saving. And on the other hand, the saving decision is correlated with the tenure decision, while the tenure decision is also correlated with the household's life cycle, in addition to income. And therefore, when one tries to estimate the correct saving rate, he or she has to consider the household's life cycle as well. In this study, we apply a data set of the household survey of Taiwan to investigate the correlation of life cycle, mortgage payment, and <b>forced</b> <b>savings.</b> First of all, we estimate the saving rate in a traditional way, and then estimate the saving rate after the adjustment of mortgage payment. To figure out the correct saving rate with the tenure decision, we evaluate different households' saving behaviors according to different cohorts, and consequently, we could check how life cycle plays its role in this model. And our finding is, that for every cohort, the <b>forced</b> <b>savings</b> is significant for owners with mortgage and for renters as well.

40|$|The current paper empirically {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} household savings rates in the Soviet republics, by utilizing the panel data of an aggregated household budget survey in the period from 1965 to 1989. Earlier studies claimed that increases in household savings starting from the late 1950 s were {{the direct result of}} worsening shortages of consumer goods; therefore, they considered Soviet households' savings to be involuntary ones and that households were "forced" to save under severe shortage conditions in the official consumer market. But they failed to fully investigate this problem mainly because of unavailability of data on household incomes and expenditures and of ignorance of a widespread informal economy ("second economy"). When the informal economy could at least partly provide households with opportunities to spend their money on lacking goods, households would be able to choose whether to save money and stand in line for scarce goods at the official retail shops, or move to the informal market. This understanding leads to the implication that there existed neither involuntary nor <b>forced</b> <b>savings.</b> In order to tackle this unsolved research problem, the Soviet households' savings rate function is estimated by taking into account shortages, the informal economy, and other factors, among them life-cycle factors, and then the "forced savings rate" is calculated. The main findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, even taking into account these factors, there existed Soviet-unique factors, namely the shortage factor, informal factor, and demand-spillover effect. Secondly, the magnitudes of these three factors varied among regions, so <b>forced</b> <b>savings</b> rates also varied. According to our estimation results, <b>forced</b> <b>savings</b> in the Slavic and Baltic regions accounted for more than 40 % of the total savings just before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while those in the Caucasian and Central Asian regions accounted for less than 10 %...|$|R
