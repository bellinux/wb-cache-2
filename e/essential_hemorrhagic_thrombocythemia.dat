40|$|Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive leukemias, {{with the}} bcr-abl gene translocation, have a dismal prognosis. The {{identification}} of Ph-positive patients {{is vitally important}} because only aggressive therapeutic approaches, such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, may result in long-term disease-free survival. Routine diagnostic methods, such as Southern blot analysis and cytogenetics, may lead to false-negative results. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is considered the most sensitive tool {{for the detection of}} the bcr-abl translocation, and it is widely used alone or in combination with karyotyping or Southern blot analysis to identify Ph-positive cases. In this study, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with BCR and ABL double-color probes for detecting Ph-positive leukemias. The FISH results were compared with the results of cytogenetic and RT-PCR analyses in 75 patients with leukemia or other myeloproliferative syndromes (chronic myeloid leukemia, 30; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 24; acute myelogenous leukemia, 6; <b>essential</b> (<b>hemorrhagic)</b> <b>thrombocythemia,</b> 12; chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 2; and polycythemia vera, 1). FISH analysis proved to be simple, extremely reliable and sensitive; bcr-abl fusion detection was successful in the presence of all types of molecular junctions ie, (b 2 a 2, b 3 a 2, and e 1 a 2). Furthermore, a Ph- positive case that proved fusion negative by RT-PCR was identified as positive by FISH. The sensitivity of RT-PCR and FISH related to Ph-positive cases were 97 % and 100 %, respectively. Regarding specificity, in 4 (5 %) of 75 patients, RT-PCR provided false-positive results. Cross-contamination was identified because a new specimen was harvested and reanalyzed when FISH, cytogenetics, and RT-PCR results were contradictory. We believe FISH is an optimal diagnostic method to detect bcr-abl translocation that can be used alone or to validate the results of RT-PCR analysis...|$|E

40|$|Hemorrhage is {{the most}} {{prominent}} effect of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) in human envenomation. The capillary injury is a multifactorial effect caused by hydrolysis {{of the components of}} the basement membrane (BM). The PI and PIII classes of SVMPs are abundant in viperid venoms and hydrolyze BM components. However, hemorrhage is associated mostly with PIII-class SVMPs that contain non-catalytic domains responsible for the binding of SVMPs to BM proteins, facilitating enzyme accumulation in the tissue and enhancing its catalytic efficiency. Here we report on Atroxlysin-Ia, a PI-class SVMP that induces hemorrhagic lesions in levels comparable to those induced by Batroxrhagin (PIII-class), and a unique SVMP effect characterized by the rapid onset of dermonecrotic lesions. Atroxlysin-Ia was purified from B. atrox venom, and sequence analyses indicated that it is devoid of non-catalytic domains and unable to bind to BM proteins as collagen IV and laminin in vitro or in vivo. The presence of Atroxlysin-Ia was diffuse in mice skin, and localized mainly in the epidermis with no co-localization with BM components. Nevertheless, the skin lesions induced by Atroxlysin-Ia were comparable to those induced by Batroxrhagin, with induction of leukocyte infiltrates and hemorrhagic areas soon after toxin injection. Detachment of the epidermis was more intense in skin injected with Atroxlysin-Ia. Comparing the catalytic activity of both toxins, Batroxrhagin was more active in the hydrolysis of a peptide substrate while Atroxlysin-Ia hydrolyzed more efficiently fibrin, laminin, collagen IV and nidogen. Thus, the results suggest that Atroxlysin-Ia bypasses the binding step to BM proteins, <b>essential</b> for <b>hemorrhagic</b> lesions induced by PII- and P-III class SVMPs, causing a significantly fast onset of hemorrhage and dermonecrosis, due to its higher proteolytic capacity on BM components...|$|R
