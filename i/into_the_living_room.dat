5|$|The front entry leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> where {{polished}} wood {{is found}} throughout {{as well as}} 19th century furnishings. The front room {{is part of the}} original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
25|$|As the {{original}} house became crowded Mrs. Hubbard concocted her own plans and layout {{for an additional}} section {{to be added to}} the house. Her plan, according to the writings of her daughter Mary, was for a two-story addition at the front elevation of the building, much as the building appears today. She envisioned a central front hall with a stairway flanked by walnut balustrades and an open parlor with folding doors opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Mrs. Hubbard's vision for the second floor included two new children's bedrooms and a spare bedroom.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords {{had not told}} him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized {{they were there to}} betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E

25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> of the apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E
500|$|A fireman named O. H. Bush {{and several}} other men crawled through a broken window of the {{farmhouse}} in search of survivors. When they determined {{that no one was}} in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up an armful of explosives and handed it to one of the men. As Kehoe left his burning farm and house in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire, [...] "Boys, you're my friends. You better get out of here. You better head down to the school", and drove off.|$|E
500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world {{was coming to an end}} and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E
500|$|Following {{criticism}} of the US in American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit, American readers were less enthusiastic at first, {{but by the end}} of the American Civil War, copies of the book were in wide circulation. In 1863 The New York Times published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the [...] "old Christmas... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> poor of today".|$|R
5000|$|A {{month after}} {{he reached the}} million dollar mark, it was, by formal proclamation, [...] "Cardigan Bay Day" [...] in Yonkers, New York.

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore later entered Ward's {{room with}} a Ruger [...]45 caliber handgun and asked to speak with Ward. The two men went into the kitchen, where Moore asked if Ward knew whether Johnson was male or female. The two men went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> where Moore asked Johnson and Coleman whether Johnson was male or female.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many houses}} {{designed}} by Wright, {{it proved to}} be better as an aesthetic work than as a livable dwelling. [...] Water tended to flow over the central lawn and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> and the flat roof terraces were conceived without an understanding of Los Angeles' rains. [...] The cantilevered concrete also has not stood up well to the area's earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Peter Eckersley {{had sought}} {{other ways to}} bring the signals of <b>the</b> IBC {{stations}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> of Britain. Rather than relying upon a receiving set licensed by the General Post Office, he began to wire parts of England for an early form of cable radio but was stopped by {{the intervention of the}} GPO. The IBC stations were eventually silenced when Adolf Hitler's troops captured the transmitters. From 1937 onwards Peter Eckersley worked for British Military Intelligence MI6 to help combat propaganda coming from Nazi Germany with British propaganda stations. He was turned down for war work.|$|R
40|$|Kenya's {{cut flower}} {{industry}} is often considered {{a testament to}} globalization [...] - a panacea for declining exports that has brought thousands of new employment opportunities to poor rural women. The industry, however, has also come to epitomize {{the dark side of}} globalization with booming economic growth lying side by side with human immiseration. In recent years this juxtaposition has spawned a new moral discourse, with images of toxic flower fields and lurid working conditions broadcast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> of suburban London homes. Such images are part of a new morality of consumption, where consumers, NGOs and global supermarkets aspire to 'save' the African worker from the downside of globalization...|$|R
60|$|Placing his bundles on a {{shelf in}} the shed, Andy softly {{opened the door to}} the summer kitchen and entered the place.

2500|$|An {{embarrassing}} {{moment for}} Daryl {{during this time}} was when awoke one minute prior to the show going to air.

[...] Still in his underwear, Daryl wrapped himself up in a blanket and rushed to the studio where he was greeted by Ernie Carroll.|$|E
2500|$|As artist Peter Malick {{states in}} the liner notes, [...] "I started looking for a singer who could record [...] for me. [...] On a Tuesday night, I walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Room</b> just as the singer {{announced}} the last song of the set. [...] The Dinah Washington classic [...] "Since I fell for You" [...] filled the room and I was struck breathless.

In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
50|$|A long, narrow, one storey {{building}} with a flat-roof, it rises slightly above the gently sloping site on a brick platform.

The bedrooms have no windows apart from skylights.|$|R
60|$|The report {{stirred the}} girls to explore. They all trooped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> big <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and were at once captivated by its charm.

5000|$|The crooked leg is {{most likely}} owed to very distant {{ancestors}} as noted in Dogs And All About Them (1910), by Robert Leighton: [...] Among the distinct breeds kept in Egypt there was a massive wolf-dog, a large, heavily-built hound with drooping ears and a pointed head, at least two varieties of Greyhound used for hunting the gazelle, and a small breed of terrier or Turnspit, with short, crooked legs. This last {{appears to have been}} regarded as an especial household pet, for it was admitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and taken as a companion for walks out of doors. It was furnished with a collar of leaves, or of leather, or precious metal wrought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> form of leaves, and when it died it was embalmed. Every town throughout Egypt had its place of interment for canine mummies.|$|R
2500|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and James went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> before {{traveling}} to Platte City. By reading the daily newspaper, James had just learned of gang member Liddil's confession {{for participating in}} Hite's murder and grew increasingly suspicious of the Fords for never reporting this matter to him. According to Robert Ford, {{it became clear to}} him that James had realized they were there to betray him. However, instead of scolding the Fords, James walked across the living room to lay his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair in order to clean it. [...] Robert Ford drew his weapon and shot the unarmed James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
2500|$|At 1 p.m. MST, Arndt asked Fleet White (a {{friend of}} the Ramseys) and John Ramsey to search the house {{to see if they}} could find if [...] "anything seemed amiss." [...] John and Fleet started their search in the basement, where John found his daughter's body in one of the rooms. Duct tape covered JonBenét's mouth, a nylon cord was found around her wrists and neck, and her torso was covered by a white blanket. Ramsey {{immediately}} picked the body up and took it upstairs. Arndt then moved her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Each time that she was moved potential evidence was contaminated or disturbed for the returning forensics team. Patsy stated that JonBenét was not wearing the clothing that she was wearing when she put her daughter to bed, as she was now dressed in white leggings and a shirt.|$|E
2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E
50|$|Full {{motion video}} (FMV) games are video games that rely upon {{pre-recorded}} television- or movie-quality recordings and animations rather than sprites, vectors or 3D models to display {{action in the}} game. FMV-based games were popular during the early 1990s as CD-ROMs and Laserdiscs made their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> providing {{an alternative to the}} low-capacity ROM cartridges of most consoles at the time. Although FMV-based games did manage to look better than many contemporary sprite-based games, they occupied a niche market; and a vast majority of FMV games were panned {{at the time of their}} release, with many gamers citing their dislike for the lack of interaction inherent in these games. As a result, the format became a well-known failure in video gaming, and the popularity of FMV games declined substantially after 1995 as more advanced consoles started to become widely available.|$|R
50|$|Two {{forms of}} {{farmstead}} predominated. On {{the one hand}} there was the unit farmhouse, which was partitioned transversely and where, in most cases, the threshing floor {{was in the middle}} of the house; on the other hand there was the two-sided farm with the farmhouse on one side and outbuildings on the other. The main farmhouse was usually oriented in a north-south direction, but there were often variations in which the building was oriented northeast to southwest. When erecting the houses, builders appear to have taken account of the direction of the sun, in particular to ensure that the morning sun shone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms.</b> As construction activity took place mainly in winter, outside the busy summer season, there was often a deviation in alignment. Very rarely, buildings oriented from northwest to southeast may be found.|$|R
5000|$|Interactive {{movies were}} popular {{during the early}} 1990s as CD-ROMs and Laserdiscs made their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{providing}} {{an alternative to the}} low-capacity cartridges of most consoles. As the first CD-based consoles capable of displaying smooth and textured 3D graphics appeared, the full-FMV game had vanished from the mainstream circles around 1995, although it remained an option for PC adventure games for a couple more years. One of the last titles released was the 1998 PC and PlayStation adventure The X-Files: The Game, packed in 7 CDs. That same year, Tex Murphy: Overseer became the first game developed specifically for DVD-ROM, and one of the last [...] "interactive movies" [...] to make heavy use of live-action FMV. In 2014, the Tex Murphy series continued with a new FMV game, Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure.|$|R
2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
