40|$|A ZLRev. {{article on}} fiscal <b>incentives</b> for <b>good</b> {{environmental}} management in Zimbabwe. Tax incentives are rarely considered in discussions on environmental protection, yet well structured incentives {{can be of}} critical importance in contributing to good environmental management. For tax incentives to contribute maximally to sound environmental management, their various objectives, e. g., curing market failure, influencing economic behaviour and raising revenue for environmental protection must be well balanced. This balance becomes {{even more difficult to}} achieve when account is taken that the objectives must be pursued {{in the light of the}} general principles of taxation-equity, certainty, efficiency, etc. — and specific principles of environmental taxation, like the polluter pays principle. Inevitable inconsistencies are bound to occur, but the framework of objectives and principles allows for clearer thinking in the design and implementation of specific environmental tax incentives. In Zimbabwe, no general tax <b>incentives</b> for <b>good</b> environmental management are currently in place. However, by examining, in the light of the above scheme, those few environmental incentives that exist, this article seeks to open the vista for the systematic introduction of more incentives for environmental protection in Zimbabwe...|$|R

It shows also that competition toughness does not always reinforce adoption <b>incentives.</b> When <b>goods</b> are differentiated enough, adoption occurs later than it is socially optimal...|$|R

Using data on {{boys from the}} National Education Longitudinal Survey, I focus on youth behavior in the classroom {{as a measure of}} noncognitive skills. I find that student behavior during adolescence is persistent. The variation in behavior can be attributed to unobserved individual heterogeneity. Family and school characteristics, as well as the <b>incentives</b> for <b>good</b> behavior provided at home and in school, are important determinants of behavior. Neither the cross-sectional variation in behavior nor the variation over time in behavior can, however, be attributed to these covariates. ...|$|R

In doing so, we introduce an equilibrium notion of platform reputation in an infinite horizon model. We find that with transaction fees only, the platform cannot eliminate {{the loss of}} reputation induced by moral hazard. If registration fees can be levied, moral hazard can be overcome. The registration fee determines the participation threshold of sellers and extracts them, whereas (lower) transaction fees provide <b>incentives</b> for <b>good</b> behavior. This provides a motivation for platforms to use registration fees in addition to transaction fees...|$|R
