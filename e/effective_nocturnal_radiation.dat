60|$|I {{have said}} that the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> in the English spring months is the great {{obstacle}} to the cultivation of many Himalayan plants; but it is not therefore to be inferred that there is no similar amount of radiation in the Himalaya; for, on the contrary, in April its amount is much greater than in England, frequently equalling 13 degrees of difference; and I have seen 16 degrees at 7,500 feet; but the minimum temperature at the time is 51 degrees, and the absolute amount of cold therefore immaterial. The mean minimum of London is 38 degrees, and, when lowered 5.5 degrees by radiation, the consequent cold is very considerable. Mr. Daniell, in his admirable essay on the climate of London, mentions 17 degrees as the maximum effect of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> ever observed by him. I have registered 16 degrees in April at Dorjiling; nearly as much at 6000 feet in February; twice 13 degrees, and once 14.2 degrees in September at 15,500 feet; and 10 degrees in October at 16,800 feet; nearly 13 degrees in January at 7000 feet; 14.5 degrees in February at that elevation, and, on several occasions, 14.7 degrees at 10,000 feet in November.|$|R

60|$|The hygrometric {{state of}} the {{atmosphere}} of the valley differs most decidedly from that of the hills. In the valley dew is constantly formed, which is owing to the amount of moisture in the air, for <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> is more powerful on the hills. The sunrise and 9 p.m. observations in the valley, give a mean depression of the dew-point below the air of 12.3 degrees, and those at the upper level of 21.2 degrees, with no dew on the hills and a copious deposit in the valley. The corresponding {{state of the}} atmosphere as to saturation is 0.480 on the hills and 0.626 in the valley.|$|R
60|$|A {{remarkable}} uniformity {{prevails in}} the depression of thermometers exposed to <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation,</b> whether laid on the earth, grass, or freely exposed; both the mean and maximum indication coincide very nearly {{with those of the}} lower Soane valley and of the hills. The temperature of tufts of green barley laid on the ground is one degree higher than that of short grass; Argemone and Calotropis leaves maintain a still warmer temperature; from the previous experiments the Argemone appeared to be considerably the cooler, which I was inclined to attribute to the smoother and more shining surface of its leaf, but from these there would seem to be no sensible difference between the radiating powers of the two plants.|$|R
60|$|It {{is evident}} from these observations, that {{compared}} with Calcutta, the dryness of the atmosphere is the most remarkable feature of this table-land, the temperature not being high; and to this, combined with the sterility of the soil over {{a great part of}} the surface, must be attributed the want of a vigorous vegetation. Though so favourably exposed to the influence of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation,</b> the amount of the latter is small. The maximum depression of a thermometer laid on grass never exceeded 10 degrees, and averaged 7 degrees; whereas the average depression of the dew-point at the same hour amounted to 25 degrees in the morning. Of course no dew was deposited even in the clearest star-light night.|$|R
60|$|The {{vegetation}} of the Soane {{valley is}} exposed to a less extreme temperature {{than that of the}} hills; the difference between solar and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> amounting here only to 80.5 degrees, and on the hills to 96.5 degrees. There is no material difference {{in the power of the}} sun's rays at the upper and lower levels, as expressed by the blackbulb thermometer, the average rise of which above one placed in the shade, amounted to 48 degrees in both cases, and the maximum occurred about 11 a.m. The decrease of the power of the sun's rays in the afternoon is much the most rapid in the valley, coinciding with a greater reduction of the elasticity of vapour and of humidity in the atmosphere.|$|R

Here the clouds alike prevent solar and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation,</b> the temperature is more uniform, and the corroding power of the damp southerly wind that blows strongly throughout the day is the great melting agent. One morning I saw a vivid and very beautiful halo 20 degrees distant from the sun's disc; it was no doubt caused by snow in the higher regions of the atmosphere, as a sharp shower of rain fell immediately afterwards: these are rare phenomena in mountainous countries.|$|R

60|$|The {{temperature}} is more uniform at Mr. Hodgson's bungalow, {{which is on}} the top of the Dorjiling ridge, than on either of its flanks; this is very much because a good deal of wood is left upon it, whose cool foliage attracts and condenses the mists. Its mean {{temperature is}} lower by nearly 2.5 degrees than that of Mr. Muller's and Dr. Campbell's houses, both situated on the slopes, 400 feet below. This I ascertained by numerous comparative observations of the temperature of the air, and by burying thermometers in the earth: it is chiefly to be accounted for by the more frequent sunshine at the lower stations, the power of the sun often raising the thermometer in shade to 80 degrees, at Mr. Muller's; whereas during the summer I spent at Mr. Hodgson's it never rose much above 70 degrees, attaining that height very seldom and for a very short period only. The nights, again, are uniformly and equally cloudy at both stations, so that there is no corresponding cold of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> to reduce the temperature.|$|R

60|$|The diurnal {{distribution}} of temperature is equally and similarly {{affected by the}} presence of vapour at different altitudes. The lower and outer ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, first receive the diurnal charge of vapour-loaded southerly winds; those beyond them get more of the sun's rays, and the rearward ones more still. Though the summer days of the northern localities are warmer than their elevation would indicate, the nights are not proportionally cold; for the light mist of 14,000 feet, which replaces the dense fog of 7000 feet, effectually obstructs <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation,</b> though it is less an obstacle to solar radiation. Clear nights, be it observed, are as rare at Momay (15,300 feet) as at Dorjiling, the nights if windy being rainy; or, if calm, cold currents descend from the mountains, condensing the moist vapours of the valleys, whose narrow floors are at sunrise bathed in mist at all elevations in Sikkim. The rise and dispersion of these dense mists, and their collection and recondensation on the mountains in the morning, {{is one of the most}} magnificent phenomena of the Himalaya, when viewed from a proper elevation; it commences as soon as the sun appears on the horizon.|$|R
60|$|The power {{this plant}} {{exercises}} {{of maintaining a}} low temperature of 72 degrees, though the main portion which is subterraneous {{is surrounded by a}} soil heated to between 90 degrees and 104 degrees, is very remarkable, and no doubt proximately due to the rapidity of evaporation from the foliage, and consequent activity in the circulation. Its exposed leaves maintained a temperature of 80 degrees, nearly 25 degrees cooler than the similarly exposed sand and alluvium. On the same night the leaves were cooled down to 54 degrees, when the sand had cooled to 51 degrees. Before daylight the following morning the sand had cooled to 43 degrees, and the leaves of the Calotropis to 45.5 degrees. I omitted to observe the temperature of the sap at the latter time; but the sand at the same depth (15 inches) as that at which its temperature and that of the plant agreed at mid-day, was 68 degrees. And assuming this to be the heat of the plant, we find that the leaves are heated by solar radiation during the day 8 degrees, and cooled by <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation,</b> 22.5 degrees.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sun radiates heat {{to earth}} in the day. At night the reverse happens when the warmer earth radiates heat to the cold night sky. Roofs of {{buildings}} radiate heat day and night {{at a rate of}} up to 75 watts per square meter. During the day, this is offset by solar radiation gains on the roof, however, at night, this heat loss has the ability to cool air as roofs can experience a temperature drop of 6 to 20 °C below ambient. Cooling a building by long-wave radiation to the night sky has long been identified as a potentially productive means to reduce space cooling energy in buildings but the technology has not been commercially available. A series of tests have been completed at Canada's National Solar Test Facility and data shows that it is possible cool air a few degrees below ambient from sunset to sunrise using a perforated metal panel system mounted onto a sky facing surface.

40|$|Abstract: A simple {{thermodynamic}} model for predicting fog at 0600 h local time at Don Muang Airport {{in the winter}} from surface observations at 0000 h (midnight) is presented. The basic parameters used are temperature and humidity of the surface air at 0000 h, and mean cloud amount for 0000 h to 0600 h. It is assumed that a layer of air with constant thickness at the surface loses heat by long-wave radiation, thereby falling in temperature and increasing its relative humidity. If the dew point is reached, water vapor then condenses, {{and the number of}} drops per unit volume with an assumed constant diameter (10 µm or 20 µm) is calculated. Estimates of the visibility are then calculated from the number of drops per unit volume. Different values of the basic parameters are used to investigate how they determine the number of drops formed. The results, found by numerical integration of the differential equations representing the thermal processes, are in reasonable order of magnitude agreement with actual meteorological observations. They give an indication of the likely depth of the surface layer under a temperature inversion formed by <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation...</b>|$|R

Typical weather data for cities at mid-altitudes (∼ 1500 meters) and high altitudes (> 2000 meters) are also presented. Due to the great variation in altitude (700 meters - 2600 meters) and climate in Burundi, both heating and cooling are required, hence the need for both heating (SOLBUDI) and cooling (COLBUDI) design analysis programs. Skylights, east windows, and west windows are the best sources of solar gain in Burundi due to the high solar angles, which are present all seasons.

50|$|However, modern {{members of}} the placental orders {{originated}} in the Paleogene around 66 to 23 MYA, following the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The evolution of crown orders such modern primates, rodents, and carnivores appears {{to be part of}} an adaptive radiation that took place as mammals quickly evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were left open when most dinosaurs and other animals disappeared following the Chicxulub asteroid impact. As they occupied new niches, mammals rapidly increased in body size, and began to take over the large herbivore and large carnivore niches that had been left open by the decimation of the dinosaurs. Mammals also exploited niches that the dinosaurs had never touched: for example, bats evolved flight and echolocation, allowing them to be highly <b>effective</b> <b>nocturnal,</b> aerial insectivores; and whales first occupied freshwater lakes and rivers and then moved into the oceans. Primates, meanwhile, acquired specialized grasping hands and feet which allowed them to grasp branches, and large eyes with keener vision which allowed them to forage in the dark.|$|R
40|$|Three {{case studies}} are {{presented}} involving data from an acoustic radar. The first two cases examine data {{collected during the}} passage of a mesoscale cold-air intrusion, probably thunderstorm outflow, and a synoptic-scale cold front. In these studies the radar data are compared to conventional meteorological data obtained from the WKY tower facility for the purpose of radar data interpretation. It is shown that the acoustic radar echoes reveal the boundary between warm and cold air and other areas of turbulent mixing, regions of strong vertical temperature gradients, and areas of weak or no wind shear. The third case study examines the relationship between the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> inversion and the low-level wind maximum or jet in the light of conclusions presented by Blackadar (1957). The low-level jet is seen forming well above the top of the inversion. Sudden rapid growth of the inversion occurs which brings the top of the inversion to a height equal that of the jet. Coincident with the rapid growth of the inversion is a sudden decrease in the intensity of the acoustic radar echoes in the inversion layer. It is suggested that the decrease in echo intensity reveals a decrease in turbulent mixing in the inversion layer as predicted by Blackadar. It is concluded that the acoustic radar can be a valuable tool for study in the lower atmosphere...|$|R

METHODS: Before and after 1 year of CPAP treatment, a total of 207 CPAP-compliant male patients (age 26 - 77) received a survey with questions drawn from two self-administered questionnaires on sexuality - Life Satisfaction 11 (LiSat- 11) and brief sexual function inventory (BSFI). For assessment of daytime sleepiness, we used the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). RESULTS: Response rate was 76 %. We found no significant changes in satisfaction with relation to partner or life as a whole, but satisfaction with sexual life (LiSat- 11) and both general and functional aspects of sexuality (BSFI) were significantly improved after 1 year of CPAP treatment. ESS score decreased significantly after 1 year of CPAP treatment. CONCLUSION: One year of CPAP treatment improves all aspects of sexual function in male patients with OSA.

50|$|Direct radiant cooling - In a {{building}} designed to optimize direct radiation cooling, the building roof {{acts as a}} heat sink to absorb the daily internal loads. The roof acts as the best heat sink {{because it is the}} greatest surface exposed to the night sky. Radiate heat transfer with the night sky will remove heat from the building roof, thus cooling the building structure. Roof ponds are an example of this strategy. The roof pond design became popular with the development of the Sky thermal system designed by Harold Hay in 1977. There are various designs and configurations for the roof pond system but the concept is the same for all designs. The roof uses water, either plastic bags filled with water or an open pond, as the heat sink while a system of movable insulation panels regulate the mode of heating or cooling. During daytime in the summer, the water on the roof is protected from the solar radiation and ambient air temperature by movable insulation, which allows it to serve as a heat sink and absorb the heat generated inside through the ceiling. At night, the panels are retracted to allow <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> between the roof pond and the night sky, thus removing the stored heat. In winter, the process is reversed so that the roof pond is allowed to absorb solar radiation during the day and release it during the night into the space below.|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{measurements}} of ozone were made using a tethered balloon at the Linyuan site in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan. Ozone was monitored at altitudes of 0, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 m from November 23 to 25 in 2005. The potential temperature profiles revealed a stable atmosphere {{during the study}} period, {{largely because of the}} dominance of the high-pressure system and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> cooling close to the surface. The mixing height was low (50 - 300 m), particularly in the late night and early morning. The surface ozone concentrations that were predicted using TAPM (The Air Pollution Model) were high (33. 7 - 119 ppbv) in the daytime (10 : 00 - 16 : 00) and were low (10 - 40 ppbv) at other times; the predictions of which were consistent with the observations. The simulated surface ozone concentrations reveal that costal lands typically had higher ozone concentrations than those inland, because most industrial parks are located in or close to the boundaries of Kaohsiung City. Both measurements and simulations indicate that daytime ozone concentrations decreased quickly with increasing height at altitudes below 300 m; while nighttime ozone concentrations were lower at low altitudes (50 to 300 m) than at higher altitudes, partly because of dry deposition and titration of surface ozone by the near-surface nitrogen oxides (NOx) and partly because of the existence of the residual layer above the stable nocturnal boundary layer. The simulations show a good correlation between the maximum daytime surface ozone concentration and average nighttime ozone concentration above the nocturnal boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|The plant canopy {{surface is}} cooled by {{radiative}} cooling at night. Cooling of the canopy surface results in cooling {{of the surrounding}} air by convective heat exchange between the canopy surface and the air. Convective heat exchange at the canopy surface {{is proportional to the}} convective heat transfer conductance, which depends on the wind speed and the canopy surface area. We conducted physical model experiments using a polyethylene chamber to examine the dependence of the heat exchange at the canopy surface on the canopy surface area during nocturnal radiative cooling. We introduced three canopy models, each having a canopy surface area equivalent to a Leaf Area Index (LAI) of 1, 2, or 4. The models were placed in two polyethylene chambers located outdoors and exposed to a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation</b> regime. The canopy surface temperature of the LAI = 1 model was the lowest among the three models, whereas the convective heat exchange between the canopy surface and the air traveling into the chamber was the smallest for the LAI = 1 model. The convective heat exchange did not differ significantly between the LAI = 2 and 4 canopy models. The results showed that the air traveling through the canopy was cooled more at night, when the canopy LAI was large and the canopy surface temperature was relatively high. This air-cooling effect tended to approach an asymptotic value as the LAI became large. We were able to simulate these phenomena with a simple heat balance analysis of the heat exchange between the canopy surface and the air...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{atmospheric}} composition {{have been made}} over a remote rainforest landscape. A box model has previously been demonstrated to model the observed daytime chemistry well. However the box model is unable to explain the nocturnal measurements of relatively high [NO] and [O 3], but relatively low observed [NO 2]. It is shown that a one-dimensional (1 -D) column model with simple O 3 -NOx chemistry and a simple representation of vertical transport is able to explain the observed nocturnal concentrations and predict the likely vertical profiles of these species in the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). Concentrations of tracers carried over {{from the end of}} the night can affect the atmospheric chemistry of the following day. To ascertain the anomaly introduced by using the box model to represent the NBL, vertically-averaged NBL concentrations at the end of the night are compared between the 1 -D model and the box model. It is found that, under low to medium [NOx] conditions (NOx < 1 ppbv), a simple parametrisation can be used to modify the box model deposition velocity of ozone, in order to achieve good agreement between the box and 1 -D models for these end-of-night concentrations of NOx and O 3. This parametrisation would could also be used in global climate-chemistry models with limited vertical resolution near the surface.

60|$|Other {{phenomena}} of no less importance than {{the distribution of}} vapour, and more or less depending on it, are the duration and amount of solar and terrestrial radiation. Towards D the sun is rarely seen during the rainy season, as well from the constant presence of nimbi aloft, as from fog {{on the surface of}} the ground. An absence of both light and heat is the result south of the parallel of Kinchin; and at C low fogs prevail at the same season, but do not intercept either the same amount of light or heat; whilst at T there is much sunshine and bright light. During the night, again, there is no terrestrial radiation between S and P; the rain either continues to pour--in some months with increased violence--or the saturated atmosphere is condensed into a thick white mist, which hangs over the redundant vegetation. A bright starlight night is almost unknown in the summer months at 6000 to 10,000 feet, but is frequent in December and January, and at intervals between October and May, when, however, vegetation is little affected by the cold of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>radiation.</b> In the regions north of Kinchin, starlight nights are more frequent, and the cold produced by radiation, at 14,000 feet, is often severe towards the end of the rains in September. Still the amount of clear weather during the night is small; the fog clears off for an hour or two at sunset as the wind falls, but the returning cold north current again chills the air soon afterwards, and rolling masses of vapour are hence flying overhead, or sweeping the surface of the earth, throughout the summer nights. In the Tibetan regions, on the other hand, bright nights and even sharp frosts prevail throughout the warmest months.|$|R

In Egypt the thermal effect of roof is increased as one go towards from north to south. This study evaluate the thermal performance of different test rooms with different roofs construction; uninsulated concrete, insulated concrete, double, plant, and active concrete roofs, constructed under the effect of external climatic condition of very hot and dry region in Egypt (Toshky region). The external climatic conditions and the temperature distribution inside the roof construction and the indoor air temperature were measured. The results of this study recognized that the thermal transmittance (UValue) has a major role in chosen the constructed materials. Also the thermal insulation considered the suitable manner for damping the thermal stresses through day time and makes the interior environment of the building near the comfort zone during most months of the year. Natural night and forced ventilation are more important in improving the internal conditions. The construction roof systems show that the indoor air temperature thermal damping reach to 96 %, 90 %, 89 %, and 76 % for insulated concrete, double, planted and uninsulated concrete roofs.
