5000|$|Sardinians in {{the late}} nineteenth century began to hatch {{feelings}} of revenge and rebellion against authority.It is these feelings created the idealization of the figure of the bandit, seen not as a criminal, but as a hero and a liberator. After all, they called themselves fighters.The wrongs which the bandit revenge, they were considered a defense against bullying and ill-treatments revenge was considered justice if not a duty.And here was formed in the figure of the people bandit-hero.The economist Giorgio Todde told of a bandit who jumped into a river to save a carabiniere who had fallen while chasing him; this contributed to the growing admiration for these characters.Even Antonio Gramsci said he had been fascinated when he was young by the figure of Giovanni Tolu, the bandit of Florinas made famous by writer and journalist Enrico Costa from Sassari and from that of Francesco De Rosas.Sebastiano Satta felt admiration for the bandits beautiful, fierce and brave.The figure of the outlaw was also shot on the intellectuals.The Congressman Francesco Pais Serra wrote in his report:Even today, the legendary Sardinian bandit, perhaps more fabulous than true, attracts a mixture of romantic strength, brutal revenge and set of chivalric generosity naive minds of the people and a halo of sympathy naive, but tenacious, surrounds the head of him who, alone and weak, it is believed not fight against the right of society, but the claim against violence and bullying staff and authority: he knows how to use the cunning against the force, draw fierce and exemplary vengeance of whoever opposes, but protects those who, like him weak, protects and defends it.And it was so in fact, for the poor people who suffered the abuses of those who held the wealth and power.Girolamo Sotgiu in his History of Sardinia after the Unification, it calls into question a small group of owners, that with a basic but efficient system of blackmail imposed his will to the community. It was they, in fact, that the great majority of the population, peasants and shepherds could have land and labor, and so it was clear they wanted to obey if you physically get the chance to live."These characters also had control of the City Council and then at their command you could not subtract.In a nutshell, the bandit was the poor man who rebelled against the rich.Among the bandits romantic include:Bastiano Addis Tansu, said Il Muto di Gallura, made famous by the writer Enrico Costa; Giovanni Tolu of Florinas; Giovanni Corbeddu Salis of Oliena, called The Kingof the bush; the Serra Sanna brothers, especially his sister Mariantonia, called Sa reina (The queen) in the nineteenth century.Samuele Stochino of Arzana; Pasquale Tandeddu of Orgosolo; Giuseppino Càmpana said Rubinu, of Orune; Graziano Mesina said Gratzianeddu, of Orgosolo; Matteo Boe, the cold-eyed bandit of Lula, Attilio Cubeddu of Arzana and Giovanni Farina of Tempio in the twentieth century.The facts prove incontrovertibly that in reality, banditry [...] "romantic" [...] has never existed in Sardinia; it's just happened that some writers and poets have described the key romantic and they did rise to false emblem of individual cases of banditry bandits who began their career with a tragic crime of honor or a Vendetta for wrongs but that almost all, they ended up robbing and killing for profit.Who says that the brutality is one of the distinguishing factors of the new course, unaware apparently some chilling episodes of the past that is worth remembering.In 1899, the two bandits of Orune, Giovanni Moni and Giuseppe Goddi, killed a farmer of Benetutti in the presence of his wife and child; the disemboweled, quartered it, the detached head that they laid on a dry stone wall and the blood that was dripping with the curled mustache.The bandit Ciccio De Rosas of Usini, killed on the same day November 4, 1891, the doctor Giuseppe Michele Melis of Usini, Antonio Secchi and two women, Maria Antoinetta Sotgia and Clotilde Coco, one of which was in an advanced state of pregnancy. On 20 February 1897 the Italian Crown Prosecutor in Nuoro, Nonis, in a public speech were somehow figure of the fugitive that, reads, <<lives of crops, robberies and thefts, which quenches the thirst of human blood capriciously, which ambushes macchiasenza to expose themselves, which does not shy away from the extreme cowardice to reunite with many others like him troublemakers, to give the agent the death of the police...>>Another Italian Crown Prosecutor in Nuoro, Marcialis, so called bandits in his inaugural speech of the <b>judicial</b> <b>year</b> 1900 <<This hyenas always thirsty for human blood, this monsters, which should cancel the memory ...>>The truth is that the brutality has always characterized the banditry in Sardinia:On January 3, 1937 in the territory of Benetutti, Giovanni Pala of Orune, with an ax smashed the skull of the young Andrea Bellina, 17 years old, as she slept; Samuele Stochino in 1928, the famous bandit of Arzana, killed with a shot at point-blank Assunta Nieddu, a 10-year-old girl.In 1960 in Orgosolo, the kidnapped Pietrino Crasta was killed by his captors with a boulder that crushed his head;in the New Year's Eve of 1966, to Ollolai, the fugitive Antonio Casula and his associates massacred the spouses Podda, sixties, and their grandson Michele of 11 years.The same applies with regard to the kidnapping of strangers to the sheep-farming world: in January 7, 1925 was seized a girl of 10 years, Wanda Serra, daughter of the mayor of Aidomaggiore, for which it was requested a ransom of 40,000 pounds, then reduced to 30,000.The child was found dead; authors were identified in the parish of Aidomaggiore, don Spanu, and Peppa Ziulu.July 6, 1933 were kidnapped the mayor of Bono, Pietro Molotzu, his wife, his daughter Maria, the teacher Pietrina Marongiu and the notary Ena; the kidnappers left all free except for the little Maria, 7 years old, for which demanded a ransom of 250,000 lire silver coins. The girl skeleton was found after more than a year.The authors discovered and arrested, they were bandits Congiu of Bottidda, Chironi of Nuoro and the Pintore brothers.With regard to the fury of revenge, the German traveler Joseph Fuos in a letter of 1773 wrote: <<If a Sardinian vowed to another deadly hatred, there is no way to escape the fulfillment of this curse, that or go out of the country, or to slay the opponent. It is said, therefore, a Sardinian who followed him to his enemy to Naples, where he took refuge: it seems like there was reconciled with him, and led him to the tavern and the brothel, and stabbed him in the act here venereum, to kill, as he said, not only his body, but also eternally damn his soul. Now he tells this idea even more, but who attributed it to a Sardinian, has basically met the favorite passion of the people, and knew that their thirst for vengeance goes to the most extreme limits to which a man can get her. So it is not uncommon for a Sardinian is not content to kill his enemy, but he also abuses his body with bites, cuts and dismemberment, in the most compassionate way, that just recently took place in Sassari and there two heinous examples .... How different is also the way of thinking of men! If I say to a Sardinian in my homeland a murderer must die without hope grace at the hands of justice, it does the sign of the cross and says that I was born in a cruel people. But if this same Sardinian killed half a dozen men because of miserable disputes, and sworn death to another half dozen (and similar cases in this country if it finds more than one) he will not find anything cruel. >> ...|$|E

Two of the justices were newcomers–replacements for two colleagues, Wiley B. Rutledge and Frank Murphy, who had died almost simultaneously, and with jarring suddenness, the summer before. The newcomers were working hard to master their new responsibilities and become useful members of an intricate and unique enterprise. But it would take them time-as it had taken all their predecessors, back to 1790, time-to learn the meanings and the methods of the enterprise, and to define their individual roles in forwarding the collective tasks.

40|$|THE TRADITION OF THE RED MASS The Red Mass is {{an ancient}} custom {{dating back to the}} 13 th century, when the solemn votive Mass began being celebrated {{annually}} {{at the opening of the}} <b>judicial</b> <b>year.</b> From the earliest of times, the Mass has been attended by the judiciary, attorneys at law, law professors, high ranking government officials, distinguished guests, and others who work in the legal arena. The Mass was intended to gather those from the noble legal profession for the purpose of seeking divine guidance and strength for the coming term of court. The Red Mass is celebrated in honor of the Holy Spirit, from whom flows the wisdom, understanding, counsel, patience, energy, and courage necessary for the administration of justice. Those who work in the legal profession prayerfully seek these virtues, which are essential to the courtroom, law practice, and public post. Originating in the great cities of Europe, the Red Mass tradition continues in Westminster Cathedral in London, and in other preeminent cathedrals of Paris, Rome, and other European capitals. The Red Mass came to America in October of 1928, where it was first celebrated in New York 2 ̆ 7 s old St Andrew 2 ̆ 7 s Church, located in the shadow of the towering state and federal courthouses. The tradition is celebrated annually in Washington, D. C. at the start of the Supreme Court term, where the justices are joined by members of the bar, presidents, members of Congress, law faculty, diplomats and other such officials. The Red Mass has further spread throughout this country, to venues such as Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Indianapolis and New Orleans, to name a few. The venerable custom derives its name from the red vestments of the celebrant, representing the tongues of fire of the Holy Spirit, and from the brilliant scarlet robes worn by the Lord High Justices of the middle ages. The Mass is attended by those of Protestant, Jewish, Catholic, and all religious beliefs who work in the legal arena, as they come together for this annual public celebration of faith and the law. Invoking this ancient tradition, Bishop John M. D 2 ̆ 7 Arcy has invited those who strive for the cause of justice to the inaugural Fort Wayne area Red Mass at the beautiful and recently restored Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception...|$|E
