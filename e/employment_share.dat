The Brookings Institution has published multiple articles on the topic. In 2005, author Michael Stoll defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than 5 mi radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 U.S. Census data. Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser and Elizabeth Kneebone's 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs. [...] These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a 35 mi radius around the CBD: 3 mi or less, 3 to 10 mi, and 10 to 35 mi. Kneebone's study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3-10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10-35 mile ring. This compares to the year 1998 - 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings.

We find that the relative stability of aggregate wage premia and <b>employment</b> <b>shares</b> hides offsetting disaggregate forces. First, while technical progress raises the relative demand for skilled labor within firms, demand changes associated with exports reduce the relative demand for skills. Second, within the class of non-manual workers, wage premia and <b>employment</b> <b>shares</b> of executives rise substantially, whereas those of clerks fall in a similar proportion. We also find that the export status of firms {{plays a key role}} in explaining labor market dynamics, as exporters account for most of both demand-related and technology-related shifts.
