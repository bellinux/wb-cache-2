Also because of the species ability to persist given the heavy grazing that occurred in the park, the wild populations of the plant looks likely to remain for at least another 50–100 years. The lack of recruitment is a concern for the survival of the plant in the long-term. A possible reason for its rarity is most likely the result of natural evolutionary and ecological processes.|$|E

She's got her life together, her businesses are successful, and she's still a bad bitch - but no longer afraid that showing her feminine side will make her come across soft or weak to a misogynistic audience. She can be the pitbull when necessary or the poodle when she feels like it and it's her flawless ability to switch it up that commands your attention." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News stated, [...] "To be specific, 11 long {{years have passed since}} the one-time Queen MC of Ruff Ryders Records completed a disc — 2002’s Eve-Olution. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>years,</b> she’s been tinkering with tracks, leaking some out while experiencing increasing frustration with her label (Interscope). Small wonder the long-aborning Lip Lock appears on her own label. The lag may also explain why we’re hearing a more mature Eve here, less angry, more open to pop." [...] Elias Leight of PopMatters said, [...] "Eve tries to sound current—Lip Lock is consistently dense with electronics that nod to today’s pop-scape. No Neptunes and Dre here, but plenty of low frequency throbbing and high-pitched glitch noises. Eve doesn’t reach for the dance floor often, but this is hip-hop that acknowledges EDM and dub-step. There are a few songs that sound very different from the rest and instantly seem like outliers." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>years.</b> Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
2500|$|While in {{hospital}} in 2008 after suffering serious head trauma, Kohl, then aged 78, married Maike Richter, a former Chancellery employee who was 44 years; {{they had no}} children. For the entire duration of this marriage, Kohl had a brain injury, was barely able to speak, and was wheelchair-bound. According to Helmut Kohl's son Peter Kohl, Helmut Kohl {{did not intend to}} marry Richter and had stated this clearly; [...] "then came the accident and a loss of control," [...] Peter Kohl said, suggesting that Richter had pressured his then seriously ill father into marrying her. Richter has been severely criticized in Germany, by Kohl's children, former friends and by German media. Following his new marriage, Kohl became estranged from his two sons and his grandchildren, and his sons said their father was kept [...] "like a prisoner" [...] by his new wife. His children and grandchildren were also prevented from seeing him by his new wife <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>years</b> of his life. In his biography of his mother, Peter Kohl wrote about the only time he had visited Richter's apartment, which he described as [...] "a kind of private Helmut Kohl museum" [...] full of Helmut Kohl photographs and artefacts everywhere; [...] "the whole thing looked like the result of a staggering, meticulous collecting for the purpose of hero worship, as we know it from reports on stalkers," [...] Kohl wrote. Jochen Arntz criticized Maike Richter in the Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2012 for building a [...] "wall" [...] around Helmut Kohl and controlling him; as a result he had also become estranged from many former friends disliked by his new wife. Kohl biographer Heribert Schwan describes Richter as [...] "more than conservative, rather German nationalist," [...] and said she insists on the right to [...] "interpretational sovereignty" [...] in relation to Kohl's life and that she has insisted on many proven falsehoods. It caused a scandal when Richter denied Kohl's sons and grandchildren entry to Helmut Kohl's house, the son's childhood home, after Kohl's death. Richter was also criticized for attempting to take full control of Kohl's funeral, and for trying to prevent Chancellor Merkel from speaking at the ceremony in Strasbourg. Richter wanted the controversial Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has fiercely criticized Merkel's refugee policies, to speak instead; she only relented when told it would cause a scandal.|$|E
