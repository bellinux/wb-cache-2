40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{a common}} {{neurodegenerative}} condition characterized by progressive motor, speech, swallowing, and gait difficulties. Risk factors for PD include male sex, pesticide <b>exposure,</b> <b>head</b> trauma, and rural living, but these account for {{only a small amount}} of the variation in risk. Recent studies suggest that for many neurological diseases, people born at a certain time of year are at higher risk of developing the disease. Small-scale studies have also suggested that persons born in the spring may be at higher risk of developing PD late in life. We examined the birth dates of 8168 PD patients collected from subspecialty movement disorder clinics across Canada. Patterns of seasonality in births or clusters of birth dates were examined and compared with the general Canadian population (from the 2001 census).

We investigated whether constant blue light (BL) exposure can eliminate the residual visual responses in a comparatively rapid RD rat model. Pigmented rhodopsin mutant S 334 ter line- 3 rat pups (21 days old) were exposed for 5 - 6 consecutive days to constant BL. Visual behavior was evaluated with an optokinetic head tracking apparatus. Electrophysiological recordings {{were made from}} the superior colliculus (SC). S-antigen, red-green opsin and rhodopsin immunoreactive residual photoreceptors were counted. Following BL <b>exposure,</b> <b>head</b> tracking was significantly reduced at 0. 25 cycles degree - 1 in 38 -day-old line 3 rats. With a 0. 125 cycles degree - 1 stimulus, the head tracking performance of 80 -day-old BL rats were {{similar to that of}} 220 -day-old no-BL-treated line- 3 rats. SC recordings also revealed a significant decrease in the residual photoreceptor activity. Histological evaluation showed reduction of the rod population in the central area of the light-damaged retina.

40|$|The {{association}} between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> injury and {{increased risk of}} neurodegenerative disease, specifically chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is widely recognized.

40|$|Background: A {{reduction}} in hearing sensitivity {{is common in}} adults and was previously considered to be normal as age increases. However, other health variables {{may play a role}} in the sensory changes. This prospective, comparative, hospital-based study assessed the risk factors (RFs) associated with sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in adult patients in a specialized tertiary hospital clinic in South-western Nigeria. Materials and Methods: Patients with clinical diagnosis of hearing impairment (bilateral SNHL) were the test subjects and age and sex-matched comparable group without SNHL were the Controls. Using a structured questionnaire, variables assessed included current and past medical history, family and social history, use of medications including ototoxic drugs, and prolonged medications. Results: One hundred and twenty-seven patients participated in the study comprising of 76 test subjects with SNHL (including 14 with suspected ARHL) and 51 controls. 59. 8 % of the participants were males. Univariate analysis revealed statistically-significant differences in family history, alcohol consumption, smoking, exposure to noise, previous ear discharge, previous head injury, hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, ototoxic drugs usage, prolonged medication and obesity between the two categories of subjects. Logistic regression analysis revealed family history, smoking, noise <b>exposure,</b> <b>head</b> injury, hypertension had significantly increased odds of developing SNHL.

40|$|Objectives. REM sleep {{behaviour}} disorder (RBD) {{is the most}} specific marker of prodromal alpha-synucleinopathies. We sought to delineate the baseline clinical characteristics of RBD and evaluate risk stratification models. Methods. Clinical assessments were performed in 171 RBD, 296 control and 119 untreated Parkinson’s (PD) subjects. Putative risk measures were assessed as predictors of prodromal neurodegeneration and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) criteria for prodromal PD were applied. Participants were screened for common LRRK 2 /GBA gene mutations. Results. Compared to controls, RBD subjects had higher rates of solvent <b>exposure,</b> <b>head</b> injury, smoking, obesity and antidepressant use. GBA mutations were more common in RBD, but no LRRK 2 mutations were found. RBD subjects performed significantly worse than controls on UPDRS-III, timed ‘get-up-and-go’, Flamingo test, Sniffin Sticks and cognitive tests, and had worse measures of constipation, {{quality of life and}} orthostatic hypotension. For all these measures except UPDRS-III, RBD and PD subjects were equally impaired. Depression, anxiety and apathy were worse in RBD compared to PD subjects. Stratification of RBD patients according to antidepressant use, obesity and age altered the odds ratio of hyposmia compared to controls from 3. 4 to 45. 5. 74 % (95 % CI 66 %, 80 %) of RBD subjects met the MDS criteria for probable prodromal Parkinson’s compared to 0. 3 % (95 % CI 0. 009 %, 2 %) of controls. Conclusions. RBD subjects are impaired across a range of clinical measures consistent with prodromal PD and suggestive of a more severe non-motor subtype.

40|$|As a {{countermeasure}} to the debilitating physiological {{effects of}} weightlessness, astronauts could live continuously in an artificial gravity environment created by slow rotation {{of an entire}} spacecraft or be exposed to brief daily "doses" in a short radius centrifuge housed within a non-rotating spacecraft. A potential drawback to both approaches is that head movements made during rotation may be disorienting and nauseogenic. These side effects are more severe at higher rotation rates, especially upon first <b>exposure.</b> <b>Head</b> movements during rotation generate aberrant vestibular stimulation and Coriolis force perturbations of the head-neck motor system. This article reviews our progress toward distinguishing vestibular and motor factors in side effects of rotation, and presents new data concerning the rates of rotation up to which adaptation is possible. We have studied subjects pointing to targets during constant velocity rotation, because these movements generate Coriolis motor perturbations of the arm but do not involve unusual vestibular stimulation. Initially, reaching paths and endpoints are deviated {{in the direction of}} the transient lateral Coriolis forces generated. With practice, subjects soon move in straighter paths and land on target once more. If sight of the arm is permitted, adaptation is more rapid than in darkness. Initial arm movement trajectory and endpoint deviations are proportional to Coriolis force magnitude over a range of rotation speeds from 5 to 20 rpm, and there is rapid, complete motor adaptation at all speeds. These new results indicate that motor adaptation to high rotation rates is possible. Coriolis force perturbations of head movements also occur in a rotating environment but adaptation gradually develops over the course of many head movements...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityChronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease marked by widespread accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau). CTE {{is associated with a}} constellation of symptoms, including impairments in cognition, behavior, and mood. Although initially described in boxers as dementia pugilistrca, CTE has been diagnosed in athletes from a variety of backgrounds, as well as military veterans and other individuals exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, the only shared risk factor for CTE is a history of single or multiple TBI. This work aimed to better elucidate the relationship between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts and the development and progression of CTE. Although the link between brain injury and CTE has been well described, the magnitude of this relationship has never been studied epidemiologically. The minimum prevalence of CTE was determined in a cohort at high risk of <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts, specifically National Football League (NFL) athletes. All former NFL athletes who passed away in 2011 were identified; a subset of these athletes were studied and diagnosed with CTE to establish a minimum prevalence of CTE. The characteristics of those examined and diagnosed with CTE and those undiagnosed were explored. These analyses represent the first epidemiologic study of CTE; the high prevalence highlights the relationship between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts and the diagnosis of CTE. Next, the relationship between the nature of athletic exposure and CTE was quantified. An athletic history questionnaire was developed and integrated into a mathematical model, incorporating data from sensors placed in football players' helmets, to identify the theoretical frequency and magnitude of an athlete's <b>head</b> impact <b>exposure.</b> This model was adapted for use postmortem, and {{it was found that the}} duration of athletic exposure, total theoretical collisions experienced; and the sum of the 95 th percentiles of the rotational acceleration endured, were all significantly associated with extent of CTE pathology. The relationships between the type of athletic exposure and the clinical presentation of disease and the specific neuroanatomic distribution of p-tau were also explored. These findings indicate the significant role of athletic <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts on the diagnosis and progression of CTE, clinically and pathologically...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Caffeine {{has been}} shown to prevent {{ultraviolet}} radiation-induced carcinogenesis and to inhibit growth of melanoma cells in experimental studies. We evaluated the association among caffeine intake, coffee consumption, and melanoma risk among three large cohort studies. METHODS: The analysis used data from 89, 220 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1991 - 2009), 74, 666 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1980 - 2008), and 39, 424 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986 - 2008). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of melanoma associated with dietary intakes. RESULTS: We documented 2, 254 melanoma cases over 4 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for other risk factors, higher total caffeine intake was associated with a lower risk of melanoma (≥ 393 mg/day vs. < 60 mg/day: HR = 0. 78, 95 % CI = 0. 64, 0. 96; Ptrend = 0. 048). The association was more apparent in women (≥ 393 mg/day vs. < 60 mg/day: HR = 0. 70, 95 % CI = 0. 58, 0. 85; Ptrend = 0. 001) than in men (HR = 0. 94, 95 % CI = 0. 75, 1. 2; Ptrend = 0. 81), and more apparent for melanomas occurring on body sites with higher continuous sun <b>exposure</b> (<b>head,</b> neck, and extremities; ≥ 393 mg/day vs. < 60 mg/day: HR = 0. 71, 95 % CI = 0. 59, 0. 86; Ptrend = 0. 001) than for melanomas occurring on body sites with lower continuous sun exposure (trunk including shoulder, back, hip, abdomen, and chest; HR = 0. 90, 95 % CI = 0. 70, 1. 2; Ptrend = 0. 60). This pattern of association was similar to that for caffeinated coffee consumption, whereas no association was found for decaffeinated coffee consumption and melanoma risk.

40|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect mucosal and {{cutaneous}} tissue. They induce several epithelial lesions {{ranging from}} benign warts to cancer. HPV infection {{has been demonstrated}} {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of cervical, vulvar, penile, anal, skin, head and neck cancers. HPV infection is associated with benign and malignant lesions in the hereditary skin disease Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), characterized by cutaneous lesions that progress to squamous cell carcinoma after UV <b>exposure.</b> <b>Head</b> and neck tumor (HNSCC) patients have been classified into two epidemiological entities, corresponding to either alcohol/tobacco use or HPV infection. High risk mucosal HPV is involved in the pathogenesis of a subset of HNSCC, particularly those that arise from the lingual and palatine tonsils within the oropharynx. Although low risk HPV have been found in several cancers, their gene products do not induce immortalization per se, and they probably need other co-factors to modify cellular genes and contribute to tumorigenesis. Cutaneous HPV 20 has been found in a number of non melanoma skin cancers as well as in esophageal carcinoma and in HNSCC patients. HPV 20 infection combined with UV exposure promotes malignant progression in skin as demonstrated in HPV 20 E 6 /E 7 transgenic mice in the presence of chronic UV irradiation. These animals presented papilloma formation that lead to transformation. However, involvement of HPV 20 in esophageal cancer and HNSCC have to date not been elucidated. In this study, the cooperation between HPV 20 infection and a chemical carcinogen in the pathogenesis of oropharynx and esophageal cancer was investigated. The synthetic carcinogen 4 -NQO is a UV-mimetic that shares the same mechanistic action with the carcinogenic compounds present in tobacco. In order to examine its involvement (comparable with the effect of tobacco) in increasing the viral oncogenic potential, 4 -NQO was applied either to cells or organotypic cultures and combined with HPV 20 by following two approaches: Promoter activation assays demonstrated that HPV 20 E 6 and/or E 7 up-regulated its own viral promoter and this effect was further enhanced by 4 -NQO treatment. These changes in the viral promoter activity may indicate a positive cooperation between the virus and the chemical in the onset of disease. Secondly, alterations in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and skin barrier functionality were studied in organotypic cultures expressing HPV 20 E 6 and treated with 4 -NQO. Although these cultures were able to stratify and differentiate they failed to form a normal epidermis. Moreover, the normal differentiation markers pattern was disturbed, resembling simpler epithelia and this phenotype was enhanced after 4 -NQO treatment. Cellular protein p 53 accumulated whereas p 21 CIP 1 and ΔNp 63 α modifed their expression pattern in the epithelia. Organotypic raft cultures expressing HPV 20 E 6 gene presented foamy-like keratinocytes resembling the typical structures found in Epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients and pityriasis versicolor -like lesions infected with HPV 20. In addition, HPV 20 E 6 expression was capable of altering the functionality of the skin barrier function by abrogation of tight junction formation in the stratum granulosum and by changes in the lipid metabolism of the skin leading to its accumulation and deregulated composition. Disruption of the skin barrier has been observed in a number of cutaneous diseases as ichthyosis, atopic dermatitis and other eczemas. These studies provide insight into the functionality of HPV 20 E 6 in the epidermis. Moreover, the up-regulation in viral promoter activity and alterations in differentiation pattern under the context of HPV 20 E 6 expression and 4 -NQO treatment compared with pLXSN and HPV 16 E 6 /E 7 controls showed the cooperation between HPV 20 and chemical carcinogens. However, epithelial transformation was not observed and longer 4 -NQO treatment would be necessary to analyze its influence in malignancy. Taken together, the conclusions obtained in the present work will be helpful in future experiments to elucidate the role of HPV 20 infection and chemical carcinogens in the pathogenesis of esophageal and oropharyngeal tumors...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{neurological}} damage {{as a result}} of chronic repetitive head trauma is a major concern for football athletes today. Repetitive concussions have been linked to many neurological disorders. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} repetitive subconcussive events can contribute to long-term neurodegeneration. For these reasons, it is important to understand the effect repetitive subconcussive head trauma has on brain health in young athletes. Past research has demonstrated that cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), an important mediator of cerebrovascular regulation, is impaired following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This impairment increases susceptibility to secondary injury following mTBI. In this study, Breath-Hold (BH) task based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to track CVR changes in asymptomatic high school football athletes across three competition seasons. Athletes in the first competition season had higher <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts than the athletes during the second and the third seasons. Baseline scans were acquired before the start of the season, and follow-up scans were obtained during and after the season to track the potential changes in CVR {{as a result of}} experienced trauma. Noncollision-sport athletes were scanned over two sessions as controls during the first and third competition season. CVR decreased significantly in football athletes during the first half of their season in the first completion season but not in any other competition seasons. Controls did not show any significant changes in CVR. The results suggest that athletes getting higher <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts in short duration of time drives cerebrovascular changes that may place athletes at higher risk of getting injured. These results also indicate that the brain may not be able to adapt quickly to abrupt increases in contact activity (as associated with the beginning of practice and competition), transiently increasing risk for symptomatic injury. ...|$|R

In addition to the factor analytic work of the PIES, several other measures of family demographics, parental psychological adjustment (e. g., self-esteem and social introversion), child psychological adjustment (i. e., learning behaviors), and ecological adjustment (life stressors and <b>exposure</b> to <b>Head</b> Start context) were administered to determine construct and criterion validity of the PIES and identified factors. Results identified four moderately reliable parent involvement factors reflecting Home Monitoring, School Engagement, School Presence, and Educational Preparation. Only Home Monitoring was found to positively influence the Attitude Toward Learning and Competence Motivation of preschoolers learning behavior as rated by their teachers. In addition, it was found that parents with higher scores in low self-esteem and social introversion were more likely to score lower on all of the levels of parent involvement. Worries about finances and crime in the community led to higher Education Preparation scores in this sample. Finally, Education Preparation, Home Monitoring and School Presence scores were significantly at different levels of educational level, years of <b>exposure</b> to the <b>Head</b> Start environment, school role served in Head Start, and ecological stressors. Ecological factors {{play a significant role in}} Parent involvement attitudes but this role varies depending upon the type of parent involvement one is investigating. The implications for understanding the different types of parent involvement and their relative contributions to educational success of children are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{only a small}} <b>exposure</b> {{near the}} <b>head</b> of its eponymous dale, the Cressbrook Dale Lava is the least exposed of the major lava flows {{interbedded}} within the Carboniferous platform-carbonate succession of the Derbyshire Peak District. It underlies a large area of the limestone plateau between Longstone Edge and the Eyam and Hucklow edges. The recent closure {{of all of the}} quarries and underground mines in this area provided a stimulus to locate and compile the existing subsurface information relating to the lava-field and, supplemented by airborne geophysical survey results, to use these data to interpret the buried volcanic landscape. The same sub-surface data-set is used to interpret the spatial distribution of the overlying Litton Tuff...|$|R

Objective: Our {{aim was to}} assess the relation between maternal personal exposure to airborne benzene during pregnancy and fetal growth. Me t h o d s: We recruited pregnant women in two French maternity hospitals in 2005 – 2006 as part of the EDEN mother–child cohort. A subsample of 271 nonsmoking women carried a diffusive air sampler for a week during the 27 th gestational week, allowing assessment of benzene <b>exposure.</b> We estimated <b>head</b> circumference of the offspring by ultrasound measurements during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and at birth...|$|R
40|$|Four {{patients}} with high {{internal carotid artery}} (ICA) occlusive disease were indicated for surgical endarterectomy and needed additional <b>exposure</b> be-sides regular <b>head</b> rotation and extension. When indicated, in our clinic this is usually achieved by mandibular subluxation with interdental wiring. Due to dental wear and periodontal disease, all 4 patients were edentulous. As a consequence, the technique of interdental wiring could not be used. In this technical note we will explain a method for interarch fixation {{with the use of}} two ipsilateral monocortical miniscrews and wiring, and the use of patients' pre-existing mandibular implants and provisional overdenture. This method gives rise to an additional exposure of 15 to 20 mm of the ICA. (J Vase Surg 2009; 50 : 1519 - 22. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{microcephaly}} is {{a feature}} of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, it is currently unknown whether low-to-moderate prenatal alcohol <b>exposure</b> affects <b>head</b> circumference. Small magnitude associations reported in observational studies {{are likely to be}} misleading due to confounding and misclassification biases. Alternative analytical approaches {{such as the use of}} family negative controls (e. g. comparing the effects of maternal and paternal exposure) could help disentangle causal effects. We investigated the association of maternal and paternal alcohol drinking before and early in pregnancy with infant head circumference, using data from 68, 244 mother-father-offspring trios from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (1999 – 2009). In analyses adjusted for potential confounders, we found no consistent pattern of association between maternal or paternal alcohol intake before or during pregnancy and offspring head circumference modelled as a continuous outcome. However, we found higher odds of microcephaly at birth for higher paternal, but not maternal, alcohol consumption before pregnancy, and similar but weaker effect estimates for first trimester drinking. Associations with paternal drinking before pregnancy were unexpected and should be regarded as hypothesis generating, until independently replicated, although potentially important given the absence of guidelines on safe drinking levels for men in couples trying for a pregnancy...|$|R
