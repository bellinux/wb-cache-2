25|$|As a physicist, Gibbs's primary area of {{interest}} was spectroscopy. At the time, this was the fairly new and <b>exciting</b> <b>field</b> of research in physics. Physicists investigated the emission and absorption of radiation, creating an understanding of atomic structure. The new theory of quantum mechanics attempted to explain phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level. Gibbs was the author or co-author of over forty research papers, on subjects such as the ultraviolet spectra of isoelectronic sequences, and the hyperfine structure of spectra. He determined the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron by studying the intervals between the H-alpha lines of hydrogen and deuterium, and investigated the absorption spectra of organic compounds in solution.|$|E

Elaine Fort Weischedel reviewed the book for School Library Journal, and recommended it for teaching specific subject matter. She wrote, [...] "Pollution patterns, shifting ocean currents, destruction of rain forests, and other environmental changes were the heart of Jones's project, and this book might be used more successfully to supplement the curriculum in those areas than in units on space flight per se". Weischedel said the book [...] "provides a unique look at a new method of research and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this <b>exciting</b> <b>field</b> of endeavor". Horn Book Review called the book [...] "a uniquely personal account", and said it [...] "features a crowded design, but the many color photographs throughout the text are fascinating".|$|E

50|$|What {{makes the}} system useful is the {{possibility}} of introducing waves of very high charge separation that propagate through the plasma similar to the traveling-wave concept in the conventional accelerator. The accelerator thereby phase-locks a particle bunch on a wave and this loaded space-charge wave accelerates them to higher velocities while retaining the bunch properties. Currently, plasma wakes are excited by appropriately shaped laser pulses or electron bunches. Plasma electrons are driven out and away from the center of wake by the ponderomotive force or the electrostatic <b>fields</b> from the <b>exciting</b> <b>fields</b> (electron or laser). Plasma ions are too massive to move significantly and are assumed to be stationary at the time-scales of plasma electron response to the <b>exciting</b> <b>fields.</b> As the <b>exciting</b> <b>fields</b> pass through the plasma, the plasma electrons experience a massive attractive force back {{to the center of the}} wake by the positive plasma ions chamber, bubble or column that have remained positioned there, as they were originally in the unexcited plasma. This forms a full wake of an extremely high longitudinal (accelerating) and transverse (focusing) electric field. The positive charge from ions in the charge-separation region then creates a huge gradient between the back of the wake, where there are many electrons, and the middle of the wake, where there are mostly ions. Any electrons in between these two areas will be accelerated (in self-injection mechanism). In the external bunch injection schemes the electrons are strategically injected to arrive at the evacuated region during maximum excursion or expulsion of the plasma electrons.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} changes in the {{dynamical}} behaviour of axisymmetric spherical mean-field dynamo models produced by changes in their geometry and topology, by considering a two parameter family of models, ranging from a full sphere to spherical shell, torus and disc [...] like configurations, within a unified framework. We find that the two parameter space of the family of models considered here separates into at least three different regions with distinct characteristics for the onset of dynamo action. In two of these regions, the most easily <b>excited</b> <b>fields</b> are oscillatory, in one case with dipolar symmetry, and in the other with quadrupolar, whereas in the third region the most easily <b>excited</b> <b>field</b> is steady and quadrupolar. In the nonlinear regime, we find that topological changes can alter significantly the dynamical behaviour, whilst modest changes in geometry can produce qualitative changes, particularly for thin disc [...] like configurations.
