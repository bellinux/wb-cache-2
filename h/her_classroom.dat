As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to <b>her</b> <b>classroom,</b> telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E

While the students in her class are initially concerned about her many falls, they become jaded by how often it occurs and {{pay no attention to}} her potentially getting injured later on in the series.

25|$|Clara Barton {{became an}} {{educator}} in 1838 for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared {{well as a}} teacher and knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys, since as a child she enjoyed her male cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in <b>her</b> <b>classroom</b> since they respected her. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college town, she developed many friendships that broadened her point of view on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen. No one could exceed her outstanding service to humanity in war and in peace.|$|E

[...] They discuss Bajoran culture, a topic Miles learned about from Neela (Robin Christopher), his Bajoran assistant. At the school, Keiko teaches her class about the science of the Bajoran wormhole and the aliens that live inside it. This scientific view {{is different from the}} religious approach taken by the Bajorans, who believe the wormhole is the legendary Celestial Temple inhabited by their [...] "Prophets", whom they worship as gods. Her class is interrupted by one of Bajor's spiritual leaders, Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher). Winn questions why Keiko doesn't teach Bajoran religion in <b>her</b> <b>classroom.</b> Afterwards, Keiko reports the incident to Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). When Sisko asks Winn about the dispute, she says there may be consequences if Keiko refuses to teach religion. Meanwhile, Miles discovers an important engineering tool is missing, but is distracted when he and Neela discover the remains of a Starfleet ensign.|$|E

500|$|Linda Laubenstein {{was born}} on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. [...] Her mother worked as a special-education {{preschool}} teacher, while her father worked as a purchasing agent for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio {{at the age of}} five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of her}} life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from <b>her</b> <b>classroom</b> to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, so when she needed to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair up and down the stairs. She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.|$|E
500|$|Teaching {{was one of}} the few careers {{then open}} to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she {{attended}} the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. <b>Her</b> <b>classroom</b> approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had [...] "brought me into the Socialist movement... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as [...] "brilliant and gifted".|$|E

VanDerWerff enjoyed her role, and wrote that Holly injected an effortless sense of fun, despite much of her plot being nonsensical. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker praised Paltrow for {{being one of the}} first guest stars to perform well alongside Sue, and wrote that <b>her</b> <b>classroom</b> scenes made the episode [...] "one in which the guest star both stood out and meshed with the cast". The Atlantic Meghan Brown commented that Paltrow [...] "brought a massive spark to {{what could have been a}} one-note role", and her Atlantic co-author Kevin Fallon wrote that her energetic performance saved an episode that might have been [...] "in shambles without her presence". Canning stated that Paltrow's casting could have been distracting, but instead she fit the role [...] "seamlessly", and CNN's Lisa Respers France compared her performance favorably to Britney Spears cameo in the episode [...] "Britney/Brittany". Several critics stated that they enjoyed Paltrow's appearance despite experiencing trepidation about it prior to broadcast. Berk found her [...] "surprisingly great", and Poniewozik ssid that while her casting was somewhat distracting, she was able to make Holly a sympathetic character without overdoing her neediness and commitment-phobia. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post recommended a [...] "lengthy moratorium" [...] on internet criticism of Paltrow, suggesting that with her Glee appearance, her [...] "mission to charm the American public may be complete".|$|E

40|$|This study, {{framed within}} Vygotskyan sociocultural {{approaches}} to teacher education, aimed at reconceptualizing the thinking and subsequent recontextualizing {{of the classroom}} practice of a participating teacher. An Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher with pseudonym -Sara- was the participant of the study. Sara’s conceptions of teaching and classroom behavior were changed through awareness-raising of and critical reflection on her teaching behavior. This was done through replacing her everyday concepts by conducting three workshops and reflection on <b>her</b> follow-up <b>classroom</b> behavior videotaped by Sara herself. The {{results of the study}} showed that the participating teacher, over a process of struggle with her past experiences, gradually replaced <b>her</b> old <b>classroom</b> practice. The findings can be illuminating for policy-makers and material developers who are striving for finding a solution to classroom complex dilemmas.
