These texts usually include a huge quantity of unstructured information written in natural language. Thanks to automatic analysis and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques, {{it is possible to}} filter out information that is not relevant and, therefore, {{to reduce the amount of}} documents that users need to browse to find the information they are looking for. In this paper we adapted the JIRS passage retrieval system to work with three kinds of legal texts: treaties, patents and contracts, studying the issues related with the processing of this kind of information. In particular, we studied how a passage retrieval system might be linked up to automated analysis based on logic and algebraic programming for the detection of conflicts in contracts. In our set-up, a contract is translated into <b>formal</b> <b>clauses,</b> which are analysed by means of a model checking tool; then, the passage retrieval system is used to extract conflicting sentences from the original contract text...|$|R
40|$|The worldÂ’s biggest Employment Guarantee Programme, IndiaÂ’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) {{has been}} in {{operation}} in rural India since February 2006. In principle, the scheme is a self-targeted programme designed to provide 100 days of employment to rural households and {{to serve as a}} safety net. More broadly its aim is to reduce rural poverty through the creation of sustainable rural infrastructure which is expected to foster rural economic growth. This study looks at the performance of the NREGS from three perspectives - it examines the targeting aspect of the programme, the efficiency of the implementing PRI bodies and the impact of the program on various outcomes at household level. The study is based on primary data collected from 500 randomly selected households, 2249 individuals and 70 schemes located in 13 Gram Panchayats in Birbhum District of West Bengal, India. On the basis of this primary data, the study reveals that at least in Birbhum District the programme is far more likely to be accessed by poorer households (defined in terms of land holding, monthly per-capita income and other household related characteristics). At the same time there is a clear and substantial impact of left political inclination in terms of enabling access to a greater number of days of work under the scheme. In terms of the efficiency impact, the analysis reveals a clear violation of the <b>formal</b> <b>clauses</b> and the spirit of the NREG Act and thereby undermining the potential of the programme in terms of providing a safety net. In terms of the impact, the study finds no statistically significant impact on economic outcomes at household level but does find a statistically significant and substantial relation between reduction of stress related to joblessness and access to the NREGS. The estimates suggest that while the NREGS may not be creating any new employment, and may indeed be substituting for existing employment opportunities, the scheme is still considered valuable as it offers better working conditions. efficiency;impact;targeting;West Bengal;NREGS;Birbhum;labour-substitution...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative constitutionalism is the watchword in the 21 st. century, and the {{creation}} of a judicial network is an important tool to improve human rights protection. This paper intends to contribute in that field, reporting the constitutional framework and the main decisions held by the Brazilian and the Colombian Constitutional Courts in protecting housing rights. The comparison is justified by the historical proximity in the juridical transition in both countries – 1988 in Brazil and 1991 in Colombia –; and also by the clear inspiration that Colombia took in the Brazilian Constitution at the time of their Constituent Assembly. As the narrative may show, <b>formal</b> constitutional <b>clauses</b> were not the key element to assure some level of efficacy to the housing right; Colombian results seems to be more solid and based in normative parameters, even though the literal text of the constitution does not provide housing rights with immediate efficacy...|$|R
30|$|Focusing here on {{the issue}} of pay concessions, it is clear that {{decentralized}} wage bargaining proper may involve counterparts to opening clauses. Visser identifies arrangements in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and the Netherlands as cases in point. In countries such as Sweden and Denmark, opening clauses are described as “generalized,” in the sense that local bargaining controls much more of total earnings, more of which is tied to performance. In Norway, on the other hand, the use of opening clauses has been sporadic. The same is true of the Netherlands and Switzerland, where the clearest examples of <b>formal</b> opening <b>clauses</b> are from the past rather than contemporary in nature. While noting that this is also true of Austria, Visser cites the more recent case of the location clause contained in the 2011 metalworkers’ collective agreement that permits poorly performing companies to divide the collectively negotiated wage increase into a general part and a contingent, individual performance-related component.|$|R
40|$|Context. The {{well known}} {{problems}} of interpretation {{of quantum mechanics}} mean that physical law lacks a physical basis. Aims. To derive the formalism of quantum mechanics from assertions about the world with clear physical meaning. Methods. Kets are defined as <b>formal</b> conditional <b>clauses</b> referring to measurements in a formal language and have a natural structure as a vector space. Addition is logical dis-junction. The dual space consists of consequent clauses, such that the inner product {{is a set of}} statements in the subjunctive mood. The probability interpretation gives truth val-ues for corresponding future tense statements when the initial state is prepared and the final state is to be measured. Results. The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is formulated in terms of dis-crete measurement results at finite level of accuracy and does not depend on an assumption of a background spacetime continuum. Discrete position functions are uniquely embedded into smooth wave functions {{in such a way that}} differential operators are defined. Using finite dimensional Hilbert space, a continuum of states, for, is defined such that the inner product can be expressed either as a finite sum or as an integral. Operators do not in general have an integral form. The Schrödinger equa-tion is shown from the requirements of the probability interpretation...|$|R
40|$|Horn clauses {{can be used}} in {{many areas}} such as logic programming, {{artificial}} intelligence and <b>formal</b> methods. Horn <b>clause</b> solving is closely related to program verification. On the one hand, program verification tasks can be translated to Horn clause solving problems. On the other hand, Horn clause solving tasks can be accomplished using some of the program verification techniques. As a result, Horn clauses can be used as an intermediate language in program verification, decoupling the verification algorithms from the details of the specific programming languages. In this article, we propose a novel method for solving Horn clauses, which is inspired by a program verification method called trace abstraction refinement. In our method, solvability of Horn clauses is verified by alternatively analyzing its unfoldings and constructing and manipulating tree automata. Since Horn clauses can serve as an intermediate language for program verification, our method generalizes the original trace abstraction refinement algorithm, making it easier to be used for various program verification tasks. We illustrate some of the existing works on how to reduce safety verification tasks of multithreaded programs and programs with procedures to Horn clause solving problems.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the different ways in which syntactic means may be employed to serve as indicators of information structure and to trace the historical development these means underwent from the Early Modern English period up to the present. The research is based on a comparative approach to textual analysis, using two different English translations of Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy, one published in the early 17 th century, the other near the end of the 20 th. Both versions are analyzed in terms of the ways in which they express the same semantic content through different syntactic means, a special focus being placed on the sphere of individual <b>clauses.</b> <b>Formal</b> disparities between parallel syntactic units are investigated both from the grammatical and communicative perspective, mapping the effect of the differences in syntactic choices on the level of the functional sentence perspective. The study thus attempts to identify the extent to which the standardization of syntactic structures may be viewed as having exercised an influence over the communicative aspects of the language in the period between the grammatical systematization of the 16 th and 17 th centuries and the Present-day English standards...|$|R

Uz „vezivanje“ dužnika, nectere, u rimskom pravu se već u najstarije doba javlja i realno osiguranje tražbine - fiducia cum creditore, o kojoj je riječ u radu. Autor ukazuje na pokazatelje u izvorima koji upućuju na arhaično porijeklo fiducije, smještajući je u okvire Zakonika dvanaest ploča, te se osvrće na indicije o mogućoj pravnoj zaštiti fiducijarne mancipacije, kao osnovu uvjetnog, relativnog vlasništva, unutar legisakcionog postupka. The {{historical}} {{development of the}} Roman law of securities was definitely changed {{in the course of}} the 4 th Century BC with the enactment of Lex Poetelia Papiria de nexis, turning from the personal security, nexum, and consequential execution, to the real security, with fiducia as its first form. Formal conveyance of the ownership, and the elements of its restriction, in connection with the related institutes in the Family Law and the Law of Wills, despite the scarce evidence for the age of ius civile, point to its archaic origin. The object of this article is to examine available sources, indices, and the use of <b>formal</b> “fidi fiduciae” <b>clause,</b> concluding that in the scope of Leges duodecim tabularum, legal confirmation of fiducia existed in Tab. VI, I. Resulting from that conclusion follows the question of the legal protection of fiducia. Even though the prevailing opinion denies the possibility that fiducia became actionable before the introduction of the formulary process, its incorporation in the nuncupatio, and formal obligation on remancipatio, suggest certain form of legal protection. In author’s view, this protection did not have to be realized through specific legis actio, but accepting the formal part of Kaser’s theory of “Relatives Eigentum”, with “stronger” causa vindicandi, mancipio dans, after the purpose was fulfilled, would succeed in the process legis actio sacramento in rem as a result of his restored, conditional ownership...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to provide an account of dative clitic {{dependencies}} in constructions with raising verbs such as to seem in Romanian. Dative clitic experiencers as quirky subjects and dative clitics in clitic left dislocation (CLLD) constructions are discussed from a syntactic {{point of view and}} experimentally tested in a psycholinguistics study. The study contributes to current innovations in the Minimalist Program, presenting new perspectives on Romanian clitic dependencies in raising constructions partially addressed in earlier generative grammar. This study poses new questions regarding raising, the intervention effects of dative clitic experiencers, and the effects of clitic dependencies in ditransitive constructions. Chapter II presents an overview of Romanian raising constructions without dative experiencers. I show that Romanian possesses three raising constructions, based on the type of the embedded clause: subjunctive, infinitive, and indicative. Each of these has three potential locations for the nominative subject, argued to be generated in the embedded <b>clause.</b> <b>Formal</b> mechanisms such as Long Distance and Multiple Agree, Movement, Case and EPP are considered independent of one another. 	Dative clitic experiencers in raising constructions, analyzed in Chapter III, are claimed to be quirky subjects and to structurally occupy the highest position in the sentence. Having established the role of dative clitic experiencers, I discuss raising constructions involving dative experiencers generated and/or surfacing in various positions, and their effects on operations such as Agree and Move. I then discuss Experiencer Islands, formed by matrix and embedded experiencers in the same utterance, and present the contexts in which they occur. A Grammaticality Judgment Test confirms the existence of such restriction in Romanian. Furthermore, I present an analysis of Experiencer Islands and discuss observed exceptions to the restriction. Dative clitic dependencies such as CLLD constructions and Long Distance CLLD Constructions are also analyzed in this thesis. The experimental study presented in Chapter IV supports theoretical claims and demonstrates that Romanian speakers are aware of dative clitic dependencies, such as clitic experiencer dependencies and clitic dependencies in CLLD constructions, possess the grammatical knowledge of biclausal constructions involving dative clitic dependencies and have the ability to recognize such dependencies...|$|R
