Peter Serkin and composer Oliver Knussen were also there, as was cellist Fred Sherry. Though he was the senior of our group by many years, Toru stayed up with us every night and literally drank us under the table. I was confirmed in my impression of Toru {{as a person who}} lived his life like a traditional Zen poet." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 27 August, Hair {{responded to}} the release of the e-mails by stating that the ICC had been in {{negotiations}} with him prior to him sending them. He was quoted as saying: [...] "During an extended conversation with Mr. Cowie, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> make a written offer. The figure in the e-mail correspondence was in line with those canvassed with the ICC." [...] The ICC however denied they had invited a claim. In a press conference on 28 September 2006 Hair reiterated that he never considered retirement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} after Salk's discovery, many supporters, in {{particular}} the National Foundation, [...] "helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society'." [...] Called the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, it opened in 1963 in the San Diego neighborhood of La Jolla. Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, [...] "I thought how nice {{it would be if}} a place like this existed and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> work there." [...] This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.|$|E

2500|$|David Amram, {{first met}} Woody Guthrie in 1956. [...] In his {{report of the}} 2005 WoodyFest he remembers that meeting: [...] "Ever since that day we first met, I have always hoped that someday I would {{get the chance to}} go to Okemah, but with my crazy {{schedule}} I never had the opportunity to do so. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the festival, I realized that I would be finally be able to see his hometown, and be able to meet his sister, her husband and his remaining old friends from long ago who were still living there. By doing that, and by playing music and spending time with people who were also natives of Okemah, I knew that I would be able to understand Woody and his work in a deeper way." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the wedding. After the {{ceremony}} I dragged Lathrop aside.|$|E

6000|$|Eustace and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> meet him, also Lady Diana and her {{daughter}} and son, who was called well now, though far from strong.

6000|$|... 1802.--This September <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> devastate the moors of {{a friend}} in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I {{unexpectedly}} came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--'Yon's frough Gimmerton, nah! They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.' ...|$|E

I suppose I'd be tickled to death if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> sit in with that gang. I'm {{what they call a}} pariah, I guess. I'm the town badman, Mrs. Kennicott: town atheist, and I suppose I must be an anarchist, too. Everybody who doesn't love the bankers and the Grand Old Republican Party is an anarchist." ...|$|E
6000|$|OUR HOST. Mr. Lynch {{was present}} {{during the most}} of the time (say a little short of an hour), but three times he left the room. His testimony, therefore, would be {{available}} only as to the bulk of what transpired. On entering this carpeted den <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> a seat near one corner of the room. Mr. Lynch took a seat near the window. J. B. Winters sat (at first) near the door, and began his remarks essentially as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Marilla, but oh, {{what do you}} think? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> tea at the manse {{tomorrow}} afternoon!

60|$|Miss Mary. Yes, found him. And today Alexander Morton, the {{reclaimed}} prodigal, {{is part of}} {{the household}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> join. So you see, Mr. Sandy, there is still hope. What has happened to him is only a promise to you. Eh! Mr. Sandy--what is the matter? Are you ill? Your exertion this morning, perhaps. Speak to me! Gracious heavens, he is going mad! No! No! Yes--it cannot be--it is--he HAS broken his promise: he is drunk again.|$|R
60|$|And {{as for my}} exact {{knowledge}} of {{the bones of the}} leviathan in their gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.|$|E
60|$|Particularly, at that eminent council {{before the}} battle of NÃ¶rdlingen, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the council of war, both by Duke Bernhard of Weimar and by Gustavus Horn. They were generals of equal worth, and their courage and {{experience}} had been so well, and so often tried, that more than ordinary regard was always given to what they said. Duke Bernhard was indeed the younger man, and Gustavus had served longer under our great schoolmaster the king; {{but it was hard}} to judge which was the better general, since both had experience enough, and shown undeniable proofs both of their bravery and conduct.|$|E
60|$|My aunt's {{remains were}} removed from London, and were buried in the little {{cemetery}} attached to the church in her own park. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the funeral {{with the rest of}} the family. But it was impossible (with my religious views) to rouse myself in a few days only from the shock which this death had caused me. I was informed, moreover, that the rector of Frizinghall was to read the service. Having myself in past times seen this clerical castaway making one of the players at Lady Verinder's whist-table, I doubt, even if I had been fit to travel, whether I should have felt justified in attending the ceremony.|$|E

50|$|A {{total of}} twenty-eight nations from the Allies of World War <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> the {{competition}} and eighteen nations accepted the <b>invite.</b> China aimed <b>to</b> compete, but ultimately was unable to send any athletes to the games within the time scale. It did, however, provide medals and trophies {{in support of the}} games. The Kingdom of Hejaz sent a delegation but with no athletes, choosing to demonstrate the skills of their Arabian horsemen instead. A full list of participants was made by the organisers.|$|R
60|$|Our party did not {{separate}} until quite late. Suppers were eaten in 1802; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> {{sit down with}} the rest of the family, and a gay set we were. It was then the fashion to drink toasts; gentlemen giving ladies, and ladies gentlemen. The usage was singular, but very general; more especially in the better sort of houses. We men drank our wine, as a matter of course; while the ladies sipped theirs, in that pretty manner in which females moisten their lips, on such occasions. After a time, Mrs. Bradfort, who was very particular in the observance of forms, gaily called on Mr. Hardinge for his toast.|$|E
60|$|Having spent a {{somewhat}} listless morning, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> accompany {{them to the}} house of Mr. Bingley, one of the Glorious Four. Mr. Bingley was really a very nice young fellow, living in a house far more worthy of the name than the slovenly rancho tenanted by his neighbour Winchcombe. He was the favourite of the colonists, having more money than the others, and keeping two servants. Always on his reception-day he provided his guests with hot bread and fresh butter, {{as well as with the}} indispensable rum-bottle and teapot. It therefore happened that, when his turn came round to keep open house, not one of the other nine colonists was absent from his table.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had arrived}} in London at what is called [...] "the height of the season." [...] Among the operatic attractions of that year--I am writing of {{the days when the}} ballet was still a popular form of public entertainment--there was a certain dancer whose grace and beauty were the objects of {{universal}} admiration. I was asked if I had seen her, wherever I went, until my social position, as the one man who was indifferent to the reigning goddess of the stage, became quite unendurable. On the next occasion when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> take a seat in a friend's box, I accepted the proposal; and (far from willingly) I went the way of the world--in other words, I went to the opera.|$|E
