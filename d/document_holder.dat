During verification the reference number is extracted and compared with the reference number printed {{in the in the}} identification document. The approach combines optical and digital image processing techniques. The detection system must be able to scan an analogue driver license or passport, convert the image of this document into a digital representation and then apply the waterma [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} {{version of}} the traditional passport (ePassport) is nowadays issued by many countries to their citizens. A contactless chip storing personal details of the <b>document</b> <b>holder</b> {{is embedded in the}} ePassport cover. To prevent unauthorized reads of the chip's content and to protect its communication with a legitimate reader the Basic Access Control (BAC) has been introduced. Thanks to the BAC, only those readers aware of the secret associated with an ePassport chip can access its content. In this paper we show that a side channel analysis can be carried out for some chips secured with the BAC. In particular we analyze the chip response time during BAC operations, showing how the collected data could be exploited to mount an attack in order to get access to the chip's content. We have verified the presence of such side channel in real ePassports and stress that electronic Driving Licences could be affected as well, since the same access control mechanism is adopted for them.

40|$|The {{development}} of plastic card printers {{has led to}} the widespread use of identity documents printed on plastic cards, such as ID cards, driving licenses and access key cards. This paper presents a new security feature based on a technique for embedding a personalized microstructure into a photograph. This microstructure {{takes the form of a}} bitmap pattern embedded into the original photograph as a succession of balanced chromatic shifts. The amplitude of these shifts may be modulated so as to make the pattern fully apparent, just noticeable, or completely invisible under normal viewing conditions. Since the chromatic shifts cancel each other out in any macroscopic portion of the image, the global appearance of the protected image remains intact. The embedded microstructure may be adapted to each instance of the protected identity document. For example, it can repeat textual information already present elsewhere on the document, or it can include a code derived from data specific to the <b>document</b> <b>holder.</b> Furthermore, this information may be made fully readable without the help of a specialized apparatus. Such identity documents exhibit an intrinsic resistance against imitation, tampering and substitution...|$|E
