25|$|B. pseudomallei is {{intrinsically}} resistant {{to a large}} number of antimicrobial agents by virtue of its <b>efflux</b> <b>pump</b> mechanism. This mediates resistance to aminoglycosides (AmrAB-OprA), tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides (BpeAB-OprB).|$|E
25|$|ADP on {{the other}} hand binds to purinergic receptors on {{platelet}} surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium <b>efflux</b> <b>pump.</b> The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 PLCB2, resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces platelet activation. Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. Clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists.|$|E
40|$|Multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> can be {{involved}} in bacterial resistance to antibiotics at different levels. Some <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> are constitutively expressed at low levels and contribute to intrinsic resistance. In addition, their overexpression may allow higher levels of resistance. This overexpression can be transient, {{in the presence of}} an effector (phenotypic resistance), or constitutive when mutants in the regulatory elements of the expression of <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> are selected (acquired resistance). <b>Efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> are present in all cells, from human to bacteria and are highly conserved, which indicates that they are ancient elements in the evolution of different organisms. Consequently, it has been suggested that, besides antibiotic resistance, bacterial multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> would likely contribute to other relevant process of the microbial physiology. In the current article, we discuss some specific examples of the role that <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> may have in the bacterial virulence of animals' and plants' pathogens, including the processes of intercellular communication. Based in these evidences, we propose that <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> are at the crossroad between resistance and virulence of bacterial pathogens. Consequently, the comprehensive study of multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> requires addressing these functions, which are of relevance for the bacterial-host interactions during infection...|$|R

In this study, {{we report that}} overproduction of NlpE increases multidrug and copper resistance through activation of the genes encoding the AcrD and MdtABC multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> in Escherichia coli. Multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> cause serious problems in cancer chemotherapy and treatment of bacterial infections. Bacterial drug resistance {{is often associated with}} multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> that decrease drug accumulation in the cell (15). Bacterial multidrug <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> are classified into five families based on sequence similarity: major facilitator, resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND), small multidrug resistance, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion, and the ATP-binding cassette (2, 24). Of these, the RND family <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> play major roles in both intrinsic and elevated resistance of Gram-negative bacte-ria {{to a wide range of}} compounds including -lactams (15, 18).

2500|$|Bacteria usually acquire {{resistance}} to tetracycline from horizontal transfer {{of a gene}} that either encodes an <b>efflux</b> <b>pump</b> or a ribosomal protection protein. Efflux pumps actively eject tetracycline from the cell, preventing the buildup of an inhibitory concentration of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. [...] Ribosomal protection proteins interact with the ribosome and dislodge tetracycline from the ribosome, allowing for translation to continue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pattern of}} {{resistance}} to antimicrobials is distinctive, and helps to differentiate the organism from P.aeruginosa. [...] The majority of B.pseudomallei isolates are intrinsically resistant to all aminoglycosides (via an <b>efflux</b> <b>pump</b> mechanism), but sensitive to co-amoxiclav: this pattern of resistance almost never occurs in P.aeruginosa and is helpful in identification. Unfortunately, the majority of strains in Sarawak, Borneo, are susceptible to aminoglycosides and macrolides, which means the conventional recommendations for isolation and identification do not apply there.|$|E

30|$|These data clearly {{demonstrate}} that the tested compounds are substrates of bacterial <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> and should be combined to EPI {{in the fight against}} MDR bacterial infections.

2500|$|Bacterial drug {{resistance}} {{has become an}} increasingly major health problem. One of the mechanisms for {{drug resistance}} is associated {{with an increase in}} antibiotic efflux from the bacterial cell. Drug resistance associated with drug efflux, mediated by P-glycoprotein, was originally reported in mammalian cells. In bacteria, Levy and colleagues presented the first evidence that antibiotic resistance was caused by active efflux of a drug. P-glycoprotein is the best-studied <b>efflux</b> <b>pump</b> and as such has offered important insights into the mechanism of bacterial pumps. Although some exporters transport a specific type of substrate, most transporters extrude a diverse class of drugs with varying structure. [...] These transporters are commonly called multi-drug resistant (MDR) ABC transporters and sometimes referred to as [...] "hydrophobic vacuum cleaners".|$|E
2500|$|Alterations {{occur in}} Lipid A. Salmonella species reduce the {{fluidity}} of their outer membrane by increasing hydrophobic interactions between an {{increased number of}} Lipid A acyl tails by adding myristate to Lipid A with 2-hydroxymyristate and forming hepta-acylated Lipid A by adding palmitate. The increased hydrophobic moment is thought to retard or abolish antimicrobial peptide insertion and pore formation. The residues undergo alteration in membrane proteins. In some Gram-negative bacteria, alteration {{in the production of}} outer membrane proteins correlates with resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides. Nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae transports AMPs into the interior of the cell, where they are degraded. And H. influenzae remodels its membranes to make it appear as if the bacterium has already been successfully attacked by AMPs, protecting it from being attacked by more AMPs. ATP-binding cassette transporters import antimicrobial peptides and the resistance-nodulation cell-division <b>efflux</b> <b>pump</b> exports antimicrobial peptides. Both transporters have been associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. Bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes, which may degrade antimicrobial peptides leading to their resistance. Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria bind the antimicrobial peptides and sequester them away from the cells, thereby protecting the cells. The outer membrane vesicles are also known to contain various proteases, peptidases and other lytic enzymes, which may have a role in degrading the extracellular peptide and nucleic acid molecules, which if allowed to reach to the bacterial cells may be dangerous for the cells. Cyclic-di-GMP signaling had also been involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...|$|E
2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an <b>efflux</b> <b>pump</b> (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol.|$|E

40|$|Burkholderia cenocepacia is {{notorious for}} causing {{respiratory}} tract infections {{in people with}} cystic fibrosis. Infections with this organism are particularly difficult to treat due to its high level of intrinsic resistance to most antibiotics. Multidrug resistance in B. cenocepacia can be ascribed to different mechanisms, including the activity of <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> and biofilm formation. In the present study, the effects of deletion of the 16 operons encoding resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) -type <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> in B. cenocepacia strain J 2315 were investigated by determining the MICs of various antibiotics and by investigating the antibiofilm effect of these antibiotics. Finally, the expression levels of selected RND genes in treated and untreated cultures were investigated using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our data indicate that the RND- 3 and RND- 4 <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> are important for resistance to various antimicrobial drugs (including tobramycin and ciprofloxacin) in planktonic B. cenocepacia J 2315 populations, while the RND- 3, RND- 8, and RND- 9 efflux systems protect biofilm-grown cells against tobramycin. The RND- 8 and RND- 9 <b>efflux</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are not involved in}} ciprofloxacin resistance.

5000|$|Several {{trials are}} {{currently}} being conducted to develop drugs that can be co-administered with antibiotics to act as inhibitors for the efflux-mediated extrusion of antibiotics.

Verapamil, for example, is used to block P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of DNA-binding fluorophores, thereby facilitating fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content.
