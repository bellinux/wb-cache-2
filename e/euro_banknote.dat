5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued <b>euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> on a joint basis. <b>Euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept <b>euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of <b>euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|R

25|$|The Bank of Canada, Canada's sole issuer of bank notes, {{currently}} issues {{five different}} denominations ($5, $10, $20, $50 and $100).

Despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the 500 <b>euro</b> <b>banknote),</b> there are no plans to re-issue Canadian banknotes larger than $100.|$|E
25|$|The weakest the krona {{has been}} {{relative}} to Euro was 6 March 2009 when one Euro bought 11.6465 SEK. The strongest the krona has been {{relative to the}} Euro was 3.44 years later on 13 August 2012 when one Euro bought 8.2065 SEK. The weakness in the Euro {{was due to the}} crisis in Greece which began in July 2012 and fear of further spreading to Italy and Spain. The average exchange rate since the beginning of 2002 when the <b>Euro</b> <b>banknote</b> and coins were issued and 1 March 2017 was 9.2884 SEK/EUR.|$|E

2500|$|Generally, {{central banks}} in the Eurozone provide {{banknotes}} of one specific denomination each year, according to demand and a rotating allocation (determined by the ECB). Prior {{to the introduction of}} the euro in 2002, national banks produced several of the lower denominations to build up stockpiles. Since 2002 however, the Central Bank of Ireland has only printed €10 notes, [...] Although notes produced in other Eurozone states circulate alongside domestically produced notes, the country of origin for any <b>euro</b> <b>banknote</b> can be identified by a one-letter prefix preceding the serial number. Banknotes issued in Ireland can be identified by the prefix [...] "T" [...] on the serial number.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{degradation}} {{in the value}} of the U.S. $100 banknote (which was worth more in 1969 than a U.S. $500 note would be worth today), and despite competition from some more valuable foreign notes (most notably, the 500 <b>euro</b> <b>banknote),</b> there are no plans to re-issue banknotes above $100. The widespread use of electronic means to conduct high-value transactions today has made large-scale physical cash transactions obsolete and therefore, from the government's point of view, unnecessary for the conduct of legitimate business.
