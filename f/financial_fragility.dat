5000|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>Fragility</b> is the {{vulnerability}} of a financial system to a financial crisis. Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale define <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> as {{the degree to which}} [...] "...small shocks have disproportionately large effects." [...] Roger Lagunoff and Stacey Schreft write, [...] "In macroeconomics, the term [...] "financial fragility" [...] is used...to refer to a financial system's susceptibility to large-scale financial crises caused by small, routine economic shocks." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities</b> of Turkish {{corporate sector}} to exogenous financial risks stemming mainly from global imbalances, the realisation {{of which may}} lead to substantial increases in international interest rates and/or a sudden stop or reversal of capital flows especially to developing countries, by using the CBRT Risk Center and CBRT Company Accounts firm level data over the 1996 - 2005 period. The magnitude of the impacts of real exchange rate depreciations or interest rate increases crucially depends on the financial conditions, debt structures and intersectoral fragility linkages of the main sectors of an economy. In the presence of <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities</b> including a substantial liability dollarisation, real exchange rate depreciations may be contractionary. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that, in spite of improvements in the leverage ratios and interest risks after the 2001 crisis, liability dollarisation and short maturity structure of debt still appear to be the main sources of fragility in Turkish corporate sector against exogenous financial shocks. Small sized or low exporting firms are found to be much more prudent to liability dollarisation after the crisis. The positive and recently improving correlations of liability dollarisation with both firm size and export ratios may be limiting the risks when we consider the issues of ability to access to financial markets and debt-revenue currency composition consistency. ...|$|R

However, because of competition for funds, the chosen architecture is not complete and does not maximizes available liquidity. Because of the network of interbank relations, a small isolated liquidity shock may turn into a major systemic banking crisis. network, bank, contagion, <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Increased {{integration}} with global financial markets has amplified {{the complexity of}} macroeconomic management in India. The diverse objectives of a robust growth rate, healthy current account deficit, competitive exchange rate, adequate external capital to finance investment, moderate inflation, targeted monetary and credit growth rate, minimizing <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities</b> and maintaining adequate reserves need to be balanced {{in an era of}} volatile capital flows. In this paper we analyze India’s experience in negotiating the trade-offs between these varied objectives. We find that to minimize risks associated with <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities</b> India has adopted a calibrated and gradual approach towards opening of the capital account, prioritizing the liberalization of certain flows. Using empirical methods we find that instead of adopting corner solutions, India has embraced an intermediate approach in managing the conflicting objectives of the well-known Impossible Trinity – monetary autonomy, exchange rate stability and an open capital account. Our results indicate that the intermediate approach has been associated with an asymmetric intervention in the foreign exchange market, with the objective of resisting pressures of appreciation, and resulted in large accumulation of reserves. We also show that sterilization of this intervention has been incomplete at times leading to rapid increase in monetary aggregates and fueling inflation. Finally, we conclude that while the greater flexibility in exchange rate since 2007, has allowed pursuit of a more independent monetary policy and the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber, the hands-off approach has resulted in reserves remaining virtually stagnant since 2007, leading to a significant deterioration in the reserve adequacy measures. ...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> {{of the international system}} is the connection to exchange rate regimes. Barry Eichengreen and Ricardo Hausmann describe three views on the connection between exchange rate regimes and <b>financial</b> <b>fragility.</b> One view relates to the moral hazard created by the belief of market participants that governments will provide bailouts {{in the event of a}} crisis. A pegged exchange rate is a form of implicit guarantee, and leads market participants to expect such bailouts. A second view is that, due to lack of confidence in a country's currency, borrowers in that country seeking financing will not be able to borrow long-term, or borrow from international lenders at all, in that country's own currency. Yet often the returns of the borrower's project will be in the domestic currency. This is a source of <b>financial</b> <b>fragility,</b> because a drop in the exchange rate can cause a debt crisis, as debt denominated in foreign currency becomes much more expensive. A third view holds that the fundamental cause of international <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> is a lack of institutions to enforce contracts between parties. This lack of strong contracts makes lenders suspicious of borrowers, and can prompt a crisis should lenders begin to suspect that borrowers will not repay.|$|E

A key conclusion is that, if the economy is operating near potential, if the level of reserves is adequate, if the exchange rate is not undervalued, and if the flows {{are likely to be}} transitory, then use of capital controls –in addition to both prudential and macroeconomic policy– is justified as part of the policy toolkit to manage inflows.

50|$|Hyman Minsky has {{proposed}} a post-Keynesian explanation that is most applicable to a closed economy.

50|$|Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale discuss <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> {{as large}} effects from small shocks.

In their view, banks are risk-sharing institutions where deposits act to insure depositors against a lack of access to money. Even minuscule shocks can set off self-reinforcing price changes.|$|E

A strikingly similar crisis that stalled Japan’s growth miracle two decades ago could provide some clues.

40|$|All things considered, {{anything}} up to US $ 7 trillion of so-called quantitative easing (QE) funds has flooded emerging markets since the 2008 global financial crisis. These funds, created to stimulate a {{recovery in the}} OECD and to stabilise international financial markets, ended up mostly as emerging markets�� corporate bonds and loans (often after being leveraged into many multiples of their original value). They were then either mainly invested (Asia), or used (as in Latin America and South Africa) at best to finance economic activities which do not enhance productive capacities, such as residential construction, or used to finance deficits, M&A, capital flight {{and all sorts of}} financial deeds - including as fuel for any conceivable asset bubble. The enquiries of these issues, especially how corporations financed their investment, and how much of it took place, were subjects that fascinated Ajit. He was the first to find out that corporations in emerging markets relied much more on external finance than those in the OECD (where retained profits played a major role). The implication was that they were likely to be even more susceptible to the vicissitudes of financial markets - and as these became ever more weird (the almost inevitable outcome of hasty deregulation cum excess liquidity), the financial balances of corporate sectors north and south of the Equator ended up moving in opposite directions further than ever before. This is a key (if not the key) difference between current global <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities</b> and those {{at the onset of the}} current global financial crisis in 2007. This highly asymmetric corporate balance scenario is part and parcel of such a low interest rate and highly financialised environment, as now (among other things) so-called ���investors�� in search for elusive yields, inevitably have to take on more risk, leverage and illiquidity. And emerging markets have always been their markets of last resort. This is a vital (yet only implicit) ingredient of the peculiar ideas behind super-accommodative monetary policy; but the downside is the risk of more volatile asset prices (including commodities), and unchartered <b>financial</b> <b>fragilities</b> all over. Closer regulatory scrutiny worldwide, therefore, should have been an intrinsic part of such risky reflationary and monetary policies. But try to get speculators, traders and rentiers (or politicians in need of donations) to understand something, when their (shortterm) earnings, bonuses, share options and corporate-sponsored retirement plans depended on them not understanding it. The stakes for emerging markets' corporations, their economies, financial markets and wider society (and everybody else in the world for that matter) could scarcely be higher - but unfortunately these huge new challenges occur at the worst possible time, as our social imagination has seldom been so barren. financial fragilitie...|$|R

5000|$|As {{described}} above, {{many economists}} believe that <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> arises when financial agents such as banks take on too many or too illiquid liabilities {{relative to the}} liquidity of their assets. Note that asset liquidity is also {{a function of the}} degree of stable funding available to market participants. As a result, the reliance on cheap short term funding creates a negative risk externality (Perotti and Suarez, 2011).

50|$|Economists Roger Lagunoff and Stacey Schreft {{have argued}} that <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> arises from linked {{portfolios}} of investors. If investors have linked portfolios such that if one investor withdraws funds the investment will fail and the other investor will also take a loss, then any event that causes investors to change their portfolio could cause others to take losses. If these losses are large enough to prompt further portfolio changes, a small change could initiate a chain reaction of losses. Moreover, Lagunoff and Schreft argue that investors will anticipate the possibility of such a chain reaction, so that the belief that it may {{happen in the future}} could cause investors to reallocate their portfolios, thus triggering a self-fulfilling crisis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>fragility</b> levels move {{together}} with the business cycle. After a recession, firms have lost much financing and choose only hedge, the safest.

In this case, they know that profits will not cover all the interest all the time. Firms, however, believe that profits will rise and the loans will eventually be repaid without much trouble. More loans lead to more investment, and the economy grows further. Then lenders also start believing that they will get back all the money they lend. Therefore, they are ready to lend to firms without full guarantees of success.|$|E

There are two views of <b>financial</b> <b>fragility</b> which correspond to two views on the origins of financial crises. According to the fundamental equilibrium or business cycle view, financial crises arise from the poor fundamentals of the economy, which make it vulnerable during a time of duress such as a recession.
