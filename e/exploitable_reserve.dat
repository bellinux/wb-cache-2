Among them, East Open Pit has oil shale reserve about(760 million tons) and West Open Pit has (160 million tons). At {{the end of}} 2008, the company operated the largest oil shale plant in the world consisting eleven retorting units with 20 retorts in each unit, total 220 sets of Fushun-type retort. [...] Annual oil shale processing capacity {{is designed to be}} 11 million tons of oil shale, and annual shale oil yields to be 330,000 tons. FMG is constructing the Alberta Taciuk processor (ATP) to treat small size oil shale (particulate oil shale) which can not be processed by Fushun retort. The 250 tonnes per hour ATP processor, scheduled to start operation at the end of 2010, is engineered and constructed by cement and mineral equipment supplier, Polysius AG of the ThyssenKrupp and uses technology developed by UMATAC Industrial Processes, a Canadian subsidiary of Polysius AG. It seems that ATP Project like a Gordian Knot for FMG as which lasts more than 8 years. An Australian company named Procom had been invited since September 2012 to help FMG for the commissioning of ATP Processor as Procom claimed that they had ATP Processor commissioning experience. Procom operated the first industrial ATP application in Gladstone,QLD Australia. In late August 2013 the first oil was produced from oil shale out of the ATP, but it is still very hard to have continuous running for ATP plant.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} characteristics of the production and processing of oil, condensates and natural gas in the Republic of Croatia starting from 2000, until the end of 2014. Amounts of balance sheet (<b>exploitable)</b> <b>reserves</b> of oil and condensates ranges from 9330, 92 × 103 m 3 in 2005, to 13 471, 08 × 103 m 3 in 2013, while extracted amounts are gradually declining from 1332, 61 × 103 m 3 to 639, 96 × 103 m 3. The ratio of extracted amounts and reserves is gradually declining, meaning that a slight increase in reserves does not affect the extracted amounts. <b>Exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> of natural gas during the observed period fluctuate greatly. Being peaked in 2007, at 40, 919. 70 × 106 m 3, they reached a low in 2014, at 17, 932. 98 × 106 m 3. Unlike liquid hydrocarbons, the ratio of extracted and exploitable amounts is growing and peaked in 2014. Overall energy demands for oil in Croatia (shown as total consumption of crude oil) amounted to 3032, 8 × 103 m 3 in 2013, while demands for natural gas amounted to 2809, 90 × 106 m 3. It {{is interesting to note that}} the consumption of oil is rapidly declining, which is a favorable trend from the standpoint of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. While needs are partly covered by domestic exploitation, the dependence on imports of oil and natural gas is still evident and ranges from 75 % to 84 % for oil and 28 % to 46 % for natural gas, without major changes to the trend. The amounts of processed hydrocarbons are declining gradually, especially motor gasoline and fuel oil, while diesel fuel amounts remain mostly the same.

It requires the typically available quantitative data on the ore-body, with its three-dimensional block model developed upon accurate interpolations. Thus it allows estimations of <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> in function of various cut-off grades, such as the average grade of mineable ore, the tonnages of ore and waste rock, stripping ratios and profit estimates for different production levels. If cost evaluations of essential mine operations are available (such as ore mining, waste removal, ore concentration, transportation, indirect project costs and expected concentrate selling prices), the methodology will provide clear indications on the economic feasibility of mining, including the best available options at any moment.

40|$|In 2009, commercially <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> of oil {{were found}} in the Albertine Lakes Basin in Uganda. Along with a number of new oil exporters, Uganda now faces the {{challenge}} of using the new resources to advance its development agenda, while avoiding the corrosive effects oil often has on governance. This paper considers the tradeoffs and potential impact of alternative uses of the oil rent. It argues that alternative approaches towards absorbing rents should be judged from two perspectives – the direct impact on growth and living standards, and the indirect effect on governance. The Ugandan authorities favor using the oil revenues to build much-needed infrastructure; while this could have very large benefits, evidence of Uganda’s already deteriorating governance and mounting corruption raise questions about its capacity to wisely invest the oil revenues. This paper considers an alternative—distributing oil rents to the population through cash transfers—as a potential tool to mitigate some of the governance risks associated with oil revenues by giving Ugandan citizens a stake in their own resource wealth, and considers the strengths and limitations of such an approach.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the political economy}} of sub-Saharan African petro-states, by specifically examining the causal link between recent developments in private military and security provision and trends in the allocation and receipt of inward foreign direct investment to the region. It is argued that private military and security companies are playing an increasingly significant role in the political economies of these countries, by facilitating transnational oil and mining interests and effectively allowing foreign capital to circumvent prior concerns relating to security. To make these claims, this paper assesses a number of cross-national variables relating to institutional quality, economic security and political stability vis-‘a-vis inward foreign direct investment. It is found that many of the most poorly governed states in the region are in fact the greatest recipients of inward foreign direct investment, on account of their large and <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> of crude oil. The growth of the international private security industry is then framed as an effective causal mechanism in this context. It is argued that the industry services the institutional deficiencies of such states, and therefore privately secures foreign investment, insofar that matters relating to good governance are being increasingly minimised vis-‘a-vis global investment patterns to the regio...|$|R

The development of the unconventional natural gas extractive industry will also endow China with further negotiating power to obtain more advantageous prices from Russia and future liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers. This paper, adopting a comparative perspective, underlines the trends learned from unconventional fuel development in the United States, emphasizing their potential application to the Chinese context in light of recently signed production-sharing contracts between qualified foreign investors and China. The wide range of regulatory and enforcement problems in this matter are accrued by an extremely limited liberalization of gas prices, lack of technological development, and political hurdles curbing the opening of resource extraction to private investors.

40|$|National {{income is}} an {{indicator}} of the economic progress of the nation. Although the extraction of non-renewable resources lowers the quantity of the asset available to future generations, and results in a permanent loss of income generating capacity, this loss is not reflected in the System of National Accounts (SNA) income accounts. This deficiency has been recognised internationally by national accountants and work has been underway to develop frameworks and methods to take account of depletion of natural assets in a "satellite account". Satellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central national accounts, enabling attention to be focussed on a certain aspect of social or economic life or to vary the standard concepts to suit particular studies {{within the context of the}} national accounts. In a satellite account the depletion of natural assets can be considered as analogous to the depreciation of produced goods, whereby the current value of the stock of fixed assets declines from normal use. Depletion is not the only cause of change in the level of available resource stocks. New discoveries of sub-soil assets may increase the economically demonstrated stock of a resource so that the level of currently <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> from which the economic valuation is derived is not falling. New discoveries can also be brought into an alternative concept of income in a satellite account. This paper defines depletion and discoveries of natural assets, and discusses the conceptual framework underlying the measurement of depletion and discoveries, how adjustments for depletion and discoveries might be calculated, and how the national accounts might be adjusted for depletion of and additions to natural assets. Included in the paper are some experimental results from work being done by the ABS to compile a satellite account of depletion adjusted national income accounts for Australia...|$|R

It also examines the institutional settings’ fragmentation and conflicts, highlighting how processes and outcomes are indeed path dependent. Moreover, the possibilities of cooperation and coordination (including through U. S. -China common initiatives), and the role of transparency and disclosure of environmental data are assessed.

40|$|The {{production}} of world phosphate rock might reach to its peak before mid-century {{due to the}} potential demand for phosphate fertilizer consumption especially in developing countries, {{and as a result}} this could eventually lead to depletion of well-known easily <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> worldwide during the following decades. The slow natural-mineral fertilizer may be one possible strategy to meet the future possible lack of cheap and high-P sources. For this I investigated to what extant basaltic glass has enough capability to provide sufficient amount of nutrients, especially phosphate, for the food production in future. This was done by performing batch reaction rate experiments and MATLAB simulations. In this study the effect of grain size and temperature on basaltic glass dissolution has been studied using batch reaction (closed system) at 50 oC and 90 oC. The result shows that dissolution rate of basalt glass increases with the decreasing grains size and also by increase of temperature. The effective size of gains for dissolution rate were identified by using an ideal condition reaction (i. e. Matlab simulations), where found that very fine particles fraction (i. e. < 1. 5 µm diameter) are dissolving efficiently at 10 oC throughout year and can last for several years. The high-temperature experiments showed that phosphate was effectively removed from the solution, probably by sorption to secondary clays, oxides, and/or hydroxides formed during the experiment. A clay phase, probably smectite, is forming on the grains surface at 90 oC. The release rates of nutrients at 10 oC, suggest that the amount of phosphate required as a fertilizer is more than 400 - 500 Kg/ha/year, whereas if basalt is also used as a nitrate source, the amount of basalt required for these elements are 930 and 1852 Kg/ha/year respectively. Continuous supply of phosphate and nitrate can be ensured by taking some necessary actions like proper use of grain size fraction (e. g., finer grains) and pretreatment of basalt etc., to reduce sorption in the soils...|$|R
40|$|The Geological Survey of the Netherlands aims at {{building}} a 3 D geological property {{model of the}} upper 30 meters of the Dutch subsurface. This model, called GeoTOP, provides a basis for answering subsurface related questions on, amongst others, sand and gravel resources. Modelling is carried out per province using a core-database containing several {{hundreds of thousands of}} core-descriptions, the majority of which reach down to around 10 to 15 m, and a context of geological maps. This study focuses on the model of the province of Zuid-Holland where major cities like Rotterdam and The Hague are situated and the Rivers Rhine and Meuse enter the North Sea. A stepwise procedure consisting of automated database queries, 2 D modelling of stratigraphic surfaces and 3 D property modelling, resulted in a model of 50 million volume cells, each measuring 100 by 100 meters in horizontal directions and 0. 5 meters in the vertical direction, every cell having estimates of lithology (sand, clay, peat) and sand-grain size class data. Running simulations, using the Sequential Indicator Simulation algorithm, resulted in information on the probabilities of the aforementioned properties. In the study presented here we focussed on two subjects. First we compared the above described GeoTOP model with two "quick and dirty" models constructed several years ago. The most important and visible difference between those models is the geological framework model used, which has more detail in GeoTOP. By comparing the two, we show the effect of detailed modelling on the cumulative <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> of aggregates. Secondly we show the effect of data density on GeoTOP modelling results. Using GeoTOP of Zuid-Holland gives us a opportunity to study the effect on the results of the amount of data used.

30|$|Shale gas, {{which has}} become an {{important}} unconventional natural gas resource all over the world, has <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> of approximately 207 [*]×[*] 1012 m 3, accounting for 32 % of the total natural gas resources of the world (U. S. EIA 2011; Dong et al. 2012). The effective exploitation and utilization of shale gas are beneficial to increase the supply of clean energy, adjust the energy structure, and alleviate the shortage {{of oil and gas}} resources (Qiu et al. 2012; Dong et al. 2012). However, the increase in shale gas production mainly depends on the exploitation of horizontal wells and the development of hydraulic fracturing technology (Middleton et al. 2015; U. S. EIA, 2018). At present, more than 90 % of shale gas wells and 70 % of oil wells are required to carry out large-scale hydraulic fracturing for effective exploitation (Brannon 2010; EIA, 2018), resulting in the explosive growth of hydraulic fracturing applications. Inspired by the global shale gas revolution, China is also successfully conducting shale gas exploration. However, China’s shale gas reservoirs have the characteristics of a deep buried depth, large horizontal stress difference, low permeability and low brittleness index, making it difficult to form complex fracture networks after conventional hydraulic fracturing (Jiang et al. 2017). Moreover, as the shale gas reservoirs in China are mainly distributed in water-scarce regions, such as the Sichuan, Tarim, and Turpan-Hami Basins, and large-scale hydraulic fracturing requires the consumption of a large amount of water, hydraulic fracturing cannot be applied in these regions (Li et al. 2016 b; Cheng et al. 2017). Furthermore, the environmental problems caused by hydraulic fracturing, such as the consumption of freshwater resources (Arthur et al. 2009), groundwater contamination (Becklumb et al. 2015), earthquakes (Green et al. 2012), air pollution and clay expansion (Howarth et al. 2011), and storage and treatment of wastewater (Becklumb et al. 2015), has raised significant concerns from many scholars and governments. To meet the special requirements of shale gas exploration to reservoir according to the properties and geological environment, it is the focus of petroleum industry to improve the effect of volume fracturing and identify a substitute for the water-based fracturing fluid (Middleton et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016). Therefore, many new waterless fracturing technologies, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LNG) fracturing (Lestz et al. 2007), nitrogen foam fracturing (Gupta et al. 1998), liquid/supercritical CO 2 fracturing (Gupta et al. 1998; Middleton et al. 2015), and cryogenic fracturing using LN 2 (Mcdaniel et al. 1997; Grundmann et al. 1998; Cheng et al. 2017), have been considered by many scholars.|$|R

30|$|Inspired by {{the ever}} {{increasing}} world energy demand and the excessive consumption of conventional energy, {{the development of}} unconventional shale oil has gained extensive attention, because of its large reserves and potential production [1]. Shale oil is short for mature organic shale oil and the most representative energy listed under the unconventional energy headings. Although the world’s total known resources of shale oil is {{more than three times}} higher than that of the remaining conventional crude oil [2], the total <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> of shale oil has been estimated to be much less than the reserves. Besides, oil shale has been exploited for about 200  years, but the development and utilization of shale oil are restricted greatly so far. All these suggest that shale oil, confined in nanochannel, is difficult to be extracted [3]. The channel size of oil shale ranges from 2 to 100  nm in width [4, 5], which generates a large specific surface area and many kinds of surface effect. Under the influence of surface interaction between fluid and substrate, lots of new physical phenomena may be aroused, for example, water flows much faster inside nanotubes than in a classical macroscale tube [6, 7], anomalous increase is found in carbon capacitance at pore sizes less than 1  nm [8], water affinity in carbon nanotube changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic as the width decreases [9]. Being located in oil shale, with the strong surface interaction between fluids and shale substrate, the fluid exhibits a lot of different characters from that in macroscopic channel, such as the density distribution, wettability, and diffusion coefficient [10 – 12], resulting in different transportation properties of fluids through such nanochannel from those in macroscale channel. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Chen et al. investigated the transportation behavior of water inside a model carbon nanotube and found that the shearing stress between the fluid and the channel was size-sensitive, and they also verified the simulative conclusions by experiment on a nanoporous carbon in glycerin [13]. Xue et al. considered flow of decane in silica nanochannel under the driving force from gas flooding, and they found that initial pressure and interaction energy between oil and substrate {{played an important role in}} displacement of oil droplets [14]. Wang et al. simulated the flow of octane in quartz slits by MD simulations, and they found that the velocity enhanced with the increase of external force, channel width, and temperature, and they also found that the surface effect can dominate the transportation of oil in the nanochannel with decreasing channel width [15]. As mentioned above, the strong surface interaction between fluids and nanochannel has a crucial effect on the flow of the fluid in nanochannel. However, there is little systematic study on the effect of surface properties on the dynamics mechanism of oil transportation in nanochannel. Understanding the influence of surface effect on the transportation of shale oil in nanochannel is of great significance to promote the development and utilization of shale oil.|$|R

L'élargissement des <b>réserves</b> économiquement <b>exploitables,</b> la maîtrise du coût de production et la réduction des coûts des chaînes gaz des champs de production aux régions consommatrices, tout en assurant la protection de l'environnement sont les prochains défis à relever. Pour faire face à ces attentes de l'industrie, d'importants efforts de recherche doivent être menés dans les domaines scientifiques correspondants, afin de mieux appréhender les phénomènes et de développer les solutions les plus appropriées. En définitive, les progrès scientifiques et technologiques, nécessaires à l'élargissement des <b>réserves</b> économiques <b>exploitables,</b> à une plus grande accessibilité aux ressources pétrolières et gazières, ainsi qu'à une utilisation mieux ciblée de l'énergie face à la protection de l'environnement, demandent un accroissement sensible des efforts de recherche. Une telle politique ne peut se concevoir sans recourir à un partenariat plus large et sans une incitation et un financement substantiel de la part de la puissance publique, française ou européenne. This article begins by recalling a statement {{made at the}} 15 th World Energy Council (Madrid, September 1992) : during the next 30 years, fossil energy sources {{will continue to be}} the basis for all energy supplies. By looking at the conditions of this assertion within a difficult geopolitical context, it shows that one of the privileged routes is to increase research efforts to make scientific and technological advances that will make it possible to fulfill the demand for oil and gas {{at the start of the}} 21 st century. The R&D effort required to make oil and gas technologies available for the next decade calls for concerted research to be done, for only coordinated research will prevent the dispersal of French efforts (Fig. 6). Increasing economically <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves,</b> mastering production costs and reducing the costs of gas chainsfrom producing fields to consumer regions, while ensuring environmental production, are the challenges that have to be faced. To cope with these expectations for the industry, great research efforts must be made in the corresponding scientific areas so as to gain a better understanding of phenomena and to develop the most suitable solutions (Fig. 7). The leading R&D axes to be promoted between now and 2000 are then explained. Reducing exploration risks requires, above all, a better petroleum assessment of basins. The progress expected will be based on the scaling up of 2 D basin modeling to 3 D modeling for assessing the ultimate reserves of a basin (Fig. 8 and Plate I). Improving the determining of the geometry of subsurface geologic structures will benefit from progress in structural imaging, whose aim is to obtain an assessment of the position and shape of seismic reflectors. These are geologic concepts (the understanding the geologist has of the architecture of deltaic or alluvial deposits, of different types of reefs, etc.) which, based on geostatistics and expressed by numerical modeling, will make lithological interpolation among wells (Fig. 9 and Plate II), thus leading to the better characterization of reservoirs. In structures where there is already a good understanding of the formations, the progress expected for the years to come, thanks to geophysical techniques, will involve prestack inversion, which will ascertain important characteristics such as the presence of gas or even the distinction of two fluids as well as the obtaining of three-dimensional data. Concerning production from fields, the stakes for R&D are considerable since the problem is now to produce from the great majority of small and structurally complex fields, or even, in some countries, to resume production from fields hampered by a relatively rustic recovery method. Such undertakings are essentially based on a better understanding of reservoir dynamics. On line of reflection that is certainly important for the future will be to analyze behavior laws in complex cases. In this area as well, numerical modeling is what will synthesize all the data (Plate V). After the reservoir has been characterized and the production method decided upon, it is indispensable to ascertain the most effective ways of operating. In this area, the technical mastery sought after aims to reduce the cost-to-quantities produced ratio while ensuring environmental protection, for example such as replacing oil-base driling fluids by nonpolluting fluids. Achieving optimum production at less cost will require better use of the processing capacities already in place. This will be achieved by the development of multiphase production, in particular for marginal or deep offshore fields. Concerning new production systems and within a context in which oil companies are seeking to exploit marginal fields and deep-water discoveries under the best possible economic conditions, the Nomad project (Plate VI) for multiphase evacuation via a light floating support seems to be destined for a great future. To decrease costs, another alternative is to use automated and unmanned installations. Gas transportation often entails the constraint of exorbitant costs, thus compromising the competitivity of gas projects. This is especially the case for the international transport of natural gas in the form of LNG, which will expand in the most competitive markets only if decisive technological progress is achieved so as to bring about a substantial decrease in costs throughout the entire LNG chain. Lastly, the chemical conversion of natural gas into fuels or petrochemical base stocks may be considered as an alternative solution to liquefaction for production from gas fields very far away from the consumer markets. For both economic and environmental reasons, natural gas appears to be the best possible base stock for manufacturing synthetic fuels. All in all, scientific and technological progress required for the increasing of economically <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves,</b> for gaining greater accessibility to oil and gas resources, and to better target use of energy in the face of environmental production, require an appreciable increase in research efforts. Such a policy is inconcevable without having recourse to more widespread partnership and without incentives and substantial financing by both French and European public authorities...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and state of mining {{and availability of}} earth resources is also connected with the required state of the environment, human population, respecting {{the concept of the}} sustainable development, adopting new technologies and materials, globalization, the transfer of the capital in the form of investments, and with political and economic intentions of decision-taking countries and groups throughout the world. In the presented study I devote a minimum attention to the problem of energetic resources because such studies are numerous, easily available and well-known. Another reason is that the question of availability of fossil fuels is today especially a matter of politics. Therefore, the study is primarily directed toward the mining industry and availability of non-energetic resources. Basing on the development {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century, we can expect that in the 21 th the same mineral resources will be explored. Ceramic materials, glass, polymers, composite materials and laminates, which may decrease the demand for metals, will be certainly of a higher importance. The same metals however will be of use in new technologies and products. Commodities for which an increased demand can be expected with a high probability are: light, strong materials such as magnesium, titanium, carbon filaments and materials of petrochemical industry. The volume of production of plastics should overcome that of metals at the beginning of the 21 th century. The development of plastics is oriented toward regulating their durability or biological tolerance because of the environmental protection. Zirconium, tantalum, rare-earth elements, pure quartz in high-tech applications elements of platinum group iron, aluminium, copper steel is expected to persist as a dominant metal in the 21 th century concerning the produced amount. A high consumption of aluminium and its alloys could also be predicted. Copper will increasingly be consumed in technologies for utilization of alternative sources of energy. Concretes the development of second generation (nonporous and homogeneous) with mechanical propertie comparable to these of aluminium alloys is assumed. In the second half of the 20 th century, important changes in the world mining occured. Most European mining companies producing coal and metals dramatically restricted their activities. The reason were political and social changes in the Europe leading to the increase of expenses for the man work and protection of nature. The new environmental legislation complicated opening of new mines. The next important factor causing the depression of mining activities in Europe has been the introduction of the high-capacity marine transport capable to economically transfer goods from a continent to a continent. I am of the opinion that due to the lack of economically exploitable mineral raw materials, the Europe must adopt a solution, already realized in the second half of the 18 th century, when important personalities of the mining research, education and industry were concentrated to speed up the development of new technologies and their introduction to the practice; qualitative step was achieved in the field of mining which became an industrial production. A similar step could also be attained at the present time when European mining is looked on as a source of many problems causing negative changes in the environment. Till now, the development of mining and processing technologies and equipments was made with the account of safety of peoples present in the process and of the economy. Presently, the environmental requirements must be meet primarily. According to me, Europe has four possibilities how to withstand the pressure of ecologists and to render the resources necessary for its sustainable development: 1. The mining industry is global and does not depend on the place of its realization. The research and the work and business organization are essential. European research institutions may realize their research at the place of mining or universities. 2. It is necessary to establish an European commission, e. g. from outstanding mining professors and research workers, which would be responsible for the coordination of the mining research and definition of future requirements of Europe for minerals. 3. The European Community will provide finances for the prognosis and research of questions related to the saturation of European requirements for minerals. 4. Considering the unfavourable state of the amount of earth reserves, the development in Europe will be immediately interconnected with that in Russia having a sufficient amount of reserves. If this requirement seems to be politically unacceptable, the development of relations between USA and Kazakhstan on the same base (the presence of crude oil in the area of the Caspian Sea) should be followed as an example. From technologies which might influence the mining of 21 th century, I would like to mention: New information technologies allowing to determine structures of new deposits and <b>exploitable</b> <b>reserves</b> in them on the base of modeling economic and mining activity Technologies for reaching deeper deposits in the earth´s crust Exploitation at the sea bottom and in the outer space New methods of processing valuable components including mineral biotechnologies and technologies for the production of pure materials from primary and secondary resources...|$|R
