A total of 45 <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> were detected with pooled sera from 21 lepromatous (LL) leprosy patients and 5 additional clones specified polypeptides that reacted with antibodies in pooled sera from 30 borderline tuberculoid or tuberculoid leprosy patients. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> that specified antigenic determinants that reacted with sera from LL patients were condensed into eight groups {{on the basis of}} DNA hybridization experiments among the M. leprae DNA insert fragments. In addition, 11 of the 45 <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> did not hybridize to members of the eight groups nor to one another; these represent unique <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones.</b> None of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> identified by screening with sera from tuberculoid leprosy patients hybridized to each other or to any of the 45 LL <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones.</b> The polypeptides specified by the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> were usually fusion proteins with beta-galactosidase, ranging in size from 117 to 175 kilodaltons (kDa).

We first inserted a PCR fragment carrying the tetracycline resistance gene (TetR) into the β-globin gene. All <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> examined contained the TetR gene at the correct target site. Next, a PCR fragment with the IVS I- 110 G→A splicing mutation but no selectable marker was used to replace the TetR gene in a second round of GET Recombination. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> were selected by plating on medium containing chlorotetracycline and fusaric acid. Although counterselection for the TetR gene is not very efficient, four recombinant colonies with the IVS I- 110 mutation were identified among 480 clones screened.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for genome analysis of phytoplasmas, bacterial plant pathogens that cannot be cultivated in vitro in cell-free media. The procedure includes a CsCl-bisbenzimide gradient buoyant centrifugation followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated whole genome amplification. The latter step involves digestion of the DNA by a restriction enzyme with an A/T-rich recognition sequence. Due to the different A/T content in the DNA of the pathogen and its plant host, the fragments originating from phytoplasma are shorter and are preferentially amplified in the PCR reaction. Products obtained were cloned and screened by dot-blot hybridization. Results showed that about 90 % of <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> appeared to harbor phytoplasma specific DNA inserts. Sequencing of randomly selected clones was carried out and comparison with the NCBI database confirmed the bacterial origin for the sequences, which have been assigned a putative function. The origin of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> was further confirmed by the generation of specific amplicons from the phytoplasma-infected plant and not from the healthy control, using PCR primers devised from the sequences of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones.</b> This method {{could be used for}} genome-wide comparisons between phytoplasmas...|$|R

However, the industrial production of PT from Bordetella pertussis is impaired by slow growth and poor yields. To overcome these problems, we have constructed a minitransposon containing the tox operon under the control of a tightly regulated promoter responsive to an aromatic inducer. The expression cassettes have been integrated into the chromosome of Bordetella bronchiseptica 5376 and ATCC 10580 bvg.
