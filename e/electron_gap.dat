40|$|We study {{symmetry}} breaking quantum phase {{transitions in}} topological insulators and superconductors where the single <b>electron</b> <b>gap</b> remains {{open in the}} bulk. Specifically, we consider spontaneous breaking of the symmetry that protects the gapless boundary modes, {{so that in the}} ordered phase these modes are gapped. Here we determine the fate of the topological boundary modes right at the transition where they are coupled to the strongly fluctuating order parameter field. Using a combination of exact solutions and renormalization group techniques, we find that the surface fermionic modes either decouple from the bulk fluctuations, or flow to a strongly coupled fixed point which remains gapless. In addition, we study transitions where the critical fluctuations are confined only to the surface and find that in several cases the critical point is naturally supersymmetric. This allows a determination of critical exponents and points to an underlying connection between band topology and supersymmetry. Finally, we study the fate of gapless Majorana modes localized on point and line defects in topological superconductors at bulk criticality, which is analogous to a quantum impurity problem. Again, an interplay of topology and strong correlations causes these modes to remain gapless but in a strongly coupled state. Experimental candidates for realizing these phenomena are discussed.

40|$|The {{perovskite}} SrIrO 3 is {{an exotic}} narrow-band metal owing to {{a confluence of}} {{the strengths of the}} spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the electron-electron correlations. It has been proposed that topological and magnetic insulating phases can be achieved by tuning the SOC, Hubbard interactions, and/or lattice symmetry. Here, we report that the substitution of nonmagnetic, isovalent Sn 4 + for Ir 4 + in the SrIr 1 -xSnxO 3 perovskites synthesized under high pressure leads to a metal-insulator transition to an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase at TN > 225 K. The continuous change of the cell volume as detected by x-ray diffraction and the lamda-shape transition of the specific heat on cooling through TN demonstrate that the metal-insulator transition is of second-order. Neutron powder diffraction results indicate that the Sn substitution enlarges an octahedral-site distortion that reduces the SOC relative to the spin-spin exchange interaction and results in the type-G AF spin ordering below TN. Measurement of high-temperature magnetic susceptibility shows the evolution of magnetic coupling in the paramagnetic phase typical of weak itinerant-electron magnetism in the Sn-substituted samples. A reduced structural symmetry in the magnetically ordered phase leads to an <b>electron</b> <b>gap</b> opening at the Brillouin zone boundary below TN {{in the same way as}} proposed by Slater.

Atoms of many elements dealing certain transition state at ground surface elongate under the force of opposite poles influencing at their centre. On impinging electrons of instantaneous velocity at fixed angle to such atoms transfer transported energy resulting into their further elongation. When electrons do not impinge at fixed angle to naturally elongated atoms, they deal deformation behavior where stretching of energy knots clamping electron states remains non-orientational.

40|$|The quantum phase {{transition}} in iron-based superconductors with 'half-Dirac' node at the electron Fermi surface as a T= 0 structural {{phase transition}} {{described in terms of}} nematic order is discussed. An effective low energy theory that describes half-Dirac nodal Fermions and their coupling to Ising nematic order that describes the phase transition is derived and analyzed using renormalization group (RG) study of the large-N_f version of the theory. The inherent absence of Lorentz invariance of the theory leads to RG flow structure where the velocities v_F and v_Δ at the paired half-Dirac nodes (11 and 22) in general flow differently under RG, implying that the nodal <b>electron</b> <b>gap</b> is deformed and the C_ 4 symmetry is broken, explaining the structural (orthogonal to orthorhombic) phase transition at the quantum critical point (QCP). The theory is found to have Gaussian fixed point λ^*= 0, (v_Δ/v_F) ^*= 0 with stable flow lines toward it, suggesting a second order nematic phase transition. Interpreting the fermion-Ising nematic boson interaction as a decay process of nematic Ising order parameter scalar field fluctuations into half-Dirac nodal fermions, I find that the theory surprisingly behaves as systems with dynamical critical exponent z = 1, reflecting undamped quantum critical dynamics and emergent fully relativistic field theory arising from the non(fully) -relativistic field theory and is direct consequence of (v_Δ/v_F) ^*= 0 fixed point. The nematic critical fluctuations lead to remarkable change to the spectral function peak where at a critical point λ_c, directly related to nematic QCP, the central spectral peak collapses and splits into satellite spectral peaks around nodal point. The vanishing of the zero modes density of states leads to the undamped z= 1 quantum critical dynamics. Comment: Already accepted for publication in Annals of Physic...|$|E
