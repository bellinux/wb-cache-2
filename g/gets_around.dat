At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E

500|$|Although OK Computers {{influence}} on rock musicians is widely acknowledged, several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced {{on a wide}} scale. Footman said the [...] "Radiohead Lite" [...] bands that followed were [...] "missing [...] sonic inventiveness, {{not to mention the}} lyrical substance." [...] David Cavanagh said that most of OK Computers purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on The Bends. According to Cavanagh, [...] "The populist albums of the post-OK Computer era—the Verve's Urban Hymns, Travis's Good Feeling, Stereophonics' Word <b>Gets</b> <b>Around,</b> Robbie Williams' Life thru a Lens—effectively closed the door that OK Computers boffin-esque inventiveness had opened." [...] John Harris believed that OK Computer was one of the [...] "fleeting signs that British rock music might [...] returning to its inventive traditions" [...] in the wake of Britpop's demise. While Harris concludes that British rock ultimately developed an [...] "altogether more conservative tendency", he said that with OK Computer and their subsequent material, Radiohead provided a [...] "clarion call" [...] to fill the void left by Britpop.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{criticism}} towards the Avatar spoof [...] "In the Na'Vi" [...] goes towards {{the timing of the}} episode. Surette thought that it was [...] "n Avatar spoof that came about two years too late. This sketch had no redeeming qualities and should be erased from the minds of all Simpsons fans immediately." [...] Similarly, Marnell commented that in the episode [...] "The Simpsons' finally <b>gets</b> <b>around</b> to parodying 'Avatar' — a movie picked to death by 'South Park' and other series a year or two ago" [...] and further elaborated that [...] "t's almost a straight forward retelling of 'Avatar' without the biting satire that made the film parodies of previous years so much fun." [...] In general, Treehouse of Horror episodes take about a year to complete for the staff. This is because they have to do many original designs, such as characters and backgrounds. Prior to the airing of the episode, Jean revealed that the staff was already working on [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXIII".|$|E
500|$|Chris Johnson of Daily Mail complimented {{the costumes}} worn in the tour.

[...] Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News felt that the show {{would have been better}} technically if around thirty minutes were lessened from it. James Montogomery from MTV reviewed the concert at San Diego and said that [...] " [...] powered through and turned the San Diego Sports Arena into a raucous, delightfully raw discotheque." [...] Writing for the Las Vegas Sun, Joe Brown observed that [...] "Lady Gaga out-Cher-ed Cher, made Cirque du Soleil and Britney's 'Circus Tour' look like county fair carnivals, and made New Year's Eve in Las Vegas anticlimactic." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers avouched that the tour was [...] "an invigoratingly ambitious show, executed with vigor by its star and her expressive dancers." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said that the tour always provided [...] "something worth a snapshot: a sci-fi tableau, perhaps, or a skimpy, glittery costume. The more her image <b>gets</b> <b>around,</b> the better Lady Gaga does." ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{contemporary}} reviews, Time magazine declared [...] "Something" [...] to be {{the best}} track on Abbey Road, while John Mendelsohn wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his 'Something,' some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles <b>gets</b> <b>around</b> to it." [...] Writing in Saturday Review magazine, Ellen Sander described [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "certainly {{one of the most beautiful}} songs George Harrison has ever written" [...] and added: [...] "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that even what is not known can be understood." [...] In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as [...] "a real quality hunk of pop" [...] with a [...] "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison [...] "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of [...] "Something": [...] "It's a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will – in a big way!" ...|$|E
500|$|Machinima creators {{have used}} {{different}} methods to handle limited character expression. The most typical ways that amateur-style machinima <b>gets</b> <b>around</b> limitations of expression include {{taking advantage of}} speech bubbles seen above players' heads when speaking, relying on the visual matching between a character's voice and appearance, and finding methods available within the game itself. Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker include the ability to manipulate characters and objects in real-time, though the former relies on community addons {{to take advantage of}} certain engine features, and the latter renders scenes using non-real-time effects. In the Halo video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use custom software. For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights. Similarly, Atussa Simon used a [...] "library of faces" [...] for characters in The Battle of Xerxes. In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for Unreal Tournament 2004 and Valve Corporation's Faceposer for Source games. Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film Berlin Assassins. It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film Not Just Another Love Story.|$|E
