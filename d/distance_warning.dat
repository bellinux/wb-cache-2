40|$|Directional sound {{can be used}} as {{a warning}} signal to denote that failure to follow an {{indicated}} action could result in serious accidents. In some applications such as to alert a vehicle that is likely to intrude into a highway construction work zone, long <b>distance</b> auditory <b>warnings</b> are necessary. In such cases, directed sound could be utilized to warn the specific vehicle without disturbing other vehicles on the highway. This report reviews the currently available scientific technologies that can potentially be used to develop a long <b>distance</b> auditory <b>warning</b> system for highway work zone applications. Of these, ultrasound based parameter arrays and time delay controlled arrays of compact ordinary speakers are taken up for detailed analysis and experimental evaluation. An ultrasound based parametric array is the most appropriate technology for generating highly directional sound. However, if cost, installation, maintenance, and price are considered, the most suitable technology is found to be arrays of flat panel loudspeakers with time delay control. Such a system can be used to generate directional sound effectively for long <b>distance</b> auditory <b>warnings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{existing}} algorithms of vehicle rear-end collision have poor adaptive, high false alarm and missed alarm rates. A two-level early warning model based on logic algorithm of safe distance is discussed. The influence of road conditions, driver status and vehicle performance on the <b>warning</b> <b>distance</b> of rear-end collision in the driving process is analyzed. And for different driving conditions, a warning algorithm of vehicle rear-end collision based on neural network with adaptive threshold which can adapt to different status of the three main elements, human-vehicle-road is proposed.

40|$|In road traffic, {{the advice}} is to {{maintain}} a minimum distance of two seconds to the vehicle in front.

A headway time of two seconds is sufficient for the majority of drivers to prevent a rear-end collision with the vehicle in front. This is mainly the case on motorways, where the traffic situation is not very complex. It gives the driver sufficient time to commence emergency braking if necessary. However, many people maintain a shorter headway time, which increases the risk of rear-end collisions and multiple collisions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} workers' responses to proximity warnings of static safety hazards on construction sites using a location-based proximity warning system named the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS). A method of evaluating workers' responses to proximity warnings is proposed. The method consists of six variables: <b>warning</b> time and <b>distance</b> (the time and the minimum distance to a hazard when a worker receives a warning), dangerous time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to the hazard when the worker comes close to the hazard), and response time and distance (the difference between dangerous time and warning time, {{and the difference between}} dangerous <b>distance</b> and <b>warning</b> <b>distance).</b> Finally, whether a worker responds to a warning is evaluated against a two-second threshold and a two-meter threshold in terms of response time and distance respectively. The experiment was conducted over 17 workdays with the participation of 72 workers and resulted in 5391 warnings on a real-life construction project in Shanghai, China. The workers' responses were analyzed with respect to two factors: building trades and a-priori risk levels. The research found that workers responded to proximity warnings actively, but slightly differently across the selected building trades; carpenters had longer response latency in hazardous areas than ironworkers did, and response percentages were high for hazardous areas with high risks. The results also show evidence that PCMS has the potential to improve workers' safety performance. The limitations of the present study and future research directions are also addressed.

40|$|Abstract—Collision {{warning and}} {{collision}} avoidance systems are emerging automotive safety technologies that assist drivers in avoiding rear-end collisions. Their {{function is to}} allow the driver enough time to avoid the crash and yet avoid annoying the driver with alerts perceived as occurring too early or unnecessary. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review various mechanisms under development or developed rear end collision avoidance of automobiles. Some of the reviewed work include an automatic braking system that safely stops an automobile while approaching an obstruction to avoid collision. Another separate but related system is to have a detection device, which alerts the driver in case the automobile veers off the road by crossing either the centre or side painted lines. The braking system senses an obstacle, calculates the relative distance and applies the variable brakes automatically to maintain a safe <b>distance.</b> <b>Warning</b> devices and sensor mechanisms used in obstacle avoidance systems are also reviewed...|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} category, the {{proposed}} techniques use a contention mechanism to disseminate warning messages {{based on the}} distance between a receiver and a source node. An example of this mechanism is the timer- and probability-based protocols which aim to suppress the broadcast storm [11].

Being given the shortest wait time or the highest probability of transmission, the vehicle located furthest {{in the range of}} the sender rebroadcasts the warning message. Upon receiving this duplicate message, all other vehicles withdraw their intention to rebroadcast. The timer and probability based protocols suffer from packet collisions due to nodes selecting the same probability or wait time for transmission.

This study aims to discover which infrastructural adjustments can contribute towards reducing the number of older road accident victims. Based on the available literature, an inventory has been made of which infrastructural measures can be taken to increase the safety of older road users (car drivers as well as cyclists and pedestrians). The relevant measures are discussed. The study is concerned with measures that take the functional limitations of the older road user into account and that are relevant for the traffic situations in which there are relatively many accidents involving the elderly in which they are the responsible party. Preceding this, the concomitant functional limitations of old age are described, and those accident types in which the elderly appear to be more often responsible. The design elements offered all concern intersections (at-grade) and (grade separated) interchanges.

40|$|A new {{navigation}} method, {{called a}} Line of Sight Counteraction Navigation (LOSCAN) algorithm {{has been introduced}} to aid manoeuvre decision making for collision avoidance based on a two-ship encounter. The LOSCAN algorithm is derived from {{an extension of the}} basic principle of traditional missile proportional navigation, recognising that the objective of the latter is target capture rather than target avoidance.

Baseline events will be drawn from data that do not include such events. To accommodate the different needs of the research questions these baseline events will be selected randomly as well as stratified according to predefined criteria in order to have comparable situations with regard to the identified SCEs from all available trips. Risks will be calculated for engaging in secondary tasks, looking away from the road, being drowsy and driving riskily. Additionally this task will look into chains of contributing factors to reveal patterns leading to specific critical events. The analysis will mostly rely on video data. Sensor data will be used to identify relevant episodes for video annotation. Video analysis will then be used to verify whether a candidate event is indeed a critical event. By means of video annotation relevant factors will be extracted that cannot be directly reliably measured yet, such as secondary task performance. Safety-critical and baseline events will be the main data source for answering the research questions.

40|$|Abstract—This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility of pedestrian collision warnings presented via different sensory modalities in a driving simulator. Despite the well-established fact that reaction times (RT) are faster under S-R compatible conditions, the majority of collision warning research has used S-R incompatible warnings (i. e., the warning comes {{from the direction of the}} obstacle to be avoided not the desired response direction). Thirty-two participants in a fixed-base driving simulator drove on a three-lane urban road in which pedestrians randomly walked from the sidewalk into the roadway. Collision warnings in two different modalities (tactile and auditory) were compared with a no warning condition. Participants were equally divided into one of four conditions representing all combinations of two levels of warning S-R compatibility (compatible and incompatible) and two levels of warning timing (early and late). For early warnings, incompatible warnings were most effective as shown by a significantly shorter steering RT and larger clearance <b>distance.</b> For late <b>warnings,</b> compatible warnings were most effective. For early warnings, RTs were significantly faster in the tactile condition. The relationship between collision warning effectiveness and S-R compatibility in driving is dependent on whether the driver has time to evaluate the situation before collision will occur. Our findings have important implications for the design of effective tactile and auditory collision warning systems. However, further research is needed to determine if these effects occur in more representative driving conditions (e. g., lower pedestrian incursion rate and unreliable warnings).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a simulation model of fighter operations, {{and sets it}} in the context of a hierarchy of defence models. The fighter model is then applied to two problems which developed from an assessment of the contribution of sensors to the air defence of the UK. These concern the influence of raid indirect routing and sensor information accuracy on the intercept capability of fighters scrambled from ground alert. Mathematical models of these two aspects of fighter operations are also developed; this dual approach ensures that the studies are both analytically understandable and operationally acceptable. Examples are given of the number of fighters from a single base which could intercept a concentrated (point) raid against a single offset target. In the case of raid indirect routing the main variables are the angle of the incoming feint track and the <b>warning</b> <b>distance.</b> In the analysis of the effect of sensor information errors the main variables are the actual position of the raid when warning is given and the errors in raid coordinates, heading and speed due to degradation of the warning system. In both cases of indirect routing and information errors alternative scramble and control procedures are considered. The work described in this thesis is a step towards an attempt to determine the more favourable procedures which a fighter force might adopt in the face of subtle raid tactics and degraded sensor performance. It also provides an illustration of the interplay between mathematical methods and computer models in the analysis of fighter operations. <p...|$|R
40|$|Highway {{safety is}} a major concern to the public and to {{transportation}} professionals, so the number of crashes caused by poor visibility due to fog form an alarming statistic. Drivers respond to poor visibility conditions in different ways: some slow down; others do not. Many drivers simply follow the taillights of the vehicle ahead. Accordingly, hazardous conditions are created in which speeds are both too high for the prevailing conditions and highly variable. Findings are presented from a study of traffic crashes due to fog in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of fog detection and warning system on driver behavior regarding speed and headway. This warning system includes visibility sensors that automatically activate a variable message sign that posts an advisory speed when hazardous conditions due to fog occur. The system was installed on a 2 km section of a two-lane, rural highway. A data set of 36, 013 observations from both experimental and control sections at two study sites was collected and analyzed. The data included vehicle speed, volume, and classification; time headway, time of day, and visibility <b>distance.</b> Although the <b>warning</b> system was ineffective in reducing speed variability, mean speed throughout the experimental sections was reduced by about 6. 5 kph. This reduction indicates that the warning system appeared to {{have a positive effect on}} driver behavior in fog even though the observed mean speeds were still higher than the posted advisory speed. From relationships found in the literature between mean driving speed and number of crashes, a speed reduction of only 5 kph would yield a 15 % decrease in the number of crashes. © 2007...|$|R
