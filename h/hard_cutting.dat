25|$|Khanda is a double-edge {{straight}} sword. It {{is often}} featured in religious iconography, theatre and art depicting the ancient history of India. Some communities venerate the weapon {{as a symbol}} of Shiva. It is a common weapon in the martial arts in the Indian subcontinent. Khanda often appears in Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh scriptures and art. In Sri Lanka, a unique wind furnace was used to produce the high quality steel. This gave the blade a very <b>hard</b> <b>cutting</b> edge and beautiful patterns. For these reasons it became a very popular trading material.|$|E

The {{soldiers}} in the forecastle {{had been able to}} give them no assistance, open as they lay to the arrows and musketry from the Rose's lofty stern. Amyas rushed along the central gangway, shouting in Spanish, [...] "Freedom to the slaves! death to the masters!" [...] clambered into the forecastle, followed close by his swarm of wasps, and set them so good an example how to use their stings, that in three minutes more there was not a Spaniard on board who was not dead or dying.|$|E
60|$|She saw the {{stiffened}} {{bodies of}} the colliers, which seemed already enclosed in a coffin, she saw their unchanging eyes, the eyes {{of those who are}} buried alive: she saw the <b>hard,</b> <b>cutting</b> edges of the new houses, which seemed to spread over the hillside in their insentient triumph, the triumph of horrible, amorphous angles and straight lines, the expression of corruption triumphant and unopposed, corruption so pure that it is hard and brittle: she saw the dun atmosphere over the blackened hills opposite, the dark blotches of houses, slate roofed and amorphous, the old church-tower standing up in hideous obsoleteness above raw new houses on the crest of the hill, the amorphous, brittle, hard edged new houses advancing from Beldover to meet the corrupt new houses from Lethley, the houses of Lethley advancing to mix with the houses of Hainor, a dry, brittle, terrible corruption spreading over the face of the land, and she was sick with a nausea so deep that she perished as she sat. And then, in the blowing clouds, she saw a band of faint iridescence colouring in faint colours a portion of the hill. And forgetting, startled, she looked for the hovering colour and saw a rainbow forming itself. In one place it gleamed fiercely, and, her heart anguished with hope, she sought the shadow of iris where the bow should be. Steadily the colour gathered, mysteriously, from nowhere, it took presence upon itself, there was a faint, vast rainbow. The arc bended and strengthened itself till it arched indomitable, making great architecture of light and colour and the space of heaven, its pedestals luminous in the corruption of new houses on the low hill, its arch the top of heaven.|$|E
25|$|From 1935 to 1955 {{machining}} cutting speeds {{increased from}} 120â€“200ft/min to 1000ft/min due to <b>harder</b> <b>cutting</b> edges, causing machining costs to fall by 75%.|$|R

50|$|Blades are damaged {{primarily}} by buckling - compressive force, from being pressed into a hard object, such as bone, ice, or a <b>hard</b> <b>cutting</b> board - and by bending, from sideways pressure. Both of these tend {{to roll the}} edge of a blade, due to metal's ductile nature.|$|E
50|$|By {{confining}} {{the expensive}} <b>hard</b> <b>cutting</b> tip {{to the part}} doing the actual cutting, the cost of tooling is reduced. The supporting tool holder can then be made from a tougher steel, which besides being cheaper is also usually better suited to the task, being less brittle than the cutting-edge materials.|$|E
50|$|Post-war rugby in Berlin mainly survived {{through the}} help of the allied {{occupation}} forces and the building of the Berlin wall in 1961 made playing the sport in the city even <b>harder,</b> <b>cutting</b> off many players in the now separate parts of the city. BSV continued to be a successful side in Berlin until 1956, winning all but the 1955 championship during this time, but none after that.|$|R
50|$|A {{material}} having compressive {{residual stress}} helps to prevent brittle fracture because the initial crack is formed under compressive (negative tensile) stress. To cause brittle fracture by crack propagation {{of the initial}} crack, the external tensile stress must overcome the compressive residual stress before the crack tips experience sufficient tensile stress to propagate.The manufacture of some swords utilises a gradient in martensite formation to produce particularly hard edges (notably the katana). The difference in residual stress between the <b>harder</b> <b>cutting</b> edge and the softer back of the sword gives such swords their characteristic curve.|$|R

50|$|A {{knife edge}} is a {{delicate}} structure and can easily be blunted by too abrasive a surface. Alternatively, it can be chipped if used on a surface that is too hard. A good cutting board material must be soft, easy to clean, and non-abrasive, but not fragile {{to the point of}} being destroyed. <b>Hard</b> <b>cutting</b> boards can, however, be used for food preparation tasks that do not require a sharp knife, like cutting cheese or making sandwiches.|$|E

Other shrubs respond better to selective pruning to reveal their structure and character.|$|E
5000|$|Drill bits are broadly {{classified}} into two main types {{according to their}} primary cutting mechanism. Rolling cutter bits drill largely by fracturing or crushing the formation with [...] "tooth"-shaped cutting elements on two or more cone-shaped elements that roll {{across the face of}} the borehole as the bit is rotated. Fixed cutter bits employ a set of blades with very <b>hard</b> <b>cutting</b> elements, most commonly natural or synthetic diamond, to remove material by scraping or grinding action as the bit is rotated.|$|E

5000|$|In swordsmithing, hamon (hamon) (from Japanese, {{literally}} [...] "blade pattern") is {{a visual}} effect created on the blade by the hardening process. The hamon is {{the outline of}} the hardened zone (yakiba) which contains the cutting edge (ha). Blades made in this manner are known as differentially hardened, with a <b>harder</b> <b>cutting</b> edge than spine (mune) (for example: spine 40 HRC vs edge 58 HRC). This difference in hardness results from clay being applied on the blade (tsuchioki) prior to the cooling process (quenching). Less or no clay allows the edge to cool faster, making it harder but more brittle, while more clay allows the center (hira) and spine to cool slower, thus retaining its resilience.|$|R
40|$|Vegetative {{propagation}} of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) through cutting {{is the most}} convenient and cheap method of obtaining true to the type, fully developed plants in considerably lesser time {{and in order to}} improve the rooting and reduce the mortality of rooted cuttings, the use of growth regulators and time cuttings has been standardized. Maximum rooting, root number and root length is observed with IBA 500 ppm + Borax 1 % both in semi hard and <b>hard</b> wood <b>cuttings.</b> Field survival of the cuttings treated with IBA 500 ppm + Borax 1 %, IBA 300 ppm + Borax 2 % and IBA 5000 ppm remained maximum. <b>Hard</b> wood <b>cuttings</b> respond better to the hormonal treatment as compared to semi hard-wood cuttings...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} use for {{differential}} tempering was for heat treating cutting tools, such as axes and chisels, where an extremely hard edge is desired, but some malleability and springiness {{is needed in}} the rest of the tool. A chisel with a very hard edge can maintain that edge longer and cut harder materials, but, if the entire chisel was too hard, it would shatter under the hammer blows. Differential tempering was often used to provide a very <b>hard</b> <b>cutting</b> edge, but to soften parts of the tool that are subject to impact and shock loading.|$|E

50|$|Chromium carbide {{is useful}} in the surface {{treatment}} of metal components. Chromium carbide is used to coat the surface of another metal in a technique known as thermal spraying. Cr3C2 powder is mixed with solid nickel-chromium. This mixture is then heated to very high temperatures and sprayed onto the object being coated where it forms a protective layer. This layer is essentially its own metal matrix composite, consisting of hard ceramic Cr3C2 particles embedded in a nickel-chromium matrix. The matrix itself contributes to the corrosion resistance of the coating because both nickel and chromium are corrosion resistant in their metallic form. After over spraying the coating, the coated part must run through a diffusion heat treatment to reach the best results in matter of coupling strength to the basemetal and also in matter of hardness. Another technique utilizes chromium carbide {{in the form of}} overlay plates. These are prefabricated chromium carbide coated steel plates, which are meant to be welded onto existing structures or machinery in order to improve performance.Chromium carbide is used as an additive in cutting tools made out of cemented carbides, in order to improve toughness by preventing the growth of large grains. The primary constituent in most extremely <b>hard</b> <b>cutting</b> tools is tungsten carbide. The tungsten carbide is combined with other carbides such as titanium carbide, niobium carbide, and chromium carbide and sintered together with a cobalt matrix. Cr3C2 prevents large grains from forming in the composite, which results in a fine-grained structure of superior toughness.|$|E
