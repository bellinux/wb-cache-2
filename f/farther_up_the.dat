5|$|The gorge widens {{where the}} highway passes by Castle Valley and Professor Valley, {{which have been}} the {{shooting}} locations for many western films (including Wagon Master and Rio Grande) and television commercials. Near {{the east end of}} the valley the highway crosses Onion Creek, a stream sourced by springs that contain naturally occurring minerals that produce a strong odor in the water. At the east end of the valley the highway has a view of the Fisher Towers, a set of dark red spires. After leaving the valley, the road winds <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river gorge until arriving at the Dewey Bridge, named for Dewey, a nearby ghost town.|$|E
5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey up to New Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led by Clinton, made a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to shut off Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale.|$|E
5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{detached}} {{a few of}} his {{ships to}} blockade the York and James Rivers <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bay, and many of the ships at anchor were missing officers, men, and boats when the British fleet was sighted. He faced the difficult proposition of organizing a line of battle while sailing against an incoming tide, with winds and land features that would require him to do so on a tack opposite that of the British fleet. At 11:30 am, 24 ships of the French fleet cut their anchor lines and began sailing out of the bay with the noon tide, leaving behind the shore contingents and ships' boats. Some ships were so seriously undermanned, missing as many as 200 men, that not all of their guns could be manned. De Grasse had ordered the ships to form into a line as they exited the bay, in order of speed and without regard to its normal sailing order. Admiral Louis de Bougainville's Auguste {{was one of the first}} ships out. With a squadron of three other ships Bougainville ended up well ahead of the rest of the French line; by 3:45 pm the gap was large enough that the British could have cut his squadron off from the rest of the French fleet.|$|E
5|$|Employing {{elements}} of the 84th and 106th Line, the French wing commander ordered the troops not to press home their assault, but to retreat every time they came against strong resistance. Each attack was pushed <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ridge before receding into the valley. When the fifth assault in regimental strength gave way, the defenders finally reacted, sweeping down the slope {{to cut off the}} French. Saint-Cyr now sprung his trap. Lecourbe led the massed grenadier companies to attack one Austrian flank, other reserves bored in on the other flank and the center counterattacked. The French troops that struck the Austrian right were hidden in the nearby town of Herrenalb. As the Austrians gave way, the French followed them up the ridge right into their positions. Nevertheless, Kaim's men laid down such a heavy fire that Lecourbe's grenadiers were thrown into disorder and their leader nearly captured. At length, Saint-Cyr's troops emerged triumphant, inflicting 1,000 casualties on their opponents and capturing two cannons. Kaim was compelled to withdraw east across the hills to Neuenbürg. From there, Kaim and Lindt's soldiers fell back toward Pforzheim.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves {{as well as}} horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the {{brothers}} worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped {{to take advantage of}} its rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{attacks by}} Lee's army had done barely {{anything}} to accomplish Confederate objectives, {{but this did}} not deter Magruder, who rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.|$|E

25|$|The French Catholic Church, which after Champlain's {{death was}} the {{dominant}} force in New France, wanted {{to establish a}} utopian Christian community in the colony. In 1642, they sponsored a group of settlers, led by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, who founded Ville-Marie, precursor to present-day Montreal, <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> St. Lawrence. Throughout the 1640s, Jesuit missionaries penetrated the Great Lakes region and converted many of the Huron natives. The missionaries came into conflict with the Iroquois, who frequently attacked Montreal.|$|E
25|$|The state commissioners by {{this time}} had begun to grow very weary of the rivalry between Jaysburg and Williamsport. They began to {{consider}} a third possibility for the county seat: a new village that was <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> West Branch Susquehanna River, west of the mouth of Pine Creek {{in what is now}} Clinton County. The town of Dunnsburg {{even went so far as}} to offer, free of charge, lots on which to build the buildings that would be required by the county government. It appeared as if the state commissioners would choose neither Williamsport nor Jaysburg, instead choosing the outpost of Dunnsburg. This is when Judge Hepburn and Michael Ross set out their plan that ultimately led toward Williamsport being named the county seat.|$|E

25|$|The Nashi {{are thought}} to have come {{originally}} from northwestern China, migrating south toward Tibetan populated regions, and usually inhabiting the most fertile river-side land, driving the other competing tribes <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hillsides onto less fertile land. The Nashi, along with Bai and Tibetans, traded over the dangerous overland trading links with Lhasa and India, on the so-called Tea and Horse Caravan routes. They were {{brought to the attention of}} the Western world by two men: the American botanist Joseph Rock and the Russian traveller and writer Peter Goullart, both of whom lived in Lijiang and travelled throughout the area during the early 20th century. Peter Goullart's book Forgotten Kingdom describes the life and beliefs of the Nashi and neighbouring peoples, while Joseph Rock's legacy includes diaries, maps, and photographs of the region, many of which were published in National Geographic. The two were friends and left the region together when the Communist troops came in.|$|E

The two routes meet at a junction southeast of the village center, at which point VT346 comes to an end. The average annual daily traffic of VT346 is highest in Pownal, where the route handles around 2,800 cars per day as of 2012, and lowest between Church Street and Dean Road, where it dips to about 1,600 vehicles per day.|$|E

500|$|The {{hurricane}} continued northeastward across northern Florida before emerging {{into the}} Atlantic between Mayport and St. Augustine. At the latter city, {{the storm was}} regarded as the most severe in 15 years; fences, trees, and crops were destroyed, and a few ships were driven aground, though the sea wall largely protected St. Augustine. Winds at Savannah, Georgia increased to hurricane strength {{on the night of}} October 5–6 and were accompanied by torrential rains. The storm surge there flooded wharves and other low-lying areas. The slow-moving storm buffeted the southern Georgia Sea Islands with a prolonged period of strong winds and heavy rain, blowing down trees and destroying some houses. Rice plantations along the Altamaha River experienced significant losses. [...] "Unprecedented" [...] tides also flooded streets <b>farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast in Charleston, South Carolina, such that some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. Though damage there was generally minor, five slaves drowned when their fishing boat capsized in rough seas. As the hurricane moved away from the coast, several ships were lost off North Carolina. On October 8 and 9, Bermuda experienced strong winds as the storm passed nearby.|$|E
500|$|Less than [...] up the trail, D Company {{came under}} machine gun fire from its right flank, which inflicted several casualties. Kennedy {{rejected}} Vandygriff's request {{to take a}} squad and knock out the gun, so the file got past {{the line of fire}} as best it could until M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle fire from the 3rd Platoon silenced the weapon. <b>Farther</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> trail another North Korean machine gun fired from the right along the trail and held up the advance until US artillery fire silenced it. The file of men left the trail-like road, which dead-ended, dropped over into a ravine on the left, and continued the climb. North Korean mortar fire killed two men and wounded eight or ten others in this phase of the ascent. At this time the 2nd Platoon leader collapsed from a kidney ailment and command passed to Vandygriff. Vandygriff led his platoon, now {{at the head of the}} company, on up the gully and at about 17:00, came through a tunnel under a small ridge and the stone wall into the bowl-shaped summit of Hill 755, the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest.
