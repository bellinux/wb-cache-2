25|$|A {{concrete}} Boolean algebra or <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> is any nonempty set of subsets {{of a given}} set X closed {{under the}} set operations of union, intersection, and complement relative to X.|$|E
25|$|SI is {{the set of}} all worlds {{inaccessible}} from worlds outside S, and SC is the set of all worlds accessible {{from some}} world in S. Every interior algebra can be embedded in an interior algebra of the form B(X) for some preordered set X giving the above-mentioned representation as a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> (a preorder field).|$|E
25|$|In {{abstract}} algebra, a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice. This type of algebraic structure captures essential {{properties of}} both set operations and logic operations. A Boolean algebra {{can be seen}} as a generalization of a power set algebra or a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets,</b> or its elements can be viewed as generalized truth values. It is also a special case of a De Morgan algebra and a Kleene algebra (with involution).|$|E

25|$|Since {{interior}} algebras are (normal) Boolean algebras with operators, {{they can}} be represented by <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> on appropriate relational structures. In particular, since they are modal algebras, {{they can be}} represented as <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> on a set with a single binary relation, called a modal frame. The modal frames corresponding to interior algebras are precisely the preordered sets. Preordered sets (also called S4-frames) provide the Kripke semantics of the modal logic S4, and the connection between interior algebras and preorders is deeply related to their connection with modal logic.|$|R
25|$|Boole's algebra predated {{the modern}} {{developments}} in abstract algebra and mathematical logic; it is however seen as {{connected to the}} origins of both fields. In an abstract setting, Boolean algebra was perfected in the late 19th century by Jevons, Schröder, Huntington, and others until it reached the modern conception of an (abstract) mathematical structure. For example, the empirical observation that one can manipulate expressions in the algebra of sets by translating them into expressions in Boole's algebra is explained in modern terms {{by saying that the}} algebra of sets is a Boolean algebra (note the indefinite article). In fact, M. H. Stone proved in 1936 that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A subalgebra of a {{power set}} algebra is called a field of sets; {{equivalently}} a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> {{is a set of}} subsets of some set W including the empty set and W and closed under finite union and complement with respect to W (and hence also under finite intersection). Birkhoff's [...] representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets.</b> Now Birkhoff's HSP theorem for varieties can be stated as, every class of models of the equational theory of a class C of algebras is the Homomorphic image of a Subalgebra of a direct Product of algebras of C. Normally all three of H, S, and P are needed; what the first of these two Birkhoff theorems shows is that for the special case of the variety of Boolean algebras Homomorphism can be replaced by Isomorphism. Birkhoff's HSP theorem for varieties in general therefore becomes Birkhoff's ISP theorem for the variety of Boolean algebras.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{complete}} atomic interior algebra is isomorphic to {{an interior}} algebra {{of the form}} A(X) for some topological space X. [...] Moreover, every interior algebra can be embedded in such an interior algebra giving a representation of an interior algebra as a topological <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets.</b> The properties of the structure A(X) are the very motivation for the definition of interior algebras. Because of this intimate connection with topology, interior algebras have also been called topo-Boolean algebras or topological Boolean algebras.|$|E

2500|$|The Klein four-group is also {{isomorphic}} to {{the direct}} sum , {{so that it}} can be represented as the pairs [...] under component-wise addition modulo 2 (or equivalently the bit strings under bitwise XOR); with (0,0) being the group's identity element. The Klein four-group is thus an example of an elementary abelian 2-group, which is also called a Boolean group. The Klein four-group is thus also the group generated by the symmetric difference as the binary operation on the subsets of a powerset of a set with two elements, i.e. over a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> with four elements, e.g. the empty set is the group's identity element in this case.|$|E
