40|$|How do {{experiences}} of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> shape or reflect {{the ways in}} which the vanquished are reconciled (or not) to the new world order established by the victors? Shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> are universal experiences in the emotional landscape of post-war politics, albeit for different reasons and with radically different political effects. An examination of Germany after 1918 and of Japan after 1945 reveals that {{experiences of}} shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> may be pivotal for creating conditions of possibility for reconciliation marked by political and moral transformation. This transformative potential of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> however, is a double-edged sword. In threatening old identities, values and beliefs, experiences of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> may provoke defensive, reactionary and violent political responses, and thus may precipitate hideous rather than salutary transformations. Political leadership and political culture are crucial factors in shaping the kind of reconciliation — reactionary or transformative — as well as the specific nature of transformations that experiences of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> may motivate the vanquished to pursue...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in trauma-related shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt.</b> However, much remains unknown {{in terms of}} how these emotions relate to the type of event, gender and mental health. We investigated shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> in men <b>and</b> women following various types of severe violence and their relation to mental health. Telephone interviews were conducted with a Norwegian general population sample (n= 4529; age= 18 - 75; response rate= 42. 9 %). Measures included child sexual abuse, child and adult rape, severe physical violence from/between parents, severe violence from a partner and non-partners, less severe violence and non-violent trauma, the new Shame <b>and</b> <b>Guilt</b> After Trauma Scale, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Analyses included t-tests and linear regressions. All types of severe violence were significantly associated with trauma-related shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> (coefficients from 0. 11 to 0. 38, p-values < 0. 001). The number of violence types showed a graded relationship with both emotions. Women had significantly more shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> than men did (p-values < 0. 001 for both emotions), which was partially explained by violence exposure. Both emotions were independently associated with mental health problems (p-values < 0. 001). The study is cross-sectional. The shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> measure requires further validation. The more types of violence that were reported, the higher levels of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> were. Clinicians should be aware of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> after a variety of violent events, including non-sexual violence, in both men and women and should particularly be aware of whether individuals have multiple violent experience...|$|R

5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms.

Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same.

5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by <b>guilt</b> <b>and</b> eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love of a poor girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little <b>guilt,</b> <b>and</b> avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E

40|$|Emotions, {{specifically}} {{those of}} shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> have been indicated as playing integral roles in determining engagement in criminal activity and more general ri sk~taking behaviour. However {{few studies have}} considered the unique contribution of these two emotions, and the effects that different forms of these two emotions may have on risk-taking. This thesis provides the first coherent attempt {{to look at the}} effects of different forms of shame <b>and</b> <b>gUilt</b> on measures of risk-taking and criminal behaviour, when shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> are unambiguously defined and therefore dissociable. Empirical evidence is provided for the existence of three distinct sources of anticipated shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> as deterrents to crime - Close Sources, Distant Sources and Practical Consequences. Close Sources are found to be the strongest deterrent, supporting the focus of Restorative Justice practices on these sources. Evidence is also provided for incidental state shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt's</b> association with increased perceived risk, however this is not found to translate into decreased risk-taking behaviour on a hypothetical task. Measurement of participants' actual risk-taking behaviour in two separate risky choice tasks, showed that both incidental state shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> result in heightened risk-taking behaviour. This suggests that crime prevention and intervention strategies, which aim to induce feelings of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt,</b> should be mindful of the incidental effect of these emotions, as they may have the unwanted side-effect of increasing unrelated risk-taking behaviour. In summary, this thesis provides evidence for the powerful impact of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt</b> on risk-taking behaviour, and proposes that crime prevention and intervent ion techniques which aim to harness t his power must be informed by a full understanding of shame <b>and</b> <b>guilt's</b> many effects. Only then can the potential of these techniques be fully realised. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
