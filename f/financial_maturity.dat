40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compute the real annual rates of return from mature, undisturbed timberlands in Mississippi during a 17 -year period (1977 - 1994). This was done using Southern Research Station, Forest Inventory and Analysis data on timber volumes and Timber Mart-South data on timber prices. Simple and adjusted <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> models were used to estimate rates of return. Average annual rates of change in value were computed and compared for four forest types across Mississippi. The average annual rate of change in volume was also computed for these stands and compared to the financial rates of return. Three distinct time periods were considered: 1977 - 1987, 1987 - 1994, and 1977 - 1994. For the 1977 to 1987 period, the average annual real rate of return of all forest types was 6. 8 % using simple <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> and 3. 5 % using adjusted <b>financial</b> <b>maturity.</b> For 1987 to 1994, the real rates of value change were much higher – 18. 6 % using simple <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> and 11. 3 % using adjusted <b>financial</b> <b>maturity.</b> Average annual real rates of return for the entire study period, 1977 to 1994, were 13. 8 % using simple <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> and 8. 1 % using adjusted <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> methods...|$|E

Using an East Asian and Latin American firm-level panel for the 1980 s and 1990 s, we study how leverage ratios, debt maturity structure, and sources of financing change when economies are liberalized and when firms access international capital markets.

However, domestic firms that actually participate in international capital markets extend their debt <b>maturity.</b> <b>Financial</b> liberalization has less effects on firms from countries with more developed domestic financial systems.

The larger the correlation between banks' projects, the more important the role for monetary policy.

40|$|We {{study how}} credit market {{deregulation}} and increased international financial openness have changed corporate borrowing. The evidence {{comes from a}} large panel of publicly traded firms in 38 countries over the period 1994 - 2002. Reforms are measured with a comprehensive new index that tracks six separate dimensions. We find that these transformations have increased leverage and lengthened debt maturity in advanced economies, as expected, suggesting that in these countries corporate credit markets have become deeper. In emerging economies, the picture is more mixed: more international openness has led to more leverage but shorter debt <b>maturity.</b> <b>Financial</b> sector reforms have reduced leverage, while their effects on debt maturity have differed {{depending on the type}} of reform. Importantly, the differential impact of openness and reforms on the leverage and debt maturity of firms in advanced and emerging market countries also emerges when we distinguish between firms that are potentially financially constrained and firms that are not. These findings suggest that in emerging economies fundamental institutional weaknesses make it difficult to secure the benefits of international financial openness and domestic <b>financial</b> reforms.

However, the same principles of analyzing the <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> of trees also apply to even-aged management. Several {{studies have shown that the}} optimal thinning of a certain stand would be rather similar in even-aged management and continuous cover forestry (e.g. Pukkala 2015 b).

However, some studies (Valsta 1992; Hyytiäinen et al. 2005; Pukkala 2015 b) have found that, in even-aged management when a forced clear-felling belongs to the management schedule, it is sometimes optimal to remove trees from both ends of the diameter distribution.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare various {{characteristics}} of the cross-country transmission of shocks {{in the financial markets}} of both advanced and emerging countries during two periods of globalization [...] the pre-World War I classical gold standard era, 1880 - 1914, and the post-Bretton Woods era, 1975 - 2000. Based on principal components analysis on monthly spreads on long-term sovereign bond yields and on an EMP measure of currency crises, an index of global stress, and impulse response functions from VARs estimated using weekly data on short-term interest rates, we conclude that financial market shocks were more globalized before 1914 compared to the present. We postulate that this difference in systemic stability between the two eras of globalization reflects factors such as strong cross-country interdependence fostered through links to gold, the growing <b>financial</b> <b>maturity</b> of advanced countries, and the widening of the center to include a more diverse group of countries spanning several regions. ...|$|E

40|$|Today?s {{level of}} {{financial}} integration {{and development of}} international capital markets is often compared to the pre-World War I Gold Standard. However, the propensity to currency crises seems higher today than in the past. Furthermore, the dynamics of crises has changed: In the most recent episodes of currency crises, output contractions have been large, {{but they have been}} followed by prompter recoveries than in the past. This paper shows that high volatility in the demand for domestic currency, due to international investors buying short-term liquid assets, may increase the probability of currency crises and lead to large contractions followed by fast recoveries. Due to the "speculative" demand for currency, a small productivity shock can prompt a drop in the demand for domestic currency and the consequent exhaustion of international reserves. Therefore, crises can happen also when the fundamentals are relatively good: Investment drops temporarily due to the devaluation and recovers fast afterwards. In contrast, if the economy has smaller short-term liabilities, like during the pre-World War I Gold Standard, currency crises happen only when the real sector of the economy experiences a strong negative productivity shock. If productivity shocks have some degree of persistence, there are prolonged recessions. <b>Financial</b> Integration, <b>Maturity</b> of Capital Flows, Gold standard, Interest rate policy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the consequences of}} international financial market integration for national fiscal and monetary policies that derive from {{the absence of an}} international sovereign authority to define and enforce contractual obligations across borders. The sovereign immunity of national governments serves as a fundamental constraint on international finance and is used to derive intertemporal budget constraints for sovereign nations and their governments. It is shown that the appropriate debt limit for a country allows for state-contingent repayment. With noncontingent debt instruments, debt renegotiation occurs in equilibrium with positive probability. A model of tax smoothing is adopted to show how information imperfections lead to conventional bond contracts that are renegotiated when a critical level of indebtedness is reached. Renegotiation is interpreted in terms of nominal and real denominated bonds, and implications are drawn about the intertemporal borrowing constraint for monetary policies, the accumulation of reserve assets, and current account sustainability.
