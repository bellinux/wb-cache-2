5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western <b>Electric</b> <b>system.</b> To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
5|$|Several local {{politicians}} have proposed re-opening {{the line and}} either making it part of the Jæren Commuter Rail {{or part of the}} planned light rail in Greater Stavanger. Additionally, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has supported a future re-opening of the line. Estimates show that the line has a traffic potential for 600,000 passengers per year. In a proposal from the National Rail Administration, the Ålgård Line is seen as a possible branch of the commuter rail, with stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. Without making any investments to the Sørlandet Line, {{it would be possible to}} extend the two hourly services that terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård. Ålgård is also a good location for a park and ride for European Route E39. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, <b>electric</b> <b>system</b> and signaling. This would give a travel time from Ganddal to Ålgård of 10 to 12 minutes. The estimated cost of re-opening the line is NOK500 million. The Center Party has proposed converting the line to a bus lane. The borough council of Figgjo has voted to convert the line to a bicycle path, but this has been rejected by the National Rail Administration.|$|E

25|$|Meccano {{introduced}} its OO scale trains in 1938 {{under the name}} 'Hornby Dublo'. The locomotives were diecast metal, and the carriages and wagons were generally made of tinplate. This was a very well planned range of electric and clockwork models, successfully consolidating 12V DC as the standard for OO scale. This led {{to the adoption of}} OO as a broadly accepted modelling standard in the UK, whereas {{much of the rest of}} the world adopted HO scale. As for their O gauge locomotives, electric Hornby Dublo locomotives ran on a third rail <b>electric</b> <b>system</b> with the track built on a pressed tinplate base.|$|E

These battery packs usually strap {{to the top}} tube of the frame, or come in the shape that fits in a water bottle cage, or can {{be placed in a}} basket. A cable connects the battery pack to the light. Another advantage with battery power (especially with 12 volt) is the ability to power other components outside of lighting, as well as all from one battery (as long as they run safe on 12 volts) though wire spaghetti from splicing can be a setback depending on how complicated the <b>electric</b> <b>system</b> is.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 1959, Sisu {{arrived in}} Rauma {{to have one}} of her {{generators}} repaired. Late in the evening, a faulty radiator in one of the cabins started a fire that quickly spread in the aft part of the vessel. While it was brought under control within three hours through the co-operative effort of the city fire department, a local volunteer fire department and three industrial fire brigades from nearby factories, the fire and water destroyed six cabins and damaged the vessel's <b>electric</b> <b>system,</b> turning gear and aft propulsion motors. However, the main engine room was protected by a carbon dioxide fire suppression system and the excessive use of water prevented the fuel oil tanks below the main deck from exploding. Although the vessel was fully crewed and part of the crew was sleeping, no-one was injured in the fire. Sisu returned to service after extensive repairs on 26 April 1959.|$|E

25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or <b>electric</b> <b>system.</b> When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E
