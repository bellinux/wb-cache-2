5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

According to Hicks, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E

Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public {{administration}} does not only {{focus on the}} business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{caused by}} enemy's attacks on non-concrete {{elements}} of the line is easily repairable while main forces carry out short counterattacks. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a passive defense, but is also based on (and its method dependent upon) common counterattacks and infiltrator assaults. The flexibility of the line also means {{it is designed to}} help execution of offensive operations as rearguard and provide fire support to moving friendly groups. The necessary infrastructure elements have been built and multiple small rapid units were available (skier, rider and cyclist grousps mainly) with strength from platoon to company size.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} aspect of the Hamiltonian operator is that it only acts at vertices (a consequence of this is that Thiemann's Hamiltonian operator, like Ashtekar's operator, annihilates non-intersecting loops except now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> formal and has rigorous mathematical meaning). More precisely, its action is non-zero on at least vertices of valence three and greater and results in a linear combination of new spin networks where the original graph has been modified by the addition of lines at each vertex together and a change in the labels of the adjacent links of the vertex.|$|E

25|$|Weisberg & Alba {{examined}} {{problem solving}} by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle) – where {{the participants are}} asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside {{the boundaries of the}} square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> insight (or creativity) that is required.|$|E
25|$|Giving (Dāna) {{is seen as}} the {{beginning}} of virtue in Theravada Buddhism and as the basis for developing further on the path. In Buddhist countries, this is seen in the giving of alms to Buddhist monastics but also extends to generosity in general (towards family, friends, coworkers, guests, animals). Giving is said to make one happy, generate good merit as well as develop non-attachment, therefore <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> good because it creates good karmic fruits, but it also develops one's spiritual qualities. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of dana and ethical conduct will themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower hells is unlikely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E
