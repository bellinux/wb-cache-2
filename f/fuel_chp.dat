40|$|The {{sector of}} {{building}} heating in last years has seen an increasing interest in {{energy conversion efficiency}} and energy production from renewable sources. The amount of buildings supplied by district heating systems in northern Italy has doubled between 2000 and 2010. The main share of Italian District Heating (DH) is fuelled by fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>CHP</b> systems, and a smaller share relies on heat production from renewable sources. The increase of energy production from renewables {{is in line with}} the European targets set out in the Climate Package (20 - 20 - 20 targets) and with the recent debate on future targets for 2030. Moreover, the use of biomass-fired CHP systems could lead {{at the same time to}} an increase of primary energy savings with respect to separate production of heat and power. This study focuses on the benefits of installing wood biomass ORC units in existing DH systems. The primary energy savings and the energy share produced from CHP have been evaluated for different simulation scenarios, as well as a basic economic analysis considering the new Italian incentives on electricity production from renewable source...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{competing}} demands on land to feed people adequately, sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services and mitigate climate change, {{there is a clear}} need for a systematic basis for allocating land use with respect to economic and environmental objectives. This study formulates an integrated environmental and economic assessment of the global consequences of changing current land use in the UK with different land-use strategies for food, feed, fuel, timber and carbon sink. Novel operational approaches are proposed for resolving the associated methodological issues, which are applied in the characterisation of the main land-use strategies in the UK. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used for the environmental assessment, with emphasis on ecosystem carbon balances as the contribution to both global climate change and ecosystem services and biodiversity impacts. A parallel economic assessment is integrated with LCA. The results indicate that changing land use and management on current crop land generally does not deliver improvements in all three criteria of mitigating climate and impacts on ecosystem service and biodiversity, while creating additional economic value. There are a few exceptions, of which wheat and barley for feed and under organic management are the best. Expanding cropland onto set-aside and permanent grassland is more beneficial when crops are used for <b>fuel</b> (<b>CHP)</b> or for carbon sink (in the case of Douglas Fir and Ash, Sycamore and Silver Birch). Expansion onto set-aside is largely undesirable if by arable cropping, but desirable by energy and forestry crops. The former are best used for CHP whereas the latter as carbon sinks, even though no economic value is generated in the foreground system. The consequential assessment showed that indirect effects (i. e. those in the background system) are relevant and ought to be considered when assessing land-use strategies.

40|$|Background: The {{availability}} of feedstock options {{is a key}} to meeting the volumetric requirement of 136. 3 billion liters of renewable fuels per year beginning in 2022, as required in the US 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of sorghum-based ethanol need to be assessed for sorghum {{to play a role in}} meeting that requirement. Results: Multiple sorghum-based ethanol production pathways show diverse well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and GHG emissions due to differences in energy use and fertilizer use intensity associated with sorghum growth and differences in the ethanol conversion processes. All sorghum-based ethanol pathways can achieve significant fossil energy savings. Relative to GHG emissions from conventional gasoline, grain sorghum-based ethanol can reduce WTW GHG emissions by 35 % or 23 %, respectively, when wet or dried distillers grains with solubles (DGS) is the co-product and fossil natural gas (FNG) is consumed as the process fuel. The reduction increased to 56 % or 55 %, respectively, for wet or dried DGS co-production when renewable natural gas (RNG) from anaerobic digestion of animal waste is used as the process fuel. These results do not include land-use change (LUC) GHG emissions, which we take as negligible. If LUC GHG emissions for grain sorghum ethanol as estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included (26 g CO 2 e/MJ), these reductions when wet DGS is co-produced decrease to 7 % or 29 % when FNG or RNG is used as the process fuel. Sweet sorghum-based ethanol can reduce GHG emissions by 71 % or 72 % without or with use of co-produced vinasse as farm fertilizer, respectively, in ethanol plants using only sugar juice to produce ethanol. If both sugar and cellulosic bagasse were used in the future for ethanol production, an ethanol plant with a combined heat and power (CHP) system that supplies all process energy can achieve a GHG emission reduction of 70 % or 72 %, respectively, without or with vinasse fertigation. Forage sorghum-based ethanol can achieve a 49 % WTW GHG emission reduction when ethanol plants meet process energy demands with CHP. In the case of forage sorghum and an integrated sweet sorghum pathway, the use of a portion of feedstock to <b>fuel</b> <b>CHP</b> systems significantly reduces fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Conclusions: This study provides new insight into life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions of multiple sorghum-based ethanol production pathways in the US. Our results show that adding sorghum feedstocks to the existing options for ethanol production could help in meeting the requirements for volumes of renewable, advanced and cellulosic bioethanol production in the US required by the EPAâ€™s Renewable Fuel Standard program...|$|E

40|$|Federal agency {{leaders are}} expressing growing {{interest}} in using innovative fuel cell {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) technology at their sites, motivated by both executive branch sustainability targets and a desire to lead by example in the transition to a clean energy economy. <b>Fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> can deliver reliable electricity and heat with 70 % to 85 % efficiency. Implementing this technology can be a high efficiency, clean energy solution for agencies striving to meet ambitious sustainability requirements with limited budgets. <b>Fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> systems can use natural gas or renewable fuels, such as biogas. Procuring Stationary Fuel Cells for CHP: A Guide for Federal Facility Decision Makers presents an overview of the process for planning and implementing a <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> project in a concise, step-by-step format. This guide is designed to help agency leaders turn their interest in fuel cell technology into successful installations. This guide concentrates on larger (100 kW and greater) <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> systems and does not consider other fuel cell applications such as cars, forklifts, backup power supplies or small generators (< 100 kW). Because fuel cell technologies are rapidly evolving and have high up front costs, their deployment poses unique challenges. The electrical and thermal output of the CHP system must be integrated with the building s energy systems. Innovative financing mechanisms allow agencies to make a make versus buy decision to maximize savings. This guide outlines methods that federal agencies may use to procure <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> systems with little or no capital investment. Each agency and division, however, has its own set of procurement procedures. This guide was written as a starting point, and it defers to the reader s set of rules if differences exist. The fuel cell industry is maturing, and project developers are gaining experience in working with federal agencies. Technology improvements, cost reductions, and experienced project developers are making fuel cell projects easier to put into service. In this environment, federal decision makers can focus on being smart buyers of fuel cell energy instead of attempting to become experts in fuel cell technology. For agencies that want to pursue a <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> this guide presents a four step process for a successful project. 1. Perform a preliminary screening of the energy needs energy costs and incentives. 2. Compare a detailed project plan. 3. Make a financing and contracting decision. 4. Execute the project plan including financing, installation, and operation. The simplest procurement method is designated funding for the outright purchase of the <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> system, although this is usually not the most cost-effective option.

40|$|Combined Heat and Power Generation (CHP) or {{cogeneration}} {{has been}} considered worldwide as the major alternative to traditional energy systems in terms of signi ticant energy saving and environmental conservation. A renewable energy resource-fuelled CHP would deliver even more environmental benefits than a fossil tuel-driven CHP. Biomass {{is one of the}} renewable energy resources that plays an important role to the world primary energy supplies and can be used to <b>fuel</b> <b>CHP</b> systems. Many medium- and large-scale biomass-fired CHP plants have been demonstrated and commercialized in the world. However, biomass-fuelled microscale CHP (1 - 1 OkW c> which is suitable tor building applications has yet to be commercialised or demonstrated. The development and evaluation of a micro-CHP system operating on biomass energy {{has been the focus of}} this PhD research. It is an integral part of an externally funded research project which aims to develop and evaluate a novel, first-of-its-kind, micro-scale (l - 2 kWe) biomass-tired CHP system suitable for public and large domestic buildings' applications. The specific tasks of the present PhD research arc: To thermodynamically model the micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) : different environment-friendly working fluids are to be modelled with the ORC processes. To experimentally evaluate the micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system in terms of power generation and combined heat and power pertormance. To experimentally investigate the combustion performance and NOx emissions of the biomass pellet boiler which is a key component of the micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system. The micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system with ORC developed by the research team of University of Nottingham including the author of this PhD thesis mainly consists of a biomass boiler, an ORC fluid evaporator, an ORC turbine, an alternator, a heat reeouperator and a condenser. The boiler produces hot water which transfers heat to the organic working tluid via the evaporator. The generated organic fluid vapour drives a turbine to rotate an alternator, producing power. The expanded organic fluid vapour leaving the turbine transfers some of its heat to the recouperator and then is condensed by cooling water which can be heated to around 40 - 50 Â°C for domestic washing and under-floor heating purposes. The main methodologies of the present PhD research are the thermodynamic modelling of the proposed micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system with ORC and the laboratory testing of the assembled micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system and its main components (biomass boiler, ORC turbine, alternator, heat exchangers etc.). Literature review has demonstrated that the biomass-fired micro-CHP systems for buildings present many advantages compared to conventional separate heating and power supply systems (e. g. a dedicated boiler for heating and grid for power supply) as they can present higher primary energy savings and lower CO 2 emissions. ORC is a suitable thermodynamic cycle that could be used for micro-CHP systems while operating with waste heat and renewable energy resources which are available at relative low temperatures. Thermodynamical modelling of the proposed micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system with ORC has been carried out and the results have been presented and discussed in the thesis. Three different environment-friendly working fluids, namely HFE 7000, HFE 7100 and n-pentane, have been modelled with various ORC process configurations. The laboratory testing of the assembled micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system and its main components (biomass boiler, ORC turbine, alternator, heat exchangers etc.) has been carried out initially with a 25 kW biomass boiler and then with a 50 kW biomass boiler. The main purpose of the laboratory testing has been to evaluate the main energy efficiencies (the electrical efficiency and the total CHP efficiency) of the assembled micro-CHP systems. The combustion performance and NOx emissions of each biomass boiler have also been investigated as the biomass boiler is a key component of the micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system. The experimental findings of these laboratory tests are presented and analysed in the thesis. Finally, the conclusions of the present PhD research have been given. The modelling results have shown that the electrical efficiency of the micro-CHP system depends on not only the modelling conditions but also the ORC fluid. A comparison of the three fluids generally follows the following order: n-pentane > HFE 7000 > HFE 7100. For the laboratory test, the 25 kW biomass boiler-driven micro-CHP system, having an ORC efficiency in the range of 2. 20 % - 2. 85 %, can generate electricity of 344. 6 W and heat of 20. 3 kW, corresponding to electricity generation efficiency 1. 17 % and CHP efficiency 86. 22 %. And the 50 kWth biomass boiler-driven micro-CHP system, having an ORC efficiency of 3. 48 % - 3. 89 %, can generate electricity of 748. 6 W and heat of 43. 7 kW, corresponding to electricity generation efficiency 1. 43 % and CHP et 1 iciency 81. 06 %...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{promising}} technologies for reducing energy consumption is combined heat and power (CHP). CHPs benefit from the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat increasing their total utilisation of fuel, thus their efficiency. Current research on <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHPs</b> is focused on detailed fuel cell models that use basic information of the building energy requirements. A deeper understanding of the process of integration of the <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> on to the building energy system is required. Fuel cell based micro-CHP system components need to be sized appropriately to satisfy the domestic energy demand profile and to serve heat loads effectively. It is also important to define the operation strategy (scheduling of demands, electricity/heat generation etc.) and the control method that is utilised to meet the building energy demands because they define the overall performance and efficiency of the building energy system as a whole. In this paper an investigation of the design of a SOFC based micro-CHP under varying conditions is carried out and ways of integration with the building energy system are presented. A mathematical model that describes the operation and control of a fuel cell micro-CHP based system in residential dwellings has been developed and is demonstrated. The model is dynamic and includes the fuel cell, the backup gas boiler, and hot water thermal storage. The evaluation is based on a new UK residential dwelling in accordance with the current building regulations and includes electricity, heating and domestic hot water loads.

Biomass resources can be, and actually are used as <b>fuel</b> in <b>CHP</b> installations; however several hurdles have to be sorted beforehand, among the most important is the fact that biomass energy sources are not as energy intense as conventional <b>CHP</b> <b>fuels.</b> The ultimate outcome is a limited number of CHP units making use of biomass as <b>fuel.</b> Even fewer <b>CHP</b> units use bioliquids (e. g. : fast pyrolysis biomass liquids, biodiesel and vegetable oil).

The solar thermal fraction alone is 44 %. It also shows that the <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> produced energy as power-to-heat contributes {{a lot in the}} winter months which has the gas boiler requirement in check. As a result, a 5 -kW gas boiler is enough for this KfW 55 house. At 26 Â m 2 collector area, it seems to be quite oversized with specific collector production less than 200 Â kWh/m 2 and this might be due to the utilization of excess electricity in the transition seasons and partly also due to a small tank. It is also to be noted that even in peak winter, the maximum power required by space heating is 7 Â kW and less than 1500 Â kWh in January. It is to be noted that the heat recovery enabled forced ventilation plays an important role and hence an annual requirement for space heating is 6542 Â kWh and for DHW is 4316 kWh.

For demonstration purposes, the methodology was applied to three distinct case studies of varying size. The developed methodology allowed {{for the analysis of}} the system from various economic points of view. Because of the scarcity of complete equation sets modeling the off-design performance of fuel cells, several novel equations were proposed. All systems utilizing alternative prime movers were unprofitable. The fuel cell-based systems exhibited some economic potential; however, the results showed it would take close to the entire system lifetime to recover the capital costs. This is consistent with the reviewed literature and hence validates the new methodology and partial load equations proposed. Based on this analysis the fuel cell-based system for the medium sized case study showed the most economic potential. Because of the susceptibility of emerging technologies (fuel cells) to changes in capital costs, an in-depth sensitivity analysis was performed. The analysis showed that a 5 % decrease in capital costs could reduce the payback period by as much as six months. This indicates that only a small decrease in price is necessary to potentially lead to the adoption of these systems in the near future. 26 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of fast pyrolysis condensates is hindered by unwanted properties like corrosivity, high viscosity and tendency to polymerization. These characteristics {{result from the}} high content of organic acids and multiple functional groups and C-C double bonds. As an alternative to severe hydroprocessing, the addition of alcohol and subsequent esterification of acids and acetalization of aldehydes is investigated. Pyrolysis condensates are mixed with butanol and an acidic catalyst is added. This mixture is heated and kept under reflux in a dean-stark-apparatus to continuously boil off the water. As reference homogeneous liquid acids are used and compared to solid acid catalysts like ZnO or zeolites. The advantage of the heterogeneous, solid catalysts is the possibility to remove the solids after reaction and use them again for another batch {{in contrast to the}} homogeneous acids, which remain in the solution and need to be neutralized at the end. The most promising catalyst candidates are then used in experiments with varying process parameters. All products are analyzed for total acid number, water mass fraction, dynamic viscosity and higher heating value. The total acid number can be reduced by 90 % (from 110 to below 10 mg/g), the water mass fraction by 90 % (from 25 % to below 2 %), the viscosity by 70 % (from 18 to 5 mm 2 /s) and the higher heating value can be increased by 45 % (from 16. 6 to 31 MJ/kg). These improvements should allow the {{utilization of}} upgraded pyrolysis liquids in standard boilers and as <b>fuel</b> in <b>CHP</b> plants...|$|R
40|$|Fuel cells produce heat when {{generating}} electricity, {{thus they}} are of particular interest for {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) and combined cooling heat and power (CCHP) applications, also known as tri-generation systems. CHP and tri-generation systems offer high energy conversion efficiency and hence the potential to reduce fuel costs and CO 2 emissions. This article serves to provide a state-of-the-art review of fuel cell technology operating in the domestic built environment in CHP and tri-generation system applications. The review aims to carry out an assessment of the following topics: (1) the operational advantages fuel cells offer in CHP and tri-generation system configurations, specifically, compared to conventional combustion-based technologies such as Stirling engines, (2) how decarbonisation, running cost and energy security in the domestic built environment may be addressed through the use of fuel cell technology, and (3) what has been done to date and {{what needs to be done}} in the future. The article commences with a review of fuel cell technology, then moves on to examine <b>fuel</b> cell <b>CHP</b> systems operating in the domestic built environment, and finally explores fuel cell tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications. The article concludes with an assessment of the present development of, and future challenges for, domestic fuel cells operating in CHP and tri-generation systems. As fuel cells are an emergent technology the article draws on a breadth of literature, data and experience, mostly from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, America and Australia. Fuel cells are a technology of the future here today, providing a change in the way heat and power are supplied to end users. Fuel cells operating in CHP and tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications could finally provide the means by which energy generation can transfer from centralised to decentralised locales in a sustainable and effective manner...|$|R
40|$|BIOPOL is {{a two-year}} {{research}} project {{funded by the}} European Commission since 2007 through the Sixth Framework Programme. The overall goal of BIOPOL is to assess the status (technical, social, environmental, political, and implementation) of innovative BIOrefinery concepts and the implications for agricultural and forestry POLicy. Biorefinery concepts are aimed at relevant market-competitive and environmental-friendly synthesis of bio-products (chemicals and/or materials) together with the production of secondary energy carriers (transportation <b>fuels,</b> power and/or <b>CHP).</b> BIOPOL was conceived to address {{the fact that the}} wider expectations for biorefineries have not yet yielded clear definitions for biorefinery concepts, or an understanding of the current status and prospective benefits of biorefining in Europe. Therefore the BIOPOL project was designed to assess the current status of biorefinery activities in Europe and explore future scenarios for development. By systematically accounting for potential technical, political, social and industrial impacts of such scenarios their outputs will be utilised to inform policy formulation in this area. By drawing from several complimentary research disciplines the insights gained will be able to inform EU policy-making and help frame future research directions both in Europe and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Santa Rita Jail is a 4, 500 inmate {{facility}} {{located in}} Dublin CA, approximately 40 miles (65 km) east of San Francisco. Over the past decade, {{a series of}} Distributed Energy Resources (DER) installations and efficiency measures have been undertaken to transform the 3 MW facility into a "Green Jail". These include a 1. 2 MW rated rooftop PV system installed in 2002, a 1 MW molten carbonate <b>fuel</b> cell with <b>CHP,</b> and retrofits to lighting and HVAC systems to reduce peak loads. With the upcoming installation of a large-scale battery and fast static disconnect switch, Santa Rita Jail will become a true microgrid, with full CERTS Microgrid functionality. Consequently, the jail {{will be able to}} seamlessly disconnect from the grid and operate as an island {{in the event of a}} disturbance, reconnecting again once the disturbance has dissipated. The extent to which that jail is capable of islanding is principally dependant on the energy capacity of the battery-one focus of this investigation. Also presented here are overviews of the DER currently installed at the jail, as well as the value it provides by offsetting the purchase of electricity under the current Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) tariff...|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) system is an efficient and clean way to generate power (electricity). Heat {{produced by the}} CHP system can be used for water and space heating. The CHP system which uses hydrogen as fuel produces zero carbon emission. Its??? efficiency can reach more than 80 % whereas that of a traditional power station can only reach up to 50 % because much of the thermal energy is wasted. The other advantages of CHP systems include that they can decentralize energy generation, improve energy security and sustainability, and significantly reduce the energy cost to the users. This paper presents the economic benefits of using a CHP system in the domestic environment. For this analysis, natural gas is considered as potential fuel as the hydrogen <b>fuel</b> cell based <b>CHP</b> systems are rarely used. UK government incentives for CHP systems are also considered as the added benefit. Results show that CHP requires a significant initial investment in return it can reduce the annual energy bill significantly. Results show that an investment may be paid back in 7 years. After the back period, CHP can run for about 3 years as most of the CHP manufacturers provide 10 year warranty...|$|R
50|$|Biomass {{provides}} the largest share {{of renewable energy}} in Denmark when considering the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector and transport sector combined. The fuel contributed to approximately 8.6% of total electricity generation in Denmark generating 2,631 GWh of electricity in 2014. Total consumption of biomass amounted to 107 PJ in 2013. There were 39 CHP plants using biomass as a fuel in 2014 consuming approximately 2.7 million tonnes to produce heat and power, corresponding to 40.94 PJ consumption in that year. Biomass is sometimes co-fired with other fuels including a small percentage that is co-fired with waste. Around 40% of the biomass used in Denmark is imported including the majority of wood pellets.Electricity generated from biomass increased dramatically in 2010 following in increased share in its use {{in a number of}} power plants. Between 2009 and 2014 production of power increased by around 50%. By 2024 biomass is expected to double the percentage of renewable energy share from 15% to 30% of renewable electricity production in Denmark. Total consumption of Biomass is expected to rise to 115PJ by 2024. A number of power stations are being converted from using coal to using wood pellets as a <b>fuel.</b> Some smaller <b>CHP</b> plants are converting from using natural gas to biomass.|$|R
