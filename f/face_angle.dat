The buildup to the match began on September 9, 2004 during {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, where a Lumberjack match (a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring) was scheduled between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to <b>face</b> <b>Angle.</b> Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, Angle and his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show a handshake. Big Show, however, tore up Guerrero's contract and signed the one with Angle's name on it to face him at No Mercy.|$|E

50|$|Cameras are {{becoming}} {{the norm in}} golf simulation. In general, one, two, three or four cameras are used that continuously monitor the play area. The downward swing path, impact, club <b>face</b> <b>angle,</b> launch angle and ball speed are all captured by the high speed cameras, normally running at around 100 to 120 frames per second. Camera data is processed using complex physics algorithms to produce a multitude of data such as back spin, side spin, trajectory, club <b>face</b> <b>angle,</b> swing path, loft, distance, carry and roll. The, most common types of camera measurement system are Triggered and Continuous. With triggered systems, Images are taken only after the club has passed through a trigger point to activate the camera. With continuous systems, the camera records permanently, and data is processed once impact with the ball is observed. Continuous cameras must be capable of frame rates in excess of 100 frames per second per camera. Such systems are used by Bogolf, Visual Sports, Sports Coach Systems and Full Swing Golf. For both methods, one camera is floor mounted facing the ball trajectory from the side, the other is over head mounted and facing down. ProTee United is using a high speed sensor system to read club head information, special floor sensors for putting and two high speed cameras (one {{on the floor and}} one on the ceiling) to pick up ball flight information. An alternative method of measuring these two angles is to mount both cameras in the upper left and right corners of the bay. This is known as stereoscopic image processing.|$|E

Strong tie bars extend from the <b>face</b> <b>angle</b> on the transverses to the tank top plating. Under the tank top, except for notches cut for the bottom and tank top longitudinals, the transverses are much like ordinary floor plates.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to study the influence of indenter tip geometry on the conventionally obtained indentation modulus of enamel by nanoindentation. Indentation tests on bovine enamel using three different diamond pyramidal indenters with half <b>face</b> <b>angles</b> 65. 27 °, 45 °, and 35. 26 ° were conducted to evaluate the indentation modulus using the Oliver–Pharr method [W.

In addition, three different dehydration conditions were studied: wet under Hank’s balanced salt solution, laboratory dried, and vacuum dehydrated. For the Berkovich indenter (65. 27 °) and 45 ° pyramidal indenters, {{there was only a}} small difference between indentation modulus values, whereas for the cube-corner indenter (35. 26 °) a ratio of 2. 4 between laboratory dry and wet samples was found. A detailed evaluation, including indentation creep and recovery as well as pileup, resulted in a reduction of this latter ratio to 1. 7.
