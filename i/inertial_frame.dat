5|$|The rate {{of change}} in the {{distance}} between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (their closing speed) may have a value in excess ofc.

5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the axle of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame,</b> only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> has a simpler physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the <b>inertial</b> <b>frame,</b> fictitious forces are zero. See <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> for more detail.|$|E

25|$|The {{paradoxical}} {{aspect of}} the twins' situation arises {{from the fact that}} at any given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's <b>inertial</b> <b>frame,</b> but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's <b>inertial</b> <b>frame.</b> One proposed resolution is that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of the trip from being at rest in an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> with velocity in one direction (away from the earth) to being at rest in an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> with velocity in the opposite direction (towards the earth).|$|E
25|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{the notion}} of an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame.</b> For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid <b>inertial</b> <b>frame,</b> even if he is accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> is defined as an element of this set.|$|E
25|$|An <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> of reference, in {{classical}} physics, is {{a frame of}} reference in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated, that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line. In analytical terms, it is a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. Conceptually, {{in classical}} physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> have no causes external to the system. An <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> of reference may also be called an inertial reference frame, <b>inertial</b> <b>frame,</b> Galilean reference frame, or inertial space.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the realm}} of Newtonian mechanics, an <b>{{inertial}}</b> <b>frame</b> of reference, or inertial reference frame, {{is one in which}} Newton's first law of motion is valid.

5000|$|In non-relativistic physics {{there is}} a unique and well defined notion {{of the center of}} mass vector, a {{three-dimensional}} vector (abbreviated: [...] "3-vector"), of an isolated system of massive particles inside the 3-spaces of <b>inertial</b> <b>frames</b> of Galilei spacetime. However, no such notion exists in special relativity inside the 3-spaces of the <b>inertial</b> <b>frames</b> of Minkowski spacetime.|$|R
25|$|An {{accelerated}} particle {{does not}} have an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> in which it is always at rest. However, as stated before in the earlier discussion of the transverse Doppler effect, an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> can always be found which is momentarily comoving with the particle. This frame, the momentarily comoving reference frame (MCRF), enables application of special relativity to the analysis of accelerated particles.|$|E

25|$|An <b>inertial</b> <b>frame</b> is a {{frame of}} {{reference}} within which an object interacting with no forces (an idealized situation) appears either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line. This is the fundamental definition of an <b>inertial</b> <b>frame.</b> These are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the observer's physical laws originate from identifiable sources caused by fields, such as electro-static field (caused by static electrical charges), electro-magnetic field (caused by moving charges), gravitational field (caused by mass), and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the events}} are placed along {{the axis of}} train movement, their time {{coordinates}} become projected to different time coordinates in the moving train's <b>inertial</b> <b>frame.</b> Events which occurred at space coordinates {{in the direction of}} train movement (in the stationary frame), happen earlier than events at coordinates opposite to the direction of train movement. In the moving train's <b>inertial</b> <b>frame,</b> this means that lightning will strike the front of the train car before two observers align (face each other).|$|E
