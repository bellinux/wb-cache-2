The resistance of model 41 -B was {{greater than that of}} model 41 -A, either when free to trim or at the best trim angle for each. The resistance of model 35 -B (a pointed step hull tested free to trim) was less than either of the models at the <b>hump</b> <b>speed,</b> greater at intermediate planing speeds, and less at the speeds and loads near get-away, although the spray was generally worse owing to the absence of transverse flare. The results of the fixed-trim tests of model 41 -A were cross plotted to obtain data at the angle for zero trimming moment and at the best trim angle. The trims assumed by models 41 -A and 41 -B, when tested free to trim, were found to be excessive at the <b>hump</b> <b>speed.</b> The corresponding trim of model 35 -B was found to be approximately 3 degrees lower because of the lower angle of afterbody keel used in this model, and the maximum hump resistance was 15 percent lower...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Speed</b> <b>humps</b> {{have become}} a common traffic calming {{technique}} to reduce vehicle speeds in residential neighborhoods. There {{is a need to}} develop standard <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> warning signs as well as to determine <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings that take into account both motorist comprehension and community preference. This study had two major goals. The first was to examine preference for various configurations for signs that are placed next to a <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> as well as for lead signs when approaching a series of <b>speed</b> <b>humps.</b> The second was to examine which type of <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings people prefer. There were 103 research participants in this study. In the first task, participants developed <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> signs that included <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> symbols, <b>speed</b> advisory messages, and location indication messages. In the second task, participants compared ten different <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings and determined which markings they: (1) liked the most, (2) thought made it easiest to actually detect a hump, (3) thought made it most difficult to do so, and (4) thought best indicated a raised pedestrian crosswalk. The paper discusses the various <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> sign configurations and roadway markings that participants preferred or thought would most effectively warn drivers. The results of this study will be used in future research to objectively evaluate comprehension, conspicuity, and driver behavior for different <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> sign and marking designs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many jurisdictions {{are faced}} with {{increased}} traffic speeds and volumes on residential streets. In an attempt to mitigate these unwanted traffic characteristics many jurisdictions have implemented traffic calming programs. The most commonly used traffic calming devices to reduce vehicle <b>speeds</b> are <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables. These devices {{have been shown to}} be effective in large urbanized areas but little information is available on their impact in smaller rural cities. This study examined the impact of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables on vehicle speed profiles, mean vehicle speed, 85 th percentile vehicle speed, and the frequency of speeders in the City of Atlantic (population of approximately 7, 400). Temporary <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables were installed on two residential streets, Roosevelt Drive and Redwood Drive, in Atlantic. Speed data was collected during four periods: “before”, while the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> was in place, while the speed table was in place, and “after”. Speed data were collected and evaluated upstream of the devices, at the devices, and downstream of the devices. It was concluded that the <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables effectively reduced mean vehicle speed and 85 th percentile vehicle speed at the location of the devices and downstream of the devices but not upstream of the devices. An evaluation of 85 th percentile speed indicated that these devices are as effective in small rural cities as they are in more urbanized areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{take-off}} performance of {{a model of the}} hull of a typical flying boat, Navy PH- 1, of fitting spray strips of four different widths, each at three different angles, was determined by model tests in the NACA Tank. Spray strips of widths up to 3 percent of the beam improve the general performance at speeds near the hump and reduce the spray thrown. A downward angle of 30 degrees to 45 degrees in the neighborhood of the step seems most favorable for the reduction of the spray.

40|$|Flume {{measurements}} of a one-dimensional sliding hump starting from rest in quiescence fresh water indicate {{that when the}} hump travels at speed less than the shallow-water wave celerity, three waves emerge, travelling in two directions. One wave travels {{in the opposite direction}} to the sliding hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (backward free wave). Another wave travels approximately in step with the hump (forced wave), and the remaining wave travels {{in the direction of the}} hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (forward free wave). These experiments were completed for a range of sliding <b>hump</b> <b>speed</b> relative to the shallow-water wave celerity, up to unity of this ratio, to investigate possible derivation from solutions of the Euler equation with non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms being included or excluded. For the experimental arrangements tested, the forced waves were negative (depression or reduced water surface elevation) waves while the free waves were positive (bulges or increased water surface elevation). For experiments where the sliding hump travelled at less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity did not include transient behaviour measurements (i. e. when the three waves still overlapped). The three wave framework was partially supported by these measurements in that the separated forward and forced waves were compared to measurements. For the laboratory scale experiments, the forward free wave height was predicted reasonably by the long-wave equation (ignoring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms) when the sliding <b>hump</b> <b>speed</b> was less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity. The forced wave depression magnitude required the Euler equations for all <b>hump</b> <b>speed</b> tested. The long-wave solution, while being valid in a limited parameter range, does predict the existence of the three waves as found in these experiments (forward travelling waves measured quantitatively while the backward travelling waves visually by video). Nevertheless, the forced wave transient development required non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms for higher sliding hump speeds. The forward free wave, controversially, does not need non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms until much higher hump speeds, suggesting that the forward free wave falls in the parameter space where long-wave equations apply whereas the forced wave more often falls into the parameter space requiring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms. It does raise the question of why the forced wave transient dynamics does not impact on the initial transient dynamics where the forward free wave is in the long-wave theory, escaping the forced wave (at least for speeds less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity) ...|$|E

Waterjets are used for high-speed multihulls due to their high efficiency when operating at speeds beyond <b>hump</b> <b>speed.</b> However, they are generally not used for medium-speed applications due to the assumed decrease in efficiency at lower speed. A series of self-propulsion tests of a high-speed wave-piercing catamaran at medium-speeds was carried out to study the influence of the hydrodynamics at medium-speeds on the waterjet propulsors. The model tests were carried out using load varied (i. e. British method) self-propulsion testing in calm water. Due to size requirements of the model, a single demihull was utilised in close proximity to the side wall of the towing tank which acts as the plane of symmetry, reflecting waves generated by the demihull and therefore providing the correct blockage effects and wave interference for the non-existing second demihull.

40|$|A road hump, or speed hump, is {{a traffic}} calming device {{used to reduce}} vehicle speed and volume on {{residential}} streets. Road humps are placed across the road to slow traffic and are often installed {{in a series of}} several humps in order to prevent cars from speeding before and after the <b>hump.</b> <b>Speed</b> humps are used in locations where very low speeds are desired and reasonable. Speed humps are typically placed on residential roads and are not used on major roads, bus routes, or primary emergency response routes. In Italy, the road humps are often built in shape of raised crosswalks, or RCWs, and they are generally placed both close and between intersections. This paper deals with the analysis of observed data on a large sample of RCWs located in Tuscany, central Italy. Such data were referred both to geometry characteristics of the single raised crosswalk and recorded differences in vehicle speeds before and after it. Speed data were gathered using two automatic radar-recorders for each one of the sampled raised crosswalks. All the collected data were analyzed trough statistical tests in order to assess their homogeneity or not between different locations and various types of roads. Finally, we were able of making some conclusions and highlighting design aspects. On one side, RCWs with similar geometries and higher heights (about 15 cm) have similar effects on vehicle speeds lowering, regardless of local conditions (location, road geometry, driver behaviour, etc.).

The forces on the forebody and afterbody of one configuration are compared with the forces on a conventional hull. Increasing the angle of afterbody keel had small effect on hump resistance and no effect on high-speed resistance but increased free-to-trim resistance at intermediate speeds. Increasing the depth of step increased hump resistance, had little effect on high-speed resistance, and increased free-to-trim resistance at intermediate speeds. Omitting the chines on the forward 25 percent of the afterbody had no appreciable effect on resistance. Omitting 70 percent of the chine length had almost no effect on maximum resistance but broadened the hump and increased spray around the afterbody. Load-resistance ratio at the hump decreased more rapidly with increasing load coefficient for the planing-tail hull than for the representative conventional hull, although the load-resistance ratio at the hump was greater for the planing-tail hull than for the conventional hull throughout the range of loads tested. At speeds higher than <b>hump</b> <b>speed,</b> load-resistance ratio for the planing-tail hull was a maximum at a particular gross load and was slightly less at heavier and lighter gross loads. The planing-tail hull was found to have lower resistance than the conventional hull at both the hump and at high speeds, but at intermediate speeds there was little difference. The lower hump resistance of the planing-tail hull was attributed to the ability of the afterbody to carry a greater percentage of the total load while maintaining a higher value of load-resistance ratio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>hump</b> {{is one of}} {{the traffic}} calming devices that has been {{installed}} in residential area in Malaysia. This study was to find a better design of <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> in reducing <b>speed</b> of vehicles. Data were collected using Speed Radar Meter Detector. Two sets of data were collected. They were speed before reaching the hump (at 30 m before the device, this is due to safe stopping sight distance) and <b>speed</b> over the <b>hump</b> for both motorcycles and cars. Data were collected in one hour or at least 50 vehicles at three locations. The effectiveness of the humps is measured by comparing the reduction in <b>speed</b> at the <b>hump.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> also influenced by other parameters such as height and width of it...|$|R
40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>hump</b> or {{also known}} as road hump is {{designed}} to ensure safety for both drivers and pedestrian. The use of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in residential streets is an efficient way of controlling speed ofvehicles. However, in Malaysia some ofthe dimensions designed by the local authorities had been implemented on an 'ad hoc' basis without any proper standards or guidelines (HPU, 2002). Although Highway Planning Unit (HPU) and Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) have stipulated specific ranges of dimensions for the installation of <b>speed</b> <b>humps,</b> however no perfect and ideal guidelines were introduced and were not properly enforced by the local authorities. Therefore, with many styles and inconsistent designs of the <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> a well-established empirical study has been implemented to develop optimal designs consistency models. In this study, the geometric design of the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> was related to 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. The speed data were carried out by using a laser gun meter detector to obtain the spot speed data at the selected <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> location and vibration data collection were carried out using triaxial acceleration transducers connected to Racelogic VBOX II SX. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to develop a statistical relationship between <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> geometric, 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. In the validation stage, the site empirical data were compared with the predicted data using the paired T -test and discrepancy measure such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Finally, the models have successfully developed and validated according to the statistical procedures in the study. The findings are hoped to provide a starting point towards {{the development of a}} standard for the <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in residential areas which will not only focus on the effectiveness but also considering the safety and discomfort level of the road users while travelling on the <b>speed</b> <b>hump...</b>|$|R
