60|$|It was {{not till}} many days had passed that the Princess began {{to accept the}} idea of having done, a little, {{something}} she was not always doing, or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a new tone. Yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the fruit, positively, of recognitions and perceptions already active; of the sense, above all, that she had made, at a particular hour, made by the mere touch of her hand, a difference in the situation so long present to her as practically unattackable. This situation had been occupying, for months and months, the very centre of the garden of her life, but it had reared itself there like some strange, tall tower of ivory, or perhaps rather some wonderful, beautiful, but outlandish pagoda, a structure plated with hard, bright porcelain, coloured and figured and adorned, at the overhanging eaves, with silver bells that tinkled, ever so charmingly, when stirred by chance airs. She had walked round and round it--that was what she felt; she had carried on her existence in the space left her for circulation, a space that sometimes seemed ample and sometimes narrow: looking up, all the while, at the fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high, but never quite making out, as yet, where she might have entered had she wished. She had not wished till now--such was the odd case; and what was doubtless equally odd, besides, was that, though her raised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve, from within, and especially far aloft, as apertures and outlooks, no door appeared to give access from her convenient <b>garden</b> <b>level.</b> The great decorated surface had remained consistently impenetrable and inscrutable. At present, however, to her considering mind, {{it was as if she}} had ceased merely to circle and to scan the elevation, ceased so vaguely, so quite helplessly to stare and wonder: she had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing, then in that of lingering, and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly near. The thing might have been, by the distance at which it kept her, a Mahometan mosque, with which no base heretic could take a liberty; there so hung about it the vision of one's putting off one's shoes to enter, and even, verily, of one's paying with one's life if found there as an interloper. She had not, certainly, arrived at the conception of paying with her life for anything she might do; but it was nevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain plates. She had knocked, in short--though she could scarce have said whether for admission or for what; she had applied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen. Something had happened; it was as if a sound, at her touch, after a little, had come back to her from within; a sound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted.|$|E

50|$|An {{extension}} {{was built}} in two phases, while the hotel was closed each year, from October to April 2007 - 2008 and again in2008-2009, and opened in May 2009. The project was designed by architect Luc Svetchine and comprised 16 rooms, 8 suites with private plunge pools, a 7500sq.feet spa with indoor swimming pool {{and the creation of}} two new suites on the <b>garden</b> <b>level</b> of the main building. The grounds are the work of landscape gardener Jean Mus. A new underground car park replaced the old above-ground parking areas.|$|E
50|$|The gardens were {{of great}} renown and highly regarded. Home Place was perhaps Prior's {{greatest}} garden design. Garden making was a preoccupation of his middle period.

The central feature of the garden is a large basin. Pergolas with masonry walls lead east and west.|$|E
50|$|This small castle, whose {{construction}} {{seems to}} {{date from the}} 13th century, has undergone various substantial transformations, notably in the 16th century, when large double windows were opened up on the first floor, and during the 18th century. The lowest floor, which {{was used as a}} cellar and, probably, stables, extends beneath the whole of the castle. It is entirely barrel vaulted and several murder-holes indicate that this floor was used for defence. The <b>garden</b> <b>level</b> is about 1m30 higher, so the lower floor is partly below ground. It is likely that the castle was surrounded by moats, later filled in. Access to the first floor is by a staircase in the west tower. The interior was greatly altered during the 18th century and maintains decoration from that period. The attic floor was dedicated to defence, though the external crenellation has disappeared. The top of the east tower has been removed. On {{the eastern side of the}} east tower, there is evidence of the existence of attached buildings which have been destroyed at some time. This tower has also been reduced in height.|$|E

We were pretty constantly mounting in our motor-flight from the station; the uplands opened round us, and began to roll far away towards the liberal horizon, in undulations that were very stately. There is something, indeed, in the sufficiency of English downs which satisfies without surfeiting, and this we had from the windows and <b>gardened</b> <b>levels</b> of our friends' house even more than from the highroad, which we suddenly left to approach the place by a way of its own.

50|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{landmarks}} of its region, the Colorado National Guard Armory, known commonly by locals simply as the Armory, was built in 1913 by the Colorado National Guard as an armory, quarters, mess hall and auditorium for the Guard's Company A of Engineers. When it was completed in 1914, the Company was housed in this building's second and third floors while the first-story <b>garden</b> <b>level</b> was available for rental to the public. The Armory's original uses included: Golden's Post Office (northeast first-level storefront); photo shop (northwest first-level storefront); barracks, mess hall, weapons storage and drill hall (second level); auditorium (third level); and map room (tower). In subsequent years the building served in part or whole as a hotel, offices, industrial bank, and student housing. During the influenza epidemic of 1918 the building became an emergency hospital for ill patients used by the Red Cross, and in 1933 it became the local headquarters of the Civil Works Administration, the federal depression era agency which created several area improvements. Today the Armory serves as Colorado School of Mines student housing with offices and shops.|$|E
5000|$|Built in 1980 by Cadillac Fairview, a Canadian developer, the 900000 sq ft, four-level mall {{is located}} on two large city blocks of former urban renewal land. It opened in August 1980 {{and was the first}} of three Gallerias to open in the fall of 1980 around the nation, the others being Sherman Oaks and Fort Lauderdale. Its anchor stores are Macy's and Sears, which were {{relocated}} to the mall from nearby locations on Main Street to replace the original anchor stores. Abraham & Straus occupied the east anchor spot until converting to Sterns in 1995 and being replaced by Macy's a year later. The west anchor J.C. Penney closed on April 28, 2001 and was left vacant until September 2003 when Sears moved in. Martin Luther King Blvd. runs directly underneath the mall. The mall was constructed adjacent to a large two-block long parking garage which is connected directly to the mall at various levels. Shopping floors were color coded blue, green, yellow and red representing Street Level, <b>Garden</b> <b>Level,</b> location of the Garden food court, and Fashion Level 1 and 2 respectively. During the holiday season the mall's slogan was [...] "We bring more good things to Christmas". The mall was renovated in the early 90's and only the glass elevator remains relatively unchanged.

40|$|The Atlantic Rainforest {{is an area}} of {{importance}} for the conservation of biodiversity. Many traditional communities of peasants maintain secular agricultural practices. The relationship between these communities and their environment is of great relevance to the proposition of conservation strategies, because these communities have been interacting with the Rainforest environment through many generations. This paper analyses the influence of agricultural management techniques of shift cultivation on the creation and maintenance of genetic variability of clops at infra and interspecific levels in areas of Atlantic forest in the southern coast of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil We have determined the diversity of crops used by traditional family units, establishing inter actions between the management processes used by the agriculturists and the life history components of their crops. For edible uses, 24 ethnospecies were cited (common names), corresponding to II botanical families and 161 varieties. We also discuss ethnotaxonomical features of cultivated species. The maintenance of diversity and its amplification at the <b>garden</b> <b>level</b> are consequences of the interaction between farmer management and life history components of the crops. Natural dispersion and the establishment of soil seed banks associated to disturbance cycles stimulating colonization are examples of processes involved in the dynamics of diversity amplification...|$|E
40|$|Villa Diomede {{is a great}} roman {{building}} {{located on}} the western corner of the modern archaeological site of Pompeii, built during III century BC and discovered between 1771 and 1774 during archaeological excavations. The system is composed by three levels: the road level, the <b>garden</b> <b>level,</b> which hosts the portico structure, and the underground level. The building includes diverse types of masonry {{with a wide range}} of unit shapes, dimensions and materials (i. e. tuff, limestone, volcanic stone, clay brick etc.). Besides, an unconventional tuff masonry type was observed on some structures of the garden; it reveals inclined head joints, whose structural function is still unknown. The paper reports the numerical micro-modeling of this particular texture of masonry, where the constitutive materials (tuff units and mortar) are discretized. The main goal of the work is the assessment of inclined masonry joints as an aseismic detail compared with widespread traditional tuff running bond masonry. Micro models of masonry wallettes were created assigning a non-linear constitutive behavior, i. e. total strain crack model (with a parabolic behavior in compression and an exponential softening behavior in tension, whereas damage due to tensile cracking was modeled adopting a rotating crack model). Moreover, brittle 2 D interfaces were modeled between mortar and units at inclined joints surfaces. The paper focuses on numerical prediction of compressive response of masonry models subjected to uniaxial compressive tests. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Message from Jay: The 2 ̆ 2 Library as Place 2 ̆ 2 {{might be}} a good {{subtitle}} for this issue of the Friends of the Library Newsletter. The UMass Amherst Libraries are an important center on campus, not only for accessing the resources and services traditionally offered to students and faculty, but also as a welcoming place for collaborative study, campus support services, and socialization. The renovation of the Integrated Sciences and Engineering Library was our first experience with this at the UMass Amherst Libraries. The new facility offers comfortable seating, wireless internet access, and areas where students can work together in a collaborative environment. The success of this project has inspired a transformation of physical space in the W. E. B. Du Bois Library. Procrastination Station, the new café in the lobby of Du Bois Library, is an immediately visible statement of this new philosophy for our facilities. In contrast to this very busy social space, we have created a quiet study area on the second floor. The new Learning Commons on the <b>Garden</b> <b>Level</b> is an exciting project sponsored by the Provost that will support students in their learning and in their campus life. We also have great aspirations for a new media viewing area, an expanded Special Collections and University Archives, and some extraordinary event space onthe 26 th floor. To make this transformation of our current facilities posssible, we are depending on the support of the Friends of the Library. Your philanthropy will allow the UMass Amherst Libraries to create the new spaces so richly deserved by our students. I look forward to working with youand other Friends as we move ahead with these exciting new plans. Jay Schafer Director of Librarie...|$|E
40|$|Blister beetle is {{a highly}} movable Coleopteran insect. Adults mainly feed on floral parts while grub {{exhibits}} predacious habit which preys on honey bee and eggs of grasshoppers. Management of this beetle in the garden which predominantly contains flowering plants is a serious concern. Application of chemical pesticides is costly comparatively while it leads to environmental hazards. By considering these aspects the experiment was conducted to evaluate the infestation severity and efficiency of handpicking in both laboratory and field. For damage estimation two severely affected plants species were selected and assessed in terms of damaging parts in flower and count of beetle while in vitro {{study was conducted to}} analyze the feeding preference by introducing the beetles into four different plants species. Four replicates were maintained. Results were analyzed statistically using one-way ANOVA in SPSS. Handpicking was performed every day Morning up to seven days continuously. The results revealed most of the flower parts damaged by this beetle except sepal and ovary. In field level beetle infestation high in shoe flower and the maximum damage percentage obtained as 54. 6 per plant. In vitro study also confirmed that the shoe is highly preferred by this beetle while among the shoe flower species shoe flower yellow and shoe flower big pink scored 100 damage but shoe flower yellow significantly damaged by this beetle. Handpicking reduced the number of beetles significantly since it was noted that the number beetles were high in some random plants up to three days. After the fourth day the population was minimized to zero and no further entry observed.
