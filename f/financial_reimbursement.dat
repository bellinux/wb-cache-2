40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the impact of the {{financial}} assistance for textbooks and related instructional materials portion of Public Law No. 390 (1987) on textbook rental programs in public school corporations across Indiana. The results of the analysis were compared with data from the financial assistance program prescribed in Public Law No. 209 (1979). The Indiana Department of Education's Textbook Cost Survey was designed to collect financial information about textbook rental programs for the school years 1984 - 85 through 1986 - 87 when P. L. 209 was in effect. A questionnaire, modeled after the Textbook Cost Survey, was developed to collect similar information for the school year 1987 - 88 when P. L. 390 came into effect. This survey was sent to the 209 school corporation that had responded to the Department of Education survey. Percentage distributions and mean per pupil financial data were ascertained for the data obtained from the two instruments. Based on information gained from the study, a comparative analysis of the impact of Public Laws 209 and 390 on Indiana textbook rental programs was made. Data collected supported the following conclusions: 1. Because Indiana law requires the adoption of some new textbooks each year, mean per pupil textbook rental billings will continue to increase annually, as mean per pupil textbook rental billings did from 1984 - 85 through 1987 - 88, the four years included in this study. 2. The overall percentage of mean per pupil textbook rental billings collected each year from parent/guardians or emancipated minors will continue to decrease as did the overall percentage of mean per pupil textbook rental billings collected during the four years (1984 - 1988) included in the study. 3. Because of the inclusion of standardized financial eligibility criteria and allocation of sufficient funding for total <b>reimbursement</b> of eligible <b>financial</b> assistance billings from individual school corporations, the financial assistance portion of P. L. 390 is an improvement over P. L. 209. 4. Because of the specific delineation of textbook rental fee components eligible for <b>financial</b> assistance <b>reimbursement</b> under P. L. 390, implementation of the law brought about changes in the components some school corporations included in textbook rental billings. 5. In an attempt to make up some of the difference between actual textbook rental billings and eligible financial assistance billings sent to the Department of Education for reimbursement, an increasing percentage of school corporations switched from annual recovery of 20 percent of textbook costs to annual recovery of 25 percent of costs after implementation of P. L. 390. 6. School corporations who ask parent/guardians or emancipated minors approved for financial assistance to pay the difference between the actual amount of textbook rental billings and the amount of <b>financial</b> assistance <b>reimbursement</b> received from the state face a difficult public relations situation. 7. The data from 1987 - 88 appear to indicate P. L. 390 has had a positive impact on the mean per pupil amounts of unpaid textbook rental billings pursued for collection. 8. The mean per pupil costs for pursuing collection of unpaid textbook rental billings through small claims court or other collection methods are not truly representative of actual costs because personnel costs were frequently omitted. 9. Textbook rental funds which are, theoretically, designed to be self-supporting cannot continuously absorb the loss of income resulting from exclusion of some components normally included in textbook rental billings from <b>financial</b> assistance <b>reimbursement,</b> exclusion of students qualifying after November 1 each year from <b>financial</b> assistance <b>reimbursement,</b> and reimbursement at a different percentage of costs than the percentage normally charged in textbook rental billings. 10. After implementation of the financial assistance portion of P. L. 390, those school corporations who indicated expenditures for components normally included in textbook rental billings but excluded from <b>financial</b> assistance <b>reimbursement</b> would be paid from the general fund, or who indicated the general fund would be used to reimburse textbook rental funds for the losses of income incurred through implementation of P.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{clinical}} {{decision rule}} (CDR), {{combined with a}} negative D-dimer test, can safely rule out deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in primary care. This strategy is recommended by guidelines, yet uptake by GPs is low. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a multi-faceted implementation strategy aimed at increased use of the guideline recommended CDR plus D-dimer test in primary care patients with suspected DVT. METHODS: This multi-faceted implementation strategy consisted of educational outreach visits, <b>financial</b> <b>reimbursements</b> and periodical newsletters. 217 Dutch GPs (implementation group) received this strategy and included patients. Effectiveness was measured through the following patient-level outcomes: (i) proportion of non-referred patients, (ii) proportion of missed DVT cases within this group and (iii) the proportion of patients in whom the guideline was applied incorrectly. Implementation outcomes ('acceptability', 'feasibility', 'fidelity' and 'sustainability') were assessed with an online questionnaire. Patient-level outcomes were {{compared with those of}} patients included by 450 GPs, uninformed about the study's purposes providing information about usual care. RESULTS: 336 (54 %) of 619 analyzable implementation group patients were not referred, missing 6 [1. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 7 % to 3. 9 %) ] DVT cases. Incorrect guideline use was observed in 199 patients (32 %). Self-reported acceptability, feasibility and expected sustainability were high. Guideline use increased from 42 % to an expected continuation of use of 91 %. Only 32 usual care GPs included 62 patients, making formal comparison unreliable. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-faceted implementation strategy safely reduced patient referral to secondary care, despite frequently incorrect application of the guideline and resulted in high acceptability, feasibility and expected sustainability...|$|R

30|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of European national health insurance systems there is no specific reimbursement fee or tariff available for teleradiology services. Usually the cost price for teleradiology is based upon a mutual agreement between the transmitting site and the teleradiology service provider (receiving site, teleradiology company), and in most cases it is financed as part of the integral radiology budget. Several business models exist in teleradiology, varying from a simple bilateral connection to a complex many-to-many type of connection using a teleradiology brokering service. In the contract the purpose of the service, responsibilities, liability and other relevant issues should be addressed [3, 27]. Teleradiology services should not be regarded as a tradable commodity but as a strategic part of the entire imaging process. The local radiologists should always be involved in the decision-making process of outsourcing with teleradiology. The <b>financial</b> and/or <b>reimbursement</b> issues should be discussed transparently with all parties involved, including radiologists, and the pricing should never be the principal basis upon which a decision to outsource is made.

40|$|Abstract Background South Africa, {{with its}} {{scientific}} capacity, good infrastructure and high HIV incidence rates, is ideally positioned to conduct large-scale HIV prevention trials. The HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council conducted four phase III and one phase IIb trials of women-initiated HIV prevention options in KwaZulu-Natal between 2003 and 2009. A total of 7046 women participated, with HIV prevalence between 25 % and 45 % and HIV incidence ranging from 4. 5 - 9. 1 % per year. Unfortunately {{none of the}} interventions tested had any impact on {{reducing the risk of}} HIV acquisition; however, extremely valuable experience was gained, lessons learned and capacity built, while the communities gained associated benefits. Experience Our experience in conducting these trials ranged from setting up community partnerships to developing clinical research sites and dissemination of trial results. Community engagement included setting up community-based research sites with approval from both political and traditional leaders, and developing community advisory groups to assist with the research process. Community-wide education on HIV/sexually transmitted infection prevention, treatment and care was provided to over 90 000 individuals. Myths and misconceptions were addressed through methods such as anonymous suggestion boxes in clinic waiting areas and intensive education and counselling. Attempts were made to involve male partners to foster support and facilitate recruitment of women. Peer educator programmes were initiated to provide ongoing education and also to facilitate recruitment of women to the trials. Recruitment strategies such as door-to-door recruitment and community group meetings were initiated. Over 90 % of women enrolled were retained. Community benefits from the trial included education on HIV prevention, treatment and care and provision of ancillary care (such as Pap smears, reproductive health care and referral for chronic illnesses). Social benefits included training of home-based caregivers and sustainable ongoing HIV prevention education through peer educator programmes. Challenges Several challenges were encountered, including manipulation by participants of their eligibility criteria in order to enroll in the trial. Women attempted to co-enroll in multiple trials to benefit from <b>financial</b> <b>reimbursements</b> and individualised care. The trials became ethically challenging when participants refused to take up referrals for care due to stigma, denial of their HIV status and inadequate health infrastructure. Lack of disclosure of HIV status to partners and family members was particularly challenging. Some of the ethical dilemmas put to the test our responsibility as researchers and our obligation to provide health care to research participants. Conclusion Conducting these five trials in a period of six years provided us with invaluable insights into trial implementation, community participation, recruitment and retention, provision of care and dissemination of trial results. The critical mass of scientists trained as clinical trialists will continue to address the relentless HIV epidemic in our setting and ensure our commitment to finding a biomedical HIV prevention option for women in the future. </p...|$|R

Intervention (thrombolytics and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA]) was only applied to patients at less than 6 hours from symptom onset. Nonintervention patients were subsequently considered for angiography and revascularization (PTCA, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) based on clinical criteria. Clinical outcome was evaluated by in-hospital mortality and uncomplicated status (free of angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias) at 72 hours. Intervention was associated with decreased mortality (5. 3 % versus 13 %, p = 0. 16) and increased uncomplicated course (43 % versus 19 %, p p = 0. 50). In conclusion, despite the potential marked incremental expense of technology associated with intervention for acute myocardial infarction, this analysis demonstrates that benefit in clinical outcome can be derived without substantially increased costs...|$|R

The consistency between nursing documentation and technical nursing interventions performed indicates that registered nurses provide much more care than they record.

The purpose of this EBP project was to implement a multifaceted reminder intervention (including a 10 -minute PowerPoint and visual reminder) in an IMCU setting to assist the nursing staff (n = 38) in completing the HAPU documentation components. John Kotter’s Eight-Stage Process and the Iowa Model of EBP were used to guide this project.

Currently, depending on the clinic and hospital that the psychologist is affiliated with, their services {{may or may not be}} covered by insurance or the institution's funds and reimbursement issues prevent pediatric psychologists from intervening in the most effective ways. Pediatric psychologists are trained in data analysis and research and so efforts should be made to demonstrate the benefits of pediatric psychologists and pediatricians collaborating such that the necessary reimbursements are instituted (http://www.nextgenmd.org/archives/808).

Instead of creating a special court, Smith suggested that existing local courts could instead determine the validity of land claims. When it became apparent that the Court of Private Land Claims was to be created, Smith attempted to have Arizona excluded from the court's jurisdiction by arguing the territory had less than a dozen land claims, only two of which had any validity.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Edison was {{impressed}} by the film and O'Brien was hired by the Edison Company to animate a series of short films with a prehistoric theme, these included R.F.D. 10,000 B.C. and Prehistoric Poultry (both 1917). During this time he also worked on other Edison Company productions including Sam Loyd's The Puzzling Billboard and Nippy's Nightmare (both 1917), which were the first stop-motion films to combine live actors with stop motion models. These films led to a commission from Herbert M. Dawley to write, direct, co-star and produce the effects for another dinosaur film, The Ghost of Slumber Mountain (1918), for a budget of $3,000. The collaboration was not a happy one and Dawley would cut the 45-minute film down to 11 minutes and claimed credit for O'Brien's pioneering effects work, which combined realistic stop-motion animated prehistoric models with live action. The film grossed over $100,000 and Dawley used the cut effects footage in a sequel Along the Moonbeam Trail (1920) and the documentary Evolution (1923), but O'Brien received little <b>financial</b> <b>reimbursement</b> from this success. [...] The film however did help to secure his position on Harry O. Hoyt's The Lost World. For his early, short films O'Brien created his own characters out of clay, although for much of his feature career he would employ Richard and Marcel Delgado to create much more detailed stop-motion models (based on O'Brien's designs) with rubber skin built up over complex, articulated metal armatures. The models contained a bladder inside the skeleton model that could be inflated and deflated to give the illusion of breathing. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who appeared in the prologue to the film based on his novel of the same name, reportedly showed a reel of O'Brien's animation from the film to his friends, claiming it was real footage of living dinosaurs, to try to convince them that his story was based on fact.|$|E
