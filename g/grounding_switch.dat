40|$|Switching-in of {{short-circuit}} current leads to pre-arcing in the switching device. Pre-arcing affects {{the ability of}} switchgear to close and latch. In three-phase systems, making is associated with transient voltage phenomena that may {{have a significant impact}} on the duration of the pre-arcing period. An analysis is presented of these transients. It was found that pre-arcing times in three-phase systems can be considerably prolonged with respect to a single phase situation. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the three-phase interaction has a moderating influence on the peak value of asymmetrical current. A test-circuit is described, able to perform three-phase synthetic make tests up to 245 kV at current up to 63 kA, representing all transient phenomena. Specific tests are described requiring the maximum available laboratory power: one with a circuit breaker subjected to direct test and one with a high-speed <b>grounding</b> <b>switch</b> subjected to synthetic tests...|$|E

The station will also have lightning arresters for protection of the AC equipment from lightning surges on the AC system.|$|R
5000|$|Professional audio {{equipment}} {{intended for use}} with balanced lines may have a <b>ground</b> lift <b>switch</b> for the cable shield. The <b>ground</b> lift <b>switch</b> eliminates unwanted hum and buzz by interrupting the ground loops between equipment, preventing current flow along the cable shield between two devices.

40|$|Preliminary ground {{correlation}} {{testing has}} been conducted with an 8 cm mercury ion thruster and diagnostic instrumentation replicating {{to a large extent}} the IAPS flight test hardware, configuration, and electrical grounding/isolation. Thruster efflux deposition retained at 25 C was measured and characterized. Thruster ion efflux was characterized with retarding potential analyzers. Thruster-generated plasma currents, the spacecraft common (SCC) potential, and ambient plasma properties were evaluated with a spacecraft potential probe (SPP). All the measured thruster/spacecraft interactions or their IAPS measurements depend critically on the SCC potential, which can be controlled by a neutralizer <b>ground</b> <b>switch</b> and by the SPP operation...|$|R

While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and <b>ground</b> <b>switches.</b> While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability.

40|$|Air {{passengers}} {{are required by}} the law to switch off their mobile phones on board any flight [1]. This requirement has been imposed due to two reasons. First, signals emitted by the mobile phone interfere with Air Traffic Control (ATC) signals, undermining {{the safety of the}} flight. Second, a mobile at such an altitude connects to multiple base stations simultaneously, clogging the resources of the ground network. We have developed a novel solution based on the integration of diverse communication links: Bluetooth, Cellular Network (GSM/IS- 95), PSTN and Air-to-ground connection. Our solution enables the user to remain connected inflight, while solving the above two critical issues. The switch over from the cellular network to our in-flight Bluetooth network does not require any user initiation or change of the mobile handset. Bluetooth, due to its low power, short range and fast frequency hopping presents negligible interference to ATC signals. When the passenger enters the plane, call forwarding is set up from the cellular network to our <b>Ground</b> <b>Switching</b> Center (GSC) and the hazardous GSM emissions of the mobile phone are automatically switched off. All voice (or data) is received at the GSC and transferred through an air-to-ground link to a Bluetooth Airplane Gateway (BTAG) in the plane. Data received at the BTAG is finally transmitted over an in-flight Bluetooth network to the passenger. We have implemented a Bluetooth enabled GSM phone, (on a laptop using a GSM modem and a Bluetooth kit), the Bluetooth Airplane Gateway and the <b>Ground</b> <b>Switching</b> Center (using a phone modem for connecting to the PSTN). The automatic setup up of various communication hops, call routing and transmission of voice over these links has been demonstrated. The system provides a unique a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In jegichagi, {{similar to}} Western Hacky Sack, players kick a jegi and the {{player with the}} {{greatest}} number of kicks wins. Usually played in winter, jegichagi's name varies by region. The jegi, similar in appearance to a shuttlecock, is made from a coin and hanji (handmade Korean paper). The player kicks the jegi into the air, and continues kicking it to keep it off the <b>ground.</b> <b>Switching</b> the kicking foot is permitted. In a one-on-one game, the player with the higher number of consecutive kicks wins; in a group game, players stand in a circle and take turns kicking the jegi. A player who lets the jegi fall to the ground loses, and tosses it to the winner to kick. When the loser catches the jegi with his hands, they can rejoin the game.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>ground</b> lift <b>switches</b> {{have the}} {{unwanted}} effect of disconnecting phantom power.

30|$|Transients: {{transients}} can {{be defined}} as unexpected changes of voltage or current from rated values. Its duration is very small, typically lasting from 200 s to 1 s. Lightning strikes, electrostatic discharges (ESD), poor <b>grounding,</b> load <b>switching,</b> and faulty wiring are the main reasons behind it. Transients can delete or change computer data and make hard to identify calculation errors. In severe cases, they can damage electronic instruments and hamper power system operations.|$|R

40|$|A {{single phase}} dynamic CMOS NOR-NOR {{programmable}} logic array (PLA) using triggered decoders and charge sharing techniques for high speed and low power is presented. By using the triggered decoder technique, the <b>ground</b> <b>switches</b> are eliminated, thereby, making this new design much faster and lower power dissipation than conventional PLA's. By using the charge-sharing technique in a dynamic CMOS NOR structure, a cascading AND gate can be implemented. The proposed PLA's are presented with a delay-time of 15. 95 and 18. 05 nsec, respectively, which compare with a conventional single phase PLA with 35. 5 nsec delay-time. For a typical example of PLA like the Signetics 82 S 100 with 16 inputs, 48 input minterms (m) and 8 output minterms (n), the 2 -SOP PLA using the triggered 2 -bit decoder is 2. 23 times faster and has 2. 1 times less power dissipation than the conventional PLA. These results are simulated using maximum drain current of 600 micro-A, gate length of 2. 0 micron, V sub DD of 5 V, the capacitance of an input miniterm of 1600 fF, and the capacitance of an output minterm of 1500 fF...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{simulation}} modeling method for the electrical switching system of hydropower station, {{which is a}} sub-topic for Hydropower Station Simulation Training System. The graphics model of commonly used electrical switch equipment is developed with a certain software [1]. As vast and different types of Hydropower station circuit breakers and associated <b>grounding</b> <b>switches,</b> and each specific action of the switch process is not same, so the modular modeling method is described to solve the problem. According to the role and status in power plant, electrical switch system is divided into several sub modules, among which {{a number of small}} modules are sorted in. In each sub module, a common model is developed. Besides, the application method that the network topology analysis algorithm used in electrical switching system simulation logic judgment is introduced. With the ‘connecting line fusion’ technique, logic function expression member information table is automatically generated, thereby enhancing the suitability for the electrical switch simulation model. The methods mentioned above assure the real-time, typicality and flexibility in simulation, and have been successfully used {{in the development of a}} large hydropower station simulator...|$|R
5000|$|The Sustainability in Sport terrace is at {{the north}} end of the ground. This terrace is the {{location}} for away fans and had previously housed home supporters.
