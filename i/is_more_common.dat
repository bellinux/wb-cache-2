5|$|In Europe, Boletus pinophilus {{is found}} in Britain, where it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in Scotland, and in France, where it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the south. The bolete is {{considered}} vulnerable in the Czech Republic. It is sold commercially in Finland.|$|E
5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, {{it is even more}} common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E

5000|$|About 20% {{of people}} are affected. Cases of short {{duration}} occur equally in males and females while cases of long duration <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in females. Cases of short duration <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> among children while cases of long duration <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{among those who are}} middle aged. Hives have been described at least since the time of Hippocrates. The term urticaria is from the Latin urtica meaning [...] "nettle".|$|R

5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} affects between 5% and 66% of people, {{with about}} 20% {{of individuals in}} most populations having the condition to some degree. This makes it the most common disease of the oral mucosa. Aphthous stomatitis occurs worldwide, but <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in developed countries.|$|E
5000|$|In Slovakia, the flag, their coat or {{arms and}} several {{municipal}} symbols include a double cross, where graded bars <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> than equally long bars, and balanced distances along the vertical line <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b>|$|R

5|$|Entoloma sinuatum {{is fairly}} common and {{widespread}} across North America {{as far south}} as Arizona. It also occurs throughout Europe and the British Isles including Ireland, though it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest. In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region, and Adıyaman Province in Turkey, Iran, and northern Yunnan in China.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious {{neurological}} disorders affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|However, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> to find Ediacaran fossils under sandy beds {{deposited}} by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping {{ocean currents}} known as turbidites. Soft-bodied organisms today rarely fossilize during such events, but {{the presence of}} widespread microbial mats probably aided preservation by stabilising their impressions in the sediment below.|$|E
30|$|With {{increasing}} age, {{there was}} {{no change in the}} mLDFA in children with MPS I and MPS II. A valgus distal femur (mLDFA ≤  85 °) <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in MPS I and a varus distal femur (mLDFA ≥  91 °) <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in MPS II.|$|R
25|$|A large 2008 {{population}} {{study of}} Swedish {{parents of children}} with autism found that the parents <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to have been hospitalized for a mental disorder, that schizophrenia <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> among the mothers and fathers, and that depression and personality disorders <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> among the mothers.|$|R
5000|$|While T-Posts <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the United States, Y-posts <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in Australia and New Zealand {{where they}} are {{sometimes}} called [...] "Waratahs", after the company which registered a patent for them in 1926. [...] In New Zealand Waratahs are often used for trail blazing.|$|R
5|$|In Europe it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in {{northern}} than south Europe, {{and it has}} not been reported from south and west Europe. In addition to being common in Scandinavian countries, it has been collected in Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, and Korea. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska, where it is usually found above the tree line.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12–40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam.|$|E
5|$|It is {{anticipated}} that rates of OHS will rise as {{the prevalence of}} obesity rises. This may also explain why OHS is more commonly reported in the United States, where obesity <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> than in other countries.|$|E

30|$|It {{might be}} that genetic and {{geographic}} differences {{play a role in}} the differences between the groups, mainly in the histological type of the Lymphoma. T-cell Lymphomas, for instance, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in Asia, while the B-cell Lymphomas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in Western countries (Rüdiger et al. 2002).|$|R
5|$|More than 50% of the world's {{population}} harbor H. pylori {{in their}} upper gastrointestinal tract. Infection <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{in developing countries}} than Western countries. H. pylori's helical shape (from which the genus name derives) {{is thought to have}} evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{prognosis}} {{is good in}} most patients, with one study showing recovery occurring in 94% and 89% of children and adults, respectively (some having needed treatment). In children under ten, the condition recurs in {{about a third of}} all cases and usually within the first four months after the initial attack. Recurrence <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in older children and adults.|$|E
5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E

5|$|Panellus stipticus {{is common}} in {{northern}} temperate regions of Europe, and has also been collected in Australia, New Zealand, Anatolia, Japan, and China. In North America, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the east than the west; the mushroom's northern range extends to Alaska, {{and it has been}} collected as far south as Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Severe disease <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in {{babies and}} young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause {{the full spectrum of}} disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|The species occurs {{throughout}} the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, North America, and Asia. In North America, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains. It has also been recorded from Australia and South Africa. In 2006, it was reported from the Arctic zone of the Ural Mountains, in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{tree species}} include the Douglas fir, the state tree, {{as well as}} redwood, ponderosa pine (generally east of the Cascades), western red cedar, and hemlock. Ponderosa pine <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the Blue Mountains {{in the eastern part}} of the state and firs <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the west.|$|R
50|$|Epidemiology Injury to {{the medial}} {{meniscus}} is {{about five times}} greater than injury to the lateral meniscus due to its anatomical attachment to the MCL. Lateral meniscal tears <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in acute ACL injuries, whereas medial mensical injuries <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in chronic ACL-deficient knees and more amenable to repair.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010 study, of all {{scientific}} fields chemistry had {{the lowest}} overall share of open access (13%), while Earth Sciences had the highest (33%).
