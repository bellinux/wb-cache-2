40|$|The pelvic {{cavities}} two australopithecines (Al 288, Sts 14) are studied biometrically {{in relation}} to a sample of extant human and non-human primates. Human obstetrical characteristics correspond to (1) a generic adaptation of the pelvic outlet which is opened ventrally to the ischial tuberosities, and (2) a sexual adaptation of the <b>female</b> <b>inlet</b> which is particularly enlarged between the hip joints and the pubic rami. The australopithecine pelvis presents most of these characteristics, but offers some significant dissimilarities notably an extreme biacetabular enlargement and a very specific morphology of the pubic region. A series of deductions leads us to suggest a Homo-like obstetrical mechanism for Australopithecus, characterized by the rotation and the flexion of the neonate, with fetal skull size similar to the one of the neonate chimpanzee, in the pelvic cavity. The constraints on the fetal skull are consequently as important as in human delivery. This means that the phenomenon of encephalization which took place during the evolution of the hominids could not be the result of an increase of the neonate cerebral capacity but was rather a consequence of neotenic change in growth-rhythm of the newborn. © 1994 Academic Press Inc.

5000|$|The gynaecoid pelvis is the {{so-called}} normal <b>female</b> pelvis. Its <b>inlet</b> is either slightly oval, with a greater transverse diameter, or round. The interior walls are straight, the subpubic arch wide, the sacrum shows an average to backward inclination, and the greater sciatic notch is well rounded. Because this type is spacious and well proportioned {{there is little or}} no difficulty in the birth process. Caldwell and his co-workers found gynaecoid pelves in about 50 per cent of specimens.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{variation}} in mating signals between environments {{can be an important}} determinant of reproductive isolation. We tested divergence in male courtship behavior between lake and stream three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) in the Misty system, Vancouver Island. Presumably, genetically based divergence was assessed by comparing male behavior (aggressive, display, and nest activities) among Lake, Inlet, and Outlet ecotypes that were reared from fertilization to maturity in a common environment. Plastic components of behavior were assessed by comparing male behavior in presence of females from each of the 3 ecotypes. We found that Inlet males had less aggressive elements than Lake and Outlet males in their behavior, whereas Lake and Outlet males were similar in their behavior. We further found that males of all ecotypes performed less display and nest activities in the presence of Lake and Outlet than <b>Inlet</b> <b>females</b> and that the male mating behavior was influenced by the relative difference in male and female body sizes. We suggest that divergent selection has driven genetic divergence in aggressive behaviors, whereas other behavioral components respond more plastically to variation in female phenotype. We discuss the implications of these results for reproductive isolation. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{comprehensive}} study of reproduction and embryonic development of Armases cinereum. Ovigerous A. cinereum (Bosc, 1802) <b>females</b> from Sebastian <b>Inlet,</b> Florida (9. 88 – 19. 4 mm CW) lay 2, 000 – 12, 000 eggs per brood, depending on their CW (mm) : fecundity = 24. 662 CW 1. 9432. A. cinereum displayed significant brood loss through development (ca. 500 eggs per brood) independently from their CW (no senescence). However, since smaller females lay fewer eggs than larger ones, the percentage of eggs lost during embryonic development is greater in smaller females. The number of eggs carried on a later stage of development (potential fertility = 5. 5593 CW 2. 4417) is a more accurate estimate of the reproductive output and subsequent recruitment. Egg volume increased during development (64 %, 0. 025 – 0. 041 mm 3 or 0. 36 – 0. 43 mm of diameter, N = 270) and was strongly correlated with egg water content increase (19. 21 %, r = 0. 89). Lipids, particularly fatty acids, {{seem to be the}} major energy source for embryonic development, decreasing 56. 31 and 37. 08 % (respectively) during embryonic development; both are negatively correlated with egg volume (r = − 0. 90). The utilization of fatty acids through the different developmental stages of A. cinereum is presented. The most consumed fatty acids are the monounsatured (43. 33 μg mg− 1 dw), followed by the saturated (29. 91 μg mg− 1 dw) and polyunsaturated (24. 03 μg mg− 1). Palmitic (16 : 0) and linoleic (18 : 2 n- 6) acids are preferentially consumed (19. 5 and 17. 9 μg mg− 1 dw, respectively). The high proportion of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids of C 18 and C 20 reflects the consumption of primary producers such as mangrove leaves. EPA/DHA ratio (2. 85 – 3. 84) and low DHA content indicated that this species appears in a medium-low level of the trophic chain. The low ratio of 18 : 1 n- 7 / 18 : 1 n- 9 and high percentage of 18 : 1 n- 9 (marker of carnivory) may be a sign of the consumption of juvenile invertebrates. The high percentage of odd-numbered FA indicated the occurrence of detritivores/scavenger behaviours. The fatty acid composition of the eggs reflects adult feeding ecology (omnivorous) and habitat...|$|R
