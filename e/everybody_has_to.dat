It’s kind of the next step: You were on a reality show, {{now you have to}} put out a song." [...] He {{said that he}} felt a personal connection with the recording process as he had [...] " [...] own soundtrack to [...] life that [...] play everyday". During an interview, he also described the single as a part of his experimentation with music.|$|E
500|$|According to Pechersky's plan, {{the prisoners}} would assassinate the German SS staff, thereby {{rendering}} the auxiliary guards leaderless, obtain weapons, {{and eliminate the}} remaining guards. Individual Polish Jewish inmates were assigned specific German SS guards that {{they were supposed to}} lure inside the workshops under some pretext and silently kill. Ester Raab, a survivor of the escape, recalled: [...] "The plan was, at 4 o’clock (pm), should start (the escape), <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> kill his SS man, and his guard at his place of work." [...] Only a small circle of trusted Polish Jewish inmates were aware of the escape plan as they didn't trust the Jews from other European countries.|$|E
500|$|Before New Amerykahs release, {{the album}} was {{tentatively}} called KahBa, which Badu derived from her name, as a reference to Islam and Kemetism. The title of the album series, New Amerykah, is a pun of Badu's name. She has explained one meaning of it as [...] "a statement that simply says, 'This {{is the beginning of}} the new world'-for both the slaves and the slave masters. In other words, <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> wake up and see. This new world moves much faster. We don't even realize how fast we're moving." [...] Part Ones subtitle, 4th World War, reflects the content's objective, political leanings, which Badu explained to be [...] "outside of me ... What’s going on outside is the left brain". Badu further explained New Amerykahs title in an interview for Remix: ...|$|E

500|$|Garrett {{said the}} song appeals to everyone, saying [...] "Whether you're a female in love, male in love, it's a real record. Your mama has {{to feel this}} record, your daddy has to feel this record, <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> feel this record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I {{definitely}} feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E

50|$|Two {{days after}} the release, Heinicke responded to the reproaches and the {{criticism}} for the first time.

60|$|This little rhyme Paddy the Beaver made {{up as he}} toiled at {{building}} the dam which {{was to make the}} pond he so much desired deep in the Green Forest. Of course it wasn't quite true, that about working all night and all day. Nobody could do that, you know, and keep it up. <b>Everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> rest and sleep. Yes, and <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> play a little to be at their best. So it wasn't quite true that Paddy worked all day after working all night. But it was true that Paddy had no time to play. He had too much to do. He had had his playtime during the long summer, and now he had {{to get ready for the}} long, cold winter.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is rather}} {{difficult}} to get accurate information about the Japanese army. It {{seems to be in}} perpetual throes of reorganisation. At present, so far as one can gather, it is about one hundred and seventy thousand strong. <b>Everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> serve for three years, but payment of one hundred dollars will shorten the term of service by one year at least. This is what a man who had gone through the mill told me. He capped his information with this verdict: [...] "English army no use. Only navy any good. Have seen two hundred English army. No use." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{tell his}} or her story, {{and for a long}} time there was a perfect babel of voices. Fred and Hans related how the steam yacht had been rescued from the {{clutches}} of the enemy, and how Frank Norton had taken command and prevented anything in the shape of a mutiny. The ladies and girls told of how they had been scared and how they had locked themselves up in a stateroom, as Bahama Bill had said. Then the Rover boys had to tell all about the finding of the great treasure.|$|E

6000|$|When {{we leave}} this room {{we go down}} some ladders and over a bridge, and then we enter {{what is called the}} [...] "Labyrinth," [...] where the passage turns and twists on itself in a very abrupt manner, and where the roof is so low that all of us, except those who are very short indeed, must stoop very low. When we get through this passage, which some folks call the [...] "Path of Humiliation"--for <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> bow down, you know--we come to a spot where the guide says he is going to show us {{something}} through a window.|$|E

But you're here, ain't you, a-gassin' with me an' likely to grow up an' be the father of a fine large family in Californy. They say everything grows large in Californy." ...|$|E
60|$|The love of {{gold and}} the great hatred that <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pirates were motives of the most influential, and would {{certainly}} raise the country in our pursuit. Besides, it was now plain we were {{on some sort of}} straggling peninsula, like the fingers of a hand; and the wrist, or passage to the mainland, which we should have taken at the first, was by this time not improbably secured. These considerations put us on a bolder counsel. For as long as we dared, looking every moment to hear sounds of the chase, we lay among some bushes {{on the top of the}} dune; and having by this means secured a little breath and recomposed our appearance, we strolled down at last, with a great affectation of carelessness, to the party by the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true, and it {{is readily}} explained," [...] {{answered}} the ranch owner. [...] "In the pioneer days <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> depend upon <b>everybody</b> else, and consequently all {{were more or less}} sociable. The feeling has not yet worn off. But I am afraid it will wear off, as we become more and more what is called civilized," [...] added Mr. Endicott, with something of a sigh.|$|R
50|$|On a {{historical}} note, Zhongshan North Road, which crosses the district was often used by Chiang Kai-shek {{to get to}} his home in Shilin. All traffic was stopped when this occurred as <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> salute the leader. Military police during martial law often lined the street as this road was used by numerous political and military leaders, some of which stayed at the Grand Hotel in Yuanshan.|$|R
60|$|She remonstrated {{with him}} reasonably, {{at some length}} too. He <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> {{complain}} of in his reception. Every new-comer was discussed more or less. <b>Everybody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be thoroughly understood before being accepted. No one that she could remember had been shown from the first so much confidence. Soon, very soon, perhaps sooner than he expected, he would be given an opportunity of showing his devotion to the sacred task of crushing the Infamy.|$|R
60|$|But Peter, {{who always}} had been so happy-go-lucky, {{with no one to}} think about but himself, now felt for the first time re-sponsi-bil-ity. That's a big word, but it is a word that <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> learn the meaning of sometime. Johnny Chuck learned it when he made a home for Polly Chuck in Farmer Brown's orchard, and tried to keep it a secret, so that no harm would come to Polly. It means taking care of other people or other people's things, and feeling that you must take even greater care than you would of {{yourself}} or your own things, So, while Peter himself would have been willing to take chances, and might even have made the journey down to the dear Old Briar-patch in broad daylight, he felt that that wouldn't do at all for little Miss Fuzzytail; that he must avoid every possible chance of danger for her.|$|E
6000|$|I don't know, to {{be quite}} candid about it, who {{mentioned}} whisky first. In these days <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be a little careful. I imagine we had all been thinking whisky for some time before anybody said it. But there {{is a sort of}} convention that when men go fishing they must have whisky. Each man makes the pretence that one thing he needs at six o'clock in the morning is cold raw whisky. It is spoken of in terms of affection. One man says the first thing you need if you're going fishing is a good [...] "snort" [...] of whisky; another says that a good [...] "snifter" [...] is the very thing; and the others agree that no man can fish properly without [...] "a horn," [...] or a [...] "bracer" [...] or an [...] "eye-opener." [...] Each man really decides that he himself won't take any. But he feels that, in a collective sense, the [...] "boys" [...] need it.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{there are}} left of us should, I think, remain together. I suppose they cannot turn {{me out of}} this house. The Prime Minister will hardly bring in a Bill that the estates bought this last hundred years shall belong to the owners of the next century. He can do so, of course, as things go now. There are no longer any lords to stop him, and the House of Commons, who want their seats, will do {{anything}} he bids them. It's the First Lieutenant who looks after Ireland, who has ideas of justice with which the angels of light have certainly not filled his mind. That we should get nothing from our purchased property this century, and give it up {{in the course of the}} next, is in strict accordance with his thinking. We can depend upon nothing. My brother-in-law can, of course, sell me out any day, and would not stop for a moment. <b>Everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> get his own, except an Irish landlord. But I think we should fare ill all together. Your brother is behaving nobly, and I don't think we ought to desert him. Of course you can do as you please." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the past}} the cadets had had {{considerable}} fun with Job Plunger, the school janitor, who was quite deaf and who was often called Shout because <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> shout at him to make him hear. But this time Plunger was wise and kept out of sight, as did also Pud Hicks, his assistant, and Bob Nixon, the chauffeur. The only person the boys could get hold of was Si Crews, the gymnastic instructor.|$|R
60|$|She was {{interrupted}} by a great rattling on the old stump. Everybody turned to look. There was Prickly Porky backing down as fast as he could, which wasn't fast at all, and rattling his thousand little spears as he did so. It was really very funny. <b>Everybody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> laugh, even Old Mother Nature. You see, it was plain that he was in a great hurry, yet every movement was slow and clumsy.|$|R
3000|$|... (…) for <b>everybody</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> food {{it would}} be {{necessary}} to create new paradigms which are different from the actual system, changing the anthropocentric conception to cosmocentric, and therefore altering the notion of success and development (D 1 project).|$|R
