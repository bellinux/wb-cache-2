As the Goose <b>Full</b> <b>Flow</b> design progressed and the project started to move towards construction, issues within contracting occurred and the project was put on delay for 1 year. Starting in mid December of 2008, Harcon Inc. was awarded the contract and construction of the new Goose <b>Full</b> <b>Flow</b> PIT-tag detection system began. The purpose of this document is to summarize the installation of the Little Goose <b>Full</b> <b>Flow</b> project from start to finish and to highlight the notable successes and challenges that the installation presented along with the final results and current status...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full dilution tunnel and the second from the partial flow system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> and the partial flow system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (<b>full</b> <b>flow,</b> partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> dilution tunnel. The results from two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> and partial flow systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

50|$|Several {{variants}} of the staged combustion cycle exists. Preburners that burn {{a small portion}} of oxidizer with a <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> of fuel are called fuel-rich, while preburners that burn {{a small portion of}} fuel with a <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> of oxidizer are called oxidizer-rich. The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has fuel-rich preburners. The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called full-flow staged combustion.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed to}} measure the external drag of fuselage side intakes is described. The scope of the experiment and the techniques employed are discussed and an assessment is made of the accuracy of results. Measurements of the external drag of rectangular intakes installed {{on the sides of}} a fuselage are presented. Results at subsonic speeds show that drag at <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> is independent of compressmn surface geometry, so that substantial flow spillage may be achieved for little drag penalty provided that the intake throat Mach number is kept high by elevation of the compression surface. For a given total turning of the flow by th 2 compression surface, splllage drag is found to be uniquely related to the inlet mass flow ratio (as distinct from capture mass flow ratlo). Radius of the cowl lip 1 s found to affect the drag of the intake at <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> but becomes less Important as flow is reduced. Drag at <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> for Intakes with swept end walls is lower than for a conflguration in which they are unswept but the spillage drag rise is greater. At supersonic speeds the variation in <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> drag with compressio...|$|R

50|$|Although a road leads up {{the canyon}} to Fengshan, the {{waterfall}} {{is extremely difficult}} to reach during <b>full</b> <b>flow.</b> Immediately after a typhoon, the waterfall is in <b>full</b> <b>flow.</b> However, the high flows also wash away the crossings and bridges of the stream, disconnecting Fengshan from access. After just several days or even hours, the waterfall decreases noticeably in volume. This is because the falls is located on a steep and short drainage that drops 1300 m in its 4 km run, which amounts to an average gradient of 325 m per kilometer, or 820 ft per mile.|$|R
40|$|The {{recontamination}} of {{a spacecraft}} surface directly {{exposed to the}} ram flux is investigated.

A BGK-simulation was compared to both a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and a <b>Full</b> <b>Flow</b> Monte Carlo (FFMC) using sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that the BGK-based simulation underpredicted the return flux contamination as compared to both the DSMC and FFMC techniques.
