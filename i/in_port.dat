5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers spend more time <b>in</b> <b>port</b> than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship {{as it does to}} load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time <b>in</b> <b>port,</b> compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time <b>in</b> <b>port</b> increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E

40|$|Establishing breakwaters <b>in</b> Japanese <b>ports</b> {{have greatly}} {{improved}} the calmness <b>in</b> <b>ports.</b> However, the seawater exchange between landward and seaward areas <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> has greatly decreased. <b>In</b> <b>ports</b> near urban areas, the inflow of sewage or industrial wastewater and {{the accumulation of}} sludge are causing a variety of environmental problems. To realize a seawater exchange breakwater that will improve the calmness <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> and the seawater exchange, an armored caisson breakwater with intake holes was developed to allow fresh seawater into the port using wave energy. The armored caisson breakwater with an opening ratio of 16. 8 % is under construction <b>in</b> Kudoh fishing <b>port</b> on the Sea of Japan. In this paper, the characteristics of seawater exchange and wave transmission of this breakwater introduced {{based on the results}} of 2 -D & 3 -D model tests and numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} {{and the great}} potential for improvements for Latvian ports are directly linked to its geographic position, being located between Europe and Asia.

Operations of the major <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> Latvia as well as the maritime safety <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> are controlled and regulated by binding rules issued by municipalities. This study focuses on examining the norms included <b>in</b> the <b>port</b> regulations as well as to what extent ports are capable of ensuring navigation safety <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> according to the legal framework.

The analysis seeks to explain why there was Chinese investment <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> Ecuador and in Mexico but not in Colombia during this period, a context in which all three countries had broader economic ties to China. The thesis examines both {{in the manner in which}} Latin American ports opened to private and/or foreign investment, and how Chinese companies invest in foreign countries.
