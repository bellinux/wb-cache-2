40|$|Matrimonial {{property}} {{regimes in}} Italian and Czech law Resumé This master thesis deals with matrimonial property regimes under the Italian Civil Code and the Czech Civil Code. This issue is significant {{not only from}} the perspective of spouses and their families, but also important for everybody who makes contract with a spouse. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse and compare Italian and Czech provisions related to marital property regimes and to point out similarities and differences between them. This thesis consists of an introduction, three parts that are further divided into chapters and a conclusion. The first part is an analysis of Italian provisions. It deals with the fundamental principles of the Italian legal system and matrimonial property regimes as codified in the Codice civile. First of all, it examines statutory <b>community</b> of <b>property,</b> marital assets (marital <b>property,</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> and liabilities), personal property and also deals with mandatory rules of the management of marital assets. Then it deals with contractual regimes, namely the separation of property, the property fund and other marital and prenuptial agreements. Subsequently, it examines the termination of <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> and the division of marital assets. The second part concerns the Czech provisions [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis analyses the legal protection afforded to non-owning spouses in Ireland {{in relation to}} the family home through the different stages of a marital relationship – inter vivos, on death and on divorce. Although the property rights of spouses continue to be held on the basis of title and are not automatically modified by marriage, some modifications to the separate property regime have taken place through the intervention of equity and the legislature which mitigate the harshness associated with it, in particular, {{in relation to the}} ownership, control and occupation of the family home. This thesis questions whether these interventions are sufficient or whether further protection is needed for non-owning spouses in relation to this important asset. To this end, the thesis considers what lessons may be learned from the law of British Columbia, Canada on this issue. What emerges is that, in certain circumstances, considerable protection is currently afforded by Irish law to non-owning spouses vis-à-vis the family home. Areas of particular strength include the restrictions against the unilateral disposition of the family home imposed by the Family Home Protection Act 1976 and the provision of the legal right share and the right to appropriate the family home in satisfaction of such a share by the Succession Act 1965. By contrast, the protection afforded by the law in British Columbia at these points in a relationship is much weaker. On the other hand, the British Columbian approach to spousal provision on intestacy appears more likely to secure the family home {{for the benefit of the}} non-owning spouse than the Irish approach and British Columbia also confers non-owning spouses with much more substantial protection on marital breakdown than is afforded pursuant to the Irish Family Law Acts. In these latter areas, in particular, the author argues that important lessons can be learned from the experiences of this other jurisdiction to shape the future of Irish law. On this basis, this thesis presents practical and viable methods of strengthening the protections which currently exist inter vivos and on death, as well as formulating an alternative regime based on a <b>deferred</b> <b>community</b> of <b>property</b> akin to that applied in British Columbia to deal with matrimonial property division on marital breakdown. When combined, the implementation of these proposals for reform in Ireland would ensure much more comprehensive protection for the family home and a system of matrimonial property law which is more theoretically consistent in its application throughout a marital relationship...|$|R

40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses - {{termination}} {{and settlement}} The topic of my thesis is called <b>Community</b> <b>property</b> between spouses, its termination and settlement. I have chosen this particular topic because I {{am interested in}} this area and in civil law in general and also I find it very important. <b>Community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses is a specific type of property partnership, which can exist only between spouses. The <b>community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses origins and terminates together with the marriage. Upon the termination of marriage, <b>community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses also terminates and needs to be settled. The thesis is composed of six chapters which further include under-chapters and sections. At the beginning there is an introduction into the history and development of the legal regulations of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses. Attention is given to the great amendment of the Civil Code carried into affect by Act No. 91 / 1998 Coll., which has brought many changes into the legal regulations of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses. Chapter two defines the basic terms connected with the issue of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses, namely concept, establishment, subject of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> of spouses, property assets and debits of the spouses, exclusive property of each of them and also <b>community</b> <b>property</b> in connection with [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Resumé As {{the title}} of the thesis suggests, it {{provides}} a detailed insight into the field of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law in the Czech Republic as well as into some of the related issues. The <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law regulates the marital property regime. The thesis has been motivated by a few simple questions: What is the impact of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> on spouses' everyday life? What are the individual attitudes to the advantages or disadvantages of <b>community</b> <b>property?</b> What shall we expect from the new legislation? The thesis is divided into ten chapters. The introduction explains the key term "community property" and describes the history of the legal regulation of property relations of spouses. The second chapter deals with the creation of <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> The <b>community</b> <b>property</b> system is presumed by the law and it is usually justified by the idea that such joint ownership recognizes the theoretically equal contributions of both spouses to its creation. The third chapter focuses on the object of the <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> The <b>community</b> <b>property</b> is ordinarily defined as everything the couple owns and what is acquired during the marriage {{with the exception of the}} separate property owned by either of them individually. If the property is held as the <b>community</b> <b>property,</b> each spouse technically owns a moiety in the [...] .

5000|$|Division of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> {{may take}} place by item by {{splitting}} all items or by values. In some jurisdictions, such as California, a 50/50 division of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> is strictly mandated by statute so the focus then shifts to whether particular items {{are to be}} classified as <b>community</b> or separate <b>property.</b> In other jurisdictions, such as Texas, a divorce court may decree an [...] "equitable distribution" [...] of <b>community</b> <b>property,</b> which may result in an unequal division of such. In non-community property states property may be divided by equitable distribution. Generally speaking, the property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate <b>property</b> (not <b>community</b> <b>property).</b> See division of <b>property.</b> Division of <b>community</b> debts {{may not be the}} same as division of <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> For example, in California, <b>community</b> <b>property</b> is required to be divided [...] "equally" [...] while community debt is required to be divided [...] "equitably".|$|R
50|$|Typically, such {{property}} {{is treated as}} if it were <b>community</b> <b>property</b> at the time of divorce or death of a spouse, but in California, at least, property acquired while married and domiciled in a non-community property jurisdiction does not become <b>community</b> <b>property</b> just because the married parties move to a <b>community</b> <b>property</b> jurisdiction. It is the new event of divorce or death while domiciled in the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> state that allows that state to treat such property as quasi-community property. , only Washington, California, New Mexico and Arizona have such laws.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>community</b> <b>{{property}}</b> {{states of}} the United States, [...] "commingling" [...] non-marital property with marital property can make it <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> For example, depositing money received by an individual through inheritance - ordinarily considered non-marital, individual property - into a joint bank account may transform the money into <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> Most <b>community</b> <b>property</b> states apply a presumption of community property; where there is any commingling {{the burden of proof}} is on the party disputing the classification to [...] "trace" [...] the property back to individual property, and demonstrate an intent to keep it separated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Community</b> <b>property</b> {{has certain}} federal tax implications, which the Internal Revenue Service {{discusses}} in its Publication 555. In general, <b>community</b> <b>property</b> {{may result in}} lower federal capital gain taxes {{after the death of}} one spouse when the surviving spouse then sells the property. Some states have created a newer form of <b>community</b> <b>property,</b> called [...] "community property with right of survivorship." [...] This form of holding title has some similarities to joint tenancy with right of survivorship. The rules and effect of holding title as <b>community</b> <b>property</b> (or another form of concurrent ownership) vary from state to state.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is to analyse the new legal {{regulation}} of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> {{included in the}} "new" Czech civil code - Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll. - and in this connection, to focus mainly on the settlement after its termination. The new legislation of this issue is quite brief {{and there are many}} questions arising in this context which are not clear. The thesis is composed of nine chapters. Chapter one characterises the legal term of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> and its basic features. Chapter two describes marital property relations in a historical context, beginning with their roots in the Roman law and continuing with particular historical periods of legal regulation of these relations on the territory of the current Czech Republic. Chapter three outlines an extent of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> and its governance in the statutory arrangement. Chapter four is concerned with contractual modifications of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> and with an arrangement established by a court decision. A part of this chapter also investigates a question of protection of third parties in the connection with the <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> Chapter five deals with possible ways how the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> terminates.

40|$|Part I of {{this article}} reviews the legal {{landscape}} that provided the backdrop against which Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Pennsylvania later adopted <b>community</b> <b>property</b> laws. It also examines the tax consequences of the two Supreme Court cases, Lucas v. Earl and Poe v. Seaborn, {{that resulted in the}} disparate tax treatment of married couples in common law and <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law states. Part II briefly reviews the subsequent passage of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> laws by Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Pennsylvania; the passage of a federal tax reduction bill that provided for equal treatment of <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law and common law jurisdictions; and the subsequent history of those laws in each of the five states. The immediate repeal by Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Oregon of their <b>community</b> <b>property</b> laws following passage of the Revenue Act of 1948 suggests that the passage of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> laws was simply a tax saving measure. This is the belief of some reputable scholars. This article does not refute that such laws were passed, in part, to achieve tax savings; however, it does suggest that other social forces were at work, as well. Part III {{of this article}} suggests that legislatures were able to pass <b>community</b> <b>property</b> laws, in part, because they gave {{little in the way of}} rights to wives, but went far, symbolically, in building married women 2 ̆ 7 s confidence that their household responsibilities were worth a portion of their husbands 2 ̆ 7 salaries. Such confidence was necessary if the pre-war social order, with women primarily in the home rather than the workforce, was going to be successfully reinstated after the war.

For example, in some <b>community</b> <b>property</b> states (so-called [...] "American Rule" [...] states), income from separate property is also separate. In others (so-called [...] "Civil Law" [...] states), the income from separate <b>property</b> is <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> The right of a creditor to reach <b>community</b> <b>property</b> in satisfaction of a debt or other obligation incurred by {{one or both of the}} spouses also varies from state to state.|$|R
40|$|When the Supreme Court decided Poe v. Seaborn in 1930, {{it did not}} {{foresee the}} {{mischief}} its decision would cause in later years. Seaborn held that, under the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law {{of the state of}} Washington, each spouse had a vested interest in one half of all <b>community</b> <b>property,</b> including income, notwithstanding the husband’s right to control and manage the property. Accordingly, spouses in <b>community</b> <b>property</b> states were entitled to split their income for income tax purposes. This gave married persons in community states a decided advantage over their counterparts in common law states, who could not enjoy this advantage. Because of this geographical disparity, Congress, in 1948, enacted the joint filing provisions giving all married persons the right to file joint returns and thus split their incomes. However, this legislation itself created a series of problems, to wit: the marriage penalty, innocent spouse issues, problems in division of marital assets in divorce, and estate issues. Recently, when the California legislature extended its <b>community</b> <b>property</b> law to cover Registered Domestic Partners (RDPs), Seaborn was pressed into service to allow income splitting for California RDPs, who are not spouses under federal law. This again has produced a series of geographic disparities in tax treatment of same sex unions in common law and <b>community</b> <b>property</b> states. Moreover, the extension of the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> regime to non-married persons is itself a departure from the age-old understanding that <b>community</b> <b>property</b> is a marital property regime solely applicable to married persons...|$|R
