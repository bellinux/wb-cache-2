Strong interfacial adhesion results in weak dependence of the extent of reinforcement on the particle characteristics of the reinforcing fibers.

40|$|Abstract [...] In IEC 61967 standards, {{there is}} often {{interest}} to evaluate electromagnetic emission of integrated circuits (ICs) by mounting IC test board on TEM/GTEM cell wall. The method is able to separate the desired <b>emission</b> <b>measurement</b> {{to be influenced by}} unintentional interference.
