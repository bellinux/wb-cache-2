50|$|In {{their desire}} to subjugate all the clans, the Soul Eaters have {{captured}} a range of hunting animals—including Wolf—which they will sacrifice to unleash demons. They plan to control the demons with a <b>fire</b> <b>opal.</b> Torak and Renn make a dangerous journey across the frozen wilderness into the Far North to rescue Wolf; their friendship is tested to the limits and they become separated. They escape, but not before the Soul Eaters brand Torak against his will as one of them. Torak manages to deceive them into thinking Renn is the spirit walker who caused the death of Tenris. Renn, meanwhile, has possession of the fire-opal {{and is about to}} sacrifice herself to destroy it. When three of the Soul Eaters try to kill Torak, Renn and Wolf take back the <b>fire</b> <b>opal,</b> Torak spirit walks into a Polar Bear to save his friends. Nef, one of the Soul Eaters, saves Renn and sacrifices herself instead, using her life to destroy the power of the <b>fire</b> <b>opal</b> and repay the Torak's father for saving her life before he was killed. Fin-Kedinn and some of the Raven Clan make the journey North and save Renn and Torak, and bring them back home.

40|$|Abstract: Five {{types of}} silica polymorphs have been {{identified}} in dacitic volcanics from the Gümüldür region of western Anatolia, Turkey. Two of them are micro-quartz and disordered cristobalite (opal-C) that occur within the groundmass of the dacitic volcanic rocks. The others are pore-filling opal nodules including mainly massy opal-CT (opal-CTM) and rarely lussatite (opal-CTL) and amorphous opal (opal-A). Red and orange opal nodules are very similar to the gemologically well-known <b>fire</b> <b>opals.</b> Results of structural, chemical and thermal studies of the Gümüldür opals reveal their origin and mode of occurrence. Opal-CTM has gel-like or nano-grain texture and opal-CTL has a fibrous, chalcedony-like texture while opal-C in the glassy groundmass of the rock shows a lepidospheric texture. Dissolved silicon was possibly precipitated directly from a Si-rich solution to form opal at lower temperatures and pressures. Our detailed mineralogical examinations show that the colours of the red and orange body coloured massy opals seem to be related to increasing iron concentration. The Gümüldür red and orange <b>fire</b> <b>opals</b> have an importance as gemstones. They could be cut as cabochon with medium dome as ovals rounds. The polished surfaces of the opals display a resinous to sub-vitreous luster, with fewer cracks and fractures than the well-known <b>fire</b> <b>opals</b> of western Turkey...|$|R

When Beka goes to tell Mistress Noll the news, she discovers it was not her son, but the mother who was the Snake.

Though the Dogs are initially unsure of their new charge, Beka proves to be a valuable resource, although she is extremely shy and has a hard time speaking in front of people. Through Beka's unusual magical abilities, she is able to hear the voices of ghosts who ride the backs of pigeons until they are ready to enter the Peaceful Realms of the Black God (the god of death). She can also hear snippets of conversations that may contain valuable information caught by [...] "dust spinners," [...] beings made of breeze and dirt mixed from the city streets. From these sources she learns of two grave threats to the Lower City. One is the Shadow Snake. Old bedtime tales featured the Shadow Snake as something to instill good behaviors into children. However, a ruthless killer who abducts children has taken on the name, and uses the threat of harming the children to force their parents to give up their most prized valuable possessions, killing the kidnapped children if the price is not paid. The other threat is an unknown party who keeps hiring digging crews to search for <b>fire</b> <b>opals</b> (rare and extremely expensive stones that not only have irresistible beauty, but supply mages with a certain power). Then they swear the workers to secrecy, and kill them when the job is done.

He scrambled to his feet again, cast a hurried glance around him,--at the half-opened door of the barn, at the floor littered with trampled hay. In one corner lay the ragged blouse and trousers of the fugitive, which the constable instantly recognized. He went back to the house, and reappeared in a few moments with Ira, white, stupefied, and hopelessly bewildered; clear only in his statement that his wife had just fainted at the news of the catastrophe, and was equally helpless in her own room. The constable--a man of narrow ideas but quick action--saw it all. The mystery was plain without further evidence. The deputy had been awakened by the prowling of the fugitive around the house in search of a horse. Sallying out, they had met, and Ira's gun, which stood in the kitchen, and which the deputy had seized, had been wrested from him and used with fatal effect at arm's length, and the now double assassin had escaped on the sheriff's horse, which was missing. Turning the body over to the trembling Ira, he saddled his horse and galloped to Lowville for assistance.|$|R

When plants die the plant opal they contain is subjected to processes {{both before and after}} it enters the soil. To date the use of plant opal has been largely confined to paleoenvironmental and archaeological research, where its relationship to the plant or plant community and its shape characteristics are of primary importance in the erection of assemblages of plant opal diagnostic of a particular environment. A comparison was made of the plant opal assemblages from the topsoil beneath several vegetation communities. Similar vegetation communities did not produce similar plant opal assemblages in the soil. Widely differing vegetation communities produced soil plant opal assemblages which differed very little. Once the plant opal has become separated from the host plant its botanical links become attenuated and its role as a mineral within the sediment assumes primacy. Periodic fire in the Australian environment exposes the plant opal to the effects of wind and running water which remove much of it while it is still in the litter layer. Large, platey sheets of plant opal are preferentially removed in this manner. In the litter layer, both the plant remains and the opal it contains are comminuted by the fauna. Soil fauna may selectively remove and store plant material containing a range of plant opal shapes which are then not found in representative amounts in the topsoil. The opal removed can vary from site to site and through time. These results suggest that plant opal {{could be used as a}} marker in pedological and geomorphic studies. This thesis presents a new view of plant opal as a constituent of sediments in its own right. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (2 v. (473 p.), 46 col. plates) il...|$|R

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of modern periodical studies has expanded {{our understanding of}} “littleqrdquo; magazines and the editors behind them, but many studies continue to be restricted to the 1920 s, examine male editors, and focus on well–established literary journals, rather than the subversive magazines that expanded the reign of modernism in the years from 1910 to 1950. These studies, though fascinating, privilege a select few and leave many lost to the archive. The new theory of book history and those who evaluate the book as a material object {{that is designed to}} circulate among a range of publics provide powerful and useful frameworks for recognizing the significance of what had previously been considered mere data. This study focuses on several neglected female little magazine editors who, despite various obstacles, powerfully intervened in the modernism debates throughout the 1910 s through to the late 1940 s by shaping successful publications to invite public appreciation of values they espoused. Unlike canonical modernist figures such as Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot who championed an elite style of modernism that was usually inaccessible to most, Lola Ridge, Gwendolyn Bennett, Caresse Crosby, and Kay Boyle encouraged diversity and fostered heterogeneity by selecting and juxtaposing material by new writers and artists who moved easily around and over the borders separating high art and mass culture, who recovered marginalized voices from history, and who appealed for social justice. Further, their traditional and non–traditional roles while they served as editors show that in many cases being an editor meant more than just choosing works and arranging them. One chapter is devoted to Lola Ridge, the American literary editor of Broom (1922 - 1923). Ridge was a cosmopolitan modernist who welcomed a broad audience to Broom and invited readers to champion styles of writing and artwork that contained strong social commentary with American subjects, instead of copying European models that many argued were created for art 2 ̆ 7 s sake. Another chapter focuses on African American poet, graphic artist and literary columnist, Gwendolyn Bennett, who held several editorial roles at Opportunity, <b>Fire!!,</b> and Black <b>Opals,</b> from the mid– 1920 s until the early 1930 s. A heterodox modernist, Bennett skillfully discussed and placed artistic work by members of the New Negro movement next to the work by their forefathers, subsequently fostering congeniality between the two conflicting literary groups and promoting a united front during the development of the Harlem Renaissance. She also promoted co–operation between black and white artists and writers with her universally themed poetry, graphic art, and literary column. Chapter four centers on Black Sun Press book publisher, novelist, and poet, Caresse Crosby, owner and editor of Portfolio (1945 - 1948), who challenged artistic reception {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic by bringing glamorous modernism to her unbound journal of eclectic work. Crosby promoted co–operation between artists and writers from conflicting World War II countries through the placement and types of materials she published on the pages of her magazine. The epilogue calls for scholars to expand their view of the modernist project and recover the often “hidden” work by overlooked female little magazine editors. Like Ridge, Bennett, and Crosby before her, Kay Boyle (This Quarter 1927 - 1929), who can be linked to each editor (directly or indirectly), relied on her trusted network of friends as she edited This Quarter. Her editorial support for young and experienced artists who used innovative styles and her commitment to social justice parallels her colleagues 2 ̆ 7 dedication to the modernist project. These women 2 ̆ 7 s labor, the significant literary time periods they worked in, the different genres, critical content, and styles of modernism they championed, and the social formations their journals produced expanded the base of modernism and reinvigorated American art and literature between the Wars, leaving a legacy for future artists and writers...|$|R

Torak and Renn find Wolf, who is distracted by an injury to his tail and doesn't recognise them. They have to use Renn's axe to cut off Wolf's tail, fulfilling the mage prophecy. They free all the animals which the Soul Eaters have been holding captive, but the Soul Eaters release demons. Renn takes the <b>Fire</b> <b>Opal,</b> a religious artifact belonging to the Soul Eaters, and as they flee, Torak and Renn become separated when Renn floats away on a piece of river ice. Meanwhile, Torak becomes snow blind and is captured by the Soul Eaters.|$|E

Opals which have weathered out of the in-place deposits are alluvial and considered placer deposits. Miocene-age opalised teeth, bones, fish, and a snake head have been found. Some of the opal has high water content and may desiccate and crack when dried.

50|$|The Eagle Owl Mage, Eostra, sends {{a shadow}} {{sickness}} among the clans, to spread fear amongst them. Torak then sees his father's soul, seemingly in pain. Torak sets out alone {{to try and}} confront his destiny. Renn follows Torak, catching up with him. Wolf's family is then attacked by Eostra's owl, sending Darkfur to her death, killing one of the cubs, and using the other to lure Wolf away for a time. Renn and Torak venture to the Mountain of Ghosts with a grieving Wolf to stop Eostra from killing all life in the forest. When Renn injures her leg because of Eostra's demon dogs, Torak leaves without her: when she has recovered, she goes after him, furious. Torak is captured by a strange boy named Dark who has been cast out by his clan. After much pleading, Dark releases Torak and ventures {{with him to the}} Mountain of Ghosts. Torak and Wolf enter the Mountain, but Dark is trapped outside. Dark then meets Renn, who after trying to follow Torak had found Darkfur. Wolf's mate had nearly perished after going through miles in the snow with an infected wound to rescue her last cub. Torak and Wolf confront Eostra, who is summoning the ghosts of the dead Soul Eaters, including Torak's father. Renn and Dark also attempt to intervene, but Eostra appears unstoppable. Then the Walker, who appeared insane when Torak and Renn previously met him in Wolf Brother, arrives and reveals himself to be Narrander, the seventh Soul Eater thought to {{have been killed in the}} great fire years before. Torak destroys the <b>Fire</b> <b>Opal,</b> breaking Eostra's hold over the dead Soul Eaters. Eostra then tries to use Torak's hair to claim his power. Narrander summons the Hidden People to cause a rockfall. Eostra falls into a crevice, pulling Torak with her. Shortly afterwards, Wolf finds Torak's body and forces Torak's spirit to re-enter it. Renn, Dark, Rip and Rek reunite with Torak and Wolf. The last of Wolf's cubs, Pebble, who has survived his ordeal, is then discovered by his parents. Three months later, Dark is named the new Raven Mage, and, after saying goodbye to Fin-Kedinn and promising to return one day, Torak and Renn set off with Wolf, Darkfur, Pebble, and the ravens Rip and Rek, to continue to explore the forest.|$|E
50|$|We {{find out}} {{at the start of}} the novel that in the {{previous}} book the Soul Eaters marked Torak with the Soul Eater symbol. This is discovered and Torak is set to be cast out from the clans, unless his own clan, the Wolf Clan, decides he is innocent. When the Wolf Clan arrives, the Leader says that his mother announced him 'Clanless'. This has never happened before, but as Torak has no clan to decide his innocence, he becomes an outcast. He leaves the clans with Wolf. Renn repeatedly tries to help him, but Torak won't let her as if anyone sees Torak they are supposed to kill him.Torak attempts to cut out the Soul Eater mark from his chest and, thinking it has worked, he goes back to the Raven Camp and watches them. Saeunn, the Raven Clan's mage, says that there is a Soul Eater among them, so Torak flees, knowing that he is the Soul Eater of which she speaks. While in hiding, he suffers from a kind of madness called soul sickness, and attackes Wolf with fire. Meanwhile, Renn and Bale meet up and decide to find Torak and prove his innocence, even though in doing so they are breaking clan law. Renn sends help to Torak in the form of two ravens (named Rip and Rek by Torak). While Torak is recovering his reason, Seshru the Viper Mage, a Soul Eater, uses her powers to draw him to her so as to control him (he is a Spirit Walker and therefore controlling him would supply her with even greater power). Seshru is revealed to be Renn's mother.Meanwhile, Renn realizes that a giant flood is coming and encourages Torak to spread the word and therefore prove his innocence. Torak therefore tells Fin-Kedinn, and the clans flee. Torak gets into a fight with a boy from the Boar Clan, but then climbs up a tree to escape the coming flood. The Boar Clan boy hears the water coming and tries to climb the tree too, but he cannot reach the first branch so Torak jumps down to help him. Torak then finds he cannot climb back up the tree, and he and Wolf are swept away by the water. When he wakes up, all the clans are there, and when Seshru appears Torak shows the clans that destroying him will not help them in their struggle against the Soul Eaters, and they accept him back. Bale uses Renn's bow to kill Seshru, and she dies with the <b>fire</b> <b>opal</b> in hand and thus both die as one.|$|E
