The number of cooperative arrangements and the results achieved by the business networks {{over the past several decades}} are significant. Therefore, they can be used as an interesting example in relation to the recent development of Brazilian networks. This paper presents the status of cooperation in <b>horizontal</b> <b>business</b> networks in Germany at present, as well as their future organization and management trends. The study was based on secondary data and in-depth interviews with German experts: academics, organizational consultants, business network managers and representatives of organizations. The results highlight the professional management of networks, a trend toward centralized governance as a way to coordinate big networks, and a trend toward mixed models of organization, combining the cooperative system with the branches system and the franchise system. Other trends highlighted by the experts are the establishment of networks alliances, the merger of cooperative groups and their internationalization. All these changes contribute to the metamorphosis of business cooperation models, and maintain these models as an important strategy for the survival and competitiveness of independent enterprises in Germany...|$|R

To evaluate the disclosure level, a disclosure index of <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> (INDCOMB) was prepared, having the disclosure index developed by Shalev (2009) as a basis. We evaluated, {{in the light of the}} literature on disclosure and <b>business</b> <b>combinations,</b> whether the following factors influenced on the disclosure level: acquiring company size, recognized percentage of overprice for expected future profitability in relation to the transaction value, dispersion of capital of the acquiring company, audit firm size, and participation of the acquiring company in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) programs. The control variables used were listing of the acquiring company in the various segments of BM&FBOVESPA, operation sector, origin (state, private company with national capital or private company with foreign capital), and relative acquired company size in relation to the acquiring company.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is a {{modified}} net present value, and how it could be a useful tool for synergy valuation in the process of <b>business</b> <b>combination.</b> Every successful acquisition has to result in synergy in the post acquisition value. In the process of valuation each company has three components that {{must be taken into account}} for an efficient valuation (assets, earning power and firm uniqueness). The process of analyzing <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> could be divided in three interdependent analyses: (1) An analyst must start by applying traditional capital budgeting analyses; (2) followed by identifying various flexibility options; and finally, (3) an analyst must determinate the present value of other strategic options along with the overall certainty of exercising them, together with the added certainty value of these options on traditional present value of <b>business</b> <b>combination.</b> Traditional capital budgeting analyses of <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> is based on net present value techniques.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{addresses}} {{two distinct}} aspects of disharmony in {{international accounting standards}} setting. The first aspect relates to the political economic context of financial accounting standards. This {{is illustrated by the}} Chinese standards setters’ decision to allow the pooling of interests method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> despite the prohibition of this method by both the FASB and the IASB. This decision by the Chinese standards setters appears to have been based on political economic factors related to the need for industrial reorganization in China rather than a desire to serve the needs of global capital markets. The second aspect of disharmony relates to the role played by differential understandings of the fundamental objectives of financial reporting in an international context. The IASB’s goal of producing one set of global accounting standards to serve the needs of global capital markets has led to a {{reduction in the number of}} permissible accounting methods and a move towards the fair value accounting model. In particular, the IASB concluded that the acquisition method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> should be the only method allowed for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> In contrast, the Chinese standards setters have recognized the existence of both mergers and acquisitions, and in response they created two different methods of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> Effectively, the Chinese standards setters developed an alternative approach to accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> which challenges the IASB’s goal of achieving international accounting convergence through the fair value model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of fair value accounting for non-financial tangible and intangible {{assets in the}} United States by examining the association of asset recognitions and revaluations accompanying <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> with future performance. Asset recognitions and revaluations are measured as components of acquisition premia generated in <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> Future performance is measured as subsequent-period changes in operating income and changes in operating cash flows. The paper addresses three related research questions. First, to what extent are the components of acquisition premium generated in a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> associated with the stock price of the combined firm? Second, do the components of acquisition premium reflect changes in future performance, where performance is measured as operating income and operating cash flows? And, third, does the accounting treatment in <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> result in differential associations of the components of acquisition premium with stock prices or changes in future performance? I find that, consistent with prior research, acquisition premia generated in <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> are positively associated with the market values of equity of the combined firms. Also, I find acquisition premia generated in purchase transactions are positively associated with changes in future operating income and cash flows from operations. However, acquisition premia generated in pooling transactions are not associated with changes in future performance. I conclude that the value relevance of fair value accounting for non-financial assets depends in part on the context in which it is valued. ...|$|R

Since transactions of this kind are mostly supranational transactions at the global level, {{it is important that}} their representation in the accounting and reporting system should be compatible. The objective {{of this paper is to}} point out the significant differences in the financial statements of a combining enterprise, which might arise if two different methodological procedures were used to record the <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> The theoretical section analyses the main reasons for the convergence of the accounting reporting systems in the area of <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> and the approaches of the two basic global organizations in the area of regulation of accounting reporting.

The base for the identification of the differences represents US GAAP.

In addition, one of objectives in the Statement is to have more intangible assets separately recognized than are currently recognized in practice. That is, the Statement requires that all reliably measurable identifiable intangible assets would be recorded separately from goodwill in the financial statement at fair value.

The research sample is composed of publicly traded Brazilian companies that carried out any type of <b>business</b> <b>combination,</b> as the acquiring entity, between 2010 and 2013, yielding a total sample of 202 observations. To measure the disclosure level of each, a metric was created based on CPC- 15 R 1 (2011) to examine certain disclosure items in order to render a greater level of detail. Data collection was carried out using the footnotes to the annual consolidated standardized financial statements (DFPs) available from the São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) website. The results revealed that disclosure levels for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> are positively and significantly associated with the stock price of the companies analyzed. As to the recognition of goodwill during <b>business</b> <b>combinations,</b> despite the fact that it represents a significant share of the value of the transactions, no statistical significance explaining stock price behavior was found.
