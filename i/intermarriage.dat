5|$|An {{estimated}} 8000 Normans {{and other}} continentals settled in England {{as a result}} of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with the native English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several marriages are attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English. Within a century of the invasion, <b>intermarriage</b> between the native English and the Norman immigrants had become common. By the early 1160s, Ailred of Rievaulx was writing that <b>intermarriage</b> was common in all levels of society.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese, mostly {{descendants}} {{of immigrants from}} Fujian, China after 1898, number 2 million, although {{there are an estimated}} 27 percent of Filipinos who have partial Chinese ancestry, stemming from precolonial and colonial Chinese migrants. <b>Intermarriage</b> between the groups is evident in the major cities and urban areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} <b>intermarriage</b> continued, as many KMT {{soldiers}} married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any <b>intermarriage</b> resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and <b>intermarriage</b> with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in <b>intermarriage</b> in the United States {{has led to}} the blurring of ethnic lines. Anti-miscegenation laws (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 and now it is estimated that one-fifth of the population in the United States by 2050 {{will be part of the}} polyethnic population. In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population.|$|E

5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause of assimilation was {{the high rate of}} <b>intermarriage.</b> Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted across the border from Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or {{to take advantage of the}} relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon. Early marriages, such as that of Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa and Egilona {{at the turn of the}} 8th century, was thought to help establish the legitimacy of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. Later instances of <b>intermarriage</b> were often made to seal trade treaties between Christian kings and Muslim caliphs.|$|E

5|$|Royal <b>intermarriage</b> is the {{practice}} of members of ruling dynasties marrying into other reigning families.
