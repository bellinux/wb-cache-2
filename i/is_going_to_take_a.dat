2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W. Bush {{used the}} phrase war on terrorism in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist′s question {{about the impact of}} enhanced law enforcement authority given to the U.S. surveillance agencies on Americans′ civil liberties: [...] "This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. [...] And we understand. [...] And the American people are beginning to understand. [...] This crusade, this war on terrorism <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> while. [...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2013 interview, guitarist Brett Gurewitz {{stated that}} Bad Religion would start writing their seventeenth studio album in 2014. Guitarist Brian Baker {{said that he}} hoped Bad Religion would start {{recording}} the album {{in the fall of}} 2015. In a September 2015 interview, however, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's Cold as the Clay, and that a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Graffin also said that Bad Religion would begin writing their new album after the release of this third solo album Millport, which was released on March 10, 2017. Baker said, however, that the album will not be released until 2017. Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to True North, Graffin said, [...] "It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work. That's hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. Why has it taken us four years to release an album after True North? Well, True North was such a great album — and we owe it to our fans to take it seriously as a great album — that to do another one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> lot more work." ...|$|E

2500|$|In later years, such {{leaders as}} Ezra Taft Benson {{would take a}} {{stronger}} anti-Communist position publicly, his anti-Communism often being anti-leftist in general. However, Benson's views often brought embarrassment to the Church leadership, and when Benson was sent to Europe on a mission for the Church, many believed this {{was a way of}} getting Benson out of the US where his right-wing views were a point of embarrassment for the church. While publicly claiming that this was not the reason for Benson's call to Europe, then President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote a letter to Congressman Ralph Harding stating that [...] "It would be better for him and for the Church and all concerned, if he would settle down to his present duties and let all political matters take their course. He <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> mission to Europe in the near future {{and by the time he}} returns I hope he will get all the political notions out of his system.” In another letter written in response to questions about how long Benson would be on his mission to Europe from U.S. Under-Secretary of State Averell Harriman, First Counselor Hugh B. Brown responded “If I had my way, he’ll never come back!”. Later, Benson would become the President of the Church and backed off of his political rhetoric. Toward the end of his presidency, the Church even began to discipline Church members who had taken Benson's earlier hardline right-wing speeches too much to heart, some of whom claimed that the Church had excommunicated them for adhering too closely to Benson's right-wing ideology.|$|E
