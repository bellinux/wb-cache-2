40|$|Insecticides were {{evaluated}} for their efficacy to citrus mealybugs on lemons at three spray <b>gallonages,</b> 60, 240, and 600 gallons per acre. None {{of the products}} tested exhibited any activity at 60 or 240 gallons per acre. At 600 gallons per acre, Lorsban at 6 qt/A + NR- 415 oil at 1. 4 % v/v, Supracide at 2 pt / 100 gal + Kinetic at 0. 25 % v/v, and Applaud at 2. 0 lbs -ai/A + NR - 415 oil at 1. 4 % v/v all demonstrated the best activity. Provado at 0. 1 lbs-ai/A + NR- 415 oil at 1. 4 %, Danitol at 0. 4 lbs-ai/A + Lorsban at 4 qt/A + NR- 415 oil at 1. 4 % v/v, and Nexter at 0. 3 lbs-ai/A + NR- 415 oil at 1. 4 % v/v showed good activity. Weaker treatments included Agri-Mek at 10 and 20 oz/A, Knack and Difenolan. For maximum control, growers should treat before the fruit is heavily infested, and use high <b>gallonages</b> of spray solution at a high pressure, the spray must penetrate the waxy coating to achieve activity. If applicable, a spray oil should be included to help break up the wax. However, if Supracide is used, use a high rate without oil...|$|R
40|$|Between 1961 and 1971, U. S. {{military}} forces dispersed more than 19 {{million gallons of}} phenoxy and other herbicidal agents in the Republic of Vietnam, including more than 12 million gallons of dioxin-contaminated Agent Orange, yet only comparatively limited epidemiologic and environmental research {{has been carried out}} on the distribution and health effects of this contamination. As part of a response to a National Academy of Sciences ’ request for development of exposure methodologies for carrying out epidemiologic research, a conceptual framework for estimating exposure opportunity to herbicides and a geographic information system (GIS) have been developed. The GIS is based on a relational database system that integrates extensive data resources on dispersal of herbicides (e. g., HERBS records of Ranch Hand aircraft flight paths, <b>gallonage,</b> and chemical agent), locations of military units and bases, dynamic movement of combat troops in Vietnam, and locations of civilian population centers. The GIS can provide a variety of proximity counts for exposure to 9, 141 herbicide application missions. In addition, the GIS can be used to generate a quantitative exposure opportunity index that accounts for quantity of herbicide sprayed, distance, and environmental decay of a toxic factor such as dioxin, and is flexible enough to permit substitution of other mathematical exposure models by the user. The GIS thus provide...|$|E
40|$|FY 2007 was a {{productive}} {{year for the}} Iowa Grape and Wine Development Commission. Fourteen proposals were recommended for funding totaling over 390, 000 in outlays. Included in the approved proposals were funds for the establishment and staffing of a Midwest Grape and Wine Institute at Iowa State University, a newly created viticulturist position at Des Moines Area Community College, funding for the first annual Mid-American Wine Competition, and marketing and promotion of four regional cooperative wine events and one wine trail. Commission funding supported a survey of commercial wine producers and grape growers and a new brochure on Iowa’s vineyards. A committee was formed to provide details for a Scholarship Program to aid vineyard and winery staff with the expenses of accredited coursework. Based on the survey conducted and from other governmental and industry sources, the Iowa grape and wine industry appears {{to continue to be}} very viable and growth continues at a strong pace. Wine produced in the state for 2007 was estimated at a market value in excess of 12. 3 million. A tabulation of the budget revealed that just over 800, 000 in wine <b>gallonage</b> tax appropriations have been received into the Grape and Wine Development Fund from 15 FY 2003 through FY 2007. Expenditures have totaled just over 607, 000 during that same time. Just over 80...|$|E
40|$|Like the {{development}} of other utilities, the implementation of reuse facilities generally requires a substantial capital expense. Capital improvements at the wastewater treatment facility are normally required, but transmission lines can also add significantly to capital costs. In an urban setting, reuse lines must often {{be added to the}} existing transmission infrastructure, requiring careful construction processes. And unless agricultural, industrial, and recreational reuse sites are close to reclaimed water sources, these sites will require new transmission facilities as well. In addition to the capital costs associated with reclaimed water facilities, there are also additional operation, maintenance, and replacement (OM & R) costs, including those associated with power and water quality monitoring, as well as administrative costs, such as customer billing. And, in almost all cases, implementation of a reuse system involves enhanced cross-connection programs with an associated increase in cost. These costs are typically calculated into a reclaimed water rate, expressed either as a <b>gallonage</b> charge or a fixed monthly fee. Even in situations where reclaimed water systems are developed in response to effluent disposal needs and customers are encouraged to make use of an “unlimited ” supply at little to no charge, provisions should still be made for the day when conservation of the reclaimed water supply will be required. Another factor impacting costs is the potential drop in revenues associated with a reduction in potable water use after implementation of a reuse system. This loss of revenue can be particularly challenging if the water and wastewater systems are owned by different utilities. Consequently, multiple financial alternatives should be investigated to fund a reclaimed water system...|$|E
40|$|Importance of problem: Ice Milk {{is not a}} {{new product}} in the ice cream industry. Rather it is one that has gained only little popularity, except in the {{preparation}} of 2 ̆ 2 malts 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 milk shakes 2 ̆ 2; however, within the last decade the <b>gallonage</b> of ice milk produced has more than doubled. Ice milk has been relatively unimportant because of the difficulty of obtaining a product with acceptable quality. In recent years progressive ice milk manufacturers and research workers have discovered new ingredients and processing procedure that seem to produce favorable results. This low-fat product has several merits that justify its recent popularity, such as low cost to the consumer, high nutritional value, an additional outlet for serum solids, and it is an attractive product to those individuals who may be diet conscious. Ice milk differs from regular ice cream in that it contains less butterfat and more solids-not-fat. Frequently when the fat content is decreased there is a tendency for the product to become coarse. In order to correct this coarseness more milk-solids-not-fat are added to the mix which often effects the flavor of the ice milk. Also with an excessive increase of serum solids in the mix there is danger of sandiness developing in the product during storage. Purpose of problem: The purpose of this experiment is to determine a formula and processing procedure that will yield a frozen ice milk product with desirable flavor, good body and texture qualities, and freedom from sandiness after reasonable storage. By the proper balance and use of ingredients and modern processing and freezing methods it is hoped that the quality goal will be reached and prove beneficial to the industry...|$|E
40|$|Three small plot {{efficacy}} {{trials were}} conducted evaluating different insecticide rotation regimes using commercially available insecticides {{and the effectiveness}} of new insecticide chemistries to control citrus thrips. Because of its long residual activity, and ability to control post- application egg hatches, Carzol appears to be the product that best fits the petal fall application window. Agri-Mek, Baythroid, Dimethoate or Vydate are probably good follow -up insecticides. However, Agri-Mek and Baythroid will probably provide greater control, especially under hotter conditions. If temperatures are cool, Agri-Mek looks good at reduced rates. The best insecticide for subsequent applications depends on temperatures and what was previously applied. Avoid making back -to -back applications of the same materials, and Dimethoate or Vydate applications should probably be followed by Carzol to catch post- application egg hatches. Overall, Vydate appears to be very similar to Dimethoate in efficacy and residual activity, while Baythroid appears to be slightly better. Although the addition of Lannate to Dimethoate does slightly enhance thrips control, the additional cost probably does not justify the tank mix. Of the new chemistries (Alert, Success, Ni- 25, and M- 96 - 015) evaluated, Success and M- 96 - 015 appeared to offer the best fruit protection. However, M- 96 - 015 {{does not appear to be}} very effective in killing the thrips, but is very effective in repelling them. Also, M- 96 - 015 will need to be applied at a high <b>gallonage,</b> i. e. 500 gal/A. None of the new products tested appear to fit the petal fall application window very well. Ni- 25, Alert and Success appear to lack the residual activity of Carzol, and M- 96 - 015 should not be used as a clean-up material but preventively following Carzol at petal fall...|$|E
40|$|The {{bottled water}} {{market in the}} U. S. is a recent development. Most water {{bottlers}} had traditionally positioned their products {{as an alternative to}} tap water. A few imported waters were sold for health reasons. The real growth in the bottled water market took place {{in the second half of}} 1970 s when Perrier was introduced as anon alcoholic, chic alternative to soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. Bottled water accounted for $ 3. 2 billion sales in 1992 out of a total beverage sales of $ 159 billion. Although bottled water is the smallest in terms of revenue, its <b>gallonage</b> market share stood at 8. 7 percent, and it is by far the fastest growing category of all beverages. The future prospects of the bottled water industry in the U. S. appear bright due to the deterioration of municipal water supplies, interest in healthy living, and the movement of bottled water into main stream as a refreshment beverage. Currently, there are over 700 bottled water manufacturers in the U. S. The leader among these is the Perrier Group with almost one-fourth of the market. Although the Perrier Group is a foreign firm, most of its sales are generated from U. S. brands that this company has acquired over the years. For example, its only imported brand Perrier, accounted for only 1. 7 percent of the market in 1993. Overall, imports have less than 4 percent of the U. S. bottled water market. This situation is no different than in the beer or soft drink industry. But there is one exception. While lead players in the beer and soft drink industries are U. S. companies, in the case of bottled water the three among the first five industry members are foreign firms, (i. e., Perrier Group, Suntory International and Evian), accounted for about one-third of industry sales.

40|$|Nearly 19. 5 {{million gallons}} of {{herbicides}} were sprayed on the Republic of Vietnam between 1961 and 1971 for military purposes. Amounts of spray and patterns of applications are available in an electronic file called HERBS that contains records of 9141 defoliation missions, including detailed coordinates of US Air Force Ranch Hand aircraft flight paths, along with chemical agent and <b>gallonage</b> sprayed. Two classes of models for use in epidemiological and environmental studies that utilize the HERBS data for estimating relative exposure opportunity indices are presented: a discrete "hits" model that counts instances of proximity {{in time and space}} to known herbicide applications, and a continuous exposure opportunity index, E 4, that takes into account type and amount of herbicide sprayed, distance from spray application, and time interval when exposure may have occurred. Both direct spraying and indirect exposure to herbicide (or dioxin) that may have remained in the local environment are considered, using a conservative first-order model for environmental disappearance. A correction factor for dermal versus respiratory routes of entry has been incorporated. E 4 has a log-normal distribution that spans six orders of magnitude, thus providing a substantial amount of discrimination between sprayed and unsprayed areas. The models improve on earlier ones by making full use of the geometry of the HERBS spray flight paths of Ranch Hand aircraft. To the extent possible so many decades after the War, the models have been qualitatively validated by comparison with recent dioxin soil and biota samples from heavily contaminated areas of Vietnam, and quantitatively validated against adipose dioxin obtained in epidemiological studies of Vietnamese. These models are incorporated within a geographic information system (GIS) that may be used, as one would expect, to identify locations such as hamlets, villages, and military installations sprayed by herbicide. In a novel application, the GIS also facilitates quantitative risk assessment in epidemiological and ecological studies by applying the models within a framework of historical reconstruction of exposure history of individuals based upon their location histories...|$|E
