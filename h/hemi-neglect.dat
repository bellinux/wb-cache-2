5000|$|The right temporoparietal {{junction}} (rTPJ) {{is involved}} in the processing of information in terms of the ability of an individual to pay attention. Evidence from neuroimaging studies as well as lesion studies revealed that the rTPJ plays a pivotal role in analyzing signals from self-produced actions as well as with signals from the external environment. [...] For example, an individual with lesions in their rTPJ would more than likely exhibit a sense of <b>hemi-neglect,</b> wherein they would {{no longer be able to}} pay attention to anything they observe on the left. So, if someone were to have a lesion in their rTPJ, then over time the awareness of the left limbs may fade without treatment. Visual signals provide the sensory information necessary for the brain to process spatial recognition of the world. When vision is limited, knowledge of existence begins to fade away since as far as the brain is concerned the object does not exist. Furthermore, the rTPJ plays a role in the way individuals observe and process information, thus impacting social interaction. Empathy and sympathy require an individual to simultaneously distinguish between different possible perspectives on the same situation. Imaging studies show that this ability depends upon the coordinated interaction of the rTPJ to identify and process the social cues presented to it. This rapid process allows for an individual to quickly react to situations.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} ocular fixations during line bisection in {{five patients}} with left hemianopia, two patients with right hemianopia, nine patients with left <b>hemi-neglect</b> and nine normal control subjects. Compared with measures in control subjects, the median fixation, and left- and rightmost fixations were shifted contralaterally {{in patients with}} hemianopia alone and ipsilaterally in patients with hemineglect. The fixation with the longest duration and the bisection point were also shifted contralaterally with hemianopia and ipsilaterally with <b>hemi-neglect.</b> However, the number of fixations and the spatial range spanned by fixations did not differ between the groups, showing that ocular exploration was not truncated in any group. Only some patients showed a previously reported directional search bias. Overall, there was no directional bias in saccadic number or amplitude. The distribution of fixations was most dense at {{the centre of the}} line in normal subjects, while hemianopic patients fixated most frequently at the ends of lines in their contralateral (blind) hemispace and at a central locus that was biased slightly contralaterally, as was their bisection judgement. This contralateral bias may reflect either an adaptive contralateral attentional gradient or a non-veridical spatial representation within the remaining normal hemifield. <b>Hemi-neglect</b> patients had a broad distribution of fixation peaks in the ipsilateral hemispace. Of two <b>hemi-neglect</b> patients with many fixations, one clustered fixations at a position right of centre, as if a normal fixation pattern was shifted rightward, while the other had two fixation peaks: one to the far right and the other near the centre of the line, reminiscent of the dual peaks of activity seen in some recent <b>hemi-neglect</b> models. These data reveal a heterogeneity in the routes by which rightbiased judgements of spatial centre are reached by hemineglect patients...|$|E

A difference in contrast sensitivity restricted to low spatial frequencies was present between controls and patients, independent of neglect.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the possible relation between deficits in spatial representation capability and vestibular function following cortical lesions. We thus investigated vestibulo-ocular behaviour in a group of 14 patients with unilateral cortical damage involving the occipito-temporo-parietal junction. Patients were divided in three sub-groups: (1) Group R+: five patients with right sided cortical lesions associated with a left <b>hemi-neglect,</b> (2) Group R−: four patients with right sided cortical lesions with no <b>hemi-neglect</b> and (3) Group L: five patients with left-sided cortical lesions. The patient groups were compared to a group of eight healthy age-matched subjects. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was tested in complete darkness by rotating the subject around the vertical axis by sinusoidal rotation at different frequencies, and by steps of acceleration or deceleration. The nystagmus slow phase velocity was measured and plotted {{as a function of the}} head velocity and the VOR parameters including gain, bias, time constant and phase were calculated. The cortical lesions induced a significant VOR asymmetry in terms of: a directional preponderance of the VOR gain to the contralesion side, only during sinusoidal rotation, and, in contrast, a VOR bias and a directional preponderance of the VOR time constant and of the nystagmus frequency to the side of the cortical lesion. These latter VOR deficits were the most significant in the R+ group, i. e. in right cortical lesions with <b>hemi-neglect</b> syndrome. These results demonstrate in man, the existence of a cortical influence on vestibular function related to the mechanisms of spatial representation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{key element}} of the {{distinction}} between explicit and implicit cognitive functioning is {{the presence or absence of}} conscious awareness. In this review, we consider the proposal that neuropsychological disorders can best be considered in terms of a decoupling between preserved implicit or unconscious processing and impaired explicit or conscious processing. Evidence for dissociations between implicit and explicit processes in blindsight, amnesia, object agnosia, prosopagnosia, <b>hemi-neglect,</b> and aphasia is examined. The implications of these findings for a) our understanding of a variety of neuropsychological disorders, b) the conceptualization of normal cognitive functioning, c) the neural basis of consciousness, and d) the clinical rehabilitation of brain-injured individuals are also discussed. 1.

40|$|In visual <b>hemi-neglect,</b> non-spatial deficits such as reduced {{intrinsic}} alertness {{can significantly}} modulate {{the degree of}} left visual field inattention. However, to date, the precise mechanisms mediating this effect are hardly understood. In the present study, we assessed the influence of increased alertness on both general attentional capacity (perceptual processing speed) and spatial attentional selection processes (spatial distribution of attentional weighting). For this purpose, a whole-report paradigm based on Bundesen's ‘theory of visual attention’ (TVA) was combined with a non-spatial, visual alerting cue. Three different cue-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs; of 80, 200, and 650 ms), allowed us to observe {{the time course of}} the alerting-cue effects. A group of six patients with visual <b>hemi-neglect</b> was examined and their performance compared with six healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, and education. In neglect patients, the alerting cue evoked a phasic increase of perceptual processing speed. However, this effect was mainly found in the ipsilateral, i. e. in the “preserved” hemifield. Importantly, however, patients displayed a fast-evolving and short-lasting, phasic modulation of spatial attentional weighting, with a re-distribution of attentional weights from the pathological rightward bias to a normal, more balanced distribution of visual attention. In control participants, the cueing effects on perceptual processing speed and spatial weighting were generally less pronounced than in neglect patients. Replicating results of a prior study, cueing induced a stable, slightly leftward, distribution of attentional weights, whilst in the no-cue condition, a temporary rightward shift of attentional weights was found. This pattern of effects suggests a close interaction between alertness and spatial-attentional weighting in the syndrome of visual <b>hemi-neglect.</b> It supports the hypothesis that the manifestation of spatial neglect involves at least in part intrinsic alertness deficits. It also provides clues to a more detailed account of the mechanisms responsible for alleviating neglect in patients following manipulations of the alertness level, both in the short (cueing) and in the long term (alertness training) ...|$|E

40|$|In visual {{search for}} pop-out targets, {{reaction}} times are facilitated when the target {{on the current}} trial appears at a previous target location, and inhibited when it appears at a previous distractor location, relative to when it appears at a previously empty (neutral) location (Maljkovic and Nakayama, Perception and Psychophysics 58 : 977 – 991, 1996). However, while normal subjects are able to positively/negatively tag selected target/rejected distractor locations to guide search on the next trial, patients with visual <b>hemi-neglect</b> may have a (uni- or bilateral) deficit in these functions that may contribute to their disturbed visual scanning behavior. To examine this, using a pop-out search task, the present study assessed cross-trial facilitatory and inhibitory priming in 14 patients with left-sided visual <b>hemi-neglect</b> and in 14 age-, education-, and IQ-matched control subjects. The group of neglect patients did show significant facilitatory and inhibitory priming. However, while control subjects exhibited balanced effects of facilitation and inhibition, inhibition was relatively reduced in magnitude in neglect patients. In particular, inhibition was virtually absent in two patients with lesions affecting superior regions of the frontal cortex, putatively encroaching on the frontal eye field of the right hemisphere. These findings provide neuropsychological evidence that facilitatory and inhibitory priming effects are based on dissociable mechanisms, consistent with Geyer et al...|$|E
40|$|Posner has {{suggested}} that unilateral spatial neglect {{could be due to}} a difficulty in disengaging attention from its current focus to orient it toward the neglected half space. Clinical and experimental data suggest, however, that this disengaging difficulty could be only one aspect of a more complex disturbance also characterized by an early automatic orienting of attention toward the half space ipsilateral to the lesion. To test this hypothesis, two different investigations in unselected groups of patients with right and left brain-damage were carried out. The first investigation, to evaluate forms of lateral orienting of attention severe enough to provoke an overt gaze deviation, consisted of the systematic assessment of the phenomenon of "magnetic gaze attraction". The second investigation, to detect milder forms of automatic orienting of attention, analysed the temporal sequence followed in identifying the pictures represented in an "Overlapping Figures task", to see if patients tended to identify first figures lying in the half space ipsilateral to the lesion. In both investigations results consistently showed: a) that patients with right brain damage tend to orient attention automatically toward the ipsilateral half space more than patients with left brain damage; b) that this tendency is tightly linked to the presence of behavioural manifestations of <b>hemi-neglect.</b> These results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that <b>hemi-neglect</b> is a multi-component syndrome with an early orienting of attention toward the half space ipsilateral to the lesion as the first of these components...|$|E
40|$|Multi-component {{models of}} visual <b>hemi-neglect</b> have {{postulated}} that visual <b>hemi-neglect</b> is characterised by various attentional deficits. A grey scales task {{has been developed}} to quantify the early, automatic, (perhaps obligatory) ipsilesional orienting of visual attention, frequently assumed as {{the first of these}} attentional deficits. Explanations for this attentional imbalance are up until now mainly formulated in terms of right hemisphere activation. This lateral attentional bias has also been demonstrated in controls, in whom it is expressed as a leftward perceptual asymmetry. We reproduced previous literature findings on a grey scales task, considering controls and neglect patients. Three patients with neglect showed an extreme ipsilesional lateral bias. This bias did not change during or after cognitive rehabilitation. Additionally, we presented this grey scale task to 32 patients with left- and right-sided homonymous hemianopia (HP). HP is the loss of sight in one visual hemi-field. The HH patients had no clinical signs of impaired lateralised attention. Results revealed that HH patients showed a similar ipsilesional bias, albeit to a lesser degree than in neglect. Left-sided HH patients presented a quantitatively similar, but qualitatively opposite bias than the right-sided HH patients. We suggest that sensory effects can be an alternative source of attentional imbalance, which can interact with the previously proposed (right) hemispheric effects. This suggests that the perceptual asymmetry in the grey scales task is not necessarily an indicator of impaired right hemisphere attention. It rather suggests a pattern of functional cerebral asymmetry, which can also be caused by asymmetric sensory input. ...|$|E

40|$|The “binding problem ” is {{discussed}} {{with reference to}} feature integration and visual search. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological findings support the existence of multiple visual areas within the primate cortex that respond to pri-mary features of objects and spatial locations. Evidence from studies with <b>hemi-neglect</b> and Balint’s syndrome supports the role of spatial attention in feature integration and demonstrates the necessity for an intact, explicit spatial represen-tation. Some implicit spatial maps remain intact but are not sufficient to support the perception of properly bound features. The evidence suggests strong inter-actions between parietal spatial representations and temporal feature representa-tions in feature integration. INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM The “binding problem ” means {{different things to different}} people. In vision it has been discussed in various contexts including grouping, the perception of illusory contours, the coherence of lines, curvature and angles that form a shape, and the integration of features such as colour and form.

40|$|Pseudo-neglect ’ in CRPS {{is closer}} to ‘anti-neglect ’ than to {{classical}} <b>hemi-neglect?</b> Attention can exert a powerful effect on the perception of pain sensations, {{so much so that}} distraction can have an analgesic effect on acute pain equal to that of opiates [21]. Spatial attention can modulate heat pain detection and discrimination, as demonstrated by studies in which a pain stimulus is presented following a cue, which is located either on the same side as the stimulus or on the opposite side. The cue on the opposite side leads to increased error rates and response latencies for heat pain stimuli [2, 8]. In turn, a lateralized visual discrimination task is performed more rapidly when it is preceded by a painful stimulus on the same side as the visual stimulus than on the opposite side. Similarly, eye orientation {{to the side of the}} painful stimulus leads to higher pain ratings [18]. These results suggest that visual stimuli and painful stimuli can interact by shifting spatial attention to one or the othe...|$|E
40|$|Six {{patients}} presenting with multimodal, predominantly motor <b>hemi-neglect,</b> {{were investigated}} by (O 2) -O- 15 or F- 18 -DG and PET {{to study the}} local cerebral metabolism in intact regions. All had suffered from an acute right-sided (n = 5) or left-sided (n = 1) focal hemispheric lesion (cortico-subcortical and purely subcortical in three patients each). Frontal and parietal cortices {{on the side of}} the lesion were significantly hypometabolic relative to the other side in each case, presumably as a result of diaschisis, whereas thalamic hypometabolism was significant in only 4 patients. Compared to absolute metabolic rates for controls, the uninjured hemisphere showed a trend towards hypometabolism. Hence, true hyperactivity of the contralateral hemisphere with respect to the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was not associated with motor hemineglect in this series. On the contrary, hemineglect was associated with a widespread hypometabolism of the entire ipsilateral cerebral cortex in the context of a moderately reduced metabolism of the ipsilateral thalamus and contralateral cerebral cortex. These findings are consistent with the implication of a cortico-subcortical network serving attention...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} found that {{patients}} with left <b>hemi-neglect</b> bisect long lines too far to the right, but bisect short lines too far to the left (the ‘cross-over ’ effect). Some studies have reported that normal participants bisect long lines too far to the left, presumably reflecting an over-estimation of the left side due {{to the role of the}} right hemisphere in attention. The purpose of the present series of studies was to further study the cross-over effect in normal participants and to determine whether it may be due to perceptual or motor factors. Participants in the first study showed no cross-over effect on either the traditional line bisection task, or on the purely perceptual Landmark task. However, improvements in the Landmark task in Study 2 did lead to a significant cross-over effect. In Study 3 there was no cross-over on the traditional line bisection task even after changes were made to eliminate the ‘ceiling effect ’ that is usually found with very short lines. Overall, the results suggest that normal participants do show a cross-over effect on a purely perceptual task, but not on the traditional manual line bisection task that includes a motor component.

40|$|Purpose: At present, prism {{adaptation}} {{is probably}} the most promising rehabilitation procedure for <b>hemi-neglect.</b> However, randomised controlled trials are lacking and no data are available on the effectiveness of prism adaptation in the treatment of acute neglect. Methods: We followed sixteen neglect patients using a randomised controlled design in which six patients received four-day-in-a-row placebo treatment (CG) and ten patients received four-day-in-a row experimental treatment with 10 ° rightward deviating prisms (EG) during their stay on the stroke unit. We examined whether patients in the EG improved faster than the CG by administering three neglect tasks (Schenkenberg Line Bisection, Letter Cancellation, Gainotti Scene Copying) immediately before and after each treatment. Second, we examined whether patients in the EG demonstrated a better long-term outcome at one month post-treatment (Behavioural Inattention Test). Results: Patients in the EG improved faster on spatial tasks (line bisection, cancellation) than the CG but not on visuo-construction. Patients in the EG showed no differences with the CG in neglect outcome at one month post-treatment. Conclusions: Four consecutive prism sessions produced beneficial effects in patients with acute neglect. However, prism effects were either short-term, or placebo treatment with repeated pointing and/or repeated neglect testing was more helpful than we anticipated. Our results emphasize the importance of a placebo condition and a follow-up in rehabilitation studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Response delays of <b>hemi-neglect</b> {{patients}} to invalidly cued left targets in Posner’s visual cueing task have been interpreted as reflecting disorders of covert at-tention, although shifts of overt attention {{have so far}} not been systematically measured in patients performing this task. Therefore, we measured saccades (i. e., fast goal-di-rected eye movements) induced by cues and targets in this task in ten patients with lesions of the right posterior parietal cortex and in age-matched healthy subjects. Par-ticipants were not aware that their saccades were studied. Of greatest interest was whether {{the presence or absence of}} saccades would modify the patients ’ response delay with invalidly cued left targets. In both groups, saccades occurred in many trials, key-press responses were slower in saccade trials than in no-saccade trials, and the delay by invalid cues was larger in saccade trials. The patients’ responses were in particular delayed if preceded by sac-cades to the left. Their delay to invalidly cued left targets almost doubled (144 ms vs 76 ms) when only saccade trials were analyzed compared to when only no-saccade trials were analyzed. Thus, overt shifts (saccades) have a similar but larger effect on manual responses than covert shifts of attention. In particular, overt shifts make a con-siderable contribution to the patients ’ pathological delay of responses to invalidly cued left targets...|$|E
40|$|Patients with spatial <b>hemi-neglect</b> display {{systematic}} {{deviations of}} the subjective vertical. The magnitude of such deviations {{was shown to}} be modulated by internal factors mediating the perception of verticality, including head-orientation. The present study investigated whether and how spatial orientation deficits are modulated by external, contextual changes in neglect patients. In a classic rod-and-frame task, we analyzed effects of frame orientation on the subjective visual vertical (SVV) in neglect patients, control patients with left- or right-sided brain damage without neglect and healthy participants. We found that neglect patients, but not brain-damaged control patients, generally display a systematic counterclockwise (CCW) tilt in their SVV judgments. Furthermore, all participant groups displayed a typical rod-and-frame effect (RFE), that is, a modulation of the SVV {{as a function of}} frame tilt. However, in the control groups, this modulation was only moderate whereas in the neglect group SVV judgments were substantially and systematically modulated by frame orientation: with CCW frame tilts, the spatial bias of neglect patients increased {{as a function of the}} magnitude of the tilt whereas with clockwise (CW) frame tilts, the spatial bias was decreased in case of moderate frame tilts and even reversed in case of stronger frame tilts, resulting in a substantial CW spatial bias. This dramatically enhanced RFE might be caused by a pathologically increased influence of contextual cues on the subjective vertical in neglect patients as a consequence of impaired processing of gravitational information. The results indicate a systematic bias of the subjective vertical along with an impairment of spatial orientation constancy which leads to severe perturbations of subjective space as well as an increased reliance on internal and external cues mediating the perception of verticality in neglect...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{psychology}} {{is starting to}} explain eating disorders (ED) as {{the outcome of the}} interaction among cognitive, socio-emotional and interpersonal elements. In particular two influential models - the revised cognitive-interpersonal maintenance model and the transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral theory – identified possible key predisposing and maintaining factors. These models, even if very influential and able to provide clear suggestions for therapy, still are not able to provide answers to several critical questions: Why do not all the individuals with obsessive compulsive features, anxious avoidance or with a dysfunctional scheme for self-evaluation develop an eating disorder? What {{is the role of the}} body experience in the etiology of these disorders? In this paper we suggest that a meaningful answer requires the integration of these models with the recent outcomes of cognitive neuroscience. First, our bodily representations are not just a way to map an external space but the main tool we use to generate meaning, organize our experience, and shape our social identity. In particular, we will argue that our bodily experience evolves over time by integrating six different representations of the body characterized by specific pathologies – body schema (phantom limb), spatial body (unilateral <b>hemi-neglect),</b> active body (alien hand syndrome), personal body (autoscopic phenomena), objectified body (xenomelia) and body image (body dysmorphia). Second, these representations include either schematic (allocentric) or perceptual (egocentric) contents that interact within the working memory of the individual through the alignment between the retrieved contents from long-term memory and the ongoing egocentric contents from perception. In this view eating disorders may be the outcome of an impairment in the ability of updating a negative body representation stored in autobiographical memory (allocentric) with real-time sensorimotor and proprioceptive data (egocentric) ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with arm and hand paresis following stroke recruit an additional degree of freedom (the trunk) to transport the hand during reaching and use alternative strategies for grasping. The few studies of grasping parameters of the impaired hand have been case studies mainly focusing on describing grasping in the presence of particular impairments such as <b>hemi-neglect</b> or optic ataxia and have not focussed {{on the role of the}} trunk in prehension. We hypothesized that the trunk movement not only ensures the transport of the hand to the object, but it also assists in orienting the hand for grasping when distal deficits are present. Nineteen patients with chronic hemiparesis and seven healthy subjects participated in the study. Patients had sustained a stroke of non-traumatic origin 6 - 82 months previously (31 +/- 22 months) and had mild or moderate to severe arm paresis. Using a whole hand grasp, subjects reached and grasped a cylinder (35 mm) that was placed sagittally (T 1) or at a 45 degrees angle to the sagittal midline in the ipsilateral workspace (T 2), both at about 90 % arm's length (10 trials per target). Eight infrared emitting diodes were placed on bony landmarks of the hand, arm and trunk and kinematic data were recorded by an optical motion analysis system (Optotrak) for 2 - 5 s at 120 Hz. Hand position and orientation were recorded by a Fastrack Polhemus system. Our results show that during goal-directed prehension tasks, individuals with hemiparesis oriented the hand more frontally for grasping and used more trunk anterior displacement or rotation to transport the hand to the target compared to healthy subjects. Despite these changes, the major characteristics of reaching and grasping such as grip aperture size, temporal coordination between hand transport and aperture formation and the relative timing of grip aperture were largely preserved. For patients with more severe distal impairments, the amount of trunk displacement was also correlated with a more frontal hand orientation for grasping. Furthermore, in healthy subjects and patients without distal impairments, the trunk movement was mostly related to proximal arm movements while in those with distal impairments, trunk movement was related to both proximal and distal arm movements. Data support the hypothesis that the trunk movement is used to assist both arm transport and hand orientation for grasping when distal deficits are present...|$|E
