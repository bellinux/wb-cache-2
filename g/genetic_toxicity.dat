This thesis focuses on the development and validation of high-throughput, microfluidic arrays for detection of DNA damage by reactive metabolites (Metabolic <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity).</b> In addition to vital human metabolic enzymes and DNA, these arrays feature a specific ruthenium redox polymer ([Ru(bpy) 2 (PVP) 10] 2 + PVP = poly(4 -vinylpyridine) to generate electrochemical or electrochemiluminescent (ECL) output. Molecular information related to reactive metabolite-induced <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> is elucidated by employing liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Chapter one clearly addresses the purpose and significance of microfluidic metabolic <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> screening platform with reliable molecular information for simple, yet high throughput detection at {{the early stages of}} drug development. Chapter two describes the first prototypic electrochemical microfluidic array to detect reactive metabolites generated by cytochrome P 450 enzymes. Chapter three presents the successful development and validation of a multiplexed microfluidic platform for screening reactive metabolites bioactivated by multiple enzyme pathways as in natural human metabolism. Chapter four reports an ECL, fluidic chip for high-throughput screening of DNA damage with metabolite-DNA adduct structure elucidation by LC-MS/MS for the first time. The chip facilitates 64 measurements in a single run. Charter five concludes the thesis with a presentation of a simple, fluidic platform to detect <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> caused by common pollutants at specific human organs.

40|$|The yeast {{target of}} rapamycin (Tor) kinases, Tor 1 and Tor 2, {{belong to the}} phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase–related family of proteins, which are {{involved}} in the cellular response to DNA damage and changes in nutrient conditions. In contrast to yeast, many eukaryotes possess a single Tor kinase. Regardless of the number of Tor kinases in an organism, two distinct complexes involving Tor proteins exist in eukaryotes, TORC 1 and TORC 2. The yeast TORC 1, containing Tor 1 or Tor 2, is sensitive to the antibiotic rapamycin. The yeast TORC 2 is insensitive to rapamycin. We examined the influence of rapamycin treatment upon yeast transcription–coupled nucleotide excision repair in a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II. We also examined tor mutants for their ability to perform transcription-coupled repair in the absence or presence of rapamycin. Ostensibly lacking TORC 1 and TORC 2 function, a tor 1 tor 2 ts mutant grown at the nonpermissive temperature exhibited similar rates of repair as the wild-type strain. However, repair of both strands in genes decreases in the wild-type strain and the tor 1 tor 2 ts mutant exposed to rapamycin. Rapamycin may be inhibiting DNA repair independently of the Tor kinases. In yeast, FPR 1 encodes the rapamycin-binding protein Fpr 1 that inhibits the TORC 1 kinase in the presence of rapamycin. Fap 1 competes with rapamycin for Fpr 1 binding. Deletion of the FPR 1 or FAP 1 gene abolishes the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on repair. Thus, the decreased repair observed following rapamycin treatment is independent of TORC 1 / 2 function and likely due to a function of Fap 1. We suggest that Fap 1 and peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, particularly Fpr 1, function in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Our findings have clinical implications for <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicities</b> associated with genotoxic agents when coadministered with rapamycin...|$|R

40|$|Positive <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{data suggest}} {{carcinogenic}} hazard, {{and this can}} stop a candidate pharmaceutical reaching the clinic. However, during the last decade, {{it has become clear}} that many non-carcinogens produce misleading positive results in one or other of the regulatory genotoxicity assays.

This in turn means that clinical trials can be put on hold. This review describes the current approaches to the ‘misleading positive’ problem as well as efforts to reduce the use of animals in genotoxicity assessment. The following issues are then addressed: the application of genotoxicity testing screens earlier in development; the search for new or improved in vitro genotoxicity tests; proposed changes to the International Committee on Harmonisation guidance on genotoxicity testing [S 2 (R 1) ].

Because of the large number of MSW landfills, these sites pose a serious environmental threat to groundwater quality. This study was conducted to assess the environmental hazards that materials leaching from four MSW landfills pose to groundwater supplies. Four leachate and one upgradient groundwater samples were collected from landfills selected to be representative of landfills of differing ages and types of wastes. Each sample was tested through three <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> bioassays (The Aspergillus diploid assay, the Bacillus DNA repair assay and the Salmonella/microsome assay) to measure the ability of each sample to induce mutations in bacteria, bind to microbial DNA, or cause chromosome damage in diploid fungi. Genetically toxic chemicals may cause cancer, genetic disease, sterility, abortions, heart disease or a variety of other chronic effects. These chronic effects can be subtle and may not appear for decades after exposure. In addition to the three <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> assays, each sample was tested in the Microtox test to measure acute toxicity. This assay {{is a measure of the}} ability of the sample to cause cell death. Organisms exposed to elevated levels of acute toxins may express the toxic effects through organ disfunction or the complete death of the organism. Each sample was chemically analyzed using GC/MS techniques and the chemical concentrations were used to calculate a chemical based risk assessment which is an estimate of the potential carcinogenic health effects associated with the mixture of chemicals in the sample. All four leachate samples exhibited acute toxicity in the Microtox test.

Case Description A 14 year-old {{girl with a}} history of extended posterior spinal fusion due to idiopathic scoliosis presented to our department with diffuse erythema and nephritis (macroscopic hemuresis and proteinuria) 5 months post surgery. The surgical trauma had no signs of inflammation or infection. The blood markers ESR and CRP were increased. Skin tests were positive for nickel allergy, which is a content of titanium alloy. The patient received corticosteroids systematically (hydrocortisone 10 mg) for 6 months, leading to total recess of skin and systemic reaction. However, a palpable mass close to the surgical wound raised the suspicion of a late infection. The patient had a second surgery consisting of surgical debridement and one stage revision of posterior spinal instrumentation. Intraoperative cultures were positive to Staphylococcus aureus. Intravenous antibiotics were administered. The patient is now free of symptoms 24 months post revision surgery without any signs of recurrence of either vasculitis or infection. Literature Review Systemic vasculitis after spinal surgery is exceptionally rare. Causative factors are broad and sometimes controversial. In general, it is associated with allergy to metal ions. This is usually addressed with metal on metal total hip bearings. In spinal surgery, titanium implants are considered to be inert and only few reports have presented cases with systemic vasculitides. Therefore, other etiologies of immune over-reaction should always be considered, such as drug <b>toxicity,</b> infection, or <b>genetic</b> predisposition.

Previous studies show that exposure of 14 -day pregnant mice to a single dose of nano-TiO 2 in the nasal cavity increase the sensitivity of inflammatory response in F 1 generation [46, 47].

40|$|Background: With a {{wide range}} of applications, {{titanium}} dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles (NPs) are manufactured worldwide in large quantities. Recently, in the field of nanomedicine, intravenous injection of TiO 2 nanoparticulate carriers directly into the bloodstream has raised public concerns on their toxicity to humans. Methods: In this study, mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of TiO 2 NPs at varying dose levels (0, 140, 300, 645, or 1387 mg/kg). Animal mortality, blood biochemistry, hematology, genotoxicity and histopathology were investigated 14 days after treatment. Results: Death of mice in the highest dose (1387 mg/kg) group was observed at day two after TiO 2 NPs injection. At day 7, acute toxicity symptoms, such as decreased physical activity and decreased intake of food and water, were observed in the highest dose group. Hematological analysis and the micronucleus test showed no significant acute hematological or <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> except an increase in the white blood cell (WBC) count among mice 645 mg/kg dose group. However, the spleen of the mice showed significantly higher tissue weight/body weight (BW) coefficients, and lower liver and kidney coefficients in the TiO 2 NPs treated mice compared to control. The biochemical parameters and histological tissue sections indicated that TiO 2 NPs treatment could induce different degrees of damage in the brain, lung, spleen, liver and kidneys. However, no pathological effects were observed in the heart in TiO 2 NPs treated mice. Conclusions: Intravenous injection of TiO 2 NPs at high doses in mice could cause acute toxicity effects in the brain, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney. No significant hematological or <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> was observed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{endpoints}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity,</b> mutation at the X-linked Pig-a {{gene and}} chromosomal {{damage in the}} form of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs), were evaluated in blood samples obtained from 28 -day repeat-dosing studies typical of those employed in toxicity evaluations. Male Wistar Han rats were treated at 24 -h intervals on days 1 through 28 with one of five prototypical genotoxicants: N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, 7, 12 -dimethyl- 12 -benz[a]anthracene, 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 NQO), benzo(a) pyrene, and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Flow cytometric scoring of CD 59 -negative erythrocytes (indicative of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor deficiency and hence Pig-a mutation) was performed using blood specimens obtained on days − 1, 15, 29, and 56. Blood specimens collected on days 4 and 29 were evaluated for MN-RET frequency using flow cytometry–based MicroFlow Kits. With the exception of 4 NQO, each chemical induced significant increases in the frequency of MN-RETs on days 4 and 29. All five agents increased the frequency of mutant phenotype (CD 59 negative) reticulocytes (RETs) and erythrocytes. Mutation responses in RETs occurred earlier than in erythrocytes and tended to peak, or nearly peak, at day 29. In contrast, the mutant phenotype erythrocyte responses were modest on day 29 and required additional time to reach their maximal value. The observed kinetics were expected based on the known turnover of RETs and erythrocytes. The data show that RETs can serve as an appropriate indicator cell population for 28 -day studies. Collectively, these data suggest that blood-based genotoxicity endpoints can be effectively incorporated into routine toxicology studies, a strategy that would reduce animal usage while providing valuable <b>genetic</b> <b>toxicity</b> information within the context of other toxicological endpoints...|$|E

Lead poisoning (plumbism) can cause irreversible <b>genetic</b> and reproductive <b>toxicity,</b> hematological effects, neurological damage, and cardiovascular effects. Despite many efforts to minimize lead poisoning, {{it continues to be}} a major health concern in many developing and developed countries. Despite efforts to control lead exposure and toxicity, serious cases of lead poisoning increasingly occur as a result of higher vehicular traffic and industrialization. The biomarkers for identification of genetic susceptibility to a particular disease are useful to identify individuals who are at risk for lead poisoning. Although many such studies have been taken up elsewhere, very few studies were performed in Saudi Arabia to assess susceptibility to lead poisoning. This indicates an urgent need for testing of susceptible individuals. The present paper was planned to understand the genetic susceptibility to lead toxicity in the various population studies conductedworldwide and also to correlate it with the current scenario in Saudi Arabia. Such studies are necessary for appropriate precautions in terms of diet and avoiding exposure to be used in order to prevent adverse health effects. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: {{this study}} was {{designed}} to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with toxicity 2 years after radiotherapy. Materials and methods: a genome wide association study was performed in 1850 patients from the RAPPER study: 1217 received adjuvant breast radiotherapy and 633 had radical prostate radiotherapy. Genotype associations with both overall and individual endpoints of toxicity were tested via univariable and multivariable regression. Replication of potentially associated SNPs was carried out in three independent patient cohorts who had radiotherapy for prostate (516 RADIOGEN and 862 Gene-PARE) or breast (355 LeND) cancer. Results: quantile–quantile plots show more associations at the P < 5 × 10 ? 7 level than expected by chance (164 vs. 9 for the prostate cases and 29 vs. 4 for breast cases), providing evidence that common genetic variants are associated with risk of toxicity. Strongest associations were for individual endpoints rather than an overall measure of toxicity in all patients. However, in general, significant associations were not validated at a nominal 0. 05 level in the replication cohorts. Conclusions: this largest GWAS to date provides evidence of true association between common <b>genetic</b> variants and <b>toxicity.</b> Associations with toxicity appeared to be tumour site-specific. Future GWAS require higher statistical power, in particular in the validation stage, to test clinically relevant effect sizes of SNP associations with individual endpoints, but the required sample sizes are achievabl...|$|R

The last formal review of the subject by MASCC/ISOO was published in 2007; consequently, an update is timely. METHODS Panel members reviewed the biomedical literature on mucositis pathobiology published between January 2005 and December 2011. RESULTS Recent research has provided data on the contribution of tissue structure changes, inflammation and microbiome changes to the development of mucositis. Additional research has focused on targeted therapy-induced toxicity, toxicity clustering and the investigation of <b>genetic</b> polymorphisms in <b>toxicity</b> prediction. This review paper summarizes the recent evidence on these aspects of mucositis pathobiology. CONCLUSION The ultimate goal of mucositis researchers is to identify the most appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions and to be able to predict toxicity risk and personalize interventions to genetically suitable patients. Continuing research efforts are needed to further our understanding of mucositis pathobiology and the pharmacogenomics of toxicity. Noor Al-Dasooqi & Stephen T. Sonis & Joanne M.
