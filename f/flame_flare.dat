5000|$|Kirby, {{the main}} protagonist, retains his {{signature}} ability to inhale indefinitely, {{allowing him to}} suck in nearby objects and enemies. The inhaled objects can either be propelled back out as projectiles or swallowed. A new feature is the [...] "Super Inhale", where shaking the Wii Remote or inhaling {{for a long time}} makes Kirby's inhale stronger. A Super Inhale has extended range and can suck up metal blocks. Certain enemies, when swallowed, allow Kirby to extract their special qualities, giving Kirby access {{to a wide variety of}} different powers, called [...] "copy abilities." [...] Copy abilities are used to defeat stronger enemies and clear special environmental obstacles, though Kirby can only possess one copy ability at a time. Other players playing as more Kirbys, King Dedede, Meta Knight, or Waddle Dee, can hold Copy Abilities and throw them to Kirby whenever needed. Similar to Kirby Super Star, each copy ability has multiple forms of attack that are summoned depending on the player's button-presses. New powers introduced to this game are the Whip, which lets Kirby grab out of reach items, Water, which allows Kirby to cool fiery areas and lava blocks, and Leaf, which lets Kirby fire leaves and hide behind a leaf shield. By shaking the Wii Remote whilst inhaling, Kirby can perform a Super Inhale, which allows him to swallow larger enemies and blocks or multiple small ones. The game introduces more powerful, though temporary copy abilities called [...] "Super Abilities," [...] which are able to destroy multiple enemies at once as well as parts of the environment. These are enhanced versions of regular Copy Abilities which can take up half the screen. Unlike Copy Abilities, ejecting a Super Ability to get another ability will make the Super Ability star explode. Five Super Abilities exist: Ultra Sword, Monster <b>Flame,</b> <b>Flare</b> Beam, Grand Hammer, and Snow Bowl. These are enhanced versions of five Copy abilities with different move-sets. Throughout the game Kirby can collect food items which recover health and earn extra lives by collection 1UP items, or by collecting 100 stars. There are also various items Kirby can use, such as keys used to unlock hidden areas, a cannon which automatically fires, a trumpet that produces a protective barrier overhead and a large boot that lets Kirby hop across enemies and spiked areas (similar to the Kuribo's Shoe in Super Mario Bros. 3). At the end of each stage, a bonus game is played in which players time a button press to jump as high as possible to earn additional items.|$|E

5000|$|A {{sensitive}} flame is a {{gas flame}} which under suitable adjustment of pressure resonates readily with sounds or air vibrations in the vicinity. Noticed {{by both the}} American scientist John LeConte and the English physicist William Fletcher Barrett, they recorded the effect that a shrill note had upon a gas flame issuing from a tapering jet. The phenomenon {{caught the attention of}} the Irish physicist John Tyndall who gave a lecture on the process to the Royal Institution in January 1867. In 1857 Prof. John LeConte discovered that an ordinary naked gas-flame, from a fish-tail or bat-wing burner, becomes an indicator of sound by vibrating in unison with an external source, provided the pressure be such that the flame is just ready to flare. This can be easily shown by blowing a shrill whistle or bowing a tuning-fork of high pitch in the immediate neighborhood of the flame, which at once becomes forked (Fig. 3) into several long, vibrating tongues. The effect soon ceases if the pressure be gradually diminished. This result is due to the disturbance produced by sound-waves on the outflowing jet of gas at the nozzle. The high temperature of flame is therefore not necessary for the production of such co-vibration, but serves to make it more easily manifest. Nine years elapsed after Dr. Le Conte's discovery before the subject was taken up again and independently by Mr. W. F. Barrett, in London, who used small cylindrical jets, which were found to flare under similar conditions, and could be rendered far more sensitive. A [...] "pin-hole lava-tip" [...] may be fitted into the end of a metal tube and connected by means of India-rubber tubing to a cylinder of compressed illuminating gas. In connection with this, also, there should be a water manometer gauge for regulating the pressure of the outflowing gas. If the pin-hole is very smoothly cylindrical, the flame mounts up to the height of nearly eighteen inches (Fig. 4, x), with an apparent thickness scarcely more than that of the little finger, and burning quietly. When the pressure approaches ten inches, as indicated by the water-gauge, the <b>flame</b> <b>flares,</b> becoming much shorter and broader, like a little Indian club (Fig. 4, y), and producing a low roaring sound, due to the escape of unburned gas. Let the pressure now be diminished until this flaring barely ceases. The flame is now in its most sensitive condition. Sounds of low or even medium pitch have no effect upon it; but on blowing a shrill whistle, or rattling a bunch of keys anywhere within thirty or forty feet, it flares. Perhaps the most beautiful illustration of its sensitiveness is given by placing an open watch near the nozzle but not touching it; every tick causes a momentary sinking and spreading of the flame, so that the effect may be seen across an audience-room. If the audience applauds with clapping of hands, the flame shrinks in acknowledgment. [...] "Popular Science Monthly/Volume 36/November 1889" ...|$|R

60|$|American Notes {{was written}} soon after Dickens had {{returned}} from {{his first visit to}} America.

The American Notes are, however, interesting, because in them he betrays his feelings when he does not know that he is betraying them. Dickens's first visit to America was, from his own point of view, and at the beginning, a happy and festive experiment. It is very characteristic of him that he went among the Americans, enjoyed them, even admired them, and then had a quarrel with them. Nothing was ever so unmistakable as his good-will, except his ill-will; and they were never far apart. And this was not, as some bloodless moderns have sneeringly insinuated, a mere repetition of the proximity between the benevolent stage and the quarrelsome stage of drink. It was a piece of pure optimism; he believed so readily that men were going to be good to him that an injury to him was something more than an injury: it was a shock. What was the exact nature of the American shock must, however, be more carefully stated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to modelling the crosswind effect on a turbulent non-premixed flame. A pre-processor software GAMBIT was employed {{to set up the}} configuration, discretisation, and boundary conditions of the flame being investigated. The commercial software Fluent 6. 3 was used to perform the calculations of flow and mixing fields as well as combustion. Standard k-ε and eddy dissipation models were selected as solvers for the representation of the turbulence and combustion, respectively. The results of all calculations are presented in the forms of contour profiles. During the investigation, the treatment was performed by setting a constant velocity of fuel at 20 m/s with varied cross-wind velocity and by keeping the cross-wind velocity constant at 1. 1 m/s with varied fuel velocity. The results of the investigation showed that the standard k-ε turbulence model in conjunction with Eddy Dissipation Model representing the combustion was capable of producing reliable phenomena of the flow field and reactive scalars field in the turbulent non-premixed flame being investigated. Other results of the investigation showed that increasing the velocity of the crosswind, when the fuel velocity was kept constant, significantly affected the flow field, temperature and species concentrations in the <b>flare</b> <b>flame.</b> On the other hand, when the velocity of the fuel was varied at the constant crosswind velocity, the increasing velocity of the fuel gave positive impact as it enabled to counteract the effect of crosswind on the flare flam...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityPolybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are a {{class of}} flame retardant chemicals that {{have been added to}} consumer products such as foam furniture and electronic equipment since the 1970 s. Human exposure can occur when PBDEs are released to the environment. North Americans are among the most highly exposed populations, with median serum concentrations about an order of magnitude higher than European or Asian populations. Multiple animal studies have shown PBDEs to be thyroid hormone disruptors that may also adversely affect reproductive success. Limited human studies exist on the human health effects of PBDEs or their persistence in human tissues. We investigated exposure to PBDEs in a longitudinal cohort of 52 healthy adults within the Boston metropolitan area, hereafter referred to as the <b>Flame</b> Retardant Exposure (<b>FlaRE)</b> cohort. We followed individuals for approximately one year and collected serum samples and questionnaire data at three sampling intervals: Winter 2010, Summer 2010, and Winter 2011. Serum samples were analyzed for 11 PBDE congeners, thyroid function, and reproductive function tests. We used these data to assess the stability of PBDEs in serum measures, determine potential temporal trends in PBDE serum concentrations over 1 year, and assess the relationship between PBDE exposure and thyroid and reproductive function tests over time. In the FlaRE cohort, geometric mean sum concentrations of the five most prevalent PBDE congeners (BDE 28, 47, 99, 100, 153) were 21. 8 ng/g lipid in Winter 2010, 22. 8 ng/g lipid in Summer 2010, and 18. 7 ng/g lipid in Winter 2011. We found that a single PentaBDE serum measurement is a stable estimate, either continuously or categorically, of a participant's blood concentration over the one-year study period. After adjustment of important confounders, we found that serum PentaBDE congeners were inversely associated with Total T 4, which is consistent with animal experiments and some previous epidemiology studies. Among men 40 years or older, increased exposure to PentaBDEs was associated with a decrease in inhibin-B, an increase in follicular stimulating hormone, and decreases in the inhibin-B/FSH ratio thus indicating PBDE exposure may decrease testicular function in men...|$|R
