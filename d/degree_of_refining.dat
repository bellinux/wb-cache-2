Also, the potential saving in chlorine dioxide was assessed. The enzyme treatment was performed on pulp containing some black liquor since the operating conditions were close to the conditions used in the storage tower in Fibria, identified as the most suitable point for application. The greatest differences in kappa number and hexenuronic acid content were observed after the X stage. Whereas, in brightness were observed after the Z stage. The effluent properties from the X stage were higher with the enzyme treatments. Also, the enzymes allowed chlorine dioxide consumption in the bleaching stage to be reduced. The control pulp contained twice as much adsorbable organic halides (AOX) and exhibited twice more brightness reversion than did the enzyme-treated samples.

In exploring this, fines co-generated upon refining the alkaline peroxide treated oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) were collected based on their passage and retention capacities when subjected to varying mesh-sizes stainless-steel square mesh wires. Pulp network incorporating fines produced from the synergy of low alkaline peroxide (AP) and low energy refining effects shows that blending 12 % of the 400 -mesh fines (P 300 /R 400) with the normal 200 -mesh pulp fraction enhanced paper tensile strength by 100 % due to their favourable dimensions. This defines the usefulness of fibrillar particles whose cell wall collapsibility increases the web density by increasing bonding ability and thus, strength of pulp-based products. Fines produced from more extreme synergy between alkaline peroxide and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining,</b> exhibit unique submicron fibrils and ‘nano-CGF’ also responsible for further augmentation of EFB alkaline peroxide pulp network. Whether from the simple (low-AP and low energy refining) or the extreme synergy of AP and refining, the co-generated fines are apparently suitable materials for use as natural filler for augmentation of pulp network. Particularly for the simple AP and refining synergy, the introduced recovery and utilization of the co-generated filler (CGF) was found to reduce 74 % turbidity and this improvement will help reduce the complexity of whitewater generation in the pulping system...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{has been}} carried out {{as a part of the}} Master of Science in {{mechanical}} engineering at Karlstads University. The purpose of the study was to evaluate how different variables affect the tearing resistance in a multi-ply paperboard. The paperboard’s final quality is dependent on several different process – and recipe variables and has, in this study, been analyzed with respect to ply grammage, ply composition and refining energies. This was investigated by manufacturing of anisotropic sheets consisting of four plies and isotropic sheets consisting of single-ply sheets. The multi-ply sheets were manufactured where one variable at a time were tested at different values. The single-ply sheets were manufactured of pure pulps with the refining energy being varied. A total of nineteen unique multi-ply sheets and twelve unique single-ply sheets were manufactured. All sheets were tested with respect to the properties including tensile strength, bending stiffness, tear strength and delamination strength. The study shows that an improvement in tearing resistance is obtained when the amount of CTMP-pulp in the center plies 2 and 3 decreases simultaneously as the amount of broke-pulp and unbleached chemical pulp in the same plies increases. The consequence of this improvement is reduced thickness and thereby reduced bending stiffness. The study also shows that several pulps has an optimal <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> for maximizing tear strength in paperboard. The major source of error is believed to be the method of manufacturing. It is also possible that the amount of test points has been too few to be able to see any clear trends for several variables...|$|E

Esse tratamento tÃrmico, muitas vezes, se torna impraticÃvel devido a alguns fatores como tamanho da peÃa, reparo no campo e custo. A tÃcnica da dupla-camada tem sido pesquisada no sentido de se evitar este tratamento tÃrmico e garantir boas propriedades mecÃnicas da peÃa soldada. O emprego da tÃcnica da dupla-camada exige uma relaÃÃo adequada entre as energias de soldagem das camadas, para que a segunda refina e revina a ZAC grosseria da primeira, pois, nesta regiÃo a possibilidade de formaÃÃo de martensita Ã grande devido a sua maior temperabilidade. Neste trabalho, foi utilizado um ensaio preliminar chamado de teste de Higuchi que permitiu a escolha das energias. Em seguida foram {{realizadas}} soldagens em simples depÃsito e camada Ãnica em corpos de prova temperados e revenidos com o objetivo de avaliar o grau de refino e revenimento proporcionado pelos passes laterais.

A soldagem de uma junta semi-V permitiu a avaliaÃÃo da tenacidade da ZAC da primeira camada atravÃs da realizaÃÃo do ensaio Charpy. Os resultados deste ensaio mostraram que as energias absorvidas por corpos de prova soldados, com as relaÃÃes de energias de soldagem (KJ/cm) da primeira e segunda camada de 5 / 5 e 5 / 10, sÃo semelhantes as dos corpos de prova com o tratamento tÃrmico pÃs-soldagem e superior a do {{metal base}} temperado e revendido, mostrando a viabilidade de tÃcnica. The welding procedure {{of the conventional}} steel AISI 4140 due {{to the formation of}} martensite in the heat affected zone by heat (HAZ), comprises a post-welding heat treatment to relieve stresses and improve the toughness of this zone. This thermal treatment often becomes impractical due to factors such as part size, and field repair cost. The technique of double-layer has been studied in order to avoid this thermal treatment and to ensure good mechanical properties of the welded part. The use of the technique of double-layer requires an appropriate relationship between the energy of welding of the layers, so that the second and refines the HAZ revina coarseness of the first, since in this region the possibility of formation of martensite is large because of its higher hardenability. In this work, we used a preliminary test called Higuchi allowing the choice of energy. Then welds were carried out in simple deposit and single layer in specimens quenched and tempered in order to assess the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> and tempering provided by lateral passes.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the potential of both corn stalk (Zea Mays L.) and industrial hemp core (Cannabis Sativa L.) fibres as a renewable source of cellulose fibres in the production of fibre-cement. For each source of fibres, a number of chemical cooking treatments were studied.

Pulp refining was carried out in a PFI mill to improve the characteristics of the fibres. In the case of corn fibres, different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> were applied. The fibre flocculation process was investigated using several polyacrylamides.

40|$|Greaseproof {{paper has}} a dense {{structure}} and therefore provides a natural barrier against materials like fat and oils. The barrier is obtained by extensive refining of the pulp. This refining is however a costly operation, {{not only in}} terms of direct costs for the refining but also in terms of indirect costs because the energy consumption for the drying of the paper is affected by the refining. A full-scale trial was performed to investigate the role of the pulp with respect to the energy demand and the barrier properties of the final papers. Paper made of 100 % sulphite pulp with a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> exhibited the lowest energy consumption at a given level of air permeance. In addition, the effect of refining on the air permeance was compared with that of calendering. The calendering affected the air permeance less than the refining. The papers produced in the full-scale trial were later used as substrates for coatings and for detailed studies of the paper structure. Coating with chitosan was examined on a bench-scale and on a pilot scale. The studies showed that greaseproof paper can be upgraded with an oxygen barrier, but also that suitable coating techniques are lacking for the application of the coating in a sufficient amount. The influence of the base paper on the barrier properties of chitosan-coated paper was investigated in another study, in which it was found that greaseproof paper possesses a unique coating hold-out which cannot be met by other types of paper with a more open structure. It was also found that the coated paper had a lower oxygen permeability than the chitosan coating itself, and this indicates that the dense surface layer of greaseproof paper contributed to the oxygen permeability of the coated paper. The pore volume fraction of the greaseproof paper was found to be approximately 40 % and it is therefore surprising that its air permeance is so low. To bring understanding to this question, the structure of greaseproof paper was studied using several methods. It was found that the structure was dominated by very small pores with a median diameter of < 0. 3 µm. The fraction of closed pores was also substantial. A porosity gradient was also found, indicating that the papers used in the study had a closed surface. The hypothesis that the surface layer of the paper contributed to the oxygen barrier was tested in an experiment in which greaseproof paper was extrusion-coated with polyethylene. The oxygen permeability was measured at 0 %, 50 % and 90 % relative humidity, and the permeability was found to increase with increasing moisture content. Because only the cellulose layer in the paper and not the polyethylene layer in the coating is affected by moisture, this result supports the hypothesis that the surface layer of the paper contributed to the oxygen barrier properties of the coated paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work was to examine different approaches to tailor chemical fibres of different raw materials. The focus in searching for new approaches was on pressure screen fractionation, selective treatment of each fraction, mechanical pre-treatment before refining, refiner loadability and its link to fibre properties and filling design, and on-line quality control of fibre properties. The evaluation {{is based on the}} impacts on fibre properties, filtration, refining and the resulting paper properties. Tailoring of fibres using pressure screen fractionation was found to produce a long and coarse (reject) fraction offering high dewatering efficiency, homogeneous and energy-efficient refining, and better strength properties, such as tear index, bulk and fracture toughness, in pure and mixed sheets with other fibres. Although the accept fraction contains short and thin fibres and has a high fines content, it proved possible to use the accept fraction to increase the bonding and scattering of once dried softwood and to reduce the refining energy input needed to reach a certain tensile strength level. A new mechanical pre-treatment was examined and found to promote lumen collapse and de-swelling of fibres, and hence to improve the strength-dewatering combination of softwood kraft pulp. The treatment involved application of linear loads, heat, and shear forces over multiple passes. In refining, the pre-treated fibres produced better dewatering and a consolidated structure with less cutting, fines creation and external fibrillation compared to never dried fibres. The pre-treated fibres offer better potential for developing a higher tensile index, stiffness and Scott bond than once dried fibres at a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining.</b> Refiner loadability and gap movement are strongly related to fibre properties and filling design. Fibre properties together with pulp consistency contribute to the size and strength of flocs building up inside the refiner, where big and strong flocs are loaded earlier and maintain a wide gap with less floc size changes. Here, pulp consistency was found to have a smaller effect than fibre properties. Filling design, reflected in the cutting edge speed, was found to contribute strongly to the gap movement and refiner loadability. An increase in edge cutting speed caused the refiner gap width to decrease linearly, thus enhancing different refining effects such as fibre cutting, fibrillation and fibre swelling. A factor network linking on-line measured fibre properties, calculated factors and predicted paper properties was found to be an effective tool for monitoring changes in pulp quality, such as different raw materials with different average fibre lengths. The model was built off-line and tested against on-line mill operation and found to be effective in predicting paper properties of both never and once dried pulp. The refining model was tested with a laboratory refiner and used to explain strength properties such as tensile index, to monitor changes in paper properties due to refining and to determine the optimum refining conditions and different refining effects such as bonding, straightening and fibre cutting...|$|E
40|$|Sizing (hydrophobization) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} process steps within the added-value chain of about 1 / 3 rd of the worldwide produced paper & board products. Even though sizing with so-called reactive sizing agents, such as alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) was implemented in the paper industry decades ago, there is no total clarity yet about the detailed chemical and physical mechanisms that lead to their performance. Previous research was carried out on the role of different factors influencing the sizing performance, such as bonding between ASA and cellulose, ASA hydrolysis, size revision as well as the most important interactions with stock components, process parameters and additives during the paper making process. However, it was not yet possible to develop a holistic model for the explanation of the sizing performance given in real life application. This thesis describes a novel physico-chemical approach to this problem by including results from previous research and combining these with a wide field of own basic research and a newly developed method that allows tracing back the actual localization of ASA within the sheet structure. The carried out measurements and trial sets for the basic field of research served to evaluate the stock and process parameters that most dominantly influence the sizing performance of ASA. Interactions with additives other than retention aids were not taken into account. The results show that parameters, such as the content of secondary fibers, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>refining,</b> the water hardness as well as the suspension conductivity, are of highest significance. The sample sets of the trials with the major impacting parameters were additionally analyzed by a newly developed localization method in order to better understand the main influencing factors. This method is based on optical localization of ASA within the sheet structure by confocal white light microscopy. In order to fulfill the requirements at magnification rates of factor 100 optical zoom, it was necessary to improve the contrast between ASA and cellulose. Therefore, ASA was pretreated with an inert red diazo dye, which does not have any impact on neither the sizing nor the handling properties of ASA. Laboratory hand sheets that were sized with dyed ASA, were analyzed by means of their sizing performance in correlation to measurable ASA agglomerations in the sheet structure. The sizing performance was measured by ultrasonic penetration analysis. The agglomeration behavior of ASA was analyzed automatically by multiple random imaging of a sample area of approx. 8650 µm² with a minimum resolution for particles of 500 nm in size. The gained results were interpreted by full factorial design of experiments (DOE). The trials were carried out with ASA dosages between 0 % and 0. 8 % on laboratory hand sheets, made of 80 % bleached eucalyptus short fiber kraft pulp and 20 % northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, beaten to SR° 30, produced with a RDA sheet former at a base weight of 100 g/m² oven dry. The results show that there is a defined correlation between the ASA dosage, the sizing performance and the number and area of ASA agglomerates to be found in the sheet structure. It was also possible to show that the agglomeration behavior is highly influenced by external factors like furnish composition and process parameters. This enables a new approach to the explanation of sizing performance, by making it possible to not only examine the performance of the sizing agent, but to closely look at the predominant position where it is located in the sheet structure. These results lead to the explanation that the phenomenon of sizing is by far not a pure chemical process but rather a more physical one. Based on the gained findings it was possible so far to optimize the ASA sizing process in industrial-scale by means of ~ 50 % less ASA consumption at a steady degree of sizing and improved physical sheet properties...|$|E

Data were generated over a selected range of flow rates and temperatures from a specially built flow loop. It was found that the magnitude of the heat transfer coefficient was above water at equivalent experimental conditions at very low fibre concentrations, but progressively decreased until it was below water at slightly higher concentrations. It was found that the heat transfer was affected by varying fibre properties, such as fibre length, fibre flexibility, fibre chemical and mechanical treatment, the variation of fibres from different parts of the tree as well as the different pulping methods used to liberate the fibres from the wood structure. Heat transfer coefficient was decreased with the increasing of fibre flexibility as found by previous workers. In the present investigation properties of fibre and paper are correlated with heat transfer to suspensions of fibres. Variations in fibre characteristics can be monitored in flowing suspension of fibres by measuring heat transfer coefficient and using those measurements to adjust the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> fibre <b>refining</b> treatment so that papers made from those fibres are more uniform, more consistent and within product specification.

Washington is the marginal supplier <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> product, providing cushion for any supply and demand imbalances in California markets.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectral}} approximation properties of isogeometric analysis with local continuity {{reduction of the}} basis. Such continuity reduction results in {{a reduction in the}} interconnection between the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom of the mesh, which allows for large savings in computational requirements during the solution of the resulting linear system. The continuity reduction results in extra <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom that modify the approximation properties of the method. The convergence rate <b>of</b> such <b>refined</b> isogeometric analysis is equivalent to that of the maximum continuity basis. We show how the breaks in continuity and inhomogeneity of the basis lead to artefacts in the frequency spectra, such as stopping bands and outliers, and present a unified description of these effects in finite element method, isogeometric analysis, and refined isogeometric analysis. Accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>refined</b> isogeometric analysis approximations can be improved by using non-standard quadrature rules. In particular, optimal quadrature rules lead to large reductions in the eigenvalue errors and yield two extra orders of convergence similar to classical isogeometric analysis...|$|R

40|$|Xylo-oligosaccharides and xylo-polysaccharides (XOS, XPS) {{produced}} by autohydrolysis of the fibre from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) were purified using {{gel filtration chromatography}} to separate the XOS and XPS from the crude autohydrolysis liquor. Six mixed fractions <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> XOS and XPS with average <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polymerisation (avDP) of 4 - 64 were obtained. These were characterised {{in terms of their}} composition and size by HPLC, MALDI-ToF-MS (selected fractions) and carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE). They were assessed in batch culture fermentations using faecal inocula to determine their ability to modulate the human faecal microbiota in vitro by measuring the bacterial growth, organic acid production and the XOS assimilation profile. The gut microbiota was able to utilise all the substrates and there was a link between the XOS/XPS <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polymerisation with the fermentation properties. In general, XOS/XPS preparations of lower avDP promote better Bifidobacterium growth and organic acid production...|$|R

Linear chains of trapped ions have proven experimentally to be highly controllable quantum systems with a variety <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> techniques for preparation, evolution, and readout, however, typically for quantum information processing applications people {{have been interested in}} using the internal levels of the ions as the computational basis. We analyse the case where the motional <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom of the ions is the quantum system of interest, and where the internal levels are leveraged to facilitate interactions. In particular, we focus on an analysis of mode-mixing of phonons in different normal modes to mimic the quantum optical equivalent of a beam splitter...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with a comparison of some technical aspects regarding batch vs continuous refining (centrifugal alkali <b>refining)</b> <b>of</b> crude cottonseed oil. Implication of processing modes of operation were examined {{in light of their}} effect on the following performance criteria: (a) percentage <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> loss {{as a function of the}} initial crude-oil free fatty acid (FFA) content: (b) refined oil color as a function of initial crude-oil FFA: (c) caustic soda consumption as a function of initial crude-oil FFA: (d) bleachability characteristics <b>of</b> <b>refined</b> oil.

40|$|A mesh {{refinement}} {{method is}} described for solving a continuous-time optimal control problem using collocation at Legendre-Gauss-Radau points. The method allows {{for changes in}} both the number of mesh intervals and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> the approximating polynomial within a mesh interval. First, a relative error estimate is derived based on {{the difference between the}} Lagrange polynomial approximation of the state and a Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature integration of the dynamics within a mesh interval. The derived relative error estimate is then used to decide if the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> the approximating polynomial within a mesh should be increased or if the mesh interval should be divided into subintervals. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> the approximating polynomial within a mesh interval is increased if the polynomial degree estimated by the method remains below a maximum allowable degree. Otherwise, the mesh interval is divided into subintervals. The process <b>of</b> <b>refining</b> the mesh is repeated until a specified relative error tolerance is met. Three examples highlight various features of the method and show that the approach is more computationally efficient and produces significantly smaller mesh sizes for a given accuracy tolerance when compared with fixed-orde...|$|R
