25|$|The {{laughing}} falcon has another call, typically given at dusk. This two-note call is {{preceded by a}} series of gwa notes given every half-second or so. They become more emphatic and after some time change to a sequence of the gwa co call proper, with the first syllable higher in pitch than the second, but not differing in emphasis or volume. The gwa co call may be repeated 50 times or more. Sometimes, the initial calls are a oo oo-oo cow-cow-cow, sometimes a descending gwaaaaaaa..... On occasion, the two-syllable call is not given, and instead the simple gwa is repeated as often as the <b>full</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{bombardment}} of Fort Sumter {{was the first}} military action of the American Civil War. Following the surrender, Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all states to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union. With {{the scale of the}} rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. Some Northern states filled their quotas quickly. There were so many volunteers in Ohio that within 16 days they could have met the <b>full</b> <b>call</b> for 75,000 men by themselves. Other governors from border states were undiplomatic in their responses. For example, Gov. Claiborne Jackson wrote, [...] "Not one man will the state of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade", and Gov. Beriah Magoffin wrote, [...] "Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states." [...] The governors of other states still in the Union were equally unsupportive. The call for 75,000 troops triggered four additional slave states to declare their secession from the Union and join the Confederacy. The ensuing war lasted four years, effectively ending in April 1865 with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomatox Courthouse.|$|E

50|$|By August 2009, WLHT {{had moved}} its format toward Hot AC (of which WMAX-FM {{used to carry}} until 2008), and its {{previous}} mainstream AC format had shifted to sister station WTRV, which previously had aired a MOR/soft AC mix. As a result, WLHT-FM had been leaning adult top 40 until the station dropped AC in 2009 (a similar situation done at adult top 40-leaning ACs such as WNIC Detroit). Also in 2009, former WOOD-TV news personality Gerry Barnaby took over the morning show. The radio station's jockeys began referring to the station as LHT, dropping the W except when plugging the station's web page {{and at the top}} of the hour for mandatory recitation of the <b>full</b> <b>call</b> sign.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial operators, {{including}} scheduled airline, {{air cargo}} and air taxi operators, will usually use an ICAO or FAA-registered call sign for their company. By ICAO Annex 10 Chapter 5.2.1.7.2.1 - <b>Full</b> <b>call</b> signs type C, a call sign consists {{out of the}} telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency, followed by the flight identification. The flight identification is very often {{the same as the}} flight number, but could be different due to call sign confusion, if two or more flights close to each other have similar flight numbers (e.g. KLM649 and KLM645 or BAW466 and BAW646). For example, British Airways flight 75 would use the call sign Speedbird Seven-Five, since Speedbird is the telephony designator for British Airways and 75 would be the flight identification. (The telephony designator {{is not the same as}} the call sign, although the two are sometimes conflated). Pan Am had the telephony designator of Clipper. (see list) ...|$|E
5000|$|Nine Chains to the Moon {{is a book}} by R. Buckminster Fuller, first {{published}} in 1938.

5000|$|In 1956, the English {{historian}} J. F. C. <b>Fuller</b> <b>called</b> {{the military}} operations on the Meuse in 1940, [...] "the Second Battle of Sedan". [...] <b>Fuller</b> <b>called</b> the German operation {{an attack by}} paralyzation but Robert Doughty wrote that what some writers later called blitzkrieg had influenced few German officers, except for Guderian and Manstein and that the dispute between Guderian and Kleist that led Guderian to resign on 17 May, showed the apprehensions of the higher commanders about the [...] "pace and vulnerability" [...] of the XIX Panzer Corps. Doughty wrote {{that the development of}} the German plan suggested that the plan to send armoured forces through the Ardennes was traditional Vernichtungsstrategie (strategy of annihilation), to encircle opposing forces and destroy them in a Kesselschlacht (cauldron battle). Weapons had changed but the methods were the same as those at Ulm (1805), Sedan (1870) and Tannenberg (1914).|$|R

40|$|The <b>full</b> <b>call</b> strings {{method is}} the most general, simplest, and most precise method of {{performing}} context sensitive interprocedural data flow analysis. It remembers contexts using call strings. For full precision, all call strings up to a prescribed length must be constructed. Two limitations of this method are (a) it cannot be used for frameworks with infinite lattices, and (b) the prescribed length is quadratic {{in the size of}} the lattice resulting in an impractically large number of call strings. These limitations have resulted in a proliferation of ad hoc methods which compromise on generality, precision, or simplicity. We propose a variant of the classical <b>full</b> <b>call</b> strings method which reduces the number of call strings, and hence the analysis time, by orders of magnitude as corroborated by our empirical measurements. It reduces the worst case call string length from quadratic {{in the size of the}} lattice to linear. Further, unlike the classical method, this worst case length need not be reached. Our approach retains the precision, generality, and simplicity of call strings method without imposing any additional constraints. It can accommodate demand-driven approximations and hence can be used for frameworks with infinite lattices...|$|E
40|$|In the {{approach}} to exascale, scalable tools are becoming increasingly necessary to support parallel applications.

We use this technique to estimate the similarity between successive call stacks, removing the need for <b>full</b> <b>call</b> stack traversal and eliminating a significant portion of the performance overhead. We demonstrate this technique applied to a parallel memory tracing toolkit, WMTools, and analyse the performance gains and accuracy...|$|E
