25|$|The {{relationships}} between India {{in the days}} of the British Raj and the US were thin. Swami Vivekananda promoted Yoga and Vedanta in America at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, during the World's Fair in 1893. Mark Twain visited India in 1896 and described it in his travelogue Following the Equator with both revulsion and attraction before concluding that India was the only foreign land <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> about or longed to see again. Regarding India, Americans learned more from English writer Rudyard Kipling. Mahatma Gandhi had an important influence on the philosophy of non-violence promoted by Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Gillespie {{was born}} in Cheraw, South Carolina, the {{youngest}} of nine children of James and Lottie Gillespie. James was a local bandleader, so instruments were {{made available to the}} children. Gillespie started to play the piano at the age of four. Gillespie's father died when he was only ten years old. Gillespie taught himself how to play the trombone as well as the trumpet by the age of twelve. From the night he heard his idol, Roy Eldridge, play on the radio, <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> of becoming a jazz musician.

Later in the year in March he would write Preston informing him of his brother in law Billy Buchanan being killed by Indians. Also in the letter Floyd wrote that <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> that his fate might become the same. This proved true as a month later Floyd was wounded on April 8, 1783 by Indians while on his way to Bullitt's Lick while wearing the scarlet coat he had brought from Paris. He died of his injuries on April 10, 1783. His widow Jane preserved the scarlet coat until 1812 when the coat was buried with her, as she had requested. Floyd is buried near Floyd's Station at Breckinridge Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} his {{political}} setbacks McLane never lost his ambition for high political office. One of his last remaining political friends from the congressional days was James K. Polk, who was now President of the United States. While <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> of something much greater, McLane took {{a leave of absence}} from the railroad in 1845 and 1846 to return to England as Minister Plenipotentiary, primarily for the purpose of coordinating negotiations over the Oregon boundary. McLane was remembered fondly from his previous service, and renewed his old friendships. The basis of the settlement was easily established, but the hard line public position of Polk was shaken only by outbreak of the Mexican–American War. McLane succeeded in keeping the British agreeable to the eventual settlement until the administration came to the same conclusion, even if he risked suggesting the president was posturing when he insisted on “54-40 or Fight.” McLane never received the higher appointment desired and reluctantly returned to the railroad.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Kallinger often {{rebelled against}} his {{teachers}} and his adoptive parents. <b>He</b> <b>dreamed</b> {{of becoming a}} playwright, and had played the part of Ebenezer Scrooge in the local YWCA's performance of A Christmas Carol in the ninth grade. When Kallinger was 15, he began dating a girl named Hilda Bergman, whom he met at a theater which {{he was allowed to}} visit on Saturdays. His parents told him not to see her, but he married her and had two children with her. She later left him because of the domestic violence she suffered at his hands. Kallinger was hospitalized at St. Mary's on September 4, 1957 due to severe headaches and loss of appetite which doctors believed was a result of stress surrounding his divorce. Kallinger remarried on April 20, 1958 and had five children with his second wife. He was extremely abusive towards his family, and often inflicted the same punishments on them that he had suffered from his adoptive parents.|$|E

Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Mahalakshmi of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> of blood drops that symbolised her male consort, Narasimha.

Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> of a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E
