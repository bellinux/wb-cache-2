5000|$|The title {{translates}} as [...] "Selfish" [...] {{and indeed the}} song is about Alexia blasting a former lover as being self-centered and transparent, wanting {{to have time to}} himself but not spend any with her, and that she <b>feels</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> without him.|$|R

60|$|The wheel was lashed {{fast and}} the engine slowed down, and all hands went to breakfast. It {{was by no means}} an {{elaborate}} meal, yet it made all but Hans <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> The German youth had little appetite and ate sparingly.|$|E

[...] "I presume you young ladies are with Miss Stevenson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Daybreak {{found the}} {{squadron}} {{running into the}} first of a series of fog-banks. At once the speed of each warship was reduced, and presently it became necessary to use the fog-horns and ship-bells. In the meantime all hands were put through several drills, [...] "to get them into fighting trim," [...] as the officer of the deck explained. The drills lasted until dinner time, and in some way they made Walter <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> As a matter of fact, his spell of seasickness was of short duration, and once gone, the malady never returned.|$|E

60|$|His words, {{like all}} his words to her, were quite true. She found it amazingly easy {{in a brief}} space of time. The floor, far from {{hindering}} her, was a positive assistance {{to one of her}} natural agility and litheness. Moreover, her marvellous dress of twelve flounces inspired her as nothing else could have done. Externally a new creature, she was prompted to new deeds. To feel as well-dressed as the other women around her is to set any woman at her ease, whencesoever she may have come: to <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> dressed is to add radiance to that ease.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the coming}} of spring the cadets formed, as of old, several {{football}} teams, and played several notches, including one with their old rivals, the pupils of Pornell Academy. This game they lost, by a score of four to five, which made the Pornellites <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> they having lost every game in the past.

[...] "You and I, friend Scarecrow, are much more easily cared for than those clumsy meat people, who spend half their time dressing in fine clothes and who must live in splendid dwellings in order to be contented and happy. You and I do not eat, and so we are spared the dreadful bother of getting three meals a day. Nor do we waste half our lives in sleep, a condition that causes the meat people to lose all consciousness and become as thoughtless and helpless as logs of wood." ...|$|E
50|$|Damon {{is trapped}} {{at the house}} since he cannot get out to the {{sunlight}} and he is getting impatient waiting for Stefan to bring him his ring.

6000|$|... 'The big {{cable is}} {{stubborn}} {{and will not}} behave like his smaller brother. The gear employed to take him off the drum is not strong enough; he gets slack on the drum and plays the mischief. Luckily for my own conscience, the gear I had wanted was negatived by Mr. Newall. Mr. Liddell does not exactly blame me, but he says we {{might have had a}} silver pulley cheaper than the cost of this delay. [...] He has telegraphed for more men to Cagliari, to try to pull the cable off the drum into the hold, by hand. I look as comfortable as I can, but feel as if people were blaming me. I am trying my best to get something rigged which may help us; I wanted a little difficulty, and <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> - The short length we have picked up was covered at places with beautiful sprays of coral, twisted and twined with shells of those small, fairy animals we saw in the aquarium at home; poor little things, they died at once, with their little bells and delicate bright tints.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{too much}} in New York to remind me. That's the worst of being happy in a place. When things go wrong you find {{there are too many}} ghosts about. I just couldn't stand it. I tried, but I couldn't. I'm going away to get cured--if I can. Mr. Faucitt is over in England, and when I went down to Mrs. Meecher for my letters, I found one from him. His brother is dead, you know, and he has inherited, of all things, a fashionable dress-making place in Regent Street. His brother was Laurette et Cie. I suppose he will sell the {{business}} later on, but, just at present, the poor old dear is apparently quite bewildered and that doesn't seem to have occurred to him. He kept saying in his letter how much he wished I was with him, to help him, and I was tempted and ran. Anything {{to get away from the}} ghosts and have something to do. I don't suppose I shall <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> in England, but, at least, every street corner won't have associations. Don't ever be happy anywhere, Ginger. It's too big a risk, much too big a risk.|$|E
60|$|With {{the last}} word he vanished, to our sorrow and disappointment. We got the men and Father Adolf, and we saw the man die. Nobody cared but the dog; he mourned and grieved, and licked the dead face, {{and could not be}} comforted. We buried him where he was, and without a coffin, for he had no money, and no friend but the dog. If we had been an hour earlier the priest would have been in time to send that poor {{creature}} to heaven, but now he was gone down into the awful fires, to burn forever. It seemed such a pity that in a world where so many people have difficulty to put in their time, one little hour could not have been spared for this poor creature who needed it so much, and to whom it would have made the difference between eternal joy and eternal pain. It gave an appalling idea of the value of an hour, and I thought I could never waste one again without remorse and terror. Seppi was depressed and grieved, and said it must be so much better to be a dog and not run such awful risks. We took this one home with us and kept him for our own. Seppi had a very good thought as we were walking along, and it cheered us up and made us <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> He said the dog had forgiven the man that had wronged him so, and maybe God would accept that absolution.|$|E
50|$|With {{the case}} closed, Gibbs takes Westcott {{to see one}} of his men. They both make amends for what {{happened}} in the ambush, and are both determined to work through their PTSD. Westcott apologizes for running from the battle, but the squadmate corrects him, saying that Westcott had never fled from the battle, and in fact was the one to rescue the captured Marine. However, Westcott's guilt made him remember the event incorrectly. Westcott then <b>feels</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> about himself now that he knows that he was never a coward.|$|R
6000|$|EVA. And I <b>feel</b> so <b>much</b> <b>better</b> that I trust I {{may be able}} by-and-by to {{help you}} in the {{business}} of the farm; but I must not be known yet. Has anyone found me out, Dora? ...|$|R
5000|$|Exploration: Tick, Jim, Michel and Amber {{head out}} to the bayou using the patrol boat. They {{encounter}} {{a house in the}} fishing camp area that they <b>feel</b> is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> habitat and easier to defend than their current location.|$|R
6000|$|My {{heart was}} touched by your regret that I hadn't given you [...] "a great deal of my news"--though my reason {{suggested}} that I could not have given you what there was not to give. [...] "La plus belle fille du monde ne peut donner que ce qu'elle a." [...] I turn out news in very small quantities--it is impossible to imagine an existence less pervaded with any sort of chiaroscuro. I am turning into an old, and very contented, Parisian: I feel as if I had struck roots into the Parisian soil, and were likely to let them grow tangled and tenacious there. It is a very comfortable and profitable place, on the whole--I mean, especially, on its general and cosmopolitan side. Of pure Parisianism I see absolutely nothing. The great merit of the place is that one can arrange one's life here exactly as one pleases--that there are facilities for every kind of habit and taste, and that everything is accepted and understood. Paris itself meanwhile {{is a sort of}} painted background which keeps shifting and changing, and which is always there, to be looked at when you please, and to be most easily and comfortably ignored when you don't. All this, if you were only here, you would <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than I can tell you--and you would write some happy piece of your prose about it which would make me feel it better, afresh. Ergo, come--when you can! I shall probably be here still. Of course every good thing is still better in spring, and in spite of much mean weather I have been liking Paris these last weeks more than ever. In fact I have accepted destiny here, under the vernal influence. If you sometimes read my poor letters in the Tribune, you get a notion of some of the things I see and do. I suppose also you get some gossip about me from Quincy St. Besides this there is not a great deal to tell. I have seen a certain number of people all winter who have helped to pass the time, but I have formed but one or two relations of permanent value, and which I desire to perpetuate. I have seen almost nothing of the literary fraternity, and there are fifty reasons why I should not become intimate with them. I don't like their wares, and they don't like any others; and besides, they are not accueillants. Turgenev is worth the whole heap of them, and yet he himself swallows them down in a manner that excites my extreme wonder. But he is the most loveable of men and takes all things easily. He is so pure and strong a genius that he doesn't need to be on the defensive as regards his opinions and enjoyments. The mistakes he may make don't hurt him. His modesty and na√Øvet√© are simply infantine. I gave him some time since the message you sent him, and he bade me to thank you very kindly and to say that he had the most agreeable memory of your two books. He has just gone to Russia to bury himself for two or three months on his estate, and try and finish a long novel he has for three or four years been working upon. I hope to heaven he may. I suspect he works little here.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{once asked}} {{his opinion of}} a poetical {{composition}} on which I had expended no little pains, he read it attentively, and then remarked 'Unless one's thought pack more neatly in verse than in prose, it is wiser to refrain. Commonplace gains nothing by being translated into rhyme, for it is something which no hocus-pocus can transubstantiate with the real presence of living thought. You entitle your piece, [...] "My Mother's Grave," [...] and expend four pages of useful paper in detailing your emotions there. But, my dear sir, watering does not {{improve the quality of}} ink, even though you should do it with tears. To publish a sorrow to Tom, Dick, and Harry is in some sort to advertise its unreality, for I have observed in my intercourse with the afflicted that the deepest grief instinctively hides its face with its hands and is silent. If your piece were printed, I have no doubt it would be popular, for people like to fancy that they <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the trouble of feeling. I would put all poets on oath whether they have striven to say everything they possibly could think of, or to leave out all they could not help saying. In your own case, my worthy young friend, what you have written is merely a deliberate exercise, the gymnastic of sentiment. For your excellent maternal relative is still alive, and is to take tea with me this evening, D.V. Beware of simulated feeling; it is hypocrisy's first cousin; it is especially dangerous to a preacher; for he who says one day, [...] "Go to, let me seem to be pathetic," [...] may be nearer than he thinks to saying, [...] "Go to, let me seem to be virtuous, or earnest, or under sorrow for sin." [...] Depend upon it, Sappho loved her verses more sincerely than she did Phaon, and Petrarch his sonnets better than Laura, who was indeed but his poetical stalking-horse. After you shall have once heard that muffled rattle of clods on the coffin-lid of an irreparable loss, you will grow acquainted with a pathos that will make all elegies hateful. When I was of your age, I also for a time mistook my desire to write verses for an authentic call of my nature in that direction. But one day as I was going forth for a walk, with my head full of an [...] "Elegy on the Death of Flirtilla," [...] and vainly groping after a rhyme for lily that should not be silly or chilly, I saw my eldest boy Homer busy over the rain-water hogshead, in that childish experiment at parthenogenesis, the changing a horse-hair into a water-snake. All immersion of six weeks showed no change in the obstinate filament. Here was a stroke of unintended sarcasm. Had I not been doing in my study precisely what my boy was doing out of doors? Had my thoughts any more chance of coming to life by being submerged in rhyme than his hair by soaking in water? I burned my elegy and took a course of Edwards on the Will. People do not make poetry; it is made out of them by a process for which I do not find myself fitted. Nevertheless, the writing of verses is a good rhetorical exercitation, as teaching us what to shun most carefully in prose. For prose bewitched is like window-glass with bubbles in it, distorting what it should show with pellucid veracity.' ...|$|E
