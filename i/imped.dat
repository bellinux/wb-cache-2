6000|$|P. Who shall decide, {{when doctors}} disagree, And soundest casuists doubt, {{like you and}} me? You hold the word, from Jove to Momus given, That man was made the {{standing}} jest of Heaven; And gold but sent to keep the fools in play, For some to heap, and some to throw away. [...] But I, who think more highly of our kind, (And surely, Heaven and I are of a mind) Opine, that Nature, as in duty bound, Deep hid the shining mischief under ground: But when by man's audacious labour won, Flamed forth this rival to its sire, the sun, Then careful Heaven supplied two sorts of men, To squander these, and those to hide again. [...] Like doctors thus, when much dispute has past, We find our tenets just the same at last. Both fairly owning Riches, in effect, No grace of Heaven or token of th' elect; Given to the fool, the mad, the vain, the evil, To Ward, to Waters, Chartres, and the devil. [...] B. What Nature wants, commodious gold bestows, 'Tis thus we eat the bread another sows. [...] P. But how unequal it bestows, observe; 'Tis thus we riot, while, who sow it, starve: What Nature wants (a phrase I much distrust) Extends to luxury, extends to lust: Useful, I grant, it serves what life requires, But, dreadful too, the dark assassin hires. [...] B. Trade it may help, society extend. [...] P. But lures the pirate, and corrupts the friend. [...] B. It raises armies in a nation's aid. [...] P. But bribes a senate, and the land's betrayed. In vain may heroes fight, and patriots rave; If secret gold sap on from knave to knave. Once, we confess, beneath the patriot's cloak, From the cracked bag the dropping guinea spoke, And jingling down the back-stairs, told the crew, [...] "Old Cato is as great a rogue as you." [...] Blest paper-credit! last and best supply! That lends corruption lighter wings to fly! Gold <b>imped</b> by thee can compass hardest things, Can pocket states, can fetch or carry kings; A single leaf shall waft an army o'er, Or ship off senates to a distant shore; A leaf, like Sibyl's, scatter to and fro Our fates and fortunes, as the winds shall blow: Pregnant with thousands flits the scrap unseen, And silent sells a king, or buys a queen. [...] Oh! that such bulky bribes as all might see, Still, as of old, encumbered villainy! Could France or Rome divert our brave designs, With all their brandies or with all their wines? What could they more than knights and squires confound, Or water all the Quorum ten miles round? A statesman's slumbers how this speech would spoil! [...] "Sir, Spain has sent a thousand jars of oil; Huge bales of British cloth blockade the door; A hundred oxen at your levee roar." [...] Poor Avarice one torment more would find; Nor could Profusion squander all in kind. Astride his cheese Sir Morgan might we meet; And Worldly crying coals from street to street, Whom with a wig so wild, and mien so mazed, Pity mistakes for some poor tradesman crazed. Had Colepepper's whole wealth been hops and hogs, Could he himself have sent it to the dogs? His Grace will game: to White's a bull be led, With spurning heels and with a butting head. To White's be carried, as to ancient games, Fair coursers, vases, and alluring dames. Shall then Uxorio, if the stakes he sweep, Bear home six w****s, and make his lady weep? Or soft Adonis, so perfumed and fine, Drive to St. James's a whole herd of swine? Oh, filthy cheek on all industrious skill, To spoil the nation's last great trade, Quadrille! Since then, my lord, on such a world we fall, What say you? B. Say? Why, take it, gold and all. [...] P. What Riches give us let us then inquire: Meat, fire, and clothes. B. What more? P. Meat, clothes, and fire. Is this too little? would you more than live? Alas! 'tis more than Turner finds they give. Alas! 'tis more than (all his visions past) Unhappy Wharton, waking, found at last! What can they give? to dying Hopkins, heirs; To Chartres, vigour; Japhet, nose and ears? Can they in gems bid pallid Hippia glow, In Fulvia's buckle ease the throbs below; Or heal, old Narses, thy obscener ail, With all th' embroid'ry plastered at thy tail? They might (were Harpax not too wise to spend) Give Harpax' self the blessing of a friend; Or find some doctor that would save the life Of wretched Shylock, spite of Shylock's wife: But thousands die, without or this or that, Die, and endow a college, or a cat. To some, indeed, Heaven grants the happier fate, T' enrich a bastard, or a son they hate. [...] Perhaps you think the poor might have their part? Bond damns the poor, and hates them from his heart: The grave Sir Gilbert holds it for a rule, That [...] "every man in want is knave or fool:" [...] "God cannot love," [...] says Blunt, with tearless eyes, [...] "The wretch He starves"--and piously denies: But the good bishop, with a meeker air, Admits, and leaves them--Providence's care. [...] Yet, to be just to these poor men of pelf, Each does but hate his neighbour as himself: Damned to the mines, an equal fate betides The slave that digs it, and the slave that hides. [...] B. Who suffer thus, mere charity should own, Must act on motives powerful, though unknown. [...] P. Some war, some plague, or famine they foresee, Some revelation hid from you and me. Why Shylock wants a meal, the cause is found-- He thinks a loaf will rise to fifty pound. What made directors cheat in South-Sea year? To live on venison when it sold so dear. Ask you why Phryne the whole auction buys? Phryne foresees a general excise. Why she and Sappho raise that monstrous sum? Alas! they fear a man will cost a plum. [...] Wise Peter sees the world's respect for gold, And therefore hopes this nation may be sold: Glorious ambition! Peter, swell thy store, And be what Rome's great Didius was before. [...] The crown of Poland, venal twice an age, To just three millions stinted modest Gage. But nobler scenes Maria's dreams unfold, Hereditary realms, and worlds of gold. Congenial souls! whose life one av'rice joins, And one fate buries in th' Asturian mines. [...] Much injured Blunt! why bears he Britain's hate? A wizard told him in these words our fate: [...] "At length corruption, like a gen'ral flood (So long by watchful Ministers withstood), Shall deluge all; and av'rice, creeping on, Spread like a low-born mist, and blot the sun; Statesman and patriot ply alike the stocks, Peeress and butler share alike the box, And judges job, and bishops bite the town, And mighty dukes pack cards for half-a-crown. See Britain sunk in Lucre's sordid charms, And France revenged of Anne's and Edward's arms!" [...] 'Twas no Court-badge, great Scriv'ner! fired thy brain, Nor lordly luxury, nor City gain: No, 'twas thy righteous end, ashamed to see Senates degen'rate, patriots disagree, And, nobly wishing party-rage to cease, To buy both sides, and give thy country peace. [...] "All this is madness," [...] cries a sober sage: But who, my friend, has reason in his rage? [...] "The ruling passion, be it what it will, The ruling passion conquers reason still." [...] Less mad the wildest whimsey we can frame, Than even that passion, if it has no aim; For though such motives folly you may call, The folly's greater to have none at all. [...] Hear then the truth: [...] "'Tis Heaven each passion sends, And different men directs to different ends. Extremes in nature equal good produce, Extremes in man concur to gen'ral use." [...] Ask we what makes one keep, and one bestow? That POWER who bids the ocean ebb and flow, Bids seed-time, harvest, equal course maintain, Through reconciled extremes of drought and rain, Builds life on death, on change duration founds, And gives th' eternal wheels to know their rounds. [...] Riches, like insects, when concealed they lie, Wait but for wings, and in their season fly. Who sees pale Mammon pine amidst his store, Sees but a backward steward for the poor; This year a reservoir, to keep and spare; The next, a fountain, spouting through his heir, In lavish streams to quench a country's thirst, And men and dogs shall drink him till they burst. [...] Old Cotta shamed his fortune and his birth, Yet was not Cotta void of wit or worth: What though (the use of barbarous spits forgot) His kitchen vied in coolness with his grot? His court with nettles, moats with cresses stored, With soups unbought and salads blessed his board? If Cotta lived on pulse, it was no more Than Brahmins, saints, and sages did before; To cram the rich was prodigal expense, And who would take the poor from Providence? Like some lone Chartreux stands the good old hall, Silence without, and fasts within the wall; No raftered roofs with dance and tabor sound, No noontide bell invites the country round; Tenants with sighs the smokeless towers survey, And turn th' unwilling steeds another way; Benighted wanderers, the forest o'er, Curse the saved candle and unopening door; While the gaunt mastiff growling at the gate, Affrights the beggar whom he longs to eat. [...] Not so his son; he marked this oversight, And then mistook reverse of wrong for right. (For what to shun will no great knowledge need; But what to follow is a task indeed.) Yet sure, of qualities deserving praise, More go to ruin fortunes, than to raise. What slaughtered hecatombs, what floods of wine, Fill the capacious squire, and deep divine! Yet no mean motive this profusion draws; His oxen perish in his country's cause; 'Tis George and Liberty that crowns the cup, And zeal for that great house which eats him up. The woods recede around the naked seat; The sylvans groan--no matter--for the fleet; Next goes his wool--to clothe our valiant bands; Last, for his country's love, he sells his lands. To town he comes, completes the nation's hope, And heads the bold train-bands, and burns a Pope. And shall not Britain now reward his toils, Britain, that pays her patriots with her spoils? In vain at Court the bankrupt pleads his cause, His thankless country leaves him to her laws. [...] The sense to value riches, with the art T' enjoy them, and the virtue to impart, Not meanly, nor ambitiously pursued, Not sunk by sloth, nor raised by servitude; To balance fortune by a just expense, Join with economy, magnificence; With splendour, charity; with plenty, health; O teach us, Bathurst! yet unspoiled by wealth! That secret rare, between the extremes to move Of mad good-nature, and of mean self-love. [...] B. To worth or want well weighed, be bounty given, And ease, or emulate, the care of Heaven (Whose measure full o'erflows on human race); Mend Fortune's fault, and justify her grace. Wealth in the gross is death, but life diffused; As poison heals, in just proportion used: In heaps, like ambergrise, a stink it lies, But well dispersed, is incense to the skies. [...] P. Who starves by nobles, or with nobles eats? The wretch that trusts them, and the rogue that cheats. Is there a lord who knows a cheerful noon Without a fiddler, flatterer, or buffoon? Whose table, wit or modest merit share, Unelbowed by a gamester, pimp, or play'r? Who copies yours or Oxford's better part, To ease the oppressed, and raise the sinking heart? Where'er he shines, O Fortune, gild the scene, And angels guard him in the golden mean! There, English bounty yet awhile may stand, And Honour linger ere it leaves the land. [...] But all our praises why should lords engross? Rise, honest Muse! and sing the Man of Ross: Pleased Vaga echoes through her winding bounds, And rapid Severn hoarse applause resounds. Who hung with woods you mountain's sultry brow? From the dry rock who bade the waters flow? Not to the skies in useless columns tost, Or in proud falls magnificently lost, But clear and artless, pouring through the plain Health to the sick, and solace to the swain. Whose causeway parts the vale with shady rows? Whose seats the weary traveller repose? Who taught that heaven-directed spire to rise? [...] "The Man of Ross," [...] each lisping babe replies. Behold the market-place with poor o'erspread! The Man of Ross divides the weekly bread; He feeds yon almshouse, neat, but void of state, Where age and want sit smiling at the gate; Him portioned maids, apprenticed orphans blest, The young who labour, and the old who rest. Is any sick? the Man of Ross relieves, Prescribes, attends, the medicine makes, and gives. Is there a variance? enter but his door, Baulked are the courts, and contest is no more. Despairing quacks with curses fled the place, And vile attorneys, now a useless race. [...] B. Thrice happy man! enabled to pursue What all so wish, but want the power to do! Oh say, what sums that generous hand supply? What mines, to swell that boundless charity? [...] P. Of debts, and taxes, wife and children clear, This man possest--five hundred pounds a year. Blush, grandeur, blush! proud courts, withdraw your blaze! Ye little stars, hide your diminished rays! [...] B. And what? no monument, inscription, stone? His race, his form, his name almost unknown? [...] P. Who builds a church to God, and not to Fame, Will never mark the marble with his name; Go, search it there, where to be born and die, Of rich and poor makes all the history; Enough, that virtue filled the space between; Proved, by the ends of being, to have been. When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend The wretch, who living saved a candle's end: Shouldering God's altar a vile image stands, Belies his features, nay, extends his hands; That livelong wig, which Gorgon's self might own, Eternal buckle takes in Parian stone. Behold what blessings wealth to life can lend! And see what comfort it affords our end. [...] In the worst inn's worst room, with mat half-hung, The floors of plaster, and the walls of dung, On once a flock-bed, but repaired with straw, With tape-tied curtains, never meant to draw, The George and Garter dangling from that bed Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red, Great Villiers lies--alas! how changed from him, That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim!-- Gallant and gay, in Cliveden's proud alcove, The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love; Or just as gay, at council, in a ring Of mimic'd statesmen and their merry king. No wit to flatter left of all his store! No fool to laugh at, which he valued more. There, victor of his health, of fortune, friends, And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends. [...] His grace's fate sage Cutler could foresee, And well (he thought) advised him, [...] "Live like me." [...] As well his grace replied, [...] "Like you, Sir John? That I can do, when all I have is gone." [...] Resolve me, Reason, which of these is worse, Want with a full, or with an empty purse? Thy life more wretched, Cutler, was confessed, Arise, and tell me, was thy death more blessed? Cutler saw tenants break, and houses fall, For very want; he could not build a wall. His only daughter in a stranger's power, For very want; he could not pay a dower. A few grey hairs his reverend temples crowned, 'Twas very want that sold them for two pound. What even denied a cordial at his end, Banished the doctor, and expelled the friend? What but a want, which you perhaps think mad, Yet numbers feel the want of what he had! Cutler and Brutus, dying, both exclaim, [...] "Virtue! and wealth! what are ye but a name!" [...] Say, for such worth are other worlds prepared? Or are they both in this their own reward? A knotty point! to which we now proceed. But you are tired--I'll tell a tale. [...] B. Agreed. [...] P. Where London's column, pointing at the skies, Like a tall bully, lifts the head, and lies; There dwelt a citizen of sober fame, A plain good man, and Balaam was his name; Religious, punctual, frugal, and so forth; His word would pass for more than he was worth. One solid dish his week-day meal affords, An added pudding solemnised the Lord's; Constant at church, and Change; his gains were sure, His givings rare, save farthings to the poor. The devil was piqued such saintship to behold, And longed to tempt him like good Job of old: But Satan now is wiser than of yore, And tempts by making rich, not making poor. [...] Roused by the prince of Air, the whirlwinds sweep The surge, and plunge his father in the deep; Then full against his Cornish lands they roar, And two rich shipwrecks bless the lucky shore. [...] Sir Balaam now, he lives like other folks, He takes his chirping pint, and cracks his jokes; [...] "Live like yourself," [...] was soon my lady's word; And lo! two puddings smoked upon the board. [...] Asleep and naked as an Indian lay, An honest factor stole a gem away: He pledged it to the knight; the knight had wit, So kept the diamond, and the rogue was bit. Some scruple rose, but thus he eased his thought, [...] "I'll now give sixpence where I gave a groat; Where once I went to church, I'll now go twice-- And am so clear, too, of all other vice." [...] The Tempter saw his time; the work he plied; Stocks and subscriptions pour on every side, 'Till all the demon makes his full descent In one abundant shower of cent. per cent., Sinks deep within him, and possesses whole, Then dubs director, and secures his soul. [...] Behold Sir Balaam, now a man of spirit, Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit; What late he called a blessing, now was wit, And God's good Providence, a lucky hit. Things change their titles, as our manners turn; His counting-house employed the Sunday morn; Seldom at church ('twas such a busy life), But duly sent his family and wife. There (so the devil ordained) one Christmas tide My good old lady catched a cold and died. [...] A nymph of quality admires our knight; He marries, bows at court, and grows polite: Leaves the dull cits, and joins (to please the fair) The well bred c*ck**ds in St. James's air; First, for his son a gay commission buys, Who drinks and fights, and in a duel dies; His daughter flaunts a viscount's tawdry wife; She bears a coronet and ---- for life. In Britain's senate he a seat obtains, And one more pensioner St. Stephen gains. My lady falls to play; so bad her chance, He must repair it; takes a bribe from France; The House impeach him; Coningsby harangues; The Court forsake him, and Sir Balaam hangs; Wife, son, and daughter, Satan! are thine own, His wealth, yet dearer, forfeit to the Crown: The Devil and the King divide the prize, And sad Sir Balaam curses God and dies.|$|E

In testis, <b>IMP</b> 1 and <b>IMP</b> 3 were found mainly in the spermatogonia, whereas <b>IMP</b> 2 was expressed in the immature Leydig cells. Moreover, all three <b>IMPs</b> were detected in human semen.

The cationic complexes are significantly more effective than analogous neutral complexes. The cationic iridium complex 8 b, containing the phosphine-imidazolyl ligand with the bulky isopropyl groups on the phosphorus donor, is more efficient than analogous complexes with the phenyl substituents on the phosphorus donor atom, 7 and 8 a.

40|$|Background Intramuscular {{pressure}} (<b>IMP)</b> {{is measured}} in studies of tissue nutrition and in the diagnosis of compartment syndromes. Patients with compartment syndromes have an elevated <b>IMP</b> due to increased volume in a muscle compartment. In patients with exercise-induced leg pain, the measurement of <b>IMP</b> is commonly regarded as the gold standard in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome (CACS). However, recent studies have reported that <b>IMP</b> as a parameter in diagnosing CACS needs to be improved. Oscillations of the <b>IMP</b> deriving from arterial pulsations have previously been detected in muscles with abnormally elevated <b>IMP.</b> The relationship between the amplitude of the <b>IMP</b> oscillations and the absolute <b>IMP</b> is, however, unknown. Aims The aims of the thesis were therefore to investigate {{the relationship between the}} <b>IMP</b> and the amplitude of the pulse-synchronous <b>IMP</b> oscillations and to evaluate the potential of using pulse-synchronous <b>IMP</b> oscillations in diagnosing compartment syndromes. Methods Pulse-synchronous <b>IMP</b> oscillations were studied at normal levels of <b>IMP</b> at rest, during experimental models of abnormally elevated <b>IMP</b> and at rest after exercise. The amplitude of the oscillations was measured in healthy subjects, patients with CACS and in patients with leg pain for reasons other than CACS. Results The amplitude of the <b>IMP</b> oscillations was higher for the CACS patients compared with the control subjects and patients with leg pain for reasons other than CACS. During simulated compartment syndrome, the oscillations were observed in the entire <b>IMP</b> range seen in patients with chronic and acute compartment syndromes. The amplitude of the <b>IMP</b> oscillations varied with the absolute level of the <b>IMP.</b> The largest amplitudes were recorded when the level of the <b>IMP</b> was close {{to the level of the}} mean arterial pressure and the local perfusion pressure approached zero. The amplitude of the oscillations is a parameter with high sensitivity and specificity that may lend support when diagnosing CACS. Among the CACS patients, women had an 11 mmHg lower <b>IMP</b> at rest after exercise compared with men (p 0. 5). The fluid injections used with traditional needle-injection techniques influences the measured <b>IMP.</b> Even small amounts of saline constitute a measurement problem, rendering an overestimated <b>IMP</b> reading. Fiberoptic pressure-measurement techniques may therefore improve <b>IMP</b> measurements. Conclusion The amplitude of the pulse-synchronous <b>IMP</b> oscillations reflects the <b>IMP</b> and the pathophysiological foundation in compartment syndromes. The patency of the catheter and the validity of the <b>IMP</b> measurement is assured when pulse-synchronous <b>IMP</b> oscillations are recorded. The amplitude has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying CACS patients. It may be an additional parameter in both research and diagnosing compartment syndromes...|$|R

However, the role of <b>IMP</b> 3 in RCC progression was poorly understood. We aim to uncover the mechanism of <b>IMP</b> 3 in regulating clear cell RCC (CCRCC) progression and validate the prognostic significance of <b>IMP</b> 3 in localized CCRCC. Caki- 1 cells stably overexpressing <b>IMP</b> 3 and Achn cells with knockdown of <b>IMP</b> 3 were analyzed for cell migration and invasion by Transwell assay. RNA-seq was used to profile gene expression in <b>IMP</b> 3 -expressing Caki- 1 cells. A cohort of 469 localized CCRCC patients were examined for <b>IMP</b> 3 expression by immunohistochemistry using tumor tissue array. <b>IMP</b> 3 promoted Caki- 1 cell migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of <b>IMP</b> 3 by RNAi inhibited Achn cell migration and invasion. Enhanced <b>IMP</b> 3 expression activated NF-кB pathway and through which, it functioned in promoting the RCC cell migration. <b>IMP</b> 3 expression in localized CCRCC {{was found to be}} associated with higher nuclear grade, higher T stage, necrosis and sarcomatoid differentiation (p< 0. 001).

40|$|For a {{mechanical}} heart valve, a strong spike in pressure during closing {{is associated with}} valve wear and erythrocyte damage; thus, for valid in vitro testing, the mock circulation system should replicate the conditions, including pressure spikes, expected in vivo. To address this issue, a study was performed to investigate how mock circulation input imped-ance affects valve closure dynamics. A left ventricular model with polyurethane trileaflet inflow valve and tilting disc out-flow valve was connected to a Louisville mock circulation system, which incorporates 2 adjustable flow resistors and 2 compliances. In the study, 116 cases matched zero frequency modulus well (982 – 1147 dyn s/cm 5), but higher harmonics were purposely varied.

40|$|SummaryThe <b>IMP</b> 3 RNA-binding {{protein is}} {{associated}} with metastasis and poor outcome in human cancer. Using solid cancer transcriptome data, we found that <b>IMP</b> 3 correlates with HMGA 2 mRNA expression. Cytoplasmic <b>IMP</b> 3 granules contain HMGA 2, and <b>IMP</b> 3 dose-dependently increases HMGA 2 mRNA. HMGA 2 is regulated by let- 7, and let- 7 antagomiRs make HMGA 2 refractory to <b>IMP</b> 3. Removal of let- 7 target sites eliminates <b>IMP</b> 3 -dependent stabilization, and <b>IMP</b> 3 -containing bodies are depleted of Ago 1 - 4 and miRNAs.  The relationship between Hmga 2 mRNA and <b>IMPs</b> also exists in the developing limb bud, where <b>IMP</b> 1 -deficient embryos show dose-dependent Hmga 2 mRNA downregulation. Finally, <b>IMP</b> 3 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) contain other let- 7 target mRNAs, including LIN 28 B, and a global gene set enrichment analysis demonstrates that miRNA-regulated transcripts in general are upregulated following <b>IMP</b> 3 induction.

40|$|Abstract: Access {{to nuclear}} genes in eukaryotes is {{provided}} {{by members of the}} importin (<b>IMP)</b> superfamily of proteins, which are of - or -types, the best understood nuclear import pathway being mediated by a heterodimer of an <b>IMP</b> and <b>IMP</b> 1. <b>IMP</b> recognises specific targeting signals on cargo proteins, while <b>IMP</b> 1 mediates passage into, and release within, the nucleus by interacting with other components of the transport machinery, including the monomeric guanine nucleotide binding protein Ran. In this manner, hundreds of different proteins can be targeted specifically into the nucleus in a tightly regulated fashion. The <b>IMP</b> gene family has expanded during evolution, with only a single <b>IMP</b> (Srp 1 p) gene in budding yeast, and three (<b>IMP</b> 1, 2 /pendulin and 3) and five (<b>IMP</b> 1,- 2,- 3,- 4 and- 6) <b>IMP</b> genes in Droso-phila melanogaster and mouse respectively, which fall into three phylogenetically distinct groups.

This review describes what is known of the <b>IMP</b> gene family in mouse and in D. melanogaster, including a comparitive examination of their mRNA expression profiles in a highly differ-entiated tissue, the testis.

40|$|Background: Renal {{accumulation}} of reactive carbonyl compounds (RCCs) {{has been linked}} to the progression of diabetic nephropathy. We previously demonstrated that carbonyl stress induces the formation of amino-carbonyl cross-links and sharply increases the content of b-sheet-rich structures, which is the seed of insoluble aggregates formation, and tea catechin (-) -epigallocatechin 3 -gallate (EGCG) can reverse this process in vitro and in vivo. In this study, methylated derivative (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -O-(3 -O-methyl) -gallate (EGCG 3 ’’Me) was hypothesized to neutralize carbonyl stress mediating the formation of insoluble ubiquitinated protein (IUP) aggregates, and reduce the early development of diabetic nephropathy. Methods and results: Diabetes was induced in mice by intraperitoneally injecting alloxan monohydrate (200 mg/kg/d) twice and administering EGCG 3 ’’Me by gavage for 15 d. Reagent case and western blot results showed that, in diabetic kidneys, the carbonyl proteins in the serum increased; and in insoluble protein fraction, 4 -hydroxynonenal-modified proteins, IUP aggregates and p 62 accumulated; FT-IR study demonstrated that the lipid content, anti-parallel b-sheet structure and aggregates increased. EGCG 3 ’’Me treatment could effectively reverse this process, even better than the negative control treatment. Conclusions: EGCG 3 ’’Me exhibiting anti-b-sheet-rich IUP aggregate properties, maybe represents a new strategy to <b>imped...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{computer-based}} algorithm that localizes {{sounds in}} near-real {{time has been}} developed. The algorithm takes input from two microphones and estimates {{the position of the}} sound source relative to the microphone array. The algorithm requires no a priori knowledge of the stimuli to be localized. The accuracy of the algorithm was tested using binaural recordings from a pair of microphones mounted in the ear canals of an acoustic mannequin. Sounds were played at 5 degree steps around the mannequin and the outputs were recorded at the entrance to each ear canal. These recordings were fed into the algorithm that estimated the location of the incoming sound on the horizontal plane. The algorithm utilizes a Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) to estimate the location of incoming sound stimuli. Although the HRTF of the acoustic mannequin was used, any HRTF can be inserted into the algorithm, allowing for predictions about individual performance differences. The results of this effort have been highly encouraging: the algorithm was able to identify accurately the location of a variety of sounds, committing an average of 2. 9 degrees of unsigned localization error. Better than chance performance was found in noisy conditions of up to a- 10 dB signal-tonoise ratio. The initial purpose of this algorithm is to predict the localization performance afforded by different types of combat helmets.

40|$|This {{presentation}} will outline {{a research}} project focused on learning and teaching in Australian Indigenous Studies. Indigenous Studies as an exciting, emerging discipline holds considerable promise for university educators interested in learning and teaching. The discussion in Indigenous Studies pedagogy to date has largely focused on curriculum and content, with {{a growing body of}} literature for example, related to the inclusion of Indigenous Knowledges (Thaman, 2003). However there is less written about or empirical work related to, how students learn or indeed don’t learn, in Indigenous Studies. This is important because in Australia there continues to be a significant gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous health and socioeconomic outcomes and much of the work to enhance outcomes is done collaboratively with non-Indigenous professionals. As we continue today to seek to ‘close the gap ’ between outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, more than 200 years post colonisation, our university graduates will need to develop deeper understandings of this complex colonial legacy than their predecessors (Behrendt, Larkin, Griew & Kelly, 2012).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of water and environmental laws on informal irrigation farming in Zimbabwe and Tanzania. It explores how legal frameworks in Zimbabwe and Tanzania have for years hindered the development of community-based management of water for informal irrigation purposes. This is illustrated in the article by {{a detailed analysis of}} water and the environmental legislations of Zimbabwe and Tanzania. The actor-oriented approach theoretical framework guides the analysis of the data presented in this article. The case studies of Zimbabwe and Tanzania serve to illustrate that legislation in the Southern African region has yet to reach a point where it promotes sound community-based management of water for informal irrigation farming. It is also not clear how new water acts, such as the one introduced in Zimbabwe in 1998, will promote community-based management of water among informal irrigators. Given this scenario of legislation that does not promote community based management of water by informal irrigators, the participants in this economic activity have resorted to ignoring legal provisions and have, in most cases, developed their own local rules and regulations that govern management of water resources in their localities. This article contends that it is time governments in Southern Africa accepted informal irrigation and enacted laws that encourage the sustainable management of water by the local communities.
