5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Nathaniel Cary, {{the second}} pathologist, {{objected to the}} CPS's decision. Cary told The Guardian that the push had caused a {{haemorrhage}} to Tomlinson's abdomen, and the haemorrhage caused him to collapse. Cary said Tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease. The CPS had erred in dismissing a charge of actual bodily harm (ABH), in his view. In a letter to Tomlinson's family, the CPS described Tomlinson's injuries as [...] "relatively minor" [...] and therefore insufficient to support such a charge. But Cary told The Guardian: [...] "The injuries were not relatively minor. He sustained quite a large area of bruising. Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike, which could amount to ABH. It's extraordinary. If that's not ABH <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Closing {{arguments}} {{were made on}} November 4, 2005. Upon completion of the closing arguments, Gillen asked Jones, [...] "By my reckoning, this is the 40th day since the trial began and tonight will be the 40th night, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if you did that on purpose." [...] (40 days and nights was {{the length of the}} Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design." [...] This humorous exchange provided the title for Matthew Chapman's book about the trial, 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{results of}} the operation were disastrous for {{the image of the}} Air Corps. Speaker of the House Henry T. Rainey, echoing comments made by Gen. Billy Mitchell, criticized: [...] "If we are unfortunate enough to be drawn into another war, the Air Corps wouldn’t amount to much. If it is not equal to carrying the mail, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what it would do in carrying bombs." [...] Despite the public humiliation, the Air Mail Fiasco resulted in a number of improvements for the Air Corps, bringing about changes that its previous publicity campaigns were unable to obtain.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E
