40|$|The new European car-to-pedestrian impact safety {{protection}} regulation has prompted many research efforts in this area. For knee and lower leg protection, the current regulation requires using a legform {{that consists of}} 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) for injury assessment. It mimics the shear and bending about the knee joint when the lateral side of a pedestrian is impacted by a vehicle. However, in a smaller portion, non-lateral impact accidents also exist in the real world. Moreover, even in a purely lateral impact, once the legform contacts with the bumper, it could rotate towards the other directions due to the curvatures of the bumper shape and the deformation of the bumper foam, causing the legform taking load from other directions. For assessing injuries under omni-direction impact, a concept design of a 4 -DOF pedestrian legform is developed. The two added DOFs represent the natural human knee rotation and the shear {{with respect to the}} knee joint when a pedestrian is impacted from the front or the back. The bio-mechanical requirements of the 4 -DOF legform are adopted from the existing 2 -DOF pedestrian legform and the Hybrid III <b>dummy</b> <b>knee.</b> The challenge is to design all the 4 -DOF mechanisms, including the motion and stiffness mechanisms, in a limited space of the legform. Design methodology is also documented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an optimized method for measuring <b>dummy’s</b> <b>knee</b> displacement in vehicle sled crash test. The proposed method utilizes completely new elements for measurement, which are acceleration and angular velocity of dummy’s pelvis, {{as well as}} the rotational angle of its femur. Compared with the traditional measurement only using camera-based high-speed motion image analysis, the optimized one can not only maintain the measuring accuracy, but also avoid the disturbance caused by dummy movement, dashboard blocking and knee deformation during the crash. An experiment is made to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, which eliminates the strong dependence on single target tracing in traditional method. Moreover, it is very appropriate for calculating the penetration depth to the dashboard...|$|R
50|$|Paul WinchellAs author Kelly Asbury points out, “Paul Winchell {{really was}} {{determined}} to get the <b>dummy</b> off his <b>knees.</b> He knew {{if he wanted to}} set himself apart from what people usually associated with ventriloquists, the little wooden dummy on a ventriloquist’s knee, he had to change something.” As illustrated through numerous clips, Paul Winchell’ s puppets were extremely animated, changing forever the possibilities for puppet manipulation. Clips from Paul various television shows and his appearance on The Ed Sullivan show are used throughout the segment.|$|R

The band were again on stage as live musicians. The songs were composed by Boff Whalley {{and the band}} specifically for the show, except for the traditional song 'It's the same the whole world over'. The company cast well known comedian Phill Jupitus alongside actors Dean Nolan, Harry Hamer (former band member), Kyler Goodie and Lisa Howard. It played for two weeks at Leeds City Varieties the venue where Chumbawamba would later play their final Going, Going gig. Set in a struggling Victorian music hall the show made specific parallels to David Cameron's 'big Society' and Tory government in its 'front of cloth variety' scenes. Notably in the opening number [...] "Who's running the show?" [...] and a later scene where 'little Nick' {{is presented as a}} ventriloquists <b>dummy</b> on David's <b>knee.</b>|$|R
