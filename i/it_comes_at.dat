25|$|Justice Loh {{also created}} a buzz in legal circles by departing from the {{inherent}} tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, {{even though he had}} defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a time when the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{literature}} suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do {{not contribute to the}} public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.|$|E
500|$|During the {{subsequent}} flight-test programme, the Su-37's [...] "supermaneuverability" [...] {{as a result}} of thrust-vectoring controls became apparent. According to Simonov, such a feature would allow pilots to develop new combat manoeuvres and tactics, greatly enhancing its effectiveness in dogfights. Among the new manoeuvres was the [...] "Super Cobra", which was demonstrated during the aircraft's international debut at the Farnborough Airshow in September that year. Piloted by Frolov, the aircraft pitched up to 180degrees and maintained the tail-first position for several seconds, which would theoretically allow the aircraft in combat to fire a missile at its opponent. The Super Cobra evolved into the kulbit (somersault), in which the Su-37 performed a 360-degree loop with an extremely tight turning radius the length of the aircraft. According to test pilot Anatoly Kvochur, thrust vectoring would give the aircraft a considerable advantage in close-in dogfights. However, critics have questioned the practical benefits of such manoeuvres; although they would allow a fighter pilot to out-manoeuvre their opponent and enable an early missile lock-on, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> the expense of a rapid loss of kinetic energy, which would leave the aircraft vulnerable in case the pilot misses their first shot.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} publicity about the coming-out of a character, [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was discussed {{a lot in the}} media before its airing because of its gay marriage theme. The entertainment website MovieWeb predicted in October 2004 that the episode would become controversial when it aired because of the large children audience and [...] "also because <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a time when many states are seeking to ban same-sex wedding ceremonies." [...] According to Knight Ridder, [...] "some conservative groups [...] growled in advance over the episode", but most pre-broadcast publicity was directed at the outing. Mark Pinsky, on the other hand, wrote in his book The Gospel According to The Simpsons that when the announcement that an episode of the show would focus on gay marriage was made, [...] "it stoked a debate that few issues and few television shows could." [...] Before its original airing, Pinsky was interviewed about the episode on ABC's World News Tonight, CNN, BBC Radio, and more, as {{the author of a book}} on religion in The Simpsons.|$|E

[...] According to Lark Anderson of GameSpot, [...] "Shattered Memories is a fantastic return to the core concept of personal fear, and though its developers made some unorthodox decisions—such as removing combat entirely—those decisions have paid off handsomely." [...] Nintendo Power called it audacious and compelling. In a retrospective feature, Nintendo World Report's Jonathan Metts generally agreed with Gamespot, stating that the installment [...] "is a noble and arguably successful attempt to revive and reform the survival horror genre. While perhaps not scary, it is genuinely disturbing, shocking, and always interesting." [...] According to Leigh Alexander of The A.V. Club, the innovation and uniqueness of the installment made it capable of standing alone from the Silent Hill series, without having to use the series' reputation or name to attract players. Conversely, Game Informers Tim Turi considered the frustrating controls and dull pacing to be major flaws, and wrote, [...] "If you’re a Silent Hill fan interested in a fresh take on the stale formula, this Wii entry may be the Cheryl you’ve been searching for—but <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a cost." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{reviews for}} Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release, {{particularly}} from mainstream media, but {{some critics have}} stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue, the album's predecessor. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times, in review of the album, wrote: [...] "To listeners {{on either side of}} rock's latest generational divide, there's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds suspiciously like Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a price [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album would be the perfect teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise." [...] Cowen concluded that the album [...] "is a substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure. It's really not worth the money in your wallet [...] even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain." [...] Now magazine claimed that the band [...] "may be in the right place, it's clear they're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus." ...|$|E

2500|$|In particle-based (sometimes called [...] "agent-based") simulations, proteins, nucleic acids, {{macromolecular}} complexes {{or small}} molecules are represented as individual software objects, and their progress is tracked {{through the course}} of the entire simulation. Because particle-based rule evaluation keeps track of individual particles rather than populations, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a higher computational cost when modeling systems with a high total number of particles, but a small number of kinds (or pools) of particles. In cases of combinatorial complexity, however, the modeling of individual particles is an advantage because, at any given point in the simulation, only existing molecules, their states and the reactions they can undergo need to be considered. Particle-based rule evaluation does not require the generation of complete or partial reaction networks {{at the start of the}} simulation or at any other point in the simulation and is therefore called [...] "network-free".|$|E
