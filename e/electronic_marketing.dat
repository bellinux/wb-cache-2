Supply chain management is another key component of the strategy as being adopted by an increasing number of companies. There are many interactions between <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> and supply chain. One of the key questions is to select one type of <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> from the view of supply chain. This paper develops some models to explore the issue of selection between public <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> and private <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> in three scenarios where <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> is used for buying, for selling, and for both selling and buying, respectively. In a public <b>electronic</b> <b>market,</b> neither the supplier nor the retailer is the owner of the <b>electronic</b> <b>market.</b> However, in a private <b>electronic</b> <b>market,</b> there is an owner that is either the supplier or the retailer. Besides demand uncertainty, we take into account the price uncertainty in <b>electronic</b> <b>market.</b> We explore the conditions under which the agent of supply chain selects one certain type of <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> by comparing expected profits of supply chain members in different scenarios. Some sensitivity analyses are conducted to explore the impact of the customer demand, <b>electronic</b> <b>market</b> retail price, and e-market use fee on the selection of <b>electronic</b> <b>market.</b> Finally, some interesting managerial and academic insights are obtained...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>markets</b> {{have been}} a {{prominent}} topic of research for the past decade. Moreover, {{we have seen the}} rise but also the disappearance of many electronic marketplaces in practice. Today, <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> are a firm component of inter-organisational exchanges and can be observed in many branches. The Research Symposium on Emerging <b>Electronic</b> <b>Markets</b> is an annual conference bringing together researchers working on various topics concerning <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> in research and practice. The focus theme of the 13 th Research Symposium on Emerging <b>Electronic</b> <b>Markets</b> (RSEEM 2006) was ?Evolution in <b>Electronic</b> <b>Markets?.</b> Looking back at more than 10 years of research activities in <b>electronic</b> <b>markets,</b> the evolution can be well observed. While electronic commerce activities were based largely on catalogue-based shopping, there are now many examples that go beyond pure catalogues. For example, dynamic and flexible electronic transactions such as electronic negotiations and electronic auctions are enabled. Negotiations and auctions are the basis for inter-organisational trade exchanges about services as well as products. Mass customisation opens up new opportunities for <b>electronic</b> <b>markets.</b> Multichannel <b>electronic</b> commerce represents today?s various requirements posed on information and communication technology as well as on organisational structures. In recent years, service-oriented architectures of <b>electronic</b> <b>markets</b> have enabled ICT infrastructures for supporting flexible e-commerce and e-market solutions. RSEEM 2006 was held at the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany in September 2006. The proceedings show a variety of approaches and include the selected 8 research papers.

The 60-day structure of this program is vital in limiting marketer inconvenience, but comprehensive enough to provide a thorough review. The success of the program lies in the voluntary participation by direct response marketers {{and the nature of}} the self-regulatory format.
