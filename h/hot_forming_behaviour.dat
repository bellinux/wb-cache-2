40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of multiscale modelling approaches for predicting the microstructural evolution and high temperature deformation characteristics of superalloys with special attention to creep and <b>hot</b> <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A microstructure informed deformation model is presented that links rearrangements at the microscale to the overall macroscopic response of the material through a damage mechanics approach and results are presented on the application of the model to CMSX 4. The control of microstructure, during the manufacture of nickel based superalloy components, is key {{to the development of the}} mechanical properties required for the high temperature applications typical of these materials. Results from empirical methods and a new physics based approach for modelling recrystallisation in polycrystalline superalloys are presented for the prediction of the grain size distributions produced during hot forming operations in Inconel alloy 718. A global macroscale modelling approach based on Neural Networks has been developed which includes the effects of composition, heat treatment and processing route and the effectiveness of the model for both property prediction and interpolation is demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{oxidation}} and decarburization during {{heat treatment}} prior to hot stamping, various coating products {{have been developed}} in the last decades. Press-Hardened Steel (PHS) components for passenger cars are generally coated by aluminized or galvanized (GI) coatings. The aluminized coating presents a good formability at high temperature and permits forming and quenching components in the same press tools with a so called direct hot stamping method. Due to a strong cracking in the base material during direct hot stamping induced by liquid-metal embrittlement (LME), galvanized coated products must be pre-formed at low temperature and undergo heat treatment in separate press units. Moreover, the oxide scale formed on GI parts must be removed by abrasive blasting, whereas aluminized parts can be directly painted after hot forming. However, higher performance in corrosion resistance has been observed for galvanized parts, in particular in cosmetic and cut-edge corrosion. This increase {{is linked to the}} sacrificial effect or cathodic protection provided by the layer containing zinc. Daimler AG is investigating the possibility of improving performance of PHS body parts in terms of suitability for direct hot stamping and corrosion protection by developing new coating materials. In the following article, the main particularities and challenges involved in both current coating products will be introduced. The development of specific press tools for this study, as well as the corresponding simulation of hot forming will be presented. Finally, the <b>hot</b> <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> and anticorrosive properties of both current products will be presented...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>forming</b> {{of boron}} steels is {{becoming}} increasingly popular in the automotive industry due to the demands for weight reduction and increased safety requirements for new vehicles. <b>Hot</b> <b>formed</b> components offer {{a significant increase in}} strength over conventional cold-formed steels, which has allowed for reductions in material thickness (and thus weight) while maintaining the same strength. <b>Hot</b> <b>formed</b> components are typically used in structural applications to improve the integrity of the vehicle’s cabin {{in the event of a}} collision. It has been suggested, however, that the crash performance of certain <b>hot</b> <b>formed</b> parts may be increased by locally tailoring their mechanical properties to improve their energy absorption. The final microstructure of a <b>hot</b> <b>formed</b> part is driven by the rate at which it is cooled within the tooling during the forming and quenching process. By controlling the cooling rate of the part, it is possible to control the final microstructure, and thus the final mechanical properties. This thesis outlines the experimental and numerical studies that were performed for the <b>hot</b> <b>forming</b> of a lab-scale B-pillar. A <b>hot</b> <b>forming</b> die set was developed which has both heating and cooling capabilities to control the local cooling rate of the blank as it is formed and quenched. The first aspect of this research is to produce a <b>hot</b> <b>formed</b> part which is representative of an industrial component, and then to numerically model the process to predict the final mechanical properties. The second aspect is to produce a <b>hot</b> <b>formed</b> part with tailored mechanical properties, such that there are regions of the part with very high strength (very hard) and other regions with increased ductility (softer). By tailoring the microstructure to meet the performance requirement of a <b>hot</b> <b>formed</b> part, it may be possible to optimize its crash behavior and also reduce the overall weight. Cartridge heaters were installed into sections of the tooling allowing it to reach a maximum temperature of 400 °C. Cooling channels are used in other sections to maintain it at approximately room temperature. Experiments were performed on 1. 2 mm Usibor® 1500 P steel at heated die temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 400 °C. In the fully cooled region, the Vickers hardness of the blank was measured to be 450 – 475 HV, on average. As the temperature of the heated region was increased, a significant softening trend was observed in the areas of the blank that were in contact with the heated tool. The greatest levels of softening occurred in the 400 °C heated die trial. Hardness measurements as low as 234 HV were recorded, which represents a reduction in hardness of 49 % compared to the fully cooled trials. Numerical models of the experiments were developed using LS-DYNA and use of its advanced <b>hot</b> <b>forming</b> material model which allows for microstructure and hardness prediction within the final part. The numerical models have shown promising results in terms of predicting the hardness trends as the temperature of the die increases. Thermal expansion of the tooling resulted in local changes in the geometry of the tooling which proved to be problematic during the forming and quenching stages of the process. The expansion caused unexpected changes in the part-die contact, and the resulting microstructures were altered. These thermal expansion issues were addressed in the current work by shimming the tooling; however, in future work the tooling should be designed to account for this expansion at the desired operating temperature...|$|R

The analysis shows the front bumper inner plate using <b>hot</b> <b>forming</b> AHSS can improve the crashworthiness of automobiles {{and make it more}} balanced and reasonable to transfer collision energy and force. As a result, the maximum displacement of the front bumper system decreases and other parts such as front side rails can be safer.
