25|$|Apollonius of Perga, in On Determinate Section, {{dealt with}} {{problems}} {{in a manner that}} may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others. Apollonius in the Conics further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of Descartes by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations of curves. However, although Apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry, he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve a posteriori instead of a priori. That is, equations were determined by curves, but curves were not determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation.|$|E

This was merely an assumption, derived from faith in the simplicity of nature.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} events {{described in}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle were transcribed centuries after they had occurred. Barbara Yorke, Patrick Sims-Williams and David Dumville among others have highlighted how a number of features of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the 5th and early 6th centuries clearly contradict {{the idea that they}} contain a reliable year-by-year record. Stuart Laycock has suggested that there may be information from the early period that can be used on the basis that: the obvious glosses and fictions should be rejected (such as the information about Porta and Portsmouth); the kernel behind some entries might contain a truth (such as the sequence of the events associated with Ælle of Sussex); and whilst the dates are uncertain, Laycock believes some of the 6th century events may describe real situations. However presenting evidence for the Anglo-Saxon settlement from a chronicle such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is uncertain and relies heavily on the present view of which entries are acceptable truth. As Dumville points out about the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: [...] "medieval historiography has assumptions <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> own, particularly in terms of distinctions between fiction and non-fiction".|$|E
2500|$|Some commentators, such as Gabriel J. Chin and Eric Maltz, {{have viewed}} Harlan's Plessy dissent {{in a more}} {{critical}} light, and suggested it be viewed in context with his other decisions. Maltz has argued that [...] "modern commentators have often overstated Harlan's distaste for race-based classifications," [...] pointing to other aspects of decisions in which Harlan was involved. Both point to a passage of Harlan's Plessy dissent as particularly troubling: [...] "There is a race so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> own {{that we do not}} permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But, by the statute in question, a Chinaman can ride in the same passenger coach with white citizens of the United States, while citizens of the black race in Louisiana, many of whom, perhaps, risked their lives for the preservation of the Union... and who have all the legal rights that belong to white citizens, are yet declared to be criminals, liable to imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by citizens of the white race".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory {{measures}} were taken against the Chinese. These laws, {{in particular the}} Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China, although the laws were later repealed by the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. Another key piece of legislation was the Naturalization Act of 1870, which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization {{on the grounds that}} they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed alien land laws that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an [...] "unassimilable" [...] race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), then-Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote of the Chinese as: [...] "a race so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States.

The introspective rejoinder against this view claims that it is opposed to our phenomenally-informed, pre-theoretic intuitions. The rejoinder seems to be correct about how colors appear when looking at how participants respond to an item about the metaphysical nature of color but not when looking at an item about the ascription of colors. The present article expands the properties investigated to sound and taste and inspects the mentioned asymmetry, with a particular focus {{on the principle of}} charity. Using a metaphysical item, we find that color and sound are no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> shape, <b>our</b> control for a clearly anti-relational property. Taste, on the other hand, is no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> likability, <b>our</b> control for a clearly relational property. Importantly, we find that the disparity between metaphysical and ascription items is due to participants using a principle of charity to interpret disagreement cases such that both parties can be correct...|$|R
2500|$|Dee {{promoted}} the sciences of navigation and cartography. He studied closely with Gerardus Mercator, and he owned an important collection of maps, globes and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments {{as well as}} special navigational techniques for use in polar regions. Dee served as an advisor to the English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation. He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to the progress of human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than Francis Bacon, though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere {{of the reign of}} James I. It should be noted, though, that Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics is radically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> contemporary view. Dee's promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement. As with most of his writings, Dee chose to write in English, rather than Latin, to make his writings accessible to the general public. His [...] "Mathematical Preface" [...] to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was very popular and influential among the [...] "mecanicians": the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training.|$|E

Describing the sound to MTV news, Joel Madden said it would sound a lot like Blink-182. Joel Madden went on to say in the same MTV interview that [...] "There's nothing dance-y on the record, though, at all, which is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> last one," [...] further implying a movement away from the sound of Good Morning Revival.

I allude to the Chinese race." [...] In United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), Harlan joined Chief Justice Fuller's dissent proclaiming the dangers of having large numbers of Chinese immigrants in the United States. The Court's holding was that persons of Chinese descent born in the United States were citizens by birth. Fuller and Harlan argued that the principle of jus sanguinis (that is, the concept of a child inheriting his or her father's citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been more pervasive in U.S. legal history since independence. In the view of the minority, excessive reliance on jus soli (birthplace) as the principal determiner of citizenship would lead to an untenable state of affairs in which [...] "the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country, whether of royal parentage or not, or whether of the Mongolian, Malay or other race, were eligible to the presidency, while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not".|$|E

2500|$|The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is {{bounded by}} a {{northern}} and a southern coast, whereas the [...] "narrow neck" [...] {{described in the}} Book of Mormon {{is said to be}} surrounded by a west sea and an east sea (...) [...] Sorenson suggests that this is explained by understanding the manner in which ancient cultures label directions. He points out that the Israelites in Palestine defined their directions as though they were standing with their backs to the sea. The direction [...] "sea" [...] (seaward) denoted west while the direction [...] "fore" [...] (inland) denoted east. The direction south was denoted by [...] "right hand" [...] and the direction north by [...] "left hand." [...] In the case of Palestine, these directions correlated with the actual geography of the north-south coast [...] In the language used by the Maya, the word south meant [...] "on the right hand" [...] and north meant [...] "on the left" [...] One researcher suggested that ancient Maya directions were set 45 degrees <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> own. The Book of Mormon, however, leads us to ask how a colony of ancient Israelites would have coordinated directions outside Palestine. [...] It {{is important to note that}} Hebraic scholars disagree with Sorenson's generalized interpretation of Israelite coordinates. [...] Sorenson is correct in pointing out that the expression [...] "seaward" [...] in Palestine commonly means west. [...] "Sea" [...] or [...] "seaward" [...] in Hebrew can substitute for [...] "west" [...] when referring to the local Mediterranean Sea. Yehoshua (Joshua) 1:4 reads, [...] "…as far as the great sea [...] toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border." [...] However, Sorenson is incorrect in suggesting that Israelites outside of Palestine would have generally defined west standing with their backs to a sea. The Israelite coordinate system is based on the perceived movement of the heavenly quarters. [...] East is therefore defined not by facing inland from an arbitrary coast, but by standing before the general direction of the rising sun. (מִזְרָח, Shemot (Exodus) 27:13, Devarim (Deuteronomy) 3:27, Yehoshua (Joshua) 11:3, Tehillim (Psalms) 113:3) [...] Facing sunrise, [...] "before" [...] is the same as east, the [...] "right hand" [...] directs south, the [...] "left hand" [...] directs north and [...] "behind" [...] becomes west. (Yehoshua (Joshua) 12:3, Yo'el (Joel) 2:20) [...] "Place of sunset" [...] (מַעֲרָב) properly defines Israelite west outside of Palestine. (Tehillim (Psalms) 103:12, Yesha'yahu (Isaiah) 43:5) [...] There is in fact an instance in Hebrew scripture in which [...] "from the sea" [...] may be translated [...] "from the south", possibly referring to the Arabian Sea.
