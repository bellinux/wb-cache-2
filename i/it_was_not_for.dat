When Hitler remonstrated, and said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E

25|$|King Louis died {{without a}} male heir, and {{after years of}} anarchy, the future Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund (r. 1387–1437), a prince of the Luxembourg line, succeeded to the throne by marrying the {{daughter}} of Louis the Great, Mary of Hungary. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> entirely selfless reasons {{that one of the}} leagues of barons helped him to power: Sigismund had to pay for the support of the lords by transferring a sizeable part of the royal properties. For some years, the baron's council governed the country {{in the name of the}} Holy Crown; the king was even imprisoned for a short time. The restoration of the authority of the central administration took decades.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> {{the lack}} of trying that Baldwin was {{unavailable}} {{to fill the void}} left by McCormick's injury. Chicago manager Cap Anson intended to start the newcomer in game 4, but objection was made by Browns owner Chris von der Ahe, who declared there was an understanding that the World Series was a competition between the two teams which had won the championships of their respective leagues and that no additional players were to be used by either side. Chicago owner Albert Spalding remonstrated on behalf of the new addition to his stable and the two owners stormed off for speedy decision of the dispute by the board of umpires appointed for the series, a process specified by an earlier agreement between the teams. Three of the four umpires (two from each league) were located and it was determined that the matter should be left to the toss of a coin. The National League lost the flip and Baldwin was barred from the series.|$|E

25|$|Reicha's {{life and}} career in Vienna were {{interrupted}} by Napoleon's November 1805 occupation of the city by French troops. In 1806 Reicha travelled to Leipzig to arrange a performance of his new work, the cantata Lenore (stopping at Prague to see his mother {{for the first time}} since 1780), but because Leipzig was blockaded by the French, not only was the performance cancelled but he could not return to Vienna for several months. When he did return <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> long, because by 1808 the Austrian Empire was already preparing for another war, the War of the Fifth Coalition, so Reicha decided to move back to Paris. This time three of his many operas were produced, but they all failed; yet his fame as theorist and teacher increased steadily, and by 1817 most of his pupils became professors at the Conservatoire de Paris. The following year, Reicha himself was appointed professor of counterpoint and fugue at the Conservatoire with the support of Louis XVIII, despite opposition from its director Luigi Cherubini.|$|E
25|$|Farrar, Haussler, and Hushovd drew {{frequent}} mention as pre-race favorites and contenders at {{events like}} Dwars door Vlaanderen, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, and Gent–Wevelgem. While {{the team had}} solid high placings at each of these races, they missed out on winning any of them. At Dwars door Vlaanderen, two riders finished ahead of the fast-charging reduced peloton to decide the race themselves. Nick Nuyens and Geraint Thomas had no measurable time gap over the field, but held on for first and second places. Farrar won the sprint from the 30-man peloton, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the victory, instead merely to round out the podium in third place. Fabian Cancellara took a dominant win at the E3, finishing a minute clear of the next group on the road. Vanmarcke {{was part of that}} second group, narrowly missing out in the sprint for the remaining podium places to take fourth overall. Farrar was again third at Gent–Wevelgem, finishing behind Tom Boonen and Daniele Bennati in a hectic reduced sprint. In April, Hesjedal took fourth behind Samuel Sánchez at the GP Miguel Indurain.|$|E
25|$|The chlamys, a semicircular cloak {{fastened}} to the right shoulder continued throughout the period. The length fell sometimes only to the hips or {{as far as the}} ankles, much longer than the version commonly worn in Ancient Greece; the longer version is also called a paludamentum. As well as his courtiers, Emperor Justinian wears one, with a huge brooch, in the Ravenna mosaics. On each straight edge men of the senatorial class had a tablion, a lozenge shaped coloured panel across the chest or midriff (at the front), which was also used to show the further rank of the wearer by the colour or type of embroidery and jewels used (compare those of Justinian and his courtiers). Theodosius I and his co-emperors were shown in 388 with theirs at knee level in the Missorium of Theodosius I of 387, but over the next decades the tablion can be seen to move higher on the Chlamys, for example in ivories of 413-414. A paragauda or border of thick cloth, usually including gold, was also an indicator of rank. Sometimes an oblong cloak would be worn, especially by the military and ordinary people; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> court occasions. Cloaks were pinned on the right shoulder for ease of movement, and access to a sword.|$|E

25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form {{a clear idea of}} his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed to choose an assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date grown up and become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E
