5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post-apocalyptic {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Walter M. Miller Jr., first {{published}} in 1960. Set in a Catholic monastery in the desert of the Southwestern United States after a devastating nuclear war, the story spans thousands of years as civilization rebuilds <b>itself.</b> <b>The</b> monks of the fictional Albertian Order of Leibowitz take up the mission of preserving the surviving remnants of man's scientific knowledge until the day the outside world is again ready for it.|$|E
5|$|According to Billboard magazine, Jive's {{mother company}} Sony BMG offered 71 {{distinct}} products {{to tie in}} with FutureSex/LoveSounds. This was an attempt at finding solutions to declining sales in physical albums, and Timberlake's album was among those offered in various configurations and versions. Aside from the album <b>itself,</b> <b>the</b> project included digital versions, ringtones, wallpapers and individual tracks.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the {{confusion}} is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls <b>itself</b> <b>the</b> Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E

5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon <b>itself),</b> <b>the</b> common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur <b>itself.</b> <b>The</b> condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E

The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League <b>itself,</b> <b>the</b> Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law.

5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with <b>itself.</b> <b>The</b> resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued to escalate throughout the early 1950s, {{and the lack}} of cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between Paramount and DuMont was gone.|$|E

5|$|Despairing of any siege {{operation}} {{against the}} Temple's massive walls, Titus had the gates burnt down.

5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times.

Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle <b>itself,</b> <b>the</b> beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
