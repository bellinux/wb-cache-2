5000|$|The triple-option, then, {{eliminates}} two defenders without blocking them. This frees two {{offensive linemen}} to block different defenders, usually inside defenders. This isolates the <b>dive</b> <b>key</b> and the pitch key for the QB to [...] "read" [...] and should leave only an outside support defender (usually a safety) and the cornerback {{to cover the}} End, who is running a deep pass route. As Pepper Rodgers and Homer Smith stated in [...] "Installing Football's Wishbone T Offense", [...] "To run a Triple Option with a lead blocker {{is the reason for}} the Wishbone formation." [...] It is the [...] "extra blocker" [...] concept that drives the success of the wishbone and its derivatives. The cornerback must cover the outside receiver. The support/safety must support the run defense and (usually) covers the pitch back. The defensive end typically attacks the quarterback and a defensive tackle is assigned the fullback dive. These assignments must be made before the play begins and that totals eight defensive players to both sides of the ball.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{measure the}} heart rate of diving seabirds, we tested a new method of {{attaching}} electrodes and a miniaturized ECG logger with high memory capacity (2 Mbytes) and high frequent sampling (5 ms). A needle type electrode was inserted into subcutaneous tissue of AdElie penguins, and an electrode was implanted under the sternum of hens. Both electrodes were connected to a logger attached {{to the back of}} the bird. The meanÂ±S of heart rate of penguins for 3 h and of hens for 1 h during a resting period were 74. 9 Â 15. 4 bpm and 245. 3 Â 12. 1 bpm, respectively. The ECG showed electric noise during exercising periods. However, as R peaks were countable in those periods, it was possible to calculate {{the heart rate}} during exercising periods from the interval between R peaks. Though the implantation method needs some recovery time for birds after surgery before the ECG measurement, the method reduces the electric noise caused by the locomotor muscle and electrode movement and is suitable to measure the ECG of free-ranging seabirds during <b>dives.</b> <b>key</b> words: ECG, heart rate, data logger, seabird...|$|R

5000|$|Triple option: In {{these highly}} complex running plays, three {{potential}} ballcarriers are available. The triple option typically features three components: a [...] "dive" [...] track, a [...] "keep" [...] track and [...] "pitch" [...] track. In its most generic version, the inside/outside veer, the dive track is typically {{carried out by}} a running back. At the snap of the ball, this player attacks {{the line of scrimmage}} somewhere between the offensive tackles (or end in the outside veer) as designated by the type of triple option play. This player is often the first choice in the triple option. His goal is to quickly attack the defensive interior in order to either pick up yardage or freeze the defense and prevent their pursuit to the outside. This quick surge into the interior of the defense is traditionally called a [...] "dive". The quarterback determines whether to hand the ball to the fullback by reading a [...] "dive key" [...] - usually a defensive end. If the <b>dive</b> <b>key</b> does not try to tackle the running back the quarterback will hand the ball off to him. Alternatively, if the defender attempts to tackle the running back, the quarterback will keep the ball himself. This decision usually takes place while both the dive back and the quarterback are holding the football in an intricate exchange called the [...] "mesh". On the keep track, the quarterback may run upfield for yardage or pitch the ball to another ballcarrier on the [...] "pitch" [...] track. This player is called the [...] "pitch back" [...] and the quarterback determines whether or not to pitch the ball by reading the [...] "pitch key" [...] - usually a linebacker or defensive back.|$|R

40|$|Divers may run {{a higher}} risk of {{infection}} with waterborne pathogens than bathers because of more frequent and intense contact with water that may not comply with microbiologic water quality standards for bathing water. In this study we aimed to estimate the volume of water swallowed during <b>diving</b> as a <b>key</b> factor for infection risk assessment associated with diving. Using questionnaires, occupational and sport divers in the Netherlands were asked about number of dives, volume of swallowed water, and health complaints (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ear, skin, eye, and respiratory complaints). Occupational divers, on average, swallowed 9. 8 mL marine water and 5. 7 mL fresh surface water per dive. Sport divers swallowed, on average, 9. 0 mL marine water; 13 mL fresh recreational water; 3. 2 mL river, canal, or city canal water; and 20 mL water in circulation pools. Divers swallowed less water when wearing a full face mask instead of an ordinary diving mask and even less when wearing a diving helmet. A full face mask or a diving helmet is recommended when diving in fecally contaminated water. From the volumes of swallowed water and concentrations of pathogens in fecally contaminated water, we estimated the infection risks per dive and per year to be as high as a few to up to tens of percents. This may explain why only 20 % of the divers reported having none of the inquired health complaints within a period of 1 year.

40|$|Landscape {{approaches}} have become en vogue {{in the past}} couple of decades. Originating from nineteenth-century landscape geography, this renewed popularity since the 1980 s is fueled by debates on-among others-nature conservation, landscape restoration, ecosystem services, competing claims on land and resources, sectorial land-use policies, sustainable development, and sense of place. This review illuminates the ambition and potential of these landscape approaches for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration. To show this, we work with a T-shaped interdisciplinary model.

40|$|The Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula is {{invariably}} {{an underwater}} feeder which exploits the benthos. Field observations {{made in the}} early 20 th century found that Tufted Duck foraging in the wild had a dive to surface time ratio of approximately 2 : 1. More recent studies of captive Tufted Duck found that the dive to surface time ratio was about 1 : 1. This study re-examined the feeding behaviour of wild Tufted Duck wintering in the UK. Mean water temperature at the benthos was 6. 2 °C (s. d. ± 1. 6 °C) over the study period. The mean dive times of 23. 4 s (± 2. 5 s) for males and 22. 2 s (± 1. 6 s) for females were significantly greater than the mean between-dive surface times of 10. 7 s (± 1. 6 s) and 10. 4 s (± 1. 6 s) for males and females, respectively.

40|$|The Earth’s {{climate is}} changing. Tourism is an {{important}} economic sector in Vanuatu and is highly vulnerable to climate change. Luganville is a <b>key</b> <b>dive</b> tourism destination in the SANMA province of Vanuatu. This working paper aims to ascertain the current shocks and stressors faced by Luganville’s tourism sector and how climate change can exacerbate these. Although data is still in process of being analysed, key shocks that have been identified include cyclones, effect on demand due to media footage and changes to direct international flights whilst notable stressors include Crown of Thorn Starfish outbreaks and environmental degradation. A majority of the tourism sector in Luganville {{is run by the}} expatriate community, which is fairly sceptical towards climate change risks and the majority of members of this community show little concern for the consequent impact on their business. On the other hand, the Ni-­‐Vanuatu (Indigenous) communities are terrified about the impacts of climate change and feel limited in their capacity to address these changes.

Found off the {{northern}} coast of Bohol Island, central Philippines, Danajon expands over an area of 272 km². The Coastal Conservation and Education Foundation, a Filipino nonprofit, is implementing a project to develop a management plan for Danajon Bank. One of the goals {{is to increase the}} economic opportunities for the coastal communities adjacent to the Danajon reefs through marine-related tourism. This study examined the feasibility of expanding dive tourism to this area. The results were derived from two methods: (1) semi-structured interviews with dive business owners and employees; and (2) contingent valuation survey among foreign and local tourists to determine willingness-to-pay an entrance fee to the reefs as a <b>dive</b> destination. The <b>key</b> results are: (1) there are challenges that may arise for attracting dive tourism to the outer Danajon Bank such as the sites location, safety and quality; (2) opportunities that can help aid in the expansion of dive tourism in Danajon include dive business interest in new sites and opportunities for dive stops when traveling through the region of Danajon when on safari dive trips; (3) dive operators are willing to provide time, labor and equipment to aid in conservation projects; and (4) resource user fees will be the best opportunity for creating economic opportunities for local communities in the region from tourism...|$|R
40|$|It is {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the goalkeeper (GK) in saving difficult shots by <b>diving</b> is a <b>key</b> factor in soccer because it can influence the outcome of the game to a large extent. However, the most appropriate way to exert force during the diving motion according to the course of the shot from either leg is still unclear. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to clarify the fundamental mechanism of a GK 2 ̆ 7 s diving motion according to the height and distance of the shot. We performed an experiment in which 11 university GKs participated. They were asked to dive toward balls set at 3 different heights located a short or a long distance from the GK. By examining the GKs 2 ̆ 7 diving motions, we calculated the ground reaction force (GRF), joint angular velocity, and joint torque. The results indicated that the magnitude of the GRF under both legs and the direction of the GRF under the ball-side (BS) leg differed with the ball height. We also found that a higher dive by the GKs corresponded to a larger counter-movement of the contralateral-side (CS) leg and a higher stopping power of the BS leg in order to increase the vertical velocity, and more exertion of extension torques at the hip and foot for takeoff compared to those in lower dives. Furthermore, a lower dive of the GKs corresponded to a larger angular impulse of the BS hip adduction after the BS leg touched the ground. These findings suggest that during the takeoff part of the diving motion of a GK, depending on the ball height, the CS leg controls the magnitude of power and the BS leg controls both the magnitude and the direction of power in order for the GK to dive directly towards the ball. 訂正は『体育学研究』 58 巻 2 号 p. 737 に掲載...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{characteristics}} of the region The most prominent geomorphological feature along the South West Tasmanian coast is the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour estuarine system, which includes Bathurst Harbour, Bathurst Channel, Port Davey and associated small embayments. While all estuarine systems possess a unique combination of physical characteristics, the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour system can justifiably be regarded as Australia’s most unique estuary, {{and perhaps the most}} anomalous globally. The unusual combination of factors operating in this system include: 1. negligible human population density in catchment 2. little anthropogenic impact in estuary 3. large water volume and surface area 4. ria formation, but with many fjord characteristics, including narrow deep channels and relatively shallow sill at seaward entrance 5. high levels of riverine input 6. strongly stratified conditions that vary seasonally, with marine salt wedge and low-salinity surface layer 7. low-salinity surface layer deeply tannin-stained, blocking light penetration to depth 8. low levels of nutrients and low aquatic productivity 9. seaward entrance of main channel protected from wave action by island barriers 10. strong barometric influence on tides 11. low residence time of bottom water 12. high stability of bottom water with respect to temperature and chemical signature Biological {{characteristics of}} the region The anomalous combination of geomorphological, climatic, hydrodynamic and hydrological conditions operating in the Port Davey region has generated an aquatic environment with a highly unusual mix of flora and fauna. The uniqueness of this biota exceeds that of terrestrial habitats in the Port Davey catchment, which are similar to terrestrial habitats in other catchments of the Tasmanian west coast. Like the adjacent terrestrial environment, the estuarine ecosystem has compositional and phylogenetic relationships with the fjord regions of southwestern New Zealand and Chile. Unique and characteristic features of the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour ecosystem include: 1. presence of extremely narrow-range endemic species 2. high variability in biotic composition over small spatial scales, with several different zones distributed along the estuary and different bands distributed with depth in each zone 3. relictual Gondwanan elements present (at least 80 mya), notably including the Port Davey skate 4. displaced deepsea species, including many octocorals 5. paucity of introduced taxa 6. predominance of fragile and delicate sessile invertebrates, including slowgrowing fenestrate bryozoans 7. presence of threatened taxa 8. bryozoan-based sediments that are more characteristic of the continental slope than inshore environments 9. relatively few molluscs, echinoderms, or decapods. A total of 46 unicellular algal taxa, 108 seaweeds and seagrasses, 496 invertebrates and 102 fishes have been recorded from the region during recent surveys. Floral and faunal assemblages should be resurveyed to gain a more complete picture of species composition and changes through time. Additional new species, many of which are likely to be endemic to the region, should be discovered with further field investigations. Distribution of biota Plant and animal communities associated with reefs in Port Davey differ greatly from those found in Bathurst Channel, with few species in common. Major differences are evident between plant and sessile invertebrate assemblages associated with eastern and western Port Davey shores. Few studies have investigated planktonic or soft-sediment assemblages in the region. The Bathurst Channel biota varies along the estuarine cline, with foliose algae reaching 5 m depth in the western region but not penetrating below 1 m in the east. By contrast, sessile invertebrates are most abundant below 5 m depth in the west and below 2 m in the east. Multivariate analysis indicated a total of eight major biotic assemblages that characterise different sections and depths of the Channel. For management purposes, the Bathurst Channel-Bathurst Harbour subregion has been subdivided into five zones with different biological characteristics. From west to east, these are: (i) Bramble Cove Zone, extending from Port Davey to western Turnbull Island, (ii) Bathurst Channel Sea Pen Zone, extending eastwards to Forrester Point and Munday Island, (iii) Bathurst Channel Tube Worm Zone, extending to Joan and Farrell Points, (iv) Bathurst Narrows Lace Coral Zone, extending to Bathurst Harbour, and (v) Shallow Embayment Sediment Zone, which includes Bathurst Harbour and the larger embayments off Bathurst Channel including Joe Page Bay and Horseshoe Inlet. The five different zones are subject to different types and levels of threat. Threats Seven major threats to the integrity of the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour ecosystem are outlined and discussed: boating impacts, fishing impacts, diver impacts, effluent impacts, introduced species, global climate change, and onshore activities. In order to reduce the potential of these impacts to threaten the unique Port Davey ecosystem, 20 management recommendations are outlined: 1. Anchoring should be prohibited within the main channel of Bathurst Channel (defined within a baseline extending between rocky headlands along northern and southern shores) and in adjacent bays for 200 m distance from the main channel. 2. A Code of Conduct for Boat Operators and Vessel-based Visitors should be prepared and distributed to commercial and private vessel operators visiting Port Davey. Port Davey-Bathurst 3. A booklet on boating in Port Davey should be produced that includes the Code of Conduct, legal regulations, background information on the unique biota, threats to biodiversity, quarantine protocols to reduce risk of transfer of introduced species, safety issues, health risk associated with eating local shellfish, actions required {{in the event of an}} oil spill, and location of no-anchoring zones. 4. An oil spill response strategy for the region should be finalised, and an oil spill response kit permanently stationed at Port Davey. 5. The boundary of the Bathurst Channel No-take Sanctuary Zone should be extended to include Shanks Island and the western as well as the eastern side of Breaksea Island to a distance of 500 m offshore, and the boundary of the Inner Saddle Bight No-take Sanctuary Zone should be extended to include Outer Saddle Bight and Point Lucy to a distance of 500 m offshore. 6. Diving should be prohibited without special permit to a distance of 200 m offshore from Farrell Point, Munday Island and Little Woody Islands. 7. A Code of Conduct for Divers should be prepared and distributed to divers visiting Bathurst Channel. 8. The Code of Conduct should state that no contact with reef surfaces is permitted while diving in Bathurst Channel. 9. The Code of Conduct should include a warning that diving should not be attempted in Bathurst Channel unless the diver is experienced with dark cold conditions and strong currents, and can achieve a high level of buoyancy control. 10. All commercial dive operations should be required to include a dive guide accredited by Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) with demonstrated experience in the area, and who is responsible for compliance with the Code of Conduct. 11. Biological monitoring at <b>key</b> <b>dive</b> sites and “no-dive” zones using video and photoquadrats should be undertaken at intervals not exceeding 3 years, and annually if resources allow, to provide information on diver impacts and reef assemblage resilience. 12. If deterioration of habitats at <b>key</b> <b>dive</b> sites is noted during monitoring, then controls should be placed on diver visitation at these sites. 13. Diver visitation rates at <b>key</b> <b>dive</b> sites should be recorded and compiled on a PWS database. 14. Discharge of sewage effluent should be banned from live-aboard vessels operating within Bathurst Channel east of Schooner Cove, Bathurst Harbour and adjacent inlets. 15. A monitoring program should be established to assess the distribution and dynamics of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, and the impact of this species on the natural food web. 16. A health warning should be issued that eating shellfish from Bathurst Harbour or Bathurst Channel could cause 17. A systematic monitoring program to detect the presence of introduced marine pests should be established with monitoring interval of three years or less, with emphasis on the detection and range mapping of target pest species (Crassostrea gigas, Asterias amurensis, Gymnodinium catenatum, Carcinus maenas, Corbula gibba, Undaria pinnatifida and Musculista senhousia) and the New Zealand screw shell Maoricolpus roseus. 18. Baseline surveys of zooplankton species distribution should be conducted, with emphasis on assays for the presence of larval Maoricolpus roseus. 19. Long-term changes in water temperature should be monitored using loggers deployed at multiple sites and depths along the Bathurst Channel estuarine cline. 20. Populations of the hollow-spined sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii should be monitored in Bathurst Channel in conjunction with surveys of introduced marine pests, MPA zone ecological reef monitoring, and surveys of native sessile invertebrate assemblages. A total of 41 research recommendations are also outlined and prioritised, as described in Section 6...|$|R
