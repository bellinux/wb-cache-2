Hence, diffusion equations are retained and reused with the <b>effective</b> <b>diffusivity</b> coefficient as a measuring parameter of internal moisture ratio.

In {{the development of a}} mathematical model for drying curves, moisture diffusion was modelled using Fick’s second law for mass transfer. The resulting partial differential equation was solved using a forward-time central-space finite difference approximation, with the assumption of variable <b>effective</b> <b>diffusivity.</b> In order to test the model, experimental data was collected for the drying of green peas in a fluidised bed at three drying temperatures. Through fitting three equation types for <b>effective</b> <b>diffusivity</b> to the data, it was found that a linear equation form, in which diffusivity increased with decreasing moisture content, was most appropriate.
