40|$|For {{the first}} time we have {{presented}} a method to investigate the stability of quiescent state in a coupled laser array. By introducing tiny perturbation, stability of quiescent state can be known by investigating <b>eigenvalues</b> of <b>coefficient</b> matrix of the corresponding linear differential equations. Only when real parts of the eigenvalues were all negative or zero, the corresponding quiescent state is stable. Two tapes of coupled laser array with loop and linear topological structure were studied respectively. It was found that there were innumerable quiescent states and they could be divided into several types based on phase relation. Some types were stable and others were unstable. Topological structure affects the stability of quiescent state in a coupled laser array. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – A {{method to}} {{approximately}} shift the electrical network poles and zeros to more suitable {{locations in the}} complex plane was proposed in [1].

The poles and/or zeros shifts are carried out by changes in the system elements (e. g. capacitor and/or reactor banks). As an improvement to the method described in [1], this paper presents a Newton-Raphson method to accurately carry out the required shifts. Although the mathematical formulation considers just one variable, it is possible to generalize the method to consider several variables and also some constraints e. g. maintenance of the system operating point. The main aspects of the method are described together with some results on a practical system problem...|$|R
