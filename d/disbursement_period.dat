The results of research were summarised based on contracts, submitted invoice, inspection dated, copies of disbursement dated between client and their main contractor and interviewed with persons involved in central and local government projects during 1994 - 2008 in Thailand. The data collection {{was to investigate the}} disbursement procedure related to performance in <b>disbursement</b> during construction <b>period</b> (Planned duration of contract against Actual execution date in each month). A graphical presentation of a duration analysis of the projects illustrated significant disbursement formation in each project.

40|$|Has ‘Aid for Trade’ been {{successful}} in reducing trade transaction costs? If so, what are the expected returns to trade-related investments? The Gravity Model is {{used to evaluate the}} trade effects of aid for trade <b>disbursements</b> for the <b>period</b> 1988 - 2006 across 78 recipient countries. The project takes several approaches with respect to ‘Aid for Trade’ and recipient country aggregations. Estimates reveal that cumulative Aid for Trade has a positive and significant impact on trade flows although significantly less so for geographically remote regions. Disaggregated estimates of trade aid reveal positive and significant findings for investments in trade-related technical assistance and infrastructure, while investments in trade development yield marginal returns at best, the lone exception being emerging market economies. The tentative conclusion is that current ‘aid for trade’ initiatives hold much promise for stimulating trade growth. However, given the potential for adverse economic effects, a more cautious approach is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural credit {{plays an}} {{important}} role in enhancing the agricultural productivity in developing countries like Pakistan. The study discusses various indicators of agricultural credit in Pakistan and presents results of estimated production function using institutional credit as one of the explanatory variables. Over the years, increased percentage of agricultural GDP has been disbursed as institutional credit. During the study <b>period</b> <b>disbursement</b> of institutional credit per cropped hectare also depicted an increasing trend in nominal terms. However, it declined in real terms from late 1980 ’s to early 1990 s. Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL) [...] formerly known as Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), provides the major share of institutional credit. The share of production loans in total loan advanced has been increasing during 1980 - 81 to 1986 - 87 and after mid 1990 ’s. It shows multiple shifts in credit policy from loans for fixed capital to advances for operational capital during the study period. The OLS estimates of the production function revealed that institutional credit affects agricultural production positively. Water availability at the farm gate, labor, and cropping intensity are the other important variables that affect agricultural output positively. However, the shocks like floods, cotton leaf curl virus (CLCV), and drought have caused significant decline in agricultural output during certain years. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis conducts an {{analysis}} of Amphibious Assault ships consumable ship's OPTAR <b>disbursements</b> for the <b>period</b> of 1 July 2007 to 30 April 2008. Regression {{analysis was used to}} test for a statistical relationship among total monthly disbursements by Federal Supply Group (FSG) code and various demographic information, monthly maintenance (MFOM) and training figure of merit (TFOM) scores. Monthly disbursements were aggregated by total monthly FSG investment for each ship in each month. Demographic information includes ship's homeport, Class, Fleet Response Plan (FRP) employment, age, inspection cycle and maintenance cycle. The thesis also analyzed past obligation data (by Julian dated document number) for the period of 01 October 2005 through April 2006 which included the same demographic information previously described. This portion of the analysis determined no quarterly spending cycles, but did identify large spikes in obligations {{at the end of each}} fiscal year, an expected result. Results of the analyses are that the regression analyses do not indicate a strong statistical relationship between monthly disbursements (by FSG) and demographic or figure of merit scores. Recommendation for further study include analysis of the distribution of available funds and what was purchased and analysis of ship's unfunded and phased replacement listing and end of year obligations.

40|$|Aims: The study aims {{to review}} the {{performance}} of the Nigerian bank of agriculture, Katsina state, in terms of micro credit disbursement and loan recovery. Study Design: Reviewing the bank performance in terms of micro-credit delivery and loan recovery from the year 2013 to 2015. Place and Duration of Study: Katsina state, Nigeria and College of Economics and Management, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China from Sep, 2015 to Sep, 2016. Methodology: Data was collected using structured questionnaire administered to a hundred and seventy six randomly sampled money borrowers from the bank of agriculture. Similarly secondary data on the bank’s loan <b>disbursement</b> for the <b>period</b> under study was collected. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the data was analyzed using loan repayment and loan default rate equations. Results: The study result revealed that, about 81 % of the borrowers from the bank are males, 55 % of them are in their productive ages and 49 % among them had no formal education and 32 % of the borrowers complained of the inadequate number of bank branches in the region. The study also revealed that a total of $ 164889. 68 was disbursed by the bank to 398 borrowers in the years under study. Furthermore the bank has recorded 79 % loan repayment rate from 2013 to 2015. Conclusion: Based on the findings, it is recommended that the bank should be restructured administratively and repositioned by employing more competent and better experienced banking personnel. Also, government should inject more funds into the bank...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{control is}} {{currently}} receiving significant international commitment. As {{part of this}} commitment, Rwanda has undertaken a two-pronged approach to combating malaria via mass distribution of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets and distribution of antimalarial medications by community health workers. This study attempted to measure {{the impact of these}} interventions on paediatric hospitalizations for malaria and on laboratory markers of disease severity. Methods A retrospective analysis of hospital records pre- and post-community-based malaria control interventions at a district hospital in rural Rwanda was performed. The interventions took place in August 2006 in the region served by the hospital and consisted of mass insecticide treated net distribution and community health workers antimalarial medication <b>disbursement.</b> The study <b>periods</b> consisted of the December–February high transmission seasons pre- and post-rollout. The record review examined a total of 551 paediatric admissions to identify 1) laboratory-confirmed malaria, defined by thick smear examination, 2) suspected malaria, defined as fever and symptoms consistent with malaria {{in the absence of an}} alternate cause, and 3) all-cause admissions. To define the impact of the intervention on clinical markers of malaria disease, trends in admission peripheral parasitaemia and haemoglobin were analyzed. To define accuracy of clinical diagnoses, trends in proportions of malaria admissions which were microscopy-confirmed before and after the intervention were examined. Finally, to assess overall management of febrile illnesses antibiotic use was described. Results Of the 551 total admissions, 268 (48. 6 %) and 437 (79. 3 %) were attributable to laboratory-confirmed and suspected malaria, respectively. The absolute number of admissions due to suspected malaria was smaller during the post-intervention period (N = 150) relative to the pre-intervention period (N = 287), in spite of an increase in the absolute number of hospitalizations due to other causes during the post-intervention period. The percentage of suspected malaria admissions that were laboratory-confirmed was greater during the pre-intervention period (80. 4 %) relative to the post-intervention period (48. 1 %, prevalence ratio [PR]: 1. 67; 95 % CI: 1. 39 – 2. 02; chi-squared p-value Conclusion This study suggests that both admissions for malaria and laboratory markers of clinical disease among children may be rapidly reduced following community-based malaria control efforts. Additionally, this study highlights the problem of over-diagnosis and over-treatment of malaria in malaria-endemic regions, especially as malaria prevalence falls. More accurate diagnosis and management of febrile illnesses is critically needed both now and as fever aetiologies change with further reductions in malaria. </p...|$|R
