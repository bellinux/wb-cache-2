40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{association}} between concentrations of air pollutants and admissions for respiratory causes in children. METHODS Ecological time series study. <b>Daily</b> <b>figures</b> for hospital admissions of children aged < 6, and daily concentrations of air pollutants (PM 10, SO 2, NO 2, O 3 and CO) were analyzed in the Regi&# 227;o da Grande Vit&# 243;ria, ES, Southeastern Brazil, from January 2005 to December 2010. For statistical analysis, two techniques were combined: Poisson regression with generalized additive models and principal model component analysis. Those analysis techniques complemented each other and provided more significant estimates in the estimation of relative risk. The models were adjusted for temporal trend, seasonality, day of the week, meteorological factors and autocorrelation. In the final adjustment of the model, {{it was necessary to}} include models of the Autoregressive Moving Average Models (p, q) type in the residuals in order to eliminate the autocorrelation structures present in the components. RESULTS For every 10 : 49 &# 956;g/m 3 increase (interquartile range) in levels of the pollutant PM 10 there was a 3. 0 % increase in the relative risk estimated using the generalized additive model analysis of main components-seasonal autoregressive &# 8211; while in the usual generalized additive model, the estimate was 2. 0 %.

40|$|Purpose – The {{random walk}} {{forecast}} of exchange rate {{serves as a}} standard benchmark for forecast comparison. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess whether this benchmark is unbiased and directionally accurate under symmetric loss. The focus is on the random walk forecasts of the dollar/euro for 1999 - 2007 and the dollar/pound for 1971 - 2007. Design/methodology/approach – A forecasting framework to generate the one- to four-quarter-ahead random walk forecasts at varying lead times is designed. This allows to compare forecast accuracy at different lead times and forecast horizons. Using standard evaluation methods, this paper further evaluates these forecasts in terms of unbiasedness and directional accuracy. Findings – The paper shows that forecast accuracy improves with a reduction in the lead time but deteriorates with an increase in the forecast horizon. More importantly, the random walk forecasts are unbiased and accurately predict directional change under symmetric loss and thus are of value to a user who assigns similar cost to incorrect upward and downward move predictions in the exchange rates. Research limitations/implications – The one- to four-quarter-ahead random walk forecasts evaluated here are for averages of <b>daily</b> <b>figures</b> and not for the (end-of-quarter) rates in 3 -, 6 -, 9 - and 12 -months. Thus, the framework is of value to a market participant who is interested in forecasting quarterly average rates rather than the end-of-quarter rates. Originality/value – The exchange rate forecasting framework presented in this paper allows the evaluation of the random walk forecasts in terms of directional accuracy which (to the best of knowledge) has not been done before.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is a gluten-free diet {{not only in the}} medical treatment of the patients withceliac disease. The particular subject of the theoretic part is a description of the gluten-free diet and all other diseases for which treatment this diet therapy is necessary. It also outlines the contemporary trend of eating gluten-free diet. For the practical part, a qualitative research method was chosen. The research group was comprised of 15 respondents who enrolled in record all consumed food within two weeks. Using the program "Nutriservis", the diets were evaluated according to the average values of energy, proteins and dietary fiber, and, subsequently, compared tothe recommended <b>daily</b> <b>figures.</b> The respondents were divided into three groups according to alimentation. The first group was made up of people with a diet without restrictions, the second group of the patients who suffered from celiac disease andthe last group included people observing a gluten-free diet, without them being proven celiac disease or gluten allergy. The groups were also compared to each other. Next, it was analyzed through interviews why the respondents were holding the gluten-free diet, and whether during that timetheir healthwas changed or improved. The research part of the thesis was to chart the quality menu of the gluten-free diet. Comparing to the non-restricted diet, research has not reached large differences between the particular groups of respondents. The biggest problem of all groups was low fiber intake. From the interviews, investigating why the respondents observed the gluten-free diet and whether it had any positive effect, emerged different responses. For the problem of atopic eczema and migraine compliance, the gluten-free diet has proven a good effect. On the contrary, it is the problem with constipation or digestive problems. In one case, the respondent was convinced about the harmful effect of gluten and therefore had 15 months consumed only gluten-free food. Afterwards he felt less tired than before and, moreover, he should have reduced his weight by 4 kg...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes strategies {{not only}} for modelling price behavior in the dry bulk market, but also for modelling relationships between economic and technical variables of dry bulk ships, by using modern time series approaches, Monte Carlo simulation and other economic techniques. The time series modelling techniques, described extensively in Appendix A, primarily consist of the Vector Error Correction model (VECM), the Vector Autoregressive model (VAR), the Autoregressive and Moving Average model (ARMA), the General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model (GARCH), and their extensions. What are new and interesting here of the modelling strategies and their applications lie in several aspects:  Modelling variables of dry bulk ships: {{the relationships between the}} economic performance and technical specifications of dry bulk vessels built over the period 1970 to 2008 are investigated in order to examine impacts of technical innovations during the past decades on the economic performance of dry bulk carriers. Furthermore, we construct a simulation-based optimization model to design a series of ships with different deadweight having the optimum main technical specifications and to obtain the optimum logistic plan for each vessel.  The extended time series models: the ARIMA, VAR and VEC models are extended by including exogenous variables to become the ARIMAX, VARX and VECM-X models in order to investigate impacts of exogenous economic variables on charter rates and ship prices.  Dynamic behavior of prices and volatilities on major routes under diverse market conditions: time series models are used to make the prediction of spot charter rates through an in-depth analysis of dynamic behavior between prices for Capesize, Panamax and Handymax vessels on specific major trading routes including the transatlantic, the fronthaul, the transpacific and the backhaul over the period 1990 - 2010 and over the period 2003 - 2010, respectively. Time series volatilities of charter rates, newbuilding prices and second-hand ship prices are examined over different periods as well.  Dynamic price behavior between different sub markets: relationships in terms of returns and volatilities at different routes are examined by making use of <b>daily</b> <b>figures</b> between Capesize and Panamax markets, and between Panamax and Handymax markets. The lead-lag relationships of prices between the spot freight and the forward markets, and interrelationships of prices among the freight, the second-hand, the newbuilding and the scrap markets are investigated as well in this research.  The price behavior, the price discovery, and the forecasting performance of FFA prices are examined extensivel...|$|E
40|$|The solar UVB {{radiation}} {{incident on}} a horizontal surface was measured {{and related to}} more routinely recorded meteorological variabIes {{in a study of}} the UVB climatology of the English East Midlands. Exposure of individuals in this climate was monitored and related to vitamin D status. On clear days relations were found between the logarithm of UVB intensity lƛ and airmass µ,and at 304 nm where ozone amount [O 3] is the dominant atmospheric attenuating factor a 2 In Iƛ/aµa[03] was close to the ozone absorption coefficient for this wavelength. At longer wavelengths other attenuation processes have to be accounted for. Measurements of the waveband 300 - 316 nm were compared with irradiation over broader wavebands. On clear days the ratio of UVB to visible irradiance IB/IV was 4. 16 cos z + x where z is the solar zenith angle and x is a coefficient which varies from day to day. Similar analysis for the full solar waveband IF showed a similar linearity of IB/IF with cos z for each day, but both slope and intercept changed between days. A relation between daily integrated totals of UVB and full solar radiation (300 - 3000 nm) was found, enabling UVB radiation to be estimated from measurements made with a standard meteorological pyranometer. The best estimates require <b>daily</b> <b>figures</b> for ozone concentration but an approximation may still be made using monthly mean concentrations or climatological averages. Diffuse UVB radiation was measured and found to be always greater than 0. 5 global UVB. The shade-ring correction applicable in this region of the spectrum is ~ 0. 01 greater than the geometric correction. Estimates of the anisotropy of UVB sky radiation gave the relative strength of the circumsolar region as 0. 36 with an angular width of 0. 78 radians. Polysulphone film was tested and found suitable for use as a personal dosimeter for solar UVB radiation. The UVB exposure of elderly long-stay hospital patients was monitored for a three month period and compared with that of a young healthy population. Plasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured to assess vitamin D status and the change in plasma 25 (OH) D resulting from skin irradiated with solar UVB was found to be 6. 9 ± 0. 4 ng J - 1 for the elderly and + 7. 3 ± 3. 4 ng J- 1 for the young volunteers suggesting little difference between the responses of the elderly and the young. The implication of these figures is that sunlight exposure: of a few hours per week is adequate to maintain a healthy vitamin D status...|$|E
