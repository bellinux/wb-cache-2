40|$|In {{this work}} we present an elegant {{solution}} for a scintillation counter {{to be integrated}} into a cryogenic system. Its distinguishing feature {{is the absence of}} a continuous light <b>guide</b> <b>coupling</b> the scintillation and the photodetector parts, operating at cryogenic and room temperatures respectively. The prototype detector consists of a plastic scintillator with glued-in wavelength-shifting fiber located inside a cryostat, a Geiger-mode Avalanche Photodiode (G-APD) outside the cryostat, and a lens system guiding the scintillation light re-emitted by the fiber to the G-APD through optical windows in the cryostat shields. With a 0. 8 mm diameter multiclad fiber and a 1 mm active area G-APD the coupling efficiency of the "lens light guide" is about 50 %. A reliable performance of the detector down to 3 K is demonstrated. Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
