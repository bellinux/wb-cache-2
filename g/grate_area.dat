25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each engine unit, outside bar frames instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the <b>grate</b> <b>area.</b> They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve gear and outside bar frames. The leading wheels were arranged as conventional pony trucks, while the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|E
25|$|When the {{intensive}} suburban service of 1920 was introduced reliance was still placed largely on these 0-6-0s {{to maintain the}} new split-second timings, and they were quite equal to the task. By then their numbers had been further reinforced by the twenty built in 1900 and 1901 with 160lbf/in² (1.1 MPa) boilers, and by a further twenty turned out in 1904, the latter with 180lbf/in² (1.24 MPa) pressure, larger boilers giving 988sq ft (91.8 m²) heating surface and 14.5sq ft (1.35 m²) <b>grate</b> <b>area,</b> and side-tanks holding 1,200 gallons (5,500 L), which increased the weight to 42½ long tons (43 t). Those built from 1912 onwards were decorated with flared-top chimneys, in place of stovepipes, and the high-roofed cab with side-windows which was now the Holden standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Normand gave a {{particularly}} large heating area (tube surface area) {{in relation to the}} <b>grate</b> <b>area.</b> The cost of this was a dense nest of tubes, where each of the numerous rows of tubes was bent into a different and complex shape. Tube ends entered the cylindrical drums perpendicularly, for good sealing. The space needed for all these tubes filled the entire lower half of the steam drum, requiring both a large drum and a separate steam dome from which to collect dry steam. The external boiler casing entered the flue uptake at one end, usually enclosing this dome. The ends of the drums extended outside the casing as hemispherical domes. Cold downcomers outside the casing linked these drums, providing a path for the return circulation of cold water.|$|E

50|$|Good {{though the}} 6th Class 4-6-0 {{locomotives}} were, the requirement grew for {{larger and more}} powerful engines. At the time, it was becoming increasingly apparent that such locomotives would require fireboxes with appreciably larger <b>grate</b> <b>areas.</b> This was not possible with the existing type of frame on a Cape gauge locomotive where the firebox was arranged between the rearmost coupled wheels. Longer fireboxes were impractical since it would be accompanied by greater fatigue to firemen as well as difficulties in design. To arrange the firebox over the coupled wheels would be unsuitable for adoption on larger locomotives, given the limitation on the maximum height of the boiler centreline above the railhead which was in vogue at the time.|$|R

500|$|The Leader had a [...] "dry lining" [...] firebox. It was not {{surrounded}} on top {{and sides}} by a [...] "jacket" [...] of water as in normal practice, but was constructed of welded steel and used firebricks instead of water for insulation, a novel but troublesome solution. Using firebricks reduced the <b>grate</b> <b>area</b> from [...] to [...] and concentrated the fire in a smaller area. The firehole door was offset {{to the left of}} the boiler backhead, which created difficulties for the fireman when adding coal to the fire. The firebox was not initially equipped with a firebrick arch, although one was retro-fitted during the summer of 1950. The arch was problematic because it led to a tendency for flames to enter the cab at high outputs, a situation made worse by the narrowing of the firebox area.|$|E

40|$|Discharge grates play an {{important}} role in determining the performance of autogenous, semi-autogenous and grate discharge ball mills. The flow capacity (grinding capacity) of these mills is strongly influenced by the discharge <b>grate</b> design-open <b>area</b> and position of apertures, as well as the performance of the pulp lifters. As mill sizes have progressively increased and closed-circuiting has become more popular the importance of grate and pulp lifter design has grown. Unfortunately very few studies have concentrated on this aspect of mill performance. To remedy this a series of laboratory and pilot-scale tests were undertaken to study both the performance of grates on their own and in conjunction with pulp lifters. In this first paper of a two-part series the results from the grate-only experiments are presented and discussed, whilst the performance of the grate-pulp-lifter system is covered in the second paper. The results from the grate-only experiments have shown that the build-up of slurry (hold-up) inside the mill starts from the shoulder of the charge, while the toe position of the slurry progressively moves towards the toe of the charge with increasing flowrate. Besides <b>grate</b> design (open <b>area</b> and position of apertures), charge volume and mill speed were also found to have a strong influence on mill hold-up and interact with grate design variables.

Soon thereafter the family name Baker disappeared from Southport, and was replaced by an influx of settlers from the <b>Grates</b> Cove <b>area,</b> {{on the opposite side of}} Trinity Bay. The first permanent settlers of Southport were James Dean (1802-1865) of Old Perlican, James Lambert, and Joseph Martin of Grates Cove.

40|$|Grinding {{media in}} coarse {{grinding}} tumbling mills constitute the biggest consumable cost to a comminution processing plant, {{therefore it is}} critically important to minimize associated wear. Secondly, efficient grinding is dependent on tight control of the desired ball size distribution, or else optimum impact breakage cannot be assured. Despite the significance of minitoring ball size distribution for mill operation, no practically deployable systems are currently in industry use to measure it. This paper describes a new method for highly accurate, comprehensive, and rapid determination of ball size distribution. Accurate SAG and AG mill product size control is dependent on appropriate <b>Grate</b> Open <b>Area</b> dimensions. Wear of the grate hole edges or in the plate thickness results in an increase of the open area due to the tapered hole cross section, which can result in oversize product exiting the mill. Conversely, some grate castings feature peening of the edges during mill operation, thereby decreasing open area, and therefore preventing the desireed top size product from exiting the mill. SAG mill throughput requires grate holes to remain open or else throughput is restricted. Many grates in operation are pegged by grinding media to varying degrees of severity. This paper introduces a comprehensive, accurate and rapid method to measure and track the size and pegging status of each and all grate holes in situ, and therefore provides tracking information on the Open Area of a SAG mill. This enables operators to control the primary mill product size and therefore the opportunity to stabilize downstream processes...|$|R
40|$|Gratings are {{essential}} components in different high performance optical set-ups such as spectrometers in space missions or ultrashort-pulse laser compression arrangements. Often such kinds of applications require gratings operating {{close to the}} technological accessible limits of today's fabrication technology. Typical critical parameters are the diffraction efficiency and its polarization dependency, the wave-front error introduced by the grating, and the stray-light performance. Additionally, space applications have specific environmental requirements and laser application typically demand a high damage threshold. All these properties need to be controlled precisely on rather large grating <b>areas.</b> <b>Grating</b> sizes of 200 mm or even above are not unusual anymore. The paper provides a review on how such high performance gratings can be realized by electron-beam lithography and accompanying technologies. The approaches are demonstrated by different examples. The first example is the design and fabrication of the grating for the Radial-Velocity-Spectrometer of the GAIA-mission of the ESA. The second grating is a reflective pulse compression element with no wavelength resonances due to an optimized design.
