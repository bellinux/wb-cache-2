500|$|Shanina's {{personal}} life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, {{she wrote in}} her diary, [...] "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [...] has been killed... <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me,</b> I know, and I him... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [...] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she [...] "is flogging into her head that [...] loves" [...] a man named Nikolai, although he [...] "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote {{that she did not}} think about marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E
500|$|... "East to West" [...] is a {{contemporary}} Christian song lasting four minutes and 26 seconds. It {{was written in}} common time in the key of F minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute. The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, [...] "East to West" [...] deals {{with the concept of}} forgiveness, and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin. Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that: [...] "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. We cut ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that he handles forgiveness like we would. We know he forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'". In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: [...] "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me</b> so much that He’s choosing to remember that against me no more, all because of Jesus".|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt studied acting at the Conservatory from January 1860 until 1862 {{under two}} {{prominent}} actors of the Comédie Française, Joseph-Isidore Samson and Jean-Baptiste Provost.

2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>me,</b> or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E
