2500|$|On 20 October 1966, President Johnson {{arrived in}} Australia at Holt's {{invitation}} for a three-day state visit, {{the first to}} Australia by a serving U.S. President. The tour marked the first major anti-war demonstrations staged in Australia. In Sydney, protesters lay {{down in front of}} the car carrying Johnson and the Premier of New South Wales, Robert Askin (prompting Askin's notorious order to [...] "Run over the bastards"). In Melbourne, a crowd estimated at 750,000 turned out to welcome Johnson, although a vocal anti-war contingent demonstrated against the visit by throwing paint bombs at Johnson's car and chanting [...] "LBJ, LBJ, how many <b>kids</b> <b>did</b> you kill today?".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year that his parents divorced, Wilson blinded himself in one eye in a fishing accident. He {{suffered}} for hours, but he continued fishing. He did not complain because he was anxious to stay outdoors. He did not seek medical treatment. Several months later, his right pupil clouded over with a cataract. He was admitted to Pensacola Hospital to have the lens removed. Wilson writes, in his autobiography, that the [...] "surgery was a terrifying [...] century ordeal". Wilson was left with full sight in his left eye, with a vision of 20/10. The 20/10 vision prompted him to focus on [...] "little things": [...] "I noticed butterflies and ants more than other <b>kids</b> <b>did,</b> and took an interest in them automatically." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{casualties}} mounted {{and success}} seemed further away than ever, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, [...] "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many <b>kids</b> <b>did</b> you kill today?" [...] Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, {{and was not}} allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where thousands of hippies, yippies, Black Panthers and other opponents of Johnson's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest. Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the [...] "hawks" [...] rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the [...] "doves" [...] rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well known quotes was [...] "the Democratic party at its worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best".|$|E
