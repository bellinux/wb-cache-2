Keepsake claims that Orlov is not a defector, but a plant, tasked with denouncing a high-ranking CIA officer as a Soviet mole in an attempt to bring chaos and distrust to the entire agency.|$|R
2500|$|A {{member of}} Cheka {{was called a}} [...] "chekist".

In an effort to clear his name, Bolan discovered the plot was conceived by Maj. Gen. Greb Strakhov, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB's</b> Department 13 executive action unit. Strakhov had masterminded the Macek plot in revenge for <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> his only son, Kyril Strakhov, a test pilot Bolan had killed during a mission in Afghanistan to recover a top-secret attack helicopter called Dragonfire.|$|R
25|$|Most of {{documents}} of the archive are letters from the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> to the Central Committee about activities of Soviet dissidents and recommendations about the interpretation in newspapers. The letters cover the period from 1968 to 1991 (Brezhnev stagnation). The documents characterize not only Sakharov's activity, but that of other dissidents, {{as well as that}} of highest-position apparatchiks and the KGB. No Russian equivalent of the KGB archive is available.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Sakharov {{was given}} the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union.

25|$|In 1992, the Indian {{newspapers}} Times of India and The Hindu {{published reports}} alleging that Rajiv Gandhi had received {{funds from the}} KGB. The Russian government confirmed this disclosure and defended the payments as necessary for Soviet ideological interest. In their 1994 book The State Within a State, journalists Yevgenia Albats and Catherine Fitzpatrick quoted a letter signed by Viktor Chebrikov, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB,</b> in the 1980s. The letter says the KGB maintained contact with Gandhi, who expressed his gratitude to the KGB for benefits accruing to his family from commercial dealings of a controlled firm. A considerable portion of funds obtained from this channel were used to support his party. Albats later said that in December 1985, Chebrikov had asked for authorisation from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to make payments to family members of Rajiv Gandhi, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The payments were authorised by a resolution and endorsed by the USSR Council of Ministers, and had been paid since 1971. In December 2001, Subramanian Swamy filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court; the Court ordered CBI to ascertain {{the truth of the}} allegations in May 2002. After two years, the CBI told the Court Russia would not entertain such queries without a registered FIR.|$|E

2500|$|January and February 1991 {{would see}} a new level <b>of</b> turmoil in <b>the</b> Baltic republics.

In his Memoirs, Gorbachev asserts that on 12 January he convened <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federation which agreed to political measures to prevent bloodshed, including sending representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federation on a [...] "fact-finding mission" [...] to Vilnius.

500|$|In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 {{that the}} KGB's old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB.</b> Koskov is later {{abducted}} from the safe-house and {{assumed to have}} been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West.

500|$|After {{returning}} from Scandinavia and Czechoslovakia in October 1964, Khrushchev, {{unaware of the}} plot, went on holiday in Pitsunda resort on the Black Sea. Upon his return, his Presidium officers congratulated him {{for his work in}} office. Anastas Mikoyan visited Khrushchev, hinting that he should not be too complacent about his present situation. Vladimir Semichastny, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB,</b> was a crucial part of the conspiracy, as it was his duty to inform Khrushchev if anyone was plotting against his leadership. Nikolay Ignatov, who had been sacked by Khrushchev, discreetly requested the opinion of several Central Committee members. After some false starts, fellow conspirator Mikhail Suslov phoned Khrushchev on 12 October and requested that he return to Moscow to discuss the state of Soviet agriculture. Finally Khrushchev understood what was happening, and said to Mikoyan, [...] "If it's me who is the question, I will not make a fight of it." [...] While a minority headed by Mikoyan wanted to remove Khrushchev from the office of First Secretary but retain him as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the majority, headed by Brezhnev, wanted to remove him from active politics altogether.|$|E

On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> agriculture.

2500|$|Serov {{was removed}} from his post as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> in 1958 after hints by Nikita Khrushchev, who had said that Western {{visitors}} could expect that they [...] "wouldn't see so many policemen around the place" [...] and that the Soviet police force would undergo a restructuring.

50|$|In 1980 Kalugin was demoted to deputy <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>KGB</b> as {{a result}} of an intrigue {{initiated}} by Vladimir Kryuchkov who was at this time a close confidant of Yuri Andropov and had been privately criticized by Kalugin. Kalugin was accused of recruiting an agent twenty years prior whom <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> believed, probably incorrectly, was actually an American spy. This made Kalugin himself seem to be a security risk. He was suspected <b>of</b> working for <b>the</b> CIA, although there was no supporting evidence. Vladimir Kryuchkov, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>KGB</b> and orchestrator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1991 coup plot, alleged that in his time in counterintelligence he failed to discover a single American agent while his successor would allegedly find over a dozen.

5|$|Leonid Brezhnev awarded Tikhonov <b>the</b> Hero <b>of</b> Socialist Labour, {{after being}} advised {{to do so}} by Konstantin Chernenko. Upon Brezhnev's death in 1982, Tikhonov {{supported}} Chernenko's candidacy for the General Secretaryship. Chernenko lost the vote, and Yuri Andropov became General Secretary. It has been suggested that Andropov had plans of replacing Tikhonov with Heydar Aliyev. Historian William A. Clark noted how Aliyev, a former <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Azerbaijani <b>KGB,</b> was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Ministers without Tikhonov's consent; however, Andropov's death in 1984 left Tikhonov secure in his office. Some Western analysts speculated that <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> Andrei Gromyko to the First Deputy Premiership, again without Tikhonov's consent, was a sign that his position within the Soviet hierarchy was weakened. Tikhonov was on a state visit to Yugoslavia when Gromyko was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership.|$|R
