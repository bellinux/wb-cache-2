40|$|Background: Hospital {{cleaning}} {{practices and}} methods for their assessment {{are important for}} healthcare-associated infections prevention. Aims of the study were: i) to assess the daily cleaning procedures of different surfaces in hospital bathrooms with a fluorescent marker, ii) to study correlations between results obtained by this method and microbial contamination. Methods: We enrolled 44 bathrooms of six hospital wards (A, B and C medical; D, E and F surgical) in which we analysed 218 surfaces (basin, toilet seat, flush button, <b>inside</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> light switch and floor). We applied a UV-fluorescent marker to these surfaces and the following day we assigned a score according how completely the marker had been removed. On the floor of each bathroom we also placed Petri dishes to assess bacterial colony forming units (CFU). The Wilcoxon test was used for comparisons between wards, Fisher’s exact test for removal scores comparisons between different objects, Spearman’s coefficient for correlations between CFU score and marker removal score. Results: Ward F proved to be less clean than wards A, B and E (p< 0. 05). Medical unitswere cleaner than surgical ones (p= 0. 0016). Basins were cleaner than the other surfaces (p< 0. 05), toilet seats were dirtier than floors (p= 0. 048) and door handles (p= 0. 013). CFU score and mark removal score {{did not seem to}} be correlated. Conclusions: The UV marker proved to be a practical and effective method for checking cleaning procedures. An early identification of inadequate cleaning practices allows the repetition of them until good hygiene standard are reached. UV marker could replace visual inspection, in a multistep process later including quantitative methods...|$|E

Current {{approaches}} for opening door usually {{focus on the}} recognition of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in a fixed position, {{but in the process}} of door opening, a manipulator with a mobile platform is very important under real-world scenarios, which brings significance to the location and distance measurement of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> when the mobile platform is moving. In this paper, a method for location of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in HSI color space is presented. The image of the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is captured by the kinect for Xbox 360, and is processed in HSI color space, resulting in a rectangle frame fitted to the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> to be displayed in real time.

25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> recessed rear <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and prominent front <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> to give it a coupé look.

50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>handles</b> {{provide a}} {{suitable}} environment for bacteria to spread easily, {{this makes it}} a hotspot for bacteria to gather and create colonies. After {{a study conducted by}} the Worcester Polytechnic institute, WPI, gathered that 1323 bacterial colonies were displaced among 27 <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> This study was conducted on the university campus, an area which is considered fairly dense in population, which many people will access these doors, providing a host for the bacteria to travel elsewhere. Flu viruses can have the potential to last up to 24 hours on <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> Over this period of time, this gives measure for the bacteria to further spread or even other <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> This bacteria on exposure can be harmful to humans, potentially infecting us with diseases such as e-coli, fungal or other viral infections. Many people may forget the potential for bacteria to thrive on <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and after exposure may touch their face, or other places that may lead to ingesting it into their body.
