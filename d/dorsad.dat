40|$|The {{development}} of cartilaginous structures in cultured sea bream Sparus aurata larvae {{and the timing}} of their ossification was studied. In cultivated sea bream larvae the first cartilaginous structure to be identified was hypural 1 at 4 · 1 mm notochord length (LN). By 5 · 3 mm LN, prior to the onset of ossification, {{it was possible to}} distinguish the following cartilaginous structures: all 23 neural arches, all 13 haemal arches and two of the four pairs of parapophyses. The neural arches 1 – 4 and 15 – 23 were formed on the notochord and elongated dorsally, while neural arches 5 – 14 appeared on the dorsal side of the spinal cord and elongated ventrally. Initiation of ossification occurred at 5 · 7 – 6 · 0 mm standard length (LS) when the cartilaginous ontogeny of the vertebral column was completed. Ossification was coincident with dorsal flexion at the posterior end of the notochord and occurred in a sequential manner: (1) dorsoanteriorly, the cartilaginous neural arches and the centra were the first structures to ossify; (2) ventrad at the centre, at 7 · 0 – 7 · 5 mm LS; (3) posteriorly at 7 · 1 mm LS the hypural complex and urostyle (24 th centrum) were ossified; and (4) <b>dorsad</b> at the centre (neural arches and spines).

40|$|It was {{possible}} to calculate pressure gradients across the interatrial septum in several cases of congenital heart disease. Gradients in cases of interatrial septal defect {{are similar to those}} foundin animals with artificially produced defects. The data are used to form a rounded picture of thehemodynamics of interatrial septal defect. In pulmonic stenosis with interatrial communication, reversal of the usual left-to-right gradient may occur only during atrial systole. Under these circum-stances it is often possible to distinguish a patent foramen ovale with competent valve from aninteratrial septal defect. ATRIAL hemodynamics have been ex-tensively studied in animals'- 7 with or without interatrial communications. Despite the widespread use of right heart catheterization, there is still a paucity of such information in man. During routine right heart catheterization of several patients with congenital heart disease, passage of the catheter through inter-atrial communications made it possible to record pressure pulses from both atria. An analysis of these curves, insofar as it provides information on atrial hemodynamics in man, forms the basis of this report. METHODS The data consisted of atrial pressure pulses from 14 cases with congenital interatrial communications. Seven of these sets of curves were unsuitable for detailed analysis because of artefacts or large re-spiratory variations. However, the data from these discarded cases lend themselves to the same inter-pretation as the seven analyzed in detail. The atrial pressure curves were recorded from each atrium in quick succession, using the Sanborn capacitance manometer (fig. 1). A simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (lead II) served as a time reference. The patients were supine and breath-ing quietly. The zero level was 5 cm. <b>dorsad</b> to the angle of Louis.

The genitalia and some anatomical details of this species are illustrated. A new genus, Anidiocerus, is described to include another species from Taiwan with the habitus somewhat similar to some Idiocerus and to Idioceroides. The Idiocerinae are redefined. IDIOCERINAE REDEFINED Because of the momentary difficulty I had in placing Idioceroides I think {{it is helpful to}} redefine the Idiocerinae. Idiocerinae: head clearly wider than pronotum, the appendix of the forewing large, the body slender and wedge-shaped, frons expanding <b>dorsad,</b> vertex relatively short and between 5 to 13 x wider than median length, anterior and posterior margins of vertex evenly curved and parallel or very nearly so, ocelli in front and usually almost halfway between eye and middle of vertex and not too high on the face, anterior margin of pronotum not extending beyond anterior margins of eyes, frontal suture ending between antennal pit and ocellus, forewing bare between veins; style slender with apophysis simple and curved outward, or, apophysis straight with curved process on inner apical margin extending upward and outward and reaching down towards outer margin that extend as an outer shelf. The prontal suture extending beyond the antennal pit has been used by DeLong (1948) to separate Idiocerinae (as Eurymelinae in his paper) from Bythoscopinae and Agallinae as in both it ends at the antennal pit. The length and position of this suture is of generic importance in Idiocerinae. The large appendix of the forewing easily separates Idiocerinae from these 2 subfamilies.

The average R-R, P-R, Q-T, and T-Q intervals, and the QRS duration did not differ among the dwarf subgroups. The average R-R, P-R, Q-T and T-Q intervals were 0. 73, 0. 20, 0. 35, and 0. 39 second, respectively, in dwarfs. These were significantly longer than the average intervals of 0. 63, 0. 16, 0. 32 and 0. 30 second, in normal Hereford cattle of Manning. Average QRS duration in dwarfs was 0. 07 second and was near 0. 08 second in normal Herefords found by Manning. The P, QRS and T wave forms of dwarfs did not differ specifically from those found in normal Hereford calves. The directions and potentials along P, QRS and T axes were determined from analysis of leads S-I (left forelimb position positive and right forelimb position negative), aVF (left hind limb connection positive and pooled right forelimb and left forelimb connection negative), and S-aVF (pre scapular position positive and pooled right forelimb and left forelimb connection negative). The average P-axis potentials of CM, CF, SCF, BF and DF dwarfs were 0. 25, 0. 29, 0. 31, 0. 32, and 0. 35 millivolts, respectively; the average QRS-axis potentials were 0. 91, 0. 78, 0. 85, 0. 89, and 0. 96 millivolts; and the average T-axis potentials were 0. 34, 0. 46, 0. 54, 0. 54, and 0. 59 millivolts. The P-axis potentials of dwarfs were frequently higher than those for normal Hereford cattle reported by Van Arsdel. The average QRS-axis potentials of dwarfs ranged from 0. 40 to 1. 43 millivolts, while those of normal Hereford cattle of Van Arsdel ranged from 0. 58 to 1. 48 millivolts. The T-axis potentials of dwarfs ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 88 millivolts, while those of normal Hereford cattle of Van Arsdel ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 85 millivolts. The CF dwarfs had significantly lower average P, QRS and T potentials than did DF dwarfs. The P and T axis potentials were significantly lower in CM than in CF, SCF, BF and DF dwarfs. The P axes pointed ventrad, caudad and sinistrad in most dwarfs. The cones of the directions of P axes of CM, CF, SCF, BF, and DF dwarfs overlapped, and differences between cones were not marked. The P axes of the normal Herefords of Van Arsdel also pointed, in general, ventrad, caudad and sinistrad. The QRS axes were oriented cephalad, <b>dorsad</b> and sinistrad {{in the majority of}} the CM and CF dwarfs. The QRS axes of SCF, BF and DF dwarfs were oriented cephalad or caudad, <b>dorsad,</b> and dextrad or sinistrad. The T axes pointed ventrad, cephalad and dextrad or ventrad, caudad and sinistrad in most dwarfs. Differences among T axes of the dwarf subgroups were not marked. The T axes were oriented dextrad in 46 percent of the dwarfs and in 92 percent of the normal Hereford cattle of Van Arsdel. The average QRS/P angle was 141, 140, 128, 121, and 112 degrees in CM, CF, SCF, BF, and DF dwarfs, respectively, and was significantly higher in CM and CF dwarfs than in BF and DF dwarfs. The QRS/P angle ranged from 72 to 171 degrees in dwarfs and from 73 to 180 degrees in the normal Herefords. The average QRS/T angle was 130, 133, 145, 146, and 140 degrees in CM, CF, SCF, BF, and DF dwarfs and was not significantly different among dwarf subgroups. The QRS/T angle ranged from 94 to 172 degrees in dwarfs and from 91 to 178 degrees in the normal Hereford cattle of Van Arsdel.

40|$|As to {{the origin}} of the {{pulmonary}} vein, there are two theories held by the earlier investigators. One holds that the anlage of the pulmonary vein grows out through the dorsal mesocardium toward the lung buds as an endothelial proliferation from the sinus venosus; the other view asserts that this vein arises from an indifferent preexisting plexus which connects the lung buds and the sinus venosus. On the further developmental stages of the vein there are also some interesting problems which were less studied, namely: 1) The connection between the pulmonary vein and the systemic circulation. 2) The position of the opening of pulmonary vein in the heart primordia. 3) The length and the direction of the common pulmonary vein. In an effort to solve these questions, the author has selected the embryos of Uroloncha domestica Flower for investigation. A large majority of the embryos were fixed in Zenker's fluid, and stained with borax carmine. After the subsequent treatment in the usual manner, these specimens were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections with a thickness of 10 microns. A number of models were prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of these experiments, the following summary and conclusions may be made: 1) The anlage of the pulmonary vein first grows out in the embryo 4. 0 mm. in length with 20 somites as an endothelial proliferation from the sinus venosus. 2) The pulmonary opening is found in the median plane of the sinus venosus at an early stage of development, and when the interatrial septum is formed, the opening migrates from the median plane to the left. Consequently, the pulmonary vein empties into the left atrium dorsally. 3) The pulmonary vein is connected with the systemic circulation by a small branch to the post-caval plexus. 4) The direction of the common pulmonary vein is toward dextro-dorsad from the pulmonary opening, and in the growth of the heart, this direction migrates from dextro-dosad to <b>dorsad.</b> 5) The length of the common pulmonary vein is increased as the pulmonary anlage develops, but at the later stage of development it is decreased and the vein is gradually absorbed into the atrial wall...|$|E

Andrews, genitalia KS 017 [SDMC] A–D Heraclides cresphontes, USA: Georgia: Clark Co. July 2009, genitalia KS 009 E Morphometric measurements {{performed on}} genitalia and facies and plotted in two dimensions. Horizontal axis is a weighted {{average of the}} three genitalic measures: 0. 6 *"U-B Angle" + 0. 2 * (B−A) /(C−B) + 0. 2 *G/H. "U-B Angle" is measured in radians. Vertical axis is a weighted average of the four facies measures: 0. 15 *"YL" + 0. 4 *F/P + 0. 4 *T/V + 0. 05 W/D, where "YL" is equal to 0 or 1, if yellow line on the neck is separated into spots or continuous, respectively. Measured distances are indicated on the illustrations. Each of the two (genitalic and facies) linear combinations of measures completely segregates Heraclides rumiko (red points) from Heraclides cresphontes (blue points) specimens (not from central Texas) with a hiatus. Even a single measure "U-B Angle" identifies all specimens correctly, except # 12, which has a brachium strongly curved <b>dorsad.</b> Specimen localities: Heraclides cresphontes: 1.

40|$|The dendrobatid genus Silverstoneia is a clade of forest-dwelling frogs {{that share}} small adult size (II, male nurse frogs (known in four species), and larvae {{possessing}} an umbelliform oral disc with few to many submarginal papillae and medially emarginate posterior labium (also known in four species). The clade is distributed from Costa Rica to southern Departamento del Valle del Cauca in western Colombia and includes eight species, five {{of which are}} described herein as new species. As in all species of Dendrobatoidea, in Silverstoneia the distal tendon of insertion of the m. semitendinosus inserts <b>dorsad</b> to the distal tendon of the mm. gracilis complex and is strapped to the dorsal edge of the inner surface of the mm. gracilis complex by a unique binding tendon. The species of Silverstoneia may be diagnosed {{on the basis of}} adult size, adult ventral coloration, thigh coloration, and degree of expansion of finger III in adult males; additionally, there are clear species differences among the known tadpoles. Taxonomic comments are given for three previously named species: Silverstoneia erasmios (Rivero and Serna), S. flotator (Dunn), and S. nubicola (Dunn). We were unable to distinguish erasmios from nubicola. However, only females of erasmios are known and its validity needs confirmation. The species S. flotator sensu lato and S. nubicola sensu lato occur north through Panama to Costa Rica; they are distinct from one another, but some intraspecific variation suggests the possible presence of unnamed sibling species. The specimen long recognized as the type of S. flotator is not the holotype, which we consider lost; however, ample material is available from the well-known type locality (Barro Colorado Island) and neotype designation is not needed. Five new species are described—all endemic to low and moderate elevations on the Pacific versant of Colombia: Silverstoneia dalyi (p. 5), S. gutturalis (p. 17), S. minima (p. 22), S. minutissima (p. 29), and S. punctiventris (p. 34). Philip A. Silverstone-Sopkin (Universidad del Valle, Sección de Botánica) generously provided crucial locality and other data for the material he collected in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. Robert Bezy and David Kizirian (LACM), John E. Cadle (MCZ), and William E. Duellman and Linda Trueb (KU) made sizeable loans of specimens under their care. In Colombia, Santiago Ayerbe (MHNUC), Fernando Castro (UVC), John D. Lynch (ICN), Yaneth Muñoz (IAvH), and Vivian Páez (MHNUA) provided space and access to specimens, and John D. Lynch provided long-distance confirmations of several observations. Lucas Barrientos (MHNUA and ICN) {{went to great lengths to}} collect specimens of Silverstoneia erasmios to be included in this study. John E. Cadle (MCZ) and John Simmons (KU) provided important information in our attempt to track down the holotype of Silverstoneia flotator. We are especially grateful to Kent Beaman and Jeff Seigel (LACM) for their patience in answering our many requests for additional data. Grant's field work with Silverstoneia was facilitated by Wilmar Bolívar-G., David Fajardo, David Huff, Pablo Lehmann, Juán Pablo López, Jaime Ramírez, and Martha Solís. The Boroboro Emberó community, led by Efrén Chamorro, willingly shared their knowledge of local fauna and granted access to their territory. Grant's initial work on this project was funded by an American Museum of Natural History Collection Study Grant in 1998 and subsequently by Graduate Student Fellowships from the American Museum and the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERC), Columbia University, an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DEB 0309226; awarded to T. G. and D. R. Frost), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico Proc. 307001 / 2011 - 3, and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo Proc. 2012 / 10000 - 5. Fieldwork in the Chocó was partially funded through donations to the Kelowna Museum by Larry Bell and the Bond family; funding was organized at the Kelowna Museum by Dan Bruce. Equipment was provided by a grant from Idea Wild. Finally, special thanks are reserved for Fernando Castro (UVC), who provided direct support for Grant's research and whose efforts to facilitate and carry out herpetological research in western Colombia continue to increase our understanding of the diversity of amphibians and reptiles in that crucially important region. Myers's fieldwork in Chocoan Colombia was initiated in 1970 in collaboration with the late John W. Daly—under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History, the National Institutes of Health, and the late F. Carlos Lehmann, then director of the Museo Departamental de Historia Natural in Calí. Sources of financial support for the Myers-Daly Colombian expeditions included contracts and grants to Myers from the National Institutes of Health, the Lincoln Ellsworth Fund of the American Museum of Natural History, the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, the Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories, Astra Läkemedal AB (Sweden), and the Phipps Foundation. Myers also is grateful for courtesies rendered in support of this work by authorities in the Seccion de Recursos Naturales, CVC (Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca). Euclides Posada Montealegre provided valuable field assistance over the years. This study was completed with support from Robert G. Goelet, former president and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of the American Museum of Natural History, whose funding allowed the preparation of illustrations. Pen-and-ink drawings were executed by Patricia J. Wynne; photographs of most preserved specimens were taken by Peter Goldberg. For reading and commenting on the manuscript, we are grateful to W. Ronald Heyer, William M. Lamar, and Jay M. Savage...|$|E
