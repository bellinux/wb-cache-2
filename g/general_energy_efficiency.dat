Such storage is generally used in order to smooth out the time lag between the acquisition {{and the use of}} energy, for example by using heat water tanks within heating systems. In this work we use a multi-agent system in order to maintain and operate distributed thermal storage among a large group of buildings in a district heating system.

The processes we consider are the pulp and paper industry, the production of crude steel, cement, and primary aluminium. Together they represent about 34 % of the energy consumption in the German industry. To analyse the time series, we use the experience curve approach, which is widely used for assessing the dynamics of specific costs for energy technologies, but has so far only rarely been applied to analyse energy-efficiency developments. We use the specific energy consumption as an indicator of the energy efficiency improvement and the cumulative production as an indicator of experience. The results show learning rates in the range of 3. 5 - 9. 5 % for the specific primary energy consumption, that is doubling the cumulative production volumes results in 3. 5 - 9. 5 % lower energy consumption. Using available forecasts for industrial production shows efficiency improvements of 4. 0 % by 2020 and 6. 9 % by 2035 compared to 2007 as the average across all processes considered. Further, the results reveal huge improvements in energy efficiency for the period after WW 2 and a rather slow improvement in the last two decades for many processes.

40|$|The role {{of cities}} in {{mitigating}} GHG emissions and thus tackling global warming has gained importance {{over the last}} years. Many cities have developed climate action plans, primarily to achieve long-term "low-carbon" mitigation goals set by national governments or (inter) national agreements. A mere adoption of high level targets, however, raises the question whether these targets are applicable for cities with very different framework conditions. We {{argue that it is}} crucial to understand the socio-economic, geophysical, spatial, infrastructural and political framework of a city - a broad approach, which is generally missing in climate action plans. Thus, determining drivers and barriers for future development paths is neglected by local policies, which leads to a gap between ambition (target) and reality (implementation). We exemplarily examine this hypothesis for the shrinking city of Oberhausen (Germany). Oberhausen, located in the Ruhr area,is a typical old industrial region, which has seen a decline of its industrial basis over the last decades. We analysed historical data and developed scenarios until 2030. Both show a significant decrease in CO 2 emissions. A closer look, however, reveals that the reduction is primarily due to the economic transformation (less manufacturing, more service industry, accompanied by a decrease in population) and <b>general</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> developments following the implementation of national and EU policies. Although the city has implemented–and will further implement - many instruments and policies to reduce CO 2 emissions, local barriers such as unemployment, low rents, low income, high per capita debts, etc. dramatically reduce the city's capacity for action. The results show that Oberhausen's emission reductions do not reflect active energy policies but are mainly driven by an economic decline. To reach ambitious reduction targets, however, the city needs to be enabled to take action in achieving appropriate and reasonable targets...|$|E

The agent system consist of producer agents responsible for valuing the necessary heat load management, consumer agents managing the quality of service in individual buildings while consenting to participate in heat load management and a market agent acting as a mediating layer between the producer and consumer agents. The market agent uses an auction-like process in order to coordinate the heat load management among the consumer agents, while the producer agents use load forecasting in order to evaluate the need for heat load management at any given point in time. A consumer agent uses continues feedback regarding indoor climate in order to uphold quality of service while par- ticipating in heat load management.

Model based scenarios are expected to reduce the uncertainties. However, {{rather than trying to}} exactly predict the future or the impact of a certain instrument, the core objective is to understand the drivers affecting the impact of policies on future energy demand in buildings. We will draw nearer to this objective by a comparative analysis of policy scenarios in 9 EU Member States (MSs) and EU- 28 as a whole. Thus, the key research questions of this paper are: (1) What impact on energy demand, CO 2 -emissions and public costs do various policies trigger in scenarios for EU MSs and the EU- 28 ? (2) What drives the differences between the scenarios in various countries and policy settings? (3) How do the policies compare in terms of their consistency with long-term targets of energy savings and CO 2 -reductions? We build this research on three policy sets which were developed in the IEE project ENTRANZE in a discussion process with policy makers: one policy set reflecting current policy instruments and two others with more innovative and ambitious approaches. The potential effect of these policy sets was analysed with the bottom-up model Invert/EE-Lab. The model is based on a disaggregated description of the building stock, and its building and HVAC components. The investment decision for various retrofit measures and HVAC systems is modelled under consideration of the characteristics of various country specific agent groups (e. g. low-income households, elderly people, ownership types etc). The results show a wide range of energy savings for space heating, hot water, cooling and lighting of less than 10 % to more than 30 % from 2008 - 2030.

40|$|In 1973 {{and again}} in 1979 oil prices {{increased}} dramatically forcing many developed and developing nations to begin programmes of energy conservation in different areas of industry. I. R Iran as an oil producing and exporting country never felt the full effect of these global oil shortages. Therefore, {{it was one of}} the few countries in the world not to invest much time or money in the study of energy conservation. Recent studies have shown that in less than two decades domestic oil consumption and Iranian oil production will balance. When this happens Iran will lose its revenue from oil exports, upon which it is dependent for foreign currency, and may even have to begin to import energy. Therefore, Iran is not only behind most countries in the investigation of energy conservation technology but is facing severe shortages. This thesis studies Iran's energy production, consumption, and outlines the possibilities for energy conservation in Iran. Chapters 1 through 4 of this work introduce Iran, its geography and location and also provide a synopsis of its current energy situation. Chapter 2 explains Iran's energy balance, outlining the production and consumption of the different fuels used in Iran. Chapter 3 looks at energy demand forecasts as well as price and income elasticities. It is this chapter that highlights Iran's impending energy crisis. Chapter 4 discusses the <b>general</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> potential and obstacles to that energy efficiency in Iran. This chapter touches on the subjects of fuel prices and the institutions set up to control energy. Chapter 5 looks at energy conservation in Industry. It is divided into two main parts; first, a general look at industrial energy conservation techniques and practices in developed and developing nations; second, a specific look at energy conservation in Iranian industry. The latter section is itself divided into three parts; one, an energy audit of the National Industries Organization; two, energy conservation in the cement industry with a specific case study done at the Tehran cement factory; and, three, a general look at energy conservation in the glass industry, with a specific case study done at the Ghazvin Glass Company. Chapter 6 examines energy conservation in Transportation. It opens with a general overview of technical and managerial aspects of energy conservation in transportation in general around the world. Next, it discusses potential for energy conservation related to transportation in Iran. Chapter 7 discusses energy conservation in Mining. There has been very little work done on this subject, especially when compared to the information available on energy conservation in transportation and industry. Therefore, a special study was carried out in this field. This study identified a number of possible areas of energy conservation in mining. A separate section of Chapter 7 describes the Iranian mining sector and notes that its growth will necessitate quite a lot of work on energy conservation in that sector. Chapters 8 and 9 examine Employment and the Environmental aspects of energy conservation. First the subjects are examined in a general way and then they are discussed specifically for the case of Iran. Chapter 10 contains the conclusion and recommendations for every chapter of this work. The study of energy production and use in Iran which is described and discussed in this thesis is related to recommended actions for the future.

40|$|Greenhouse gas (and other pollutant) {{emissions}} from energy use are now {{taken to be}} a problem both internationally and for individual national and regional governments. A number of mechanisms are being employed to reduce energy consumption demand as part of climate and energy policies internationally. A central policy focus is increased efficiency in the use of energy. However, the straightforward link between increased <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reduced <b>energy</b> consumption has been questioned. This is due to the notion of the ‘rebound effect’. Rebound occurs when improvements in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> actually stimulate the direct and indirect demand for energy in production and/or consumption. It is triggered by the fact that an increase in the efficiency in the use of energy acts to reduce the implicit price of energy, or the price of effective energy services for each physical unit of energy used. Thus, it is an economic phenomenon. The rebound effect implies that measures taken to reduce energy use might lead to increases in carbon emissions, or at least not offset them to the extent anticipated. It is possible to distiguish between direct rebound effects in energy consumption in the activity where <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> has increased, indirect rebound effects from income and substitutuion effects and economy-wide rebound effects (impacts on macro-level energy use).

40|$|After {{reviewing}} {{land based}} freight growth trends nationally and internationally, this thesis discusses the main parameters governing fuel consumption, {{as well as}} past approaches in modelling road and rail energy consumption. Past work on comparing these two main modes is also reviewed here. The review included ways of estimating energy consumption of a complete freight task i. e., from origin to destination. Mathematical models estimating modal energy consumption are presented in this thesis. Modal energy consumption is a complex function to be approximated in practice due to numerous variables affecting their outcome. Energy demands are particularly sensitive to changes in vehicle characteristics such as mass and size; route parameters such as grade and curvature; traffic conditions such as level of congestion; and less sensitive to ambient conditions, such as temperature and altitude. There is a large set of energy estimation models available to transportation planners. Unfortunately, unless simple relationships are established for energy estimation and modal comparison, their application in freight movement planning and corridor development becomes computationally prohibitive. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} modal freight energy comparison tool to quantify the energy advantage from mode choice, corridor development and vehicle types and loading improvements. The thesis also describes the used modelling processes and the trade-offs between model complexity and data quality. The tool developed in this thesis is based on well established relationships between energy consumption and traffic flow, route and vehicle operating characteristics for road freight movement. The rail freight component was developed from equations of motion together with parameters obtained from past studies. The relationships have been enhanced to fit the purpose of corridor level comparative analysis. The comparison tool has been implemented using a spreadsheet based approach developed specifically to calculate the total door to door energy consumption for given task options. A series of linked sheets enable the user to: specify all necessary inputs; estimate road and rail energy by trip segment. The outputs consist of trip segment energy demand and total energy efficiency of each option. A case study approach, for aiding in model development and testing, is presented. Toowoomba second range crossing in Southern Queensland, Australia (section between below Postman's Ridge and Gowrie Junction) was selected. Four options considered include existing and proposed road and rail corridors. The existing rail and road corridors could be taken as a typical poor case, with very high grades and sharp curvatures. The proposed new road section has a relaxed curvature and gradient. The section of proposed rail corridor, under consideration here, still contains a high grade section. However, the proposed track length is considerably shorter than the base-case. The new proposed train alignment was found as the most efficient mode and the existing trains as the least efficient mode when measured based on absolute expected fuel gain (litres/tonnage of freight moved). This could be attributed to the improvement in curvature and load carrying capacity. However, when the options are compared in terms of litres/ 1000 NTK, the new train option did not show a significant advantage. Furthermore, the developed model was applied on some simulated cases to test the functionality of other aspects of the model. The total door-to-door energy consumption and the efficiency were compared for all the simulated cases. It showed that the energy efficiency of scenarios varies exponentially with the variation in the ratio of road pickup and delivery legs to the rail line-haul length. In <b>general,</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the intermodal options was found to be better unless the best case of the road and the worst case of intermodal option was compared. The modelling approaches presented in the thesis and the comparison model developed in this study could be used for several purposes namely: to assess the energy (and hence greenhouse gas) implications of specific modal freight movements; to aid in the economic and environmental evaluation of transport options; and to assess the potential for energy efficiency gains from vehicle and infrastructure improvements.

However, there is a debate in the literature as to whether the impact of improved <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> on reducing <b>energy</b> use might be partially, or more than wholly, offset through "rebound" and "backfire" effects. This paper clarifies the theoretical conditions under which such effects would occur and explores their likely significance using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Scottish economy. We find that for Scotland a <b>general</b> improvement in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the production sectors of the economy initially produces rebound effects that eventually grow into backfire. Energy use ultimately increases in response to an efficiency gain and the ratio of GDP to CO 2 emissions falls. The economic factors underpinning rebound effects are straightforward: <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvements result in an effective cut in energy prices, which produces output, substitution, competitiveness and income effects that stimulate energy demands. However, the presence of strong rebound or even backfire does not mean that efficiency-enhancing policies are irrelevant: rather it suggests that such policies operating alone are insufficient to generate environmental improvements. The implication is that a co-ordinated portfolio of energy policies is required...|$|R
40|$|For some indicators, {{longer time}} series {{back to the}} 1970 s are useful, too. These data are, however, only {{included}} in the ODYSSEE database for the former West Germany (in the following called ex-FRG). Therefore, for some important indicators the long-term development since the 1970 s will also be given in this report using data for the ex-FRG. The report starts with a review on data collection and the recent trends in the <b>general</b> context of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> i. e. economic and energy consumption development, energy and environmental policy and energy price trends. Afterwards, the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> trends are described both {{at the level of}} the whole economy (Chapter 3) and at sectoral level (Chapter 4 to 8). The annex not only includes some further data remarks but also a special case study for Germany about the development of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the industrial sector and the link to causal factors (Annex 4).

40|$|While {{technology}} is delivering increasingly sophisticated and powerful chip designs, {{it is also}} imposing alarmingly high energy requirements on the chips. One way {{to address this problem}} is to manage the energy dynamically. Unfortunately, current dynamic schemes for energy management are relatively limited. In addition, they manage energy either for <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> or for temperature control, but not for both simultaneously. In this paper, we design and evaluate for the first time an energy-management framework that tackles both <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and temperature control in a unified manner. We call this <b>general</b> approach Dynamic <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> and Temperature Management (DEETM). Our framework combines many energy-management techniques and can activate them individually or in groups in a fine-grained manner according to a given policy. The goal of the framework is two-fold: maximize energy savings without extending application execution time beyond a given tolerable limit, and guarantee that the temperature remains below a given limit while minimizing any resulting slowdown. The framework successfully meets these goals. For example, it delivers a 40 % energy reduction with only a 10 % application slowdown. ...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{of energy}} {{use is a}} vital concept in {{providing}} solutions {{to many of the}} energy challenges in our world today. Large chemical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electrical systems require <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> as one of the important aspects of operating systems. At the micro-scale, the built environment experiences progressive changes in energy consumption. There is steady increase in the annual energy consumption of households as a result of population growth, increase of economic activity and increased use of domestic appliances. The drive to reduce this growing trend has stimulated many mechanisms {{such as the use of}} energy labels on domestic appliances. Home appliance manufacturers research into developing energy-efficient products with the end-goal of making consumer devices more energy efficient. One important step towards <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and savings in the built environment is the introduction of Smart Home Energy Management Systems. (SHEMS). This paper analyses how the implementation of such solutions could contribute to energy savings and enhance efficiency for residential customers. The paper presents a <b>general</b> overview of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures focusing on residential loads. It further highlights, via modelling and simulation the potentials of Smart Home Energy Management Solutions for future domestic applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a computable general {{equilibrium}} (CGE) {{framework to}} investigate {{the conditions under which}} rebound effects may occur in response to increases in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the UK national economy. Previous work for the UK has suggested that rebound effects will occur even where key elasticities of substitution in production are set close to zero. The research reported in this paper involves carrying out a systematic sensitivity analysis, where relative price sensitivity is gradually introduced into the system, focusing specifically on elasticities of substitution in production and trade parameters, in order to determine conditions under which rebound effects become a likely outcome. The main result is that, while there is positive pressure for rebound effects even where (direct and indirect) demands for energy are very price inelastic, this may be partially or wholly offset by negative income, competitiveness and disinvestment effects, which also occur in response to falling energy price. The occurrence of disinvestment effects is of particular interest. These occur where falling energy prices reduce profitability in domestic energy supply sectors, leading to a contraction in capital stock in these sectors, which may in turn lead to rebound effects that are smaller in the long run than in the short run, a result that runs contrary to the predictions of previous theoretical work in this area. <b>general</b> equilibrium, <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> rebound effects, disinvestment...|$|R
40|$|This reports {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> trends in Germany {{on the basis of}} <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> indicators extracted from the ODYSSEE data base, maintained and updated in the framework of the SAVE programme. This analysis focuses on the period 1990 - 2000. The year 1990 could however not be considered for all indicators, because most of the economic and some energy consumption data for Germany are only available since 1991. The analysis also examines the policies and measures implemented in the field of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> with a focus on the latest years until February 2002. All these measures are extracted from the MURE data base also updated within the SAVE programme. The report starts with a review on data collection and the recent trends in the <b>general</b> context of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> i. e. economic and energy consumption development, energy and environmental policy and energy price trends (Chapter 2). Afterwards, the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> trends are described both {{at the level of the}} whole economy and at sectoral level (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4 the development in one sector - transport - is described more detailed. For the other sectors (industry, residential, tertiary) Annex 2 presents a selection of commented graphs that show the trends for the main indicators. An overview of the most important measures in the field of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> policy in the end-use sectors in Germany is given in Annex 1. A more detailed description of the most recent measures is presented in Annex 3. (orig.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{many reasons}} {{building}} simulation programs {{are still not}} recognised as useful design support tools {{to the same extent}} as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or cost-estimating software. There is a strong perception that simulations are time consuming, costly, slow and require expensive or specialised equipment and knowledge that increase design costs. Additionally, simplifications applied to model description, algorithm inaccuracy, or deviations inherent to weather data treatment methods result in poor matches between measurements and predictions, which decrease confidence in obtained results. Finally, complex tools and interfaces raise doubts among potential users. In <b>general</b> terms, <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> is a recent concern in Brazil, but has clearly come to the discussion forefront among all construction sector stakeholders. In architectural design teaching at the undergraduate level in Brazil, environmental comfort and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> have been traditionally kept as separate knowledge domains. To overcome these problems a new discipline has been introduced at the University of Campinas, UNICAMP in Brazil following a bioclimatic design studio, to consolidate the acquired knowledge and test concepts on student’s designs. To evaluate this course an experimental follow-up research is currently underway. This paper discusses the contextual framework that motivated and founded the approach for the introduction of simulation as both a decision support tool and a design teaching resource. The bioclimatic design studio given in 2005 provided students a contact with simulation tools and was used to assess the suitability of the chosen tool for such experience...|$|R
