Both Williams and Ferrari had another good session, while Lotus got both their drivers in the top ten, raising hopes for a points finish on Sunday. Red Bull continued to struggle, with Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat down in 15th and 18th and Ricciardo's car stopping {{at the end of}} pit lane due to engine problems. Between them were the once more struggling McLaren drivers.|$|E

A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper's ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty's forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1938 {{he played}} eight games for England, {{starting}} with defeat to a Scotland team containing a young Bill Shankly. He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade drove past a café the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team {{that they had}} to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|Russell had {{not broken}} the French line and her {{opponent}} Témeraire <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with Trajan and Eole. Russell then fired on several passing French ships before joining Leviathan in attacking {{the centre of}} the French line. Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign). Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line {{on the far side of}} the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action.|$|E

By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>of</b> him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to}} the money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

A dish of roasted meat was lying before him, and his eyes fairly glared as he turned them from me to the viand, {{in a way to}} render it a little {{doubtful}} whether I was a welcome visitor. But that honest old principle of seamen which never refuses to share equally with an ancient mess-mate, <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> even <b>of</b> his voracity.|$|R

50|$|Suffolk {{knew that}} {{this would not be}} popular in England, but Henry insisted on the truce, having heard that the Count of Nevers was {{preparing}} to offer marriage to Margaret himself.

All of the concessions in the treaty were made by England and France <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truce. Henry believed it was a first step towards a lasting peace; Charles intended to use it purely for military advantage.|$|R
50|$|In March 1978, the Brewers traded {{him with}} Jim Slaton to the Tigers for Ben Oglivie. <b>The</b> Brewers {{definitely}} <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> end <b>of</b> that deal—Folkers never {{appeared in a}} big league game with the Tigers, while Slaton only pitched one season with them (it was, however, arguably his best season in the Majors.
