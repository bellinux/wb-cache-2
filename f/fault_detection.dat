40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that induction machine faults introduce phase and/or amplitude modulation of the stator currents. Hence, demodulation of the stator currents is of high interest for induction machines <b>faults</b> <b>detection</b> and diagnosis. The demodulation techniques can be classified into mono-dimensional and multi-dimensional approaches. The monodimensional techniques include the synchronous demodulator, the Hilbert transform, the Teager energy operator and other approaches. The multi-dimensional approaches include the Concordia transform and the Principal Component Analysis. Once the demodulation has been performed, demodulated signals are further processed in order to measure failure severity.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} several decades, {{induction}} machine condition monitoring have received increasing attention from researchers and engineers. Several induction machine <b>faults</b> <b>detection</b> techniques have been proposed {{that are based on}} vibration, temperature, and currents/power monitoring, etc. Motor current signature analysis is a cost-effective method, which has been widely investigated. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that mechanical and electrical induction machine faults can be effectively diagnosed using stator currents demodulation. Therefore, this paper proposes to investigate the use of demodulation techniques for bearing <b>faults</b> <b>detection</b> and diagnosis based on stator currents analysis. If stator currents are assumed to be mono-component signals, the demodulation techniques include the synchronous demodulator, the Hilbert transform, the Teager energy operator, the Concordia transform, the maximum likelihood approach and the principal component analysis. For a multi-component signal, further preprocessing techniques are required such as the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) or the Ensemble EMD (EEMD). The studied demodulation techniques are demonstrated for bearing faults diagnosis using simulation data, issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach-based simulation tool, and experiments on a 0. 75 kW induction machine test bed...|$|R
