5000|$|Charles Blacker Vignoles (31 May 1793 [...] - [...] 17 November 1875) was an {{influential}} British railway engineer, and eponym of the <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
50|$|Seaton rail {{was similar}} to <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> but with the flanged foot angled down to give an {{inverted}} V section that was then used on triangular longitudinal.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{profiles}} of rail include: bullhead rail; grooved rail; [...] "flat-bottomed rail" [...] (<b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> or flanged T-rail); bridge rail (inverted U–shaped used in baulk road); and Barlow rail (inverted V).|$|R
50|$|<b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> was a {{light section}} that today would be classed as {{flat-bottomed}} rail. In its original form it was only about 4 in deep and was used on baulk road interchangeably with bridge rail.|$|R
50|$|The T4 is {{a hybrid}} line. In most cases, French rail lines are {{electrified}} (when applicable) in 1,500 V or 25 kV, and use <b>Vignole</b> <b>rails</b> and a block signal system. These trains travel on the left.|$|R
5000|$|The rails {{were very}} similar to today's {{flat-bottomed}} stock, which {{has become known as}} <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail,</b> and weighed [...] The line was unusual for the day in not using any stone blocks. Part of the way, longitudinal sleepers were used, and part of the way, cross sleepers.|$|R
5000|$|As {{its name}} implies, a rocket sled {{does not use}} wheels. Instead, it has sliding pads, called [...] "slippers", which are curved around {{the head of the}} rails to prevent the sled from flying off the track. [...] The rail {{cross-section}} profile is that of a <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail,</b> commonly used for railroads.|$|R
50|$|The SM&AR {{line had}} {{originally}} been laid with <b>Vignoles</b> (<b>flat</b> <b>bottom)</b> <b>rails</b> of 70 lbs per yard (35 kg/m) in 18 to 24 feet (5.5 to 7.3 metre) lengths, but the northward extension was laid with 75 lb per yard (37 kg/m) bullhead rail. The track limited locomotive weight, and was gradually replaced by 87 lb per yard (43 kg/m) bullhead track, but this took until 1928. Cerney station was renamed South Cerney on 1 July 1924. Blunsdon station closed in September 1924.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{constant}} gradient of 16° 56' (about 30%), {{it was entirely}} built on a viaduct of twelve metal sections, resting on five lattice pillars and two masonry abutments with a foundation of solid brick. A passing loop was provided {{in the middle of}} the route. The <b>Vignole</b> <b>rails</b> weighed , at a track gauge of [...] Safety brakes were provided by a rack rail.|$|R

25|$|MBO55 and -56 {{also had}} {{issues with the}} {{controllers}} and the lubrication of the gear boxes, and the issues were soon corrected. The most troubling issue was a swaying motion when running on the suburban <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rails.</b> The riders complained to no avail until several derailments made the management aware of the severity. A Gullfisk was test-run and {{found to have a}} much smoother ride. A horizontal suspension was added, which helped somewhat to reduce the swaying. This could only be installed on the newer MBO55 and -56 series, as MBO50 had a different bogie design. The issue was never corrected in a satisfactory way.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail</b> is {{the popular}} {{name of the}} {{flat-bottomed}} rail, recognising engineer Charles Vignoles who introduced it to Britain.Charles Vignoles observed that wear was occurring with wrought iron rails and cast iron chairs upon stone blocks, the most common system at that time. In 1836 he recommended flat-bottomed rail to the London and Croydon Railway {{for which he was}} consulting engineer.His original rail had a smaller cross-section than the Stevens rail, with a wider base than modern rail, fastened with screws through the base. Other lines which adopted it were the Hull and Selby, the Newcastle and North Shields, and the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company.|$|R
5000|$|Length: 7 miles, 16.5 chains. Gauge: 4 ft 8½ in. Rails: <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail,</b> 80 lb per linear yard. Fixing: Fang bolts to wooden {{sleepers}} laid 2 feet apart.

Underbridges: 1 brick and 10 wrought iron girder with brick abutments. Signalling: Kemble - 29 working levers and 4 spares; Culkerton - none (siding locked by key on train staff); Tetbury - 8 working levers and 3 spares (all interlocked; line worked by a train staff {{in conjunction with}} the Block Telegraph.|$|R
5000|$|To keep {{construction}} costs down, routes followed the terrain {{as much as}} possible, with gradients as steep as 1:22.22 (4.5%) to 1:20 (5%) compared {{to no more than}} 1:40 (2.5%) on more traditional lines, with the exception of some mountain railways. Curves could have radii of less than 30 m. The rail tracks used were very light; generally <b>Vignoles</b> <b>rail,</b> with mass being [...] depending on the distance. In many cases, lines were laid over road shoulders, which reduced the need to buy land and, above all, limited the need for new bridges and tunnels. But these measures severely limited the maximum operational speed, generally to less than 30 km/h.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>bottom</b> rails {{were still}} seen as {{undesirable}} for British main line railway use, despite their successful use in North America, although some lightly operated British railways used them, generally spiked direct to the sleepers. Under heavy usage, they indent the sleepers severely and the incremental {{cost of a}} base-plate appeared at this early date, to rule the <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> section out.|$|R
