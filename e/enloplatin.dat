40|$|The role of {{glutathione}} (GSH) in {{the effectiveness}} of and resistance to 7 platinum compounds [5 Pt(II) and 2 Pt(IV) drugs] was evaluated in a 8. 6 -fold cisplatin (CDDP) -resistant human small cell lung cancer cell line (GLC 4 /CDDP), the parent GLC 4 line, a 3. 7 -fold CDDP-resistant human embryonal carcinoma cell line (Tera-CP), and the parent Tera line (NTera 2 /D 1). Resistance factors for both CDDP-resistant cell lines were determined after continuous incubation (4 days) with CDDP. Continuous incubation with the other studied platinum drugs revealed complete cross-resistance for carboplatin (CBDCA) and zeniplatin but less for <b>enloplatin</b> (ENLO) and iproplatin in both models. Tetraplatin and lobaplatin showed, respectively, partial and complete cross-resistance in GLC 4 /CDDP but no cross-resistance in Tera-CP.

Tetraplatin and lobaplatin showed, respectively, partial and complete cross-resistance in GLC 4 /CDDP but no cross-resistance in Tera-CP. GSH level, but not glutathione S-transferase activity, of the 4 cell lines correlated with platinum drug concentrations inhibiting cell survival by 50 % after continuous incubation (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 05). GSH depletion by DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (BSO) increased sensitivity, as measured after a 4 -h exposure to the drugs, of GLC 4 /CDDP for CDDP 2. 0 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 7 -fold, for zeniplatin 1. 7 -fold, and almost {{to the level of}} the sensitive GLC 4 for ENLO, whereas no effect was observed for lobaplatin and the Pt(IV) compounds iproplatin and tetraplatin. BSO-modulating effect was higher in the sensitive GLC 4 line for most compounds; therefore reduction of resistance could be achieved only for CDDP and ENLO. In contrast to GLC 4, no modulation occurred in Tera. In Tera-CP BSO increased sensitivity for CDDP 1. 5 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 9 -fold, and for zeniplatin 1. 2 -fold; no effect was observed for ENLO, lobaplatin, and the Pt(IV) compounds. Reduction of CDDP resistance by BSO was known to occur with identical cellular platinum levels and higher Pt-DNA binding in GLC 4 /CCDP. However, pretreatment with BSO followed by 4 h ENLO incubation increased cellular platinum levels in both GLC 4 and GLC 4 /CDDP while Pt-DNA binding remained unchanged. In conclusion, GSH reflected sensitivity to platinum-containing drugs. However, since the involvement of GSH differed between the models and the various platinum drugs, the effect of modulation with BSO was unpredictable...|$|E
