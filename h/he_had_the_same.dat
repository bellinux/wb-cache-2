25|$|As Poglavnik of the NDH, Pavelić had {{full control}} over the state. The oath taken by all {{government}} employees declared that Pavelić represented {{the sovereignty of the}} NDH. His title Poglavnik represented the close ties between the Croatian state and the Ustaše movement, since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> title as leader of the Ustaše. Moreover, Pavelić made all significant decisions, including naming state ministers and leaders of the Ustaše. As the NDH had no functional legislature, Pavelić approved all of the laws, which made him the most powerful person in the state. Through the incorporation of the extreme right-wing of the popular HSS, Pavelić's regime was initially accepted by the majority of Croats in the NDH. The regime also attempted to re-write history by falsely claiming the legacy of the founder of the HSS Stjepan Radić, and that of Croatian nationalist Ante Starčević.|$|E
