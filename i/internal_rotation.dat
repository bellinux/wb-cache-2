5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining <b>internal</b> <b>rotation.</b> Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's <b>internal</b> <b>rotation</b> rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

It is shown that neglecting the internal rotational inertia terms and effects of director gradient made the stress symmetric.

25|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>rotation</b> (or medial rotation) and {{external}} rotation (or lateral rotation) refers to rotation towards (internal) {{or away from}} (external) {{the center of the}} body. For example, the Lotus position posture in yoga requires the legs to be externally rotated.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation,</b> abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation.</b> Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{observation}} {{suggests the}} coexistence of increased <b>internal</b> hip <b>rotation</b> in limbs with clubfoot, thereby providing an additional, and perhaps overlooked, site of deformity {{to account for}} an intoeing gait in these limbs. Furthermore, assuming a genetic basis exists for exaggerated femoral and/or acetabular anteversion, which are the possible cause(s) for increased <b>internal</b> hip <b>rotation,</b> this association could provide another key to the multifactorial etiology of clubfoot. We asked whether such an association exists and retrospectively reviewed 114 children (178 clubfeet). We then tested for an association between clubfoot and increased <b>internal</b> hip <b>rotation.</b> These rotational measurements were compared with published normative data on torsion in children. In cases of unilateral clubfoot, an additional analysis compared the rotational profiles of the affected and unaffected extremities. Increased <b>internal</b> hip <b>rotation</b> occurred more frequently in limbs with idiopathic clubfoot. In patients with unilateral clubfoot, the affected extremities manifested greater <b>internal</b> hip <b>rotation</b> than the unaffected extremities, whereas the latter showed no difference in <b>internal</b> hip <b>rotation</b> compared with normative values. Clinical evaluation of intoeing in children {{with a history of}} clubfoot should include a rotational profile to determine the level(s) of deformity and guide therapeutic intervention...|$|R
25|$|The most {{versatile}} among dialkylboranes is 9-BBN. It exists predominantly as a dimer. It can be distilled without decomposition at 195°C (12mm Hg). Such property allows 9-BBN to react at 60–80°C, and most alkenes react within one hour in such temperature range. Even tetrasubstituted alkenes undergo hydroboration with 9-BBN at elevated temperature. As mentioned before, 9-BBN has excellent regioselectivity in hydroboration of alkenes. It is {{more sensitive to}} subtle steric differences than Sia2BH, because the rigid hetereocyclic substituents prevent <b>internal</b> <b>rotation</b> to relieve steric hindrance in the transition state. Reflecting its greater sensitivity to electronic factors, 9-BBN is more reactive towards alkenes than alkynes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{children}} {{may have a}} slightly raised temperature; high fever and general malaise point to other, more serious conditions. On clinical examination, the child typically holds the hip slightly bent, turned outwards {{and away from the}} middle line (flexion, external rotation and abduction). Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain, especially abduction and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation.</b> The hip can be tender to palpation. The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back, to check when muscle guarding occurs. The unaffected hip and the knees, ankles, feet and spine are found to be normal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inferior}} {{parts of}} latissimus dorsi, {{one of the}} muscles of the upper limb, arises from the posterior third of the iliac crest. Its action on the shoulder joint are <b>internal</b> <b>rotation,</b> adduction, and retroversion. [...] It also contributes to respiration (i.e. coughing). [...] When the arm is adducted, latissimus dorsi can pull it backward and medially until the back of the hand covers the buttocks.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{symptoms}} include hip, knee (hip pathology can refer pain {{to a normal}} knee), or groin pain, exacerbated by hip or leg movement, especially internal hip rotation (with the knee flexed 90°, twisting the lower leg away {{from the center of}} the body). The range of motion is reduced, particularly in abduction and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation,</b> and the patient presents with a limp. Pain is usually mild. Atrophy of thigh muscles may occur from disuse and an inequality of leg length. [...] In some cases, some activity can cause severe irritation or inflammation of the damaged area, including standing, walking, running, kneeling, or stooping repeatedly for an extended period of time. In cases exhibiting severe femoral osteonecrosis, pain is usually a chronic, throbbing sensation exacerbated by activity.|$|E
2500|$|The hip joint, an enarthrodial joint, can be {{described}} as a ball and socket joint. The femur connects at the acetabulum of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage. The labrum lines the circumference of the acetabulum to provide stability and shock absorption. Articular cartilage covers the concave area of acetabulum, providing more stability and shock absorption. [...] Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the psoas muscle and three ligaments. The iliofemoral, or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip hyperextension. The pubofemoral ligament is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, adduction, and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation.</b> When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E

40|$|We have {{observed}} rotational transitions of ethylmethyl ether (CH 3 CH 2 OCH 3) in the 24 - 110 GHz frequency range. We newly assigned the transitions of four Q-branch series for J= 1 - 38 with Ka= 0 - 5 and six R-branch series of b-type transitions for J= 7 - 37 with Ka= 0 - 3. All these assigned transitions were observed to be {{split into two}} or four components due to the <b>internal</b> <b>rotations</b> of the methyl groups. We analyzed the averaged frequencies of the split components {{on the basis of}} the Watson A-reduced Hamiltonian, neglecting the effect of the <b>internal</b> <b>rotations.</b> A total of 122 transitions were fitted to eight molecular parameters to a 1 s standard deviation of 24 kHz. The parameters A, B, C and DJ were improved, and DJK, Dk, dJ and dK were determined for the first time...|$|R
2500|$|Diagnosis {{can usually}} be made by {{palpation}} or by feeling the joint and surrounding tissues, although there is controversy {{as to whether or}} not the degree of subluxation can be measured clinically. [...] If shoulder subluxation occurs, it can become a barrier to the rehabilitation process. [...] Treatment involves measures to support the subluxed joint such as taping the joint, using a lapboard or armboard. [...] A shoulder sling may be used, but is controversial and a few studies have shown no appreciable difference in range-of-motion, degree of subluxation, or pain when using a sling. A sling may also contribute to contractures and increased flexor tone if used for extended periods of time as it places the arm close to the body in adduction, <b>internal</b> <b>rotation</b> and elbow flexion. Use of a sling can also contribute to learned nonuse by preventing the functional and spontaneous use of the affected upper extremity. That said, a sling may be necessary for some therapy activities. Slings may be considered appropriate during therapy for initial transfer and gait training, but overall use should be limited. As the patient begins to recover, spasticity and voluntary movement of the shoulder will occur as well as reduction in the shoulder subluxation. Slings are of no value at this point.|$|E
2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the piriformis muscle of the hip. [...] It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce piriformis syndrome {{at some point in}} the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent this. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the piriformis muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage. [...] The pain is exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip including lifting, prolonged sitting, or walking. The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. During a physical examination, attempts may be made to stretch the irritated piriformis and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg test, the Pace test, the FABER test (flexion, abduction, external rotation), and the FAIR test (flexion, adduction, <b>internal</b> <b>rotation).</b> Conditions to be ruled out include herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upright}} position, it {{prevents}} the trunk from falling backward {{without the need}} for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation</b> of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (<b>internal)</b> <b>rotation</b> while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and <b>internal</b> <b>rotation</b> of the hip joint.|$|E
30|$|Statistically {{significant}} increase in angular displacement error was found in all tests in the affected shoulder compared to the unaffected contralateral shoulder and dominant arm of control subjects. The contralateral unaffected shoulder of patients showed within normal values and no differences with control values.

30|$|In conclusion, {{we found}} that a high-intensity {{activity}} combining stair descent and pivoting produces similar tibial <b>internal</b> <b>rotations,</b> net knee joint external moments and rotational stiffness in ACL deficient knees compared to contralateral ACL intact knees and a knee healthy control group. During running, the ACL intact knees displayed a higher external moment than the ACL deficient knees and the knee healthy control group. This could indicate muscular adaption or a protective strategy in the ACL-injured patients.|$|R
