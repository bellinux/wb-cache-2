5|$|Recognising {{that his}} force {{was at a}} disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group {{showed no signs of}} movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for {{personal}} reasons. Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl would have had to <b>either</b> <b>go</b> through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford's men.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} <b>either</b> <b>go</b> to an inn to recover Musashi's health or make Musashi sleep {{outdoors}} without {{a full recovery}} and with danger he may be attacked by enemies. To pass time, the player may also opt to collect the various action figures -which resemble more detailed models of nearly all the characters and monsters- available at the town toy store which stocks new items {{at the start of}} every chapter. Along the way, Musashi obtains parts from the Legendary Armor which allow him to perform actions such as climbing or performing double jumps.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, MacArthur {{met with}} Curtin and {{detailed}} {{his plans for}} the Western New Guinea campaign, explaining that he would assume direct command of land forces when he reached the Philippines, and suggesting that Blamey could <b>either</b> <b>go</b> with him as an army commander, or remain in Australia as Commander in Chief. The new organisation went into effect in September 1944, with Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth US Army, Lieutenant General Robert Eichelberger's Eighth United States Army, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee's First Australian Army, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead's I Australian Corps and Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps reporting directly to GHQ. Allied Land Forces remained as an important administrative and logistical command, until it was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E

5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to <b>either</b> <b>go</b> after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

25|$|In the event, {{the race}} itself was an anti-climax - no other {{countries}} entered a team. All {{that had to}} be done was for one of the aircraft from the flight to complete the course.

Doctors determined he needed coronary artery bypass surgery; however, no surgeon wanted to perform the operation out of fear of controversy, and Aquino refused to undergo the procedure in the Philippines out of fear of sabotage by Marcos, indicating he would <b>either</b> <b>go</b> to the United States to undergo the procedure or die in his prison cell. On May 8, 1980, First Lady Imelda Marcos arranged for Aquino and his family to leave for the U.S. He underwent the coronary bypass surgery in Dallas, Texas and met with Muslim leaders in Damascus, Syria, before settling with his family in Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding. To solve this problem, the Ming could <b>either</b> <b>go</b> on the offensive and re-establish their positions in the steppe, or concede the transitional zones to the nomads and maintain a defensive and accommodative policy. Over the late 15th and 16th centuries, the choice between the two options {{became the subject of}} fierce debate in the Chinese court and dissension that was sometimes exploited by various political factions {{to get rid of the}} opposition. The decision to build the first major Ming walls was the one of the outcomes of these debates as an acceptable compromise.|$|E
25|$|A Japanese school {{opened in}} Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for {{temporary}} settlers in North America followed. In the {{years prior to}} World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their child might {{go through the same}} discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to <b>either</b> <b>go</b> back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{initially}} reacted angrily to {{news of the}} Royal Navy’s {{attack on}} the French fleet (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him “astonishingly objective” and acknowledging {{that it was the}} right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown “a splendid dignity”. In his broadcast of 8 July he spoke of the “pain and anger” caused by the attack and that it was a “hateful tragedy not a glorious battle”, but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England (sic) or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean “bondage forever” for France. “Our two ancient nations … remain bound to one another. They will <b>either</b> <b>go</b> down both together or both together they will win”.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicles are prequel {{segments}} {{that take}} place during the initial murders of the Origami Killer. The first one, The Taxidermist, was released on 1 April 2010, available for purchase from the PlayStation Network. It was also included with the original game when pre-purchased from selected retailers. The original intention was {{for there to be}} four episodes which would focus on the main characters' backgrounds. In July 2010, David Cage of Quantic Dream announced that future downloadable content would be put on indefinite hiatus due to Heavy Rain: Move Edition taking up the production time allocated to the Chronicles. Once the Move Edition development was completed, the team planned to <b>either</b> <b>go</b> back to working on the Chronicles or move on. Ultimately, the team decided to cancel the rest of the series so that they could focus on Quantic Dream's next title, Beyond: Two Souls. In October 2014, Cage announced that Heavy Rain Chronicles has been cancelled and confirms that the team is currently not working on it.|$|E

Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years.
