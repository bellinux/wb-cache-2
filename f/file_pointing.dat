50|$|M3U is a {{computer}} file format for a multimedia playlist. One common use of the M3U file format is creating a single-entry playlist <b>file</b> <b>pointing</b> to a stream on the Internet.

5000|$|Although Windows {{does not}} provide {{convenient}} tools to create it, Explorer supports a [...] "folder link" [...] or [...] "shell link folder": a folder with the system attribute set, containing a hidden [...] "desktop.ini" [...] (folder customization) file which tells Explorer to look in that same folder for a [...] "target.lnk" [...] shortcut <b>file</b> <b>pointing</b> to another folder. When viewed in Explorer, the shell link folder then appears to have {{the contents of the}} target folder in it—that is, the customized folder becomes the effective shortcut. This technique is used by Microsoft Windows for items like WebDAV folders. The advent of file system links in Windows Vista and up has made shell link folders less useful.|$|E
5000|$|A [...]ZIP file is {{correctly}} {{identified by}} the presence of an end of central directory record which is located {{at the end of the}} archive structure in order to allow the easy appending of new files. If the end of central directory record indicates a non-empty archive, the name of each file or directory within the archive should be specified in a central directory entry, along with other metadata about the entry, and an offset into the [...]ZIP <b>file,</b> <b>pointing</b> to the actual entry data. This allows a file listing of the archive to be performed relatively quickly, as the entire archive does not have to be read to see the list of files. The entries within the [...]ZIP file also include this information, for redundancy, in a local file header. Because zip files may be appended to, only files specified in the central directory at the end of the file are valid. Scanning a ZIP file for local file headers is invalid (except in the case of corrupted archives), as the central directory may declare that some files have been deleted and other files have been updated.|$|E

50|$|In May 2009, the Dutch {{copyright}} enforcement organization BREIN {{started a}} civil procedure against Mininova demanding that Mininova filter torrent <b>files</b> <b>pointing</b> to copyrighted works.

On May 6, 2009, Mininova began a trial of a content recognition system, which was intended to remove any torrents that were flagged as infringing copyright. On August 26, 2009, the court in Utrecht ruled that Mininova should remove all torrent <b>files</b> <b>pointing</b> to copyrighted material within three months or face damages of up to 5 million €.|$|R

5000|$|Source {{deduplication}} {{ensures that}} {{data on the}} data source is deduplicated. This generally takes place directly within a file system. [...] The file system will periodically scan new files creating hashes and compare them to hashes of existing files. When files with same hashes are found then the file copy is removed and the new <b>file</b> <b>points</b> to the old file. Unlike hard links however, duplicated files {{are considered to be}} separate entities and if one of the duplicated files is later modified, then using a system called copy-on-write a copy of that file or changed block is created. The deduplication process is transparent to the users and backup applications. Backing up a deduplicated file system will often cause duplication to occur resulting in the backups being bigger than the source data.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the ICE project in 1990, ICE corpora have been used extensively in the investigation and comparison of varieties of English on different linguistic levels. These levels, however, have so far primarily been restricted to lexis and lexico-grammar, while relatively little has to date been achieved in the investigation of pragmatic strategies used by the speakers in these corpora. One of the main reasons for this shortcoming is a lack of suitable annotation that would make such a detailed pragmatic comparison possible. This paper will propose a suitable model and format for converting and enriching the ICE corpora with different levels of pragmatics-relevant information, as well as discussing the issues involved in this endeavour. And finally, to illustrate the feasibility of this aim, the paper will also include a small case study carried out on a number of <b>files,</b> <b>pointing</b> out how the resulting annotations could later be exploited in pragmatics research...|$|R

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{an examination of}} how adoption files, or expedientes, have “fissured” the legality of transnational adoption processes in Guatemala. By focusing on declarations and disclaimers as an entry point to explore controversies over adoption files, the article argues that <b>files</b> <b>point</b> to the “prior” histories of adoption that are intimately connected to local histories {{of violence in the}} country. Through the analysis of the politics inherent in these legal documents, and the legal frameworks regulating the production of adoption paperwork, the article offers a critical insight into the extra-judicial processes and forms of “exceptionalism” that made transnational adoptions possible in the thirty-year period between 1977 and 2007. At the same time, the analysis of declarations and disclaimers brings to light how the technologies of their production allow the emergence of “anti-social affects” that saturate, and internally disrupt, transnational adoption files. The article proposes a critical, “anti-social” analysis of international adoption, by illuminating the problems that come from taking for granted the values of futurity and reproduction in adoption studies...|$|R
