25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the colour}} {{flew back to}} <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> her eyes flashed with anger.|$|E
60|$|She offered <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> Joan kissed it, {{somewhat}} gingerly.|$|R
60|$|A tear {{ran down}} <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> {{was caught in}} a furrow near the mouth.|$|R
60|$|Romola {{seized the}} hand that was against <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> put it to her lips in silence.|$|R
60|$|A little {{flush of}} color stole into <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> her eyes danced with excitement.|$|E
60|$|Jacinta {{turned to}} her with the colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a {{haziness}} in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{looked at}} him steadily, with the colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> her voice was a little tremulous.|$|E
60|$|Hetty turned {{towards her}} with a little spot of colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> {{apprehension}} in <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{took his}} wrist in <b>her</b> hand, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> eyelashes came within {{a foot of}} his face.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her then, sidelong. The curve of <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|R
6000|$|Standing {{before that}} mirror, {{smoothing}} back her hair, passing her handkerchief over <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> eyes and lips, she thought: ...|$|E
60|$|He went out, and Sally {{turned to}} Hawtrey with the color in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a flash in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a faint colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a softer light in her proud, clear eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gerhardt, {{accustomed}} to not being troublesome, rose; a tear rolled down <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> {{was arrested by}} her smile.|$|R
60|$|Without in {{the least}} {{understanding}} him, the color had leaped to <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> the consciousness of it made her furious.|$|R
50|$|According to her, {{because of}} her supreme cuteness, Amy had cuteness {{reduction}} surgery on <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> nose {{when she was a}} teenager.|$|R
60|$|She turned round {{upon him}} with colour enough in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a strange angry light burning in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|The colour {{fled from}} <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> uttering a {{piercing}} cry, she fell {{forward on the}} breast of her long-lost lover.|$|E
60|$|When {{the queen}} saw the huge basin full of silver treasure, <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> her {{forehead}} flushed {{as red as}} fire.|$|E
60|$|A faint blush {{of shame}} mantled <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> into <b>her</b> blue eyes {{there came a}} look of pain, but she faced him bravely.|$|R
60|$|And he's taen {{down the}} silk napkin, Hung {{on a silver}} pin, And aye he wipes the tear {{trickling}} A'down <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> chin.|$|R
60|$|Cuthbert {{looked at}} her in surprise. There was a slight flush on <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> it was evident that she was deeply in earnest.|$|R
60|$|Then he went out, and Sally {{turned to}} Hawtrey with the colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a flash in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|The little Nubian {{boys who}} fan [...] <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> tresses clear, [...] Wonderful, {{wonderful}}, wonderful voices [...] Seem afar to hear.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood there}} {{blushing}} before him, over <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> {{up to her}} forehead; but yet did not turn away her face.|$|E
60|$|Eliza screamed, but {{the shot}} did not hurt him. It passed {{close to his}} hair, nearly touched <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and,</b> struck a tree behind.|$|R
60|$|She {{took his}} hand in hers and pressed it against <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> as he stood beside her came closer {{to him with a}} {{nestling}} movement.|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry patted <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> {{turned to}} greet his wife. There was a shadow upon his bronzed, {{handsome}} {{face as he}} watched her rather hesitating approach.|$|R
60|$|Virginia sat {{upright in}} her seat. A very {{becoming}} touch of colour had stolen into <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> {{her eyes were}} bright.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{pure and}} eloquent blood [...] Spoke in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> so {{distinctly}} wrought, [...] That one would almost say her body thought.|$|E
60|$|But a {{flush of}} fire flamed in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> her {{trembling}} hands shook Black Star's bridle, {{and her eyes}} fell before Lassiter's.|$|E
60|$|The damsel was {{reclining}} on the ferns; {{one hand}} supporting <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> the other listlessly {{turning over the}} leaves of a Tahitian Bible. The doctor approached.|$|R
60|$|She {{bit her lip}} {{and faced}} me there, a sweet flushed living thing, with a tear {{coursing}} down <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mouth now firm and steady.|$|R
60|$|She was {{ignoring}} {{every one}} of his suggestions now, but the flush of <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> a certain softness in her eyes encouraged him to go on.|$|R
