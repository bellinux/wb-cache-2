5|$|From 1890 to 1895 {{major changes}} {{were made to the}} Rue Saint-Honoré section, with many attics and roofs transformed. In 2007, the {{residence}} was purchased by a developer, who divided it into ten apartments three years later. This <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> the rear of the residence, which had a badly-damaged roof. Currently, the building comprises ten apartments and a large office.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> {{her life}} {{when she was}} impaled on a railing and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart {{to another part of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{was well}} known for {{cultivating}} the arts and for defending even unpopular political causes.

5|$|Realizing the North Vietnamese {{would try}} to destroy the installation, Secord advised the U.S Embassy in Vientiane to {{evacuate}} all U.S. personnel. However, high-ranking U.S. officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> the lives of U.S. pilots every day it remained in operation. In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled {{by a series of}} skirmishes. On 15December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{variation}} of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major socio-economic problems. The grape phylloxera was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E. Planchon, <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> the French wine industry by suggesting the grafting of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto Vitis labrusca root stocks.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Barbirolli, CH (2 December 189929 July 1970), né Giovanni Battista Barbirolli, was a British {{conductor}} and cellist. He {{is remembered}} above all as {{conductor of the}} Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, which he <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> from dissolution in 1943 and conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Earlier in his career he was Arturo Toscanini's successor as music director of the New York Philharmonic, serving from 1936 to 1943. He was also chief conductor of the Houston Symphony from 1961 to 1967, and was a guest conductor of many other orchestras, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, with all of which he made recordings.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Aqil served various masters, among whom was Ibrahim Pasha, {{the son of}} Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Aqil {{defected}} from Ibrahim Pasha's army and joined local rebels in the 1834 peasants' revolt against Egyptian conscription and disarmament measures, leading his Hawwara irregulars in the Galilee. At {{some point during the}} revolt, Aqil <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> the mostly Druze village of Isfiya from being destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's troops after its inhabitants paid Aqil for protection. As the revolt was suppressed, Aqil and his men left Palestine for Transjordan, where they sought the protection of that region's major Bedouin tribes. During his time in Transjordan he strengthened relations with these tribes. When the Ottomans regained control of Palestine in 1840–1841, Aqil returned to the Lower Galilee and was commissioned as a captain of ten mounted irregulars. He recruited Egyptian irregulars from the Hanadi tribe and others who were left unemployed following the Egyptian withdrawal. Together with Aqil's Hawwara, they became a formidable local force. In 1843, Aqil became the chief of irregulars, known as bashi-bazouk, in northern Palestine, and his command was expanded to fifty horsemen. Aqil's irregulars became known in the area as the Hanadi, although the group's tribal composition was mixed.|$|E

5|$|To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in {{addition}} to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos. His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80million. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength {{in order to be able}} to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this <b>helped</b> <b>save</b> rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
