5|$|Immigrants {{have not}} always been readily {{accepted}} and in 1517 the Evil May Day riots, where <b>foreign-owned</b> property was attacked, resulted in the deaths of 135 Flemings in Stepney. The Gordon Riots of 1780 began with burnings of the houses of Catholics and their chapels in Poplar and Spitalfields.|$|E
5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now <b>foreign-owned,</b> such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a flag {{of convenience}} to reduce operating costs or avoid the regulations of the owner's country. The closely related term open registry, which describes a ship register that will register <b>foreign-owned</b> ships, also exists.|$|E
5|$|Social changes also {{occurred}} in this time, most markedly {{with the decline}} in authority of the Catholic Church. The financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by <b>foreign-owned</b> businesses continued to grow). The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>foreign-owned</b> hotels were {{established}} around the square, making it popular with visitors to London. Brunet's Hôtel at No.25 was opened by Louis Brunet in 1800, later expanding to Nos.24 and 26 {{during the following}} decade. It was bought by Francis Jaunay in 1815 known as Jaunay's Hôtel. The Hôtel Sablonière et de Provence opened at No.17–18 in 1845 as the Hôtel de Provence, and renamed in 1869. It closed in 1919 and became a public house. The Cavour, at No.20 at the southeast of the square, opened in 1864. It was badly damaged in World War II but subsequently restored.|$|E
5|$|Following Farsari's {{departure}} from Japan in 1890, his studio continued to operate and even listed him as proprietor until 1901, when Tonokura Tsunetarō became the owner. Tonokura, whom Farsari had known since the mid-1870s, had long managed {{the day-to-day operations}} of the studio. In 1904 Tonokura left the business {{to start his own}} studio and another of Farsari's former employees, Watanabe Tokutarō, became the new owner, only to be succeeded by the former secretary, Fukagawa Itomaro. The business was finally registered as a Japanese company in 1906 and it continued to operate until at least 1917 and possibly as late as 1923, the year in which Yokohama was largely destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake. A. Farsari & Co. was the last notable <b>foreign-owned</b> photographic studio to operate in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Mobutu {{launched}} a second coup d'état against {{the central government}} and took personal emergency powers. Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to illustrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's revised constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and {{efforts were made to}} remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining <b>foreign-owned</b> economic assets in the country. By the time of its disestablishment, Zaire was characterised by widespread croneyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also <b>foreign-owned</b> planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from <b>foreign-owned</b> large-format chain stores.|$|E
25|$|Ford Sollers in Vsevolozhsk: {{opened in}} 2002. It {{was the first}} <b>foreign-owned</b> car plant to be {{established}} in Russia.|$|E
25|$|The growing {{success of}} Ireland's economy {{encouraged}} entrepreneurship and risk-taking, qualities {{that had been}} dormant during poor economic periods. However, whilst some semblance of a culture of entrepreneurship exists, <b>foreign-owned</b> companies account for 93% of Ireland's exports.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{government}} quickly expanded it by buying the Canadian assets of <b>foreign-owned</b> oil companies, such as Atlantic Richfield in 1976, Pacific Petroleums in 1979, Petrofina in 1981, the {{refining and marketing}} assets of BP in 1983 and of Gulf Oil in 1985.|$|E
25|$|In Latin American {{countries}} in which ISI was most successful, it was accompanied by structural changes to the government. Old neocolonial governments were replaced by more-or-less democratic governments. Banks and utilities and certain <b>foreign-owned</b> companies were nationalized or had their ownership transferred to local businesspeople.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of Russian {{repudiation}} of Tsarist bonds, nationalisation of <b>foreign-owned</b> property and confiscation of foreign assets, Russia and Germany signed an additional agreement on 27 August 1918. Russia agreed to pay six billion marks in compensation to German interests for their losses.|$|E
25|$|The top {{individual}} {{income tax}} rate is 50 percent. The top corporate tax rate is 30 percent (35 percent for wholly <b>foreign-owned</b> companies). Other taxes include a tax on property transfers and a sales tax. The overall tax burden is 24.4 percent of GDP.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2009, HSBC started {{operating}} its locally incorporated entity {{and became}} the first foreign bank to incorporate in Vietnam, after gaining approval from the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to set up a Wholly <b>Foreign-Owned</b> Bank (WFOB) in Vietnam in September 2008.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December trade unions, largely {{under control}} of PKI, started seizing control of Dutch-owned companies. These {{seizures}} {{paved the way}} for the nationalization of <b>foreign-owned</b> enterprises. The struggles against foreign capitalists gave the PKI the opportunity to profile itself as a national party.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina also {{benefits}} from foreign investment. There are 1,950 <b>foreign-owned</b> firms operating in South Carolina employing almost 135,000 people. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) brought 1.06 {{billion dollars to}} the state economy in 2010. Since 1994, BMW has had a production facility in Spartanburg County near Greer.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} a mild climate, but {{is known for}} {{frequent}} hurricanes. It is a popular tourist destination, with many beaches and resorts, including Bibijagua Beach. Until the Cuban government expropriated all <b>foreign-owned</b> property in the early 1960s, much land was owned by Americans, and the island contained {{a branch of the}} Hilton Hotels chain.|$|E
25|$|The Party {{was able}} to advance parts of its {{programme}} considerably: <b>Foreign-owned</b> plantations were nationalised, local ownership was restricted, democratically elected workers' councils were established in state corporations and government departments under the purview of its ministries (and of that of a sympathiser, T.B. Subasinghe), and measures were taken that narrowed {{the gap between the}} rich and poor.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century, it was invited by the Vietnamese Government to become the country's first <b>foreign-owned</b> university. Its first {{international}} branch campus opened in Ho Chi Minh City in 2001 with a second in Hanoi in 2004. In 2013, it established a presence in Europe by opening a centre in Barcelona, Spain.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, around 7% of all New Zealand agriculturally {{productive}} land was <b>foreign-owned.</b> In 2011, economist Bill Rosenberg {{said that the}} figure is closer to 9% if foreign ownership of forestry is included. In March 2013 the financial sector, which includes the four big Australian owned banks, was worth $39.3 billion accounting for the largest portion of the $101.4 billion foreign ownership of New Zealand companies.|$|E
25|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, <b>foreign-owned</b> private oil {{companies}} {{had refused to}} supply fuel to the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force. In response, Gandhi nationalised {{oil companies}} in 1973. After nationalisation the oil majors such as the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and the Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) had to keep a minimum stock level of oil, to be supplied to the military when needed.|$|E
25|$|Industry is {{the core}} force of oil sands development. The first major players, Suncor Energy and Syncrude, {{dominated}} the market until the 1990s. Currently there are 64 companies operating several hundred projects. The majority of production now comes from <b>foreign-owned</b> corporations, {{and the maintenance of}} a favourable climate for these corporations grants them strong influence; much stronger than that of non-productive stakeholders, such as citizens and environmental groups.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{money market}} is {{classified}} into the organised sector, comprising private, public and <b>foreign-owned</b> commercial banks and cooperative banks, together known as 'scheduled banks'; and the unorganised sector, which includes individual or family-owned indigenous bankers or money lenders and non-banking financial companies. The unorganised sector and microcredit are preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes such as short-term loans for ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Other major German {{manufacturers}} are Opel and Ford-Werke, {{but are not}} considered {{as part of this}} grouping, although they are among the top selling brands in Europe - they are both <b>foreign-owned</b> (Opel is a subsidiary of Groupe PSA, whilst Ford Werke is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company), and are largely Germany based and carry out much of their research and development in the nation.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Asturias' {{literary}} career, he was continually {{involved in}} politics. He was openly {{opposed to the}} Cabrera Dictatorship and worked as an ambassador in various Latin American countries. His political opinions come through {{in a number of}} his works. Some political themes found in his books are the following: Spanish colonization of Latin America and the decline of the Maya civilization; the effects of political dictatorships on society; and the exploitation of the Guatemala people by <b>foreign-owned</b> agricultural companies.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December 2014 and as {{a result}} of a ruling which barred the club from a first European {{campaign}} under Tommaso Ghirardi, Ghirardi sold his 66.55% controlling stake in Eventi Sportivi to Dastraso Holding Ltd, a company based in Cyprus and controlled by Rezart Taçi for €1, at which point the club was $200million in debt. The club became the third Serie A club to become <b>foreign-owned</b> as a result and Albanian Emir Kodra was installed as president.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on exporting commodities rather than manufactures underpinned {{a significant increase}} in Australia's terms of trade during the rise in commodity prices since 2000. However, due to a colonial heritage a lot of companies operating in Australia are <b>foreign-owned</b> and as a result, Australia has had persistent current account deficits for over 60 years despite periods of positive net merchandise exports; given the net income outlay between Australia {{and the rest of the}} world is always negative. The current account deficit totalled AUD$44.5 billion in 2016 or 2.6% of GDP.|$|E
25|$|In trade terms, the Australian {{economy has}} had {{persistently}} large current account deficits (CADs) {{for more than}} 50 years. One single factor that undermines balance of payments is Australia's narrow export base, making it highly sensitive to the volatility of global primary product prices. In addition, due to a colonial heritage {{a lot of companies}} operating in Australia are <b>foreign-owned</b> and as a result, Australia's net income outlay between it {{and the rest of the}} world is always negative; this results in persistent current account deficits even during times of positive net merchandise exports.|$|E
25|$|The Foreign Banks in Switzerland Association {{reported}} {{that from the}} start of 2012 to the end of May 2013, the number of <b>foreign-owned</b> private banks operating in Switzerland declined from 145 to 129 due to the roll-back of bank secrecy regulations. Over the preceding five years, the foreign banks' assets under management declined by 25% to CHF870.7billion Swiss francs ($921 billion) due to their clients paying taxes or withdrawing their money. Foreign banks in Switzerland saw their pretax margin decline from 38 basis points in 2007 to 20 basis points in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{new state}} firms created {{in this period}} {{established}} a significant share of public ownership in the modern sector of the economy. By 1975 they accounted for over half of mining output and a fifth of industrial output. One set of estimates indicates that enterprises under state ownership came to account for a higher share of value added than domestic private capital: 26 percent of GDP for the state firms, compared with 22 percent for domestic private firms. The share produced by <b>foreign-owned</b> firms dropped to 8 percent from 21 percent prior to the Velasco government's reforms.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the {{government}} has allowed foreign investors to manufacture and sell {{a wide range of}} goods on the domestic market, eliminated time restrictions on the establishment of joint ventures, provided some assurances against nationalization, allowed foreign partners to become chairs of joint venture boards, and authorized the establishment of wholly <b>foreign-owned</b> enterprises, now the preferred form of FDI. In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state, such as energy, communications and transportation.|$|E
25|$|Eco-tourism aims to be ecologically and {{socially}} conscious; {{it focuses on}} local culture, wilderness, and adventure. Nicaragua's eco-tourism grows every year, as the country boasts a number of eco-tourist tours and perfect places for adventurers. Nicaragua has three eco-regions, the Pacific, Central and Atlantic, which contain volcanoes, tropical rainforest and agricultural land. The majority of ecolodges and other environmentally-focused touristic destinations are found on Ometepe Island, found {{in the middle of}} Lake Nicaragua, an hour's boat ride from Granada. While some are <b>foreign-owned,</b> such as the tropical permaculture lodge at Finca El Zopilote, others are owned by local families, like the small but acclaimed Finca Samaria.|$|E
25|$|In February 1959, the Ministry for the Recovery of Misappropriated Assets (Ministerio de Recuperación de Bienes Malversados) was created. Cuba began expropriating {{land and}} private {{property}} {{under the auspices}} of the Agrarian Reform Law of 17 May 1959. Farms of any size could be and were seized by the government, while land, businesses, and companies owned by upper- and middle-class Cubans were nationalized (notably, including the plantations owned by Fidel Castro's family). By the end of 1960, the revolutionary government had nationalized more than $25billion worth of private property owned by Cubans. The Castro government formally nationalized all <b>foreign-owned</b> property, particularly American holdings, in the nation on 6 August 1960.|$|E
25|$|The Polish banking {{sector is}} the largest in East Central/Eastern European region, with 32.3 {{branches}} per 100,000 adults. The banks are {{the largest and most}} developed sector of the country's financial markets. They are regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority. During the transformation to a market-oriented economy, the government privatized several banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector more competitive. This has attracted a significant number of strategic foreign investors (ICFI). Poland's banking sector has approximately 5 national banks, a network of nearly 600 cooperative banks and 18 branches of <b>foreign-owned</b> banks. In addition, foreign investors have controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which make up 68% of the banking capital.|$|E
