40|$|First {{published}} online: 21 December 2014 In {{order to}} increase the effectiveness of migration management, the EU increasingly enters into agreements with <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> Such co-operation aims to engage <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> in migration control mechanisms in exchange for enhanced legal migration opportunities, yet this externalization of migration policy is highly selective with regard to both participating Member States and <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> In this paper we develop a three-level game perspective to explain why Member States and <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> participate in EU external migration policy initiatives. The three-level game links three sets of actors in two strategic interactions: Member States, EU institutions and <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> We argue that two factors determine the outcome of negotiations: the cost of no agreement and the autonomy of central decision-makers. The model {{is illustrated by the}} successful and failed Mobility Partnership negotiations between EU Member States, the European Commission and, respectively, Cape Verde and Senegal...|$|R

40|$|Just {{as there}} has been tension between EU {{migration}} policies and national level policies, there is growing evidence that local authorities are taking a more proactive position to define local policies for <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals. In some countries, these complement stronger positive national policies, in other countries, where there is an absence of national migration policies, local authorities are playing {{an important role in}} supporting the integration of <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals within society and the local economy. They do this through social cohesion activities, language education and wider education and life-long learning services. The position of <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals in the labour force is often weak, especially women and those with low levels of education. There is a need for more focused strategies to make the recognition of existing qualifications easier and quicker. Austerity policies have had an impact on <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals because they have resulted in cuts to services, e. g. social cohesion, which were specially targeted at <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals. Public sector workers responsible for services for <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals have experienced cuts in budgets, more difficult working conditions and a lack of training, which has made it more difficult to deliver adequate public services...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the impact of <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> on outbound FDI to a given host country. Here, we consider potential third-country effects on inbound FDI. A simple model suggests two sources of such effects on a country's inbound FDI. First, it will tend to receive more FDI fromparent countries proximate to large <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> Second, FDI from <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> may increase or decrease FDI from the parent country in question depending on whether production spillovers or crowding out effects dominate. Using data on US inbound FDI from OECD countries during 1980 - 2000, we find strong evidence for parent market proximity effects. We find robust results for <b>third</b> <b>country</b> FDI effects only in a European subsample. There, crowding out effects dominate. ...|$|R
40|$|Published online 22 January 2016 Greater {{cooperation}} with <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> {{is one of}} the EU’s core responses to the refugee crisis. This cooperation is focused on the readmission of individuals irregularly staying in the EU, on border surveillance and control, and on the reception of refugees in <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> The EU has attempted to co-opt Turkey and African countries into these priorities, using funding and specific mobility channels as incentives. This paper poses the question of what kind of cooperation the EU should pursue with <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> As the current approaches are not new, we present the lessons from the EU’s long {{cooperation with}} Morocco to inform the current debate. We find that, first, the difficult negotiations on an EU Readmission Agreement with Morocco show that more funding or ‘incentives’ cannot guarantee such an agreement, let alone its implementation. Second, we highlight the challenges of the partly EU-funded and Frontex-coordinated cooperation on borders between Spain and Morocco, which hampers the capacity of <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> to respect migrants’ rights and challenges the obligations of EU member states under European and international law. Third, as EU cooperation with Turkey and Africa now aims to ‘stem’ the flow of asylum-seekers, the capacity of <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> to offer reception and protection to asylumseekers is crucial. We conclude that Morocco has limited capacities in this regard, which {{raises the question of whether}} <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> can be assumed to be able to offer such reception and protection. We argue that the lessons learnt from the cooperation with Morocco illustrate the limited feasibility and appropriateness of the EU’s approach towards <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> Cooperation with <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> should not come at the expense of migrants’ rights, but should open up regular channels for seeking asylum, and not link readmission to other fields of EU external action under the ‘more-for-more’ principle...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impacts of export-platform foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) on backward linkages. First, in a three-country model, these impacts are explained through the competition effect and the demand effect.

Otherwise, the level of backward linkages is also affected by <b>third</b> <b>country</b> size, local content requirement, and the power of trade agreements between the host and the <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> Second, {{in the case of the}} Vietnamese supporting industries between 2000 and 2012, export-platform FDI generates a negative effect.
