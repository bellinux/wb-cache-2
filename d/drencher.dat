I drifted {{straight}} towards it until I was {{about half a mile}} from shore, not more, and then the current took a turn, and I had to paddle as hard as I could with my hands and bits of the Aepyornis shell to make the place. However, I got there. It was just a common atoll about four miles round, with a few trees growing and a spring in one place, and the lagoon full of parrot-fish. I took the egg ashore {{and put it in a}} good place well above the tide lines and in the sun, to give it all the chance I could, and pulled the canoe up safe, and loafed about prospecting. It's rum how dull an atoll is. As soon as I had found a spring all the interest seemed to vanish. When I was a kid I thought nothing could be finer or more adventurous than the Robinson Crusoe business, but that place was as monotonous as a book of sermons. I went round finding eatable things and generally thinking; but I tell you I was bored to death before the first day was out. It shows my luck--the very day I landed the weather changed. A thunderstorm went by to the north and flicked its wing over the island, and in the night there came a <b>drencher</b> and a howling wind slap over us. It wouldn't have taken much, you know, to upset that canoe.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, a rocket {{scientist}} named Lonnie Johnson {{was working on a}} heat pump system, and was testing it in his bathroom. A powerful stream shot from his prototype, and he immediately realized that this could make a great water gun. Lonnie Johnson spent the next eight years trying to sell his idea. Eventually, Johnson sold the idea to Larami Toys, and they released the Power <b>Drencher.</b> The Power <b>Drencher</b> wasn't very popular at first, but popularity grew significantly when they renamed it the Super Soaker 50. Since then, there have been hundreds of other Super Soaker models. These include 10th and 20th anniversary Super Soaker 50s.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide more {{effective}} fire-fighting, a water mist suppression system will be used. When the temperature exceeds 57 °C, sprinklers creating a water mist will start working automatically. Along with the sprinklers, there will be <b>drenchers</b> which could be switched on manually or by the means of remote control {{in order to create}} a water curtain in an emergency. Lakhta Center is also set to be the first skyscraper in St. Petersburg where an ice formation control system will be used. Heating of the glass at high floors will prevent ice accumulation and help maintain good visibility. The spire of the Tower will be made from metal gauze to prevent a layer of ice forming in winter. Level of consumption of material and energetic resources is going to be decreased due to conversion of kinetic energy of the Center workers and visitors' steps to electric energy.In periods of birds' migration special illumination will be used to light the tower.|$|R

The first Super Soaker {{went on sale}} in 1990 and was originally called the Power <b>Drencher,</b> or the [...] "Shaw" [...] because {{of its ability to}} shoot straight and narrow. [...] Rebranding the name to Super Soaker occurred in 1991 together with a series of TV advertisements that resulted in 2 million water guns being sold.

50|$|In 1982, Air Force and NASA {{engineer}} Lonnie Johnson {{conceived of}} the idea of a pressurized water gun after shooting a powerful stream of water in his bathroom while performing experiments for a new type of refrigeration system. Several months later he built a prototype in his basement. Johnson originally wanted to produce the toy himself, but realized that the costs were out of his reach. He attempted to arrange partnerships with toy companies to bring the product to market, {{but it was not until}} 1989 that he found success. While at the American International Toy Fair in New York City, he met the vice president of the toy company Larami, who showed interest in the idea. In 1982, Lonnie Johnson decided to shift his focus from his current scientific career at NASA to the Super Soaker because the Super Soaker could potentially create enough funding for his own research goals. The revenue that Lonnie received from the Super Soaker licensing provided enough money for Lonnie to create Johnson Research & Development Co., Inc. Johnson then went home and built an improved prototype and made a trip to their headquarters in Philadelphia where he made a successful sales pitch. Refinements made with Larami employee Bruce D'Andrade made its mass production feasible, and the first commercial version of the water gun appeared in stores the following year as the Power <b>Drencher.</b> In 1991 it achieved commercial success under its new name, Super Soaker.|$|E

40|$|Ammunition storage spaces on {{naval vessels}} are {{commonly}} fitted with <b>drencher</b> {{systems that are}} designed to prevent ordnance reaching a temperature where it might explode due to fast or slow “cook‐off”. Many of these systems are traditional low pressure water spray systems that are required by the Naval Ship Code and class requirements to deliver water at a rate of between 24 ℓ/m 2 /min and 32 ℓ/m 2 /min. The origin of this requirement is not entirely clear. The high flow rates are a burden on system design and rapid flooding of the magazines decreases the stability of the ship due to free surface effects. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the necessity of high flow rates. In addition, the feasibility of reducing them using a lower flow rate <b>drencher</b> system –if necessary in conjunction with a low pressure water mist system– was investigated. The experiments involved exposure of an instrumented steel tube, representing ordnance, to a diesel pool fire located beneath or beside it. The temperature of the tube was monitored prior to, during and after activation of the fire suppression to ensure that it did not exceed a threshold temperature of 200 °C. Flow rates from the <b>drencher</b> system were varied and at lower flows the WMS was activated. For the fire scenarios studied, the results indicated that a flow rate of 32 ℓ/m 2 /min exceeded that required to keep the temperature of the ordnance below 200 oC. At an application rate of 10 ℓ/m² per minute, the installed <b>drencher</b> system suppressed the fire and the kept the temperature of the ordnance below the threshold. A dual system of <b>drencher</b> combined with water mist system was effective at comparable flow rates. The fire however, although controlled, was not fully extinguished in all cases. This study is part of a trilateral research project between Canada, The Netherlands and Sweden designated FiST. Results contribute to defining the way ahead in the process of evaluation of national requirements for fixed fire fighting systems for magazines...|$|E

This feeding strategy is used to provide calves sufficient amounts of immunoglobulins, in order to prevent failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI). To newborn calves (n = 4) 4 liters colostrum was administered by an esophageal <b>drencher,</b> within 2 hours after birth. Abomasal volume was determined using ultrasonography. Mean determined abomasal volume was 2. 74 liters (CI 1. 87 – 3. 61). No correlation (- 0. 134) was found between determined abomasal volume and administered volume. Determined abomasal volume was significantly different from administered volume (p = 0. 025). In another newborn calf 2. 1 liters of a solution of colostrum and barium-sulfate was provided by an esophageal <b>drencher.</b> X-rays and fluoroscopy was performed to determine localization of provided colostrum. Fluoroscopy showed a first entry of colostrum into reticulum and ruminal atrium, after which overflow to all ruminal compartments, omasum and abomasum occurs. No flow into duodenum was detected. This study clearly shows that the abomasum is unable to contain 4 liters colostrum. Also, this study shows colostrum is localized in all parts of the forestomachs and abomasum.

40|$|A <b>drencher</b> {{system might}} be {{installed}} to substitute fire resisting {{construction in the}} Far East. Whether the discharged water curtain (or screen) can block thermal radiation and prevent smoke spreading depends on the air voids or porosity.

Photographs of the water curtain discharged from the nozzles were taken with suitable optical arrangement. Results radicated that the water curtains discharged from the selected nozzles are not continuous water layers. There are many air voids inside.

There would be different blocking effects on smoke emitted from burning different fuels. Better smoke obstruction of water curtain was observed for smoke with larger particles. More smoke can be blocked by discharging several water layers. Smoke filling time in the protected room can be extended upon discharging a water curtain.

40|$|Prior to {{proceeding}} with any design, fire safety strategies {{must be developed}} based on clearly defined goals.

This is particularly important while implementing engineering-performance-based fire codes. Detailed design can then be worked out for adequate, not more nor less, fire safety provisions, both passive building design and active fire protection systems. In this forum, the main fire safety objectives and the methods applied to achieve these in different countries are surveyed and reported. Fire safety strategies are divided into fourparts: passive building construction strategy, fire services installation strategy, fire safety management strategy, and strategy on controlling the risk factor. An example is provided that discusses the special features of an airport terminal, the specific fire safety strategies employed, the utilization of the cabin design, and its defects.

There are always arguments on the design for means of escape (MoE), as the usable floor area will be affected. In this paper, the prescriptive approach of the MoE code with respect to the local buildings characteristics and occupants characteristics are reviewed. Deficiency and inadequacy of the MoE code, which is not yet updated quick enough for getting an appropriate fire safety solution for some building or occupancy types, are discussed.

The first group of cows (n= 10; dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) =+ 95. 99 mEq/kg DMI) 10 ml of Vitamin D 3 was administered one week before the expected calving. KatAn® group (n= 10; DCDA=- 99. 00 mEq/kg DMI) was orally administered 300 g of anionic salts per day two weeks before parturition. The third group of cows (n= 10, DCDA=+ 95. 99 mEq/kg DMI) was the control group. During the experiment we controlled the clinical status of cows and blood samples were taken (2 and 1 week before parturition, and 1, 2 and 7 days postpartum) for the determination of plasma Ca, iP and Mg concentrations. It was established that the best results were achieved by i/m administration of 10 million IU cholecalciferol (vit. D 3) one week before calving. Only one cow in this group was affected by MF the second day after calving. In KatAn® group one cow showed typical MF symptoms the first day after calving and another cow had retained foetal membranes (RFM). In the control group the MF incidence was markedly higher. One cow developed MF, one RFM and one cow showed left-sided displacement of the abomasum (LDA). Because the cows refused to eat silage mixed with KatAn salts, each cow was given the solution (300 ml) daily via a manual <b>drencher.</b> On the basis of the analyses, clinical-laboratory data and time-consuming application of anionic salts, we are of the opinion that the best prophylactic measure for the prevention of MF on small and medium large dairy farms in Slovenia is i/m administration of Duphafral®Vit.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P BSE 2015 Lauxix, 157 leaves, 97 {{variously}} numbered pages :illustrations (some color); 30 cmLocal code {{of practice}} for fire safety in buildings issued by Buildings Department (BD) requires supertall buildings over forty storeys high to provide a refuge floor for every 25 storeys in residential/commercial buildings. However, the protection to external wall openings on refuge floor by a drencher/water curtain system falls within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Fire Services Department (FSD). There is a concern on the trend for flatted units in supertall buildings to have large window/glass panes design so as to have more sunlight and a better view. The result is that this design increases the impact of the ventilation factor, which in turn steps up the heat release rate for flashover and fire development in compartment fires. Another concern is the external wall opening sizes on the refuge floor vary greatly in different types of buildings. The differeence in the ratio of the area of an external wall opening to the area of the external wall of the refuge floor greatly affects the effectiveness of cross-ventilation on that floor. For a better understanding, a survey of building plans including 44 building lots (51 blocks) of residential and non-residential buildings was conducted. As statistics from FSD reveal that about 80 % of structural fires occurred in government housing estates and private residential buildings, my study focuses on these types of buildings. Detailed inspections of building plans of 29 building lots (31 blocks) were conducted to obtain and analyze, for each of the building, the ratio of the area of an external wall opening to the area of the external wall on the refuge floor, the ratio of the window opening area to the external wall area as well as the ratio of the window opening area to the floor area of the flatted unit immediately below the refuge floor. The trend of refuge floor designs and the cross-ventilation requirement stipulated in the relevant local building code were also analysed. To determine the minimum amount of heat released for flashover in a compartment with large window panes, 31 supertall residential buildings were selected and the Babrauskas method for flashover was adopted. The results showed that the average minimum heat release rate for flashover was 15. 3 MW for an unit having an average window opening area of 15. 1 m². To evaluate the effectiveness of a water curtain system in achieving heat reduction, radiation attenuation and smoke reduction from entering the refuge floor, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was adopted. Before working on the CFD model, a pre-study in four main subject areas was conducted: (1) comparing the simulation results of the FDS model with another CFD model called "SIMTEC" and also with the results of full-scale burning test from literature; (2) selecting appropriate fuel types as an input parameter in FDS simulation; (3) comparing the performance of the sprinkler system and the water curtain system; and (4) making FDS trial runs covering different locations of fire seat, domain model geometry and fire sizes, etc. Simulation results from my pre-study showed that the results generated by the FDS model were comparatively more conservative in subject area 1 (i. e. lower temperture reduction and lower radiation attenuation) and agreed well with burning test results from literature (at least in the veocity of outflow gases) and with temeprature profile of the fire plume. In the selection of the appropriate fuel type for FDS simulation study, my prime objective was to look for the adverse effects in the combustion of propane, wood, polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Simulation results including outputs of temperature, visibilities, carbon monoxide concentrations and radiation heat fluxes from different scenarios were evaluated. The highly hazardous properties of burning PVC and PU in producing large amounts of carbon monoxide and very low visibilities within {{a short period of time}} were carefully considered. The sprinkler system is commonly used in fire protection but this is not the case in the protection of external wall openings on the refuge floor. To compare the performance of the sprinkler system with that of the water curtain system in defined scenarios, the FDS model was adopted. Simulation results showed that the water curtain system performed better in of temeprature reduction and radiation atttenuation. To simulate the performance of the water curtain system on refuge floor external wall openings, a two-storey building model consisting of a fire room measuring 11 m (length) x 9 m (width) x 3 m (height) on the ground floor with a refuge floor immediately above it was designed. A fire was assumed to be spreading from the fire room after a flashover fire with flames ejecting through broken windows and spreading upwards along the external wall and wall openings of the refuge floor. An in-depth simulation study using FDS in different scenarios and design parameters including different fire sizes, opening widths of the fire room, wind speeds and scenarios with and without the water curtain system were conducted. The results showed that the water curtain sytem performed well in temeperature reduction, radiation attenuation and visibility enhancement on the refuge floor. Attenuation of thermal radiation by the drencher/water curtain system and relevant parameters such as water flow rates, water pressures, spacing of <b>drencher</b> nozzles, water droplet sizes and water density were studied using FDS simulation. Theories of Beer-Lambert's law and its analogy were adopted and simulation data analysed. The relationship between the parameters and the ratios of radiation intensity for scenarios with and without water curtain protection was established. A generalized equation to calculate the maximum attenuation of thermal radiation by a water curtain system was formulated using multiple regression analysis. The introduction of a building fire safety management system to monitor building fire safety based on the total fire safety concept together with an ultimate building fire safety audit system to ensure overall building fire safety has been developed. Methods and procedures in the evaluation of building fire safety levels are also presented. The thesis concludes that in the scenarios studied, the water curtain system performs well in temperature reduction, radiation attenuation and visibility enhancement on the refuge floor; and offers recommendations on how to improve the design of the water curtain system. Limitations of the study and suggestions on further work on the adequacy of ventilation requirement on the refuge floor are also given. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.
