40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented that college students {{use the term}} “hooking up” to discuss their casual sexual encounters. These encounters involve a range of sexual activity from kissing and fondling to oral, anal, and vaginal intercourse that occurs between strangers or associates without intent of a committed relationship. Prior {{research has}} examined who <b>hooks</b> <b>up,</b> what a <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> is, where <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> takes place, and consequences of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> (Heldman and Wade 2010). Yet, {{little is known about}} how and why students use this term to describe their sexual experiences. Using data from in-depth interviews with 20 college students at a large Midwestern university, this study explores links between the meanings students associate with the term <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> and how the term allows them to reconcile their beliefs about sexuality with their sexual behavior. Some areas under investigated include: what <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> means to students, how they use the term <b>hooking</b> <b>up,</b> and a comparison of the term <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with other terms for non-committal sex. Results indicate that the term <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> serves as a mechanism for impression management and this is achieved through creating gendered and sexed typologies, changing the meanings of sex, and constructing meaning as individuals and within groups...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Hook</b> <b>ups</b> are casual sexual {{encounters}} (ranging from kissing to intercourse) {{between two people}} with no clear mutual expectation of further interactions or a committed rela-tionship. This study utilized a short-term prospective design to examine predictors of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> {{in a sample of}} young adults (N = 394). Hooking up over the past year, positive reactions to prior <b>hook</b> <b>ups,</b> alcohol use, and loneliness were associated with <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> over a 4 -month period. Alcohol use was a stronger predictor for women than men. Thoughtfulness about relation-ship transitions and religiosity were significant predictors of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> in univariate analyses, but were not significant in multivariate analyses. Young adults who reported more depres-sive symptoms and feelings of loneliness at Time 1 and subse-quently engaged in penetrative <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> reported fewer depres-sive symptoms and lower feelings of loneliness at Time 2 as compared to young adults who did not <b>hook</b> <b>up.</b> However, young adults who reported fewer depressive symptoms and were less lonely at Time 1 and engaged in penetrative <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> over the 4 month period reported more depressive symptoms and greater feelings of loneliness at Time 2 as compared to young adults who did not <b>hook</b> <b>up.</b> Implications for relationship education programs are offered...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hook</b> <b>ups</b> are sexual {{encounters}} that can include {{a variety of}} behaviours (e. g., kissing to intercourse) with no expectation of future contact or a committed relationship. Although <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> {{is reported to be}} common on college campuses across the USA, little is known about whether the frequency of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> changes {{over the course of the}} college experience. Using cross-sectional data and the covariates alcohol use, gender and relationship status, we examined a synthetic cohort of undergraduate students (n 1003) on rates of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> using (1) logistic regression and (2) an applied form of survival analysis. Whereas both analytic techniques produced similar results, survival analysis provided a more complete picture by showing an increase in the rate of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> that peaked between spring semester of the first year of college and autumn semester of the second year of college, followed by a gradual decline in <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> rates over subsequent semesters. Findings indicate that gender is significantly related to <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> in the logistic regression analysis, with women reporting fewer hook ups; however, gender was not significantly related to <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> in the survival analysis, indicating that there are no differences in the pattern across cohorts. Implications for promoting the sexual health of college students and future research are discussed...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} ideas {{as to why}} people think young adults are {{involved}} in this <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> culture,such as that they feel like they have to do it to fit in. Some girls also reported that the main reason they are involved with random <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> is because they think that is what boys want. The feeling of being wanted by a cute guy is what they want and <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> are how girls think they can get that attention. However, many boys and girls did report that they do <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> with random people in order to find someone they could possibly start something serious with. That being said not all young adults are <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> with each other to fit the college norm, and gain sexual pleasure, but because they truly want to find someone they have a serious connection with. There was a study by University of Louisville researchers Owen and Fincham, who asked 500 undergraduate students that have been involved in <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> culture how they felt about commitment, and about 45% of men and 65% of women said they wanted their <b>hook</b> <b>ups</b> to possibly end up in a serious relationship.|$|R
40|$|College student alcohol {{consumption}} has many associated risky behaviors. For example, one {{issue in the}} college community is alcohol’s role in “hooking up ” behaviors.

Additionally, alcohol use is consistently associated with <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> behaviors for both males and. However, male and female college students experience the outcomes of <b>hooking</b> <b>up</b> (both positive and negative) differently.

To replicate the previous literature, the current study sought to determine the behavior of college students with regards to alcohol and <b>hooking</b> <b>up.</b> To extend the previous literature, the current study sought to examine gender differences with the amount of alcohol consumption and <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> encounters in the past week. Data for this study were collected via an online survey. A total of 454 college students at a Midwestern university participated (72. 2 % female and 24. 7 % male).

Participants completed an online survey about their frequency of attendance at different party types, as well as frequency of substance use and frequency of sexual behavior at these parties.

There was then a study of about 400 young adults that felt lonely and depressed and adults who had less feeling of loneliness and depression who were involved in sexual intercourse.
