50|$|In both, player {{drivers and}} rival drivers can be <b>freely</b> <b>selected.</b> Each {{driver in the}} game {{is divided into three}} levels based on real-life skill: A, B, and C. Because there are less entries than there are racers, these choices {{directly}} affect the game's difficulty.|$|E
50|$|This {{version of}} the game also uses two {{different}} type of Locomotive wildcards. In addition to the standard type, there are +4 locomotives, {{which can only be}} used as wildcards on routes of at least length four. The upside of this is that these locomotives can be <b>freely</b> <b>selected</b> from the available face-up cards without counting as a double-draw.|$|E
50|$|HiCAD {{supports}} 2D {{design and}} 3D modeling. The construction method {{can also be}} <b>freely</b> <b>selected</b> between the parametric and feature-and the free and direct construction. In parametric design the construction work starts with the mental model construction, with all parameters and conditions. However, In free design changes can be made directly in the 3D model, without considering {{the history of a}} part.|$|E
50|$|The player then <b>freely</b> <b>selects</b> one of {{the animals}} in {{question}} from the board and moves it accordingly. He/she can decide its route for him/herself.

He convinced the Archbishop of Mainz, , to select a king who would principally serve their interests. Gerard in turn recruited the new Archbishop of Trier, Bohemund I. Thereupon, the Count Palatine was forced {{to submit to the}} majority of the College of Electors. Siegfried therefore proposed to the Elector College to select Adolf of Nassau as king. They were ready to elect him, provided he make extensive concessions to the Electors and follow their political demands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{invisible}} deck {{is one of}} {{the best}} known card tricks. The trick's title stems from the classic presentation of this effect, in which the magician hands the spectator an imaginary, or [...] "invisible" [...] deck. On being handed the deck, the spectator is asked to mime the acts of removing the cards from their case, shuffling them, spreading them face-up on the table, <b>freely</b> <b>selecting</b> a card, replacing it face-down among the other face-up cards, and returning the deck to its box.|$|R

5000|$|David Gray {{disagrees with}} broad generalizations, and states {{defining}} Tantra {{is a difficult}} task because [...] "Tantra traditions are manifold, spanning several religious traditions and cultural worlds. As a result they are also diverse, {{which makes it a}} significant challenge {{to come up with an}} adequate definition". The challenge of defining Tantra is compounded by the fact that it has been a historically significant part of major Indian religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in and outside South Asia and East Asia. To its practitioners, Tantra is defined as a combination of texts, techniques, rituals, monastic practices, meditation, yoga, ideologies that are <b>freely</b> <b>selected</b> based on personal preference, or master-disciple developed, or guru-revealed.|$|E
50|$|All {{decisions}} of the sacred congregations require pontifical approval, unless special powers have been given previously by the pope. The officials of the congregations are divided into two classes: minor officers, who are to be chosen by competitive examination and named by a letter of the Cardinal-prefect, and major officers, <b>freely</b> <b>selected</b> by the pope, and named by a note of the Cardinal Secretary of State. There is to be henceforth no cumulation of offices {{in the hands of}} one individual, not only to satisfy the requirements of distributive justice, but also because the tenure of several offices by the same person often results in detriment to the service. Wherefore, it is forbidden for an officer of one of the congregations to serve in any way as an agent, or as a procurator or advocate, in his own department or in any other ecclesiastical tribunal.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{keywords}} used as metadata: controlled terms and free terms. Free terms have the advantage that metadata creators can <b>freely</b> <b>select</b> keywords, but there also exists a disadvantage that the information retrieval recall ratio might be reduced. The recall ratio can be improved by using controlled terms. But creating and maintaining controlled vocabularies has an enormous cost. In addition, many existing controlled vocabularies are published in formats less suitable for programming. We introduce a JavaScript library called “covo. js” that enables us to make use of controlled vocabularies as metadata for the organization of web pages...|$|R
5000|$|The {{player is}} able to <b>freely</b> <b>select</b> {{whichever}} stage to come next. The ordering could be important, as defeating a boss gives the character that bosss powers {{in the form of}} a new action, which can make it easier to take on the next boss. The difficulty of a stage will change according to how many stages you have previously cleared when entering it, making the stages progressively harder by introducing new subordinate enemies and increasing the boss health pool. The character also gains power in other areas, including increased jump height and the ability to lock on to a greater number of enemies with [...] "Demon Bullets".|$|R

Stockhausen found that there were certain advantages to an indoor venue (better auditory contact among the performers, improved control of the just tuning of the harmonies, etc.), and so decided henceforth to authorise such performances and drew up special instructions for those conditions.

Then, by using the difference of texture features between congestion image and unobstructed image, proposing vehicle density estimation based on texture analysis.

After features training, the decision threshold could be obtained and traffic congestion was carried out. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of algorithm was as high as 99 %, and the processing speed could satisfy the real-time requirement in engineering...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of robust {{stabilization}} for uncertain Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with constant time delays. The purpose is to design a state-feedback fuzzy controller such that the closed-loop system is robustly exponentially stable with a prescribed decay rate. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By using feasible solutions of these LMIs, desired fuzzy controllers are designed and their corresponding exponential estimates are given. In addition, the main results of this paper are explicitly dependent on the decay rate. This enables one to design fuzzy controllers by <b>freely</b> <b>selecting</b> decay rates according to different practical conditions. Two numerical examples are provided finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
