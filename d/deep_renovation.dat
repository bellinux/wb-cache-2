40|$|The {{building}} {{sector is}} well known {{to be responsible for}} a considerable part of the total European energy consumption. In the endeavor to implement radical reductions, there is an identified potential in addressing the existing building stock through <b>deep</b> <b>renovations.</b> These renovations make up complex, highly interdisciplinary systems. They involve stakeholders across a broad spectrum of disciplines and potentially affect the lives {{of a large number of}} occupants. The involved people bring different understandings of value in sustainability into a project and judge the outcome according to this understanding. As a response to this, a number of sustainable assessment methodologies for the building industry, and specifically for that of retrofitting, have been developed to assist in the decision-making processes and ensure targeted results. However, these methodologies themselves represent a stance on sustainability as they assign weight to different sustainability indicators. As such, the same design may be assessed differently according to the chosen tool. As part of the research project RE-VALUE, this paper presents an evaluation of current practices in a Danish context through a systematic literature review of existing assessment tools. The paper presents the results of a metasynthesis, which highlights the focus areas of the individual tool as well as patterns and relationships between the tools. Based on the review we discuss a noticeable focus on quantitative, technical values in today’s ‘assessment practice’ and put forward the hypothesis that there is a need to rank qualitative, ‘non-technical’ values alongside quantitative values in order to deliver significantly improved building performance, which benefits the people who inhabit the built environment. This hypothesis is substantiated through an additional literature review, from which we propose a need to develop a holistic methodology for assessing architectural transformations in <b>deep</b> <b>renovations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{findings}} from a monitor containing around 1. 5 million {{homes in the}} Dutch non-profit rented sector show that the energy improvement pace in the sector {{in the last years}} is too slow to meet the nationally agreed level in 2020. The findings also show that the improvement of the energy performance of the respective homes is mostly carried out in small steps: in many of the improved dwellings only one single measure is applied, and <b>deep</b> energy <b>renovations</b> are rare. Advocators of such renovations nevertheless believe that such improvements are the most appropriate way to substantially reducing energy consumption and argue that the developments and proliferation of energy renovation concepts is the best way forward. Others, however, do not see this as realistic and argue that reality forces us to proceed on the path of small interventions. This study sheds more light on this debate from the way in which housing providers conceive and implement their portfolio and asset management strategies. From these investment policies, it seeks explanations for the dominance of the small interventions and investigates the room for a more concentrated allocation of budget resources. To this end, housing providers with different energy investment policies are selected and interviewed.

40|$|Sustainability {{paradigm}} foresees {{a balance}} of energy production and consumption with no, or minimal, negative impact on environment (within the environmental tolerance limits). It gives an opportunity to a country to employ its potentiality {{of the social and}} economic activities. An overview of recent researches about building renovation context demonstrates the lack of an appropriate methodology and decision support framework -by compounding the typical challenges of sustainable retrofitting from theory to implement stages- that takes into account the retrofitting projects throughout more comprehensive insights and perspectives. It calls, therefore, for a <b>deep</b> building <b>renovation</b> approach. The major difference between a <b>deep</b> building <b>renovation</b> project and an ordinary one is commitment to a holistic approach. From one side, it initially should {{be able to deal with}} the society including various stakeholders with different priorities and barriers -on the top of the list is behavioral barriers about energy consumption- in order to improve their learning; to the other side, it has to perform multiple optimization through sustainability development perspective in its full sense. The intent is to identify, manage, and evaluate the renovation objectives through different available retrofitting alternatives during the early design stages. In this framework, the paper considers building renovation as a complex messy/wicked problem and later it gives details on how combinations of methods that are parts of SSM (Soft Systems Methodologies) and MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) may support multiple perspectives of such a problem. The aim is to promote a methodology which is initially able to deal with complexity of the detected problem and subsequently to address building renovation process in order to involve the various stakeholders in the design process [and keep them involved in all design stages].

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} challenge in Europe is mainly concerned with existing {{buildings and the}} investment scenarios to implement <b>deep</b> <b>renovations.</b> The cost-optimal approach imposed on EU-Member states by the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aims to identify the investment gap and challenges to transform existing buildings into nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs). The investment gap is function of several volatile financial parameters including discount rate (r), developing of energy price (e), decline rate of technology price (d), as well as nZEB’s incentives like feed-in-tariff (FiT) and investment grant (iG). In this context, the decision making process of individuals or investment institutions is hindered by complexity and uncertainty. In order to assist the decision making process and improve the visibility of financial energy benefits, a novel optimization-based parametric analysis scheme (OptnZEB-I) is developed. The scheme is designed to investigate {{a large number of}} economic scenarios (i. e., combinations of financial assumptions) in a short computational time while a holistic optimization approach is adopting for exploring all possible design options including energy conservation measures (ESMs); renewable energy sources (RETs) and mechanical systems (Sys). For demonstration, the scheme is applied to analyse the impact of several financial parameters on the cost-optimal energy performance level (CO-EPL) of a single family house in Finland. In line with the EU-directive, a large number of possible design options (∼ 3 × 109 million) are optimized for 4608 cases of economic scenarios. The results of the address case study show that, in average, the CO-EPL ranges from 90 to 160 [kWh/m 2]. The range has most frequent value of 145 kWh/m 2. The CO-EPL is significantly sensitive to the e, f, then i, respectively. Less sensitivity is found to the other financial parameters. The robustness of the optimization results are verified by solving the addressed design problem by using four different optimization algorithms (i. e., pattern search, interior-point, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms).

30|$|Public {{universities}} {{face the}} challenge of retrofitting the actual campus buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB). In this study, a novel methodology for evaluating historical energy use and renewable energy production for all the buildings of a university, including hourly, daily and monthly data assessments is presented. This analysis is useful as a baseline for comparisons with future energy retrofits and enables determining the current gap between actual energy indicators at building and campus levels and the established limits for NZEB non-residential buildings in the European Union. The methodology is applied to a case study at the University of Lleida, a typical average-size university in Spain. Results show a wide variation in energy use among campus buildings, ranging between 50 and 470  kWh/m 2  year. Constant or slightly increasing energy use and decreasing trends in renewable energy generation are observed. The daily electricity profiles have shown similar patterns among buildings and substantial potential energy savings during unoccupied periods. In the NZEB analysis, the average non-renewable primary energy use is about 4 times higher than the maximum estimated Spanish threshold range of 45 – 55  kWh/m 2  year. <b>Deep</b> energy <b>renovation</b> strategies are, thus, needed for universities to meet EU NZEB targets.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{housing stock}} {{plays a major role}} in meeting the energy saving targets set in the Netherlands as well as in the EU. Existing buildings account for 38 % of the final energy consumption in the European Union (EU), and they are responsible for 36 % of the CO 2 emissions. Energy renovations in dwellings offer unique opportunities to reduce both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In this article, the renovation rates for the non-profit housing stock of the Netherlands are presented, based on the changes in the energy performance of 856, 252 dwellings for the period of 2010 – 2014. The data necessary are drawn from a monitoring system that contains information about the energy performance of approximately 60 % of all dwellings in the sector. The method used follows the changes of the dwellings’ physical properties and reported energy performance. The results show that although many energy improvements have been realized, they result in small changes of the energy efficiency of the dwellings. <b>Deep</b> energy <b>renovation</b> rates are very low.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the environmental impacts of renovating an exemplary single-family house built between 1980 and 1990 to the TEK 10 or NS 3700 (passive house) standard. The scope of the analysis is split in two steps. First, one exemplary house is analysed and impacts from renovation depending on the refurbishment scenario and different shares of primary energy mix are compared against each other. Subsequently, the analysis of the whole stock of single &# 150;family houses built between 1980 and 1990 is presented. Dynamic modelling is used for assessment of changes due to demolition, renovation rate and erection of new buildings. The scope of this study includes analysis for two characterizations: cumulative energy demand (CED) and climate change (CC). Both materials used for renovation and energy needed for the operation of the house are investigated. Beyond the scope of this thesis is assessment of the demolition of the house and materials and impacts related to the construction of the exemplary house. The results indicate that retrofitting with the NS 3700 scenario gives bigger energy and GHG savings than with the TEK 10 scenario. During renovation, the biggest impacts occur due to usage of high-density insulation and production of solar collector system. Overall, the renovation package for NS 3700 scenario contributes more to the CC impact than for TEK 10 scenario. The total difference between those two scenarios is 2. 38 E+ 03 kgCO 2 -eq (11 %). This difference is relatively small when compared to the GHG reduction potential for both scenarios. Results from dynamic modelling shows that cumulated GHG savings during period 2010 - 2050 with reference to 2010 level were very low for TEK 10 scenario. By 2050 the cumulated saving potential was estimated to be 112 ktoneCO 2 -eq which was 8 % of cumulative saving potential for NS 3700 scenario achieved by the same time. For NS 3700 scenario, the accumulated GHG emissions saving potential would be positive for all of the energy scenarios, assuming that either 7 % or 12 % of electricity is imported from Nordic or EU mix for Norwegian use. The saving potential would still be positive even when assuming, the worst-case scenario for the EU mix (red scenario). That shows the potential and role of renovating the existing building stock. The level of renovation as well plays a significant role. If the existing single-family houses stock built between 1980 and 1990, would be renovated to the TEK 10 standard the cumulated GHG emissions saving potential would be positive for only the ultra-green EU mix scenario, which is the most optimistic. If the shares of imported electricity will increase and the EU mix would be imported, the potential for saving GHG emissions could be highly dependent on the level and quality of <b>deep</b> <b>renovations.</b> That is assuming that other variables such as behavior linked to energy use would not change. </p...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{literature}} about energy retrofit focuses on single buildings, but {{the investigation of}} whole building stocks is particularly worthy because it can yield substantial energy, environmental and economic benefits. Hence, how to address large-scale energy retrofit of existing building stocks? The paper handles this issue by employing a methodology that provides a robust energy analysis of building categories. This is denoted as SLABE, “Simulation-based Large-scale uncertainty/sensitivity Analysis of Building Energy performance”. It was presented by the same authors and is here enhanced to investigate a whole and heterogeneous building stock that includes various categories. Each category is represented via a Representative Building Sample (RBS), which is defined through Latin hypercube sampling and uncertainty analysis. Hence, optimal retrofit packages are found in function of building location, intended use and construction type. Two families of optimal solutions are achieved. The first one collects the most energy-efficient (and thus sustainable) solutions, among the ones that produce global cost savings, thereby addressing the public perspective. The second one collects cost-optimal solutions thereby addressing the private perspective. EnergyPlus is employed as a simulation tool and coupled with MATLAB® for data analysis and processing. The methodology is applied to a significant share of the Italian public administration building stock, which includes several building categories depending on location, use destination and construction type. The outcomes show huge potential energy and economic savings, and could support a <b>deep</b> energy <b>renovation</b> of the Italian building stock...|$|R
