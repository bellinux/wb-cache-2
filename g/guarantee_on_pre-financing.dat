40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} overlending {{problems}} and banking crises in open economies are provoked by investor moral hazard, {{which is caused}} in turn by <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> deposits. This Paper shows {{that this is not}} necessarily the case: <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> deposits may even limit the losses banks accumulate. In the model, banks may rationally accumulate bad loans if international investors have incomplete information on firm profitability and initially provide funds at low cost. In equilibrium, international investors rationally require a risk premium and banks stop renewing bad loans, only when a substantial amount of losses has been accumulated. This feature of the equilibrium does not depend on whether or not there are <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> deposits. Transparency and bond market development can eliminate overlending problems and prevent banking crises. bank-firm relationships; banking crises; bond markets; <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> deposits; transparency...|$|R

The proposed schedulers finds the transmission rate and power using temporal water-filling techniques without any knowledge of the arrival traffic statistics. We also introduce an iterative process to compute a lower bound on the transmit power of any scheduler that provides absolute delay guarantees. The proposed schedulers and iterative method of computing the lower bound are also shown to provide statistical <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> packet delays. I...|$|R

We first propose {{a model to}} quantify video quality and stability. We then develop graph construction algorithms that ensure statistical <b>guarantee</b> <b>on</b> video quality at every peer. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that video quality and stability can be explicitly controlled. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms use the server resources efficiently while significantly improving the video stability at peers...|$|R
