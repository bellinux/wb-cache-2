Historians <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the buildup of Viet Cong forces in the south before the early 1968 Tet Offensive. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General William Westmoreland, maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|Economists <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> {{consumers}} tend {{to travel}} more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in {{the demand for}} fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

5|$|Written {{at a time}} of {{religious}} upheaval, and {{in the wake of the}} English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they present a contradiction of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of naturism tends to increase {{during the summer}} months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist. Some studies <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists. This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.|$|E
25|$|Although auditory–motor {{interactions}} can {{be observed}} in people without formal musical training, musicians are an excellent population to study because of their long-established and rich associations between auditory and motor systems. Musicians have been shown to have anatomical adaptations that correlate with their training.

25|$|President Toda's linking of Makiguchi's {{progressive}} {{ideals and}} Nichiren Shōshū institutions created an immensely effective, if inherently unstable alliance, {{which resulted in}} periodic outbreaks of tension between the priesthood and the laity. Other scholars <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> {{it is no surprise}} that a culturally conservative Japanese priesthood built on ideas of hierarchy, ritual, and traditional custom should conflict with a global lay movement built on ideas of egalitarianism, active faith, and rational adaption to the modern world would be unsustainable.|$|E
25|$|Prior to its creation, Quezon {{was once}} part of a vast track of {{agricultural}} land called the Mallig Plains. At that time, the area that is now under the political jurisdiction of the municipality was sparsely populated. Historians believe that the precursor of the present inhabitants of Quezon were the Igorots and the Kalingas of the Cordilleras. Although the Igorots and the Kalingas are primarily upland dwellers, historians <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> these natives {{come down from the}} highlands {{from time to time to}} hunt for low-landers especially the Kanyaw rituals.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to close}} {{proximity}} to the Arabian Sea, Gujarat has developed a mercantile ethos which maintained a cultural tradition of seafaring, long-distance trade, and overseas contacts with the outside world since ancient times, and the diffusion of culture through Gujarati diaspora was a logical outcome of such a tradition. During the pre-modern period, various European sources <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> these merchants formed diaspora communities outside of Gujarat, and {{in many parts of the}} world, such as the Persian Gulf, Middle East, Horn of Africa, Hong Kong and Indonesia long before the internal rise of the Maratha Dynasty, and the British Raj colonial occupation.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Indus valley developed a system of standardization, using weights and measures, evident by the excavations made at the Indus valley sites. This technical standardization enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Calibration was also found in measuring devices along with multiple subdivisions in case of some devices. One of the earliest known docks is at Lothal (2400 BCE), located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the Harappans must have possessed knowledge relating to tides {{in order to build}} such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary hydrography and maritime engineering.|$|E
25|$|Communalism and {{communal}} violence {{are among the}} problems faced by Indian Muslims. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> in the Hindu-Muslim communal riots in India, it is invariably Muslims who suffer the greatest losses. Proportionately more Muslims are killed and more Muslim property is destroyed. In 1961 and 1964 there were riots in Jamshedpur, Rourkela and Jabalpur. Major riots took place in Ranchi, Bihar in 1967 and in Ahmedabad in Gujarat in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s major communal riots took place. In many of these riots nearly 1000 Muslims were killed. In 1992-3 riots took place in Bombay in which 575 Muslims perished. From 1992 to 2003 the Muslim community faced a series of communal riots, among which the most serious was the Babri mosque incident.|$|E
25|$|In human cells, the ABO alleles {{and their}} encoded glycosyltransferases have been {{described}} in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event {{as part of the}} underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.|$|E

25|$|Large-scale {{farming is}} {{necessary}} to produce agricultural alcohol and this requires substantial amounts of cultivated land. University of Minnesota researchers report that if all corn grown in the U.S. were used to make ethanol it would displace 12% of current U.S. gasoline consumption. There are claims that land for ethanol production is acquired through deforestation, while others <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> areas currently supporting forests are usually not suitable for growing crops. In any case, farming may involve a decline in soil fertility due to reduction of organic matter, a decrease in water availability and quality, {{an increase in the}} use of pesticides and fertilizers, and potential dislocation of local communities. New technology enables farmers and processors to increasingly produce the same output using less inputs.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 The U.S. had {{the fourth}} widest income {{distribution}} among OECD nations, behind Turkey, Mexico and Chile. The Brookings Institution said in March 2013 that income inequality was increasing and becoming permanent, sharply reducing social mobility in the US. The OECD ranks the US 10th in social mobility, behind the Nordic countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and France. Of the major developed nations, only Italy and Great Britain have lower mobility. This has been partly {{attributed to the}} depth of American poverty, which leaves poor children economically disadvantaged, though others <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> a relative rise in the U.S. is mathematically harder due to its higher and more widely distributed income range than in nations with artificial income compression, even if one enjoys more absolute mobility in the U.S., and have questioned how meaningful such international comparisons are.|$|E
25|$|Historians such as Ellis and Stewart <b>have</b> <b>observed</b> <b>that,</b> under William Howe's command, the British squandered several {{opportunities}} {{to achieve a}} decisive victory over the Americans. Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors, errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory. At Long Island, Howe failed to even attempt an encirclement of Washington, and actively restrained his subordinates from mounting an aggressive pursuit of the defeated American army. At White Plains, he refused to engage Washington's vulnerable army, and instead concentrated his efforts upon a hill which offered the British no strategic advantage. After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army. Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause and the surge of Loyalist activity {{in the wake of}} Washington's defeats, Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.|$|E
