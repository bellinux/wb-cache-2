5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> {{on the river}} for thirty years. In 1947, the college {{chaplain}} Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been back in the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In the band's home country, the United Kingdom, Gravity the Seducer {{peaked at}} number 72 on the UK Albums Chart, {{spending}} one {{week on the}} chart. This was the band's <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> on the chart, as their only other charting album was Velocifero, which reached number 75.|$|E
5|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound {{in comparison to}} their previous record. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two, the band's <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> ever. It eventually achieved double platinum status and became their most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. Although critics felt that it lacked a classic single and considered it a minor letdown compared to Body Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album {{reached the top of}} the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> on the chart.|$|E
50|$|The {{change from}} gut to steel has also {{affected}} the instrument's playing technique {{over the last}} hundred years. Steel strings {{can be set up}} closer to the fingerboard and, additionally, strings can be played in <b>higher</b> <b>positions</b> on the lower strings and still produce clear tone. The classic 19th century Franz Simandl method does not use the low E string in <b>higher</b> <b>positions</b> because older gut strings, set up high over the fingerboard, could not produce clear tone in these <b>higher</b> <b>positions.</b> However, with modern steel strings, bassists can play with clear tone in <b>higher</b> <b>positions</b> on the low E and A strings, particularly when they use modern lighter-gauge, lower-tension steel strings. For information on the strings used in regular and solo tuning (F#-B-E-A) and with different types of basses (e.g., four-string and five-string), see the section below on tuning.|$|R

That week, it shifted 27,000 album-equivalent units, 23,000 of which were sales, making it the album's highest-selling week in the US since 3 January 1993.|$|E
5|$|He was {{replaced}} by another Welsh manager, Mark Hughes. Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in 2013–14, their <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> in the Premier League and best finish since 1974–75. Stoke again finished in ninth position in 2014–15, which ended with a 6–1 victory against Liverpool. Despite breaking their transfer record twice (on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula), in 2015–16, Stoke did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in 2016–17, finishing in 13th position.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{did not differ from}} the previous two titles. Wipeout is based on a futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer-controlled AI opponents to finish in the <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> possible. Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E

5|$|Critics gave {{mixed reviews}} for the album, with their general {{complaint}} {{being that the}} release was unnecessary. Most of them, however, complimented The Weeknd, Twin Shadow and Guéna LG's remixes. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Commercially, Born This Way: The Remix achieved minor success, entering the charts in ten countries. Its <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> was attained in Japan, where it reached top-twenty, while in the United States, it failed to reach the top-100 of the Billboard 200 albums chart.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County, {{they took the}} lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for {{re-election}} to the League five times, and by 1982 they were facing a financial crisis which they survived thanks to fundraising efforts in the town. Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division; the 13th-place finish in 1986 was the <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> they achieved in the Football League since {{the introduction of the}} four-division structure in 1958, but they were relegated the following season.|$|E

It was the band's <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> on the US charts until their 2009 album The Eternal reached No. 18. The album also charted in several other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands and Sweden. The band {{did not support the}} album with a tour due to Gordon's advanced pregnancy at the time. As of 2005, the album had sold 246,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|Following {{schooling}} at Wellington College, Bellew {{went up to}} Christ Church, Oxford. He {{arrived at}} the College of Arms in 1922, when he was appointed Portcullis Pursuivant. After four years in that capacity, {{he was promoted to}} the office of Somerset Herald and went on to serve as the College’s registrar from 1935 to 1946. His heraldic career was interrupted by World War II, when Bellew rose to the rank of Squadron Leader in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and was mentioned in despatches. Having spent 24 years as Somerset Herald, he succeeded Sir Algar Howard as Garter Principal King of Arms in 1950, the <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> in the College of Arms and the leading herald in England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|In {{different}} eras, various gods {{were said}} to hold the <b>highest</b> <b>position</b> in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited {{with the creation of}} the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten.|$|E
