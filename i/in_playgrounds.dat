5|$|The show {{focused on}} Arab heritage, like the wedding rituals of {{countries}} in the region, and included Arab poems and songs. Iftah Ya Simsim premiered in Kuwait in September 1979, and was broadcast in all Arabic-speaking countries excluding Egypt. The show's opening consisted of a catchy tune that became beloved of its young viewers. As the song played, the opening footage showed children across the Arab world running past familiar landmarks like the Pyramids and playing <b>in</b> <b>playgrounds</b> and ancient alleyways before running into a white fort that had its gates open wide. The show's set consisted of an intricately traditional Arabian neighborhood called Sharee Eshreen (20th Street).|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, {{and several of the}} hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set <b>in</b> <b>playgrounds</b> and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1903, a {{government}} policy to discourage, and even punish, {{the use of}} the Māori language <b>in</b> <b>playgrounds</b> was enacted. In the early 1930s the director of Education blocked an initiative by the New Zealand Federation of Teachers to have the Māori language added to the curriculum. Though not the only factor, the ban on the Māori language in education contributed to the widespread loss of Māori-language ability. By 1960 the number of Māori who could speak the language had fallen to 25% from 95% in 1900.|$|E

500|$|Palestinian {{children}} were distressed by the repeated broadcasting of the footage, {{according to a}} therapist in Gaza, and were re-enacting the scene <b>in</b> <b>playgrounds.</b> Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images. Parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honour, and Osama bin Laden mentioned him in a [...] "warning" [...] to President George Bush after 9/11. The images were blamed for the 2000 Ramallah lynching and a rise in antisemitism in France.

2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement <b>in</b> <b>playgrounds</b> and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} February 18, 2009, {{less than two}} months before the show premiered. The show faced early production delays because Poehler was pregnant when she signed on, and filming had to be postponed until she gave birth. The show was filmed in Southern California. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, and several of the hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a large studio set sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. The set also includes four hallways that make up the hospital setting where Ann Perkins works as a nurse. The construction pit featured throughout the first and second seasons was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24hours a day. Scenes set <b>in</b> <b>playgrounds</b> and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles. Most scenes set in locations outside the usual Parks and Recreation settings are also filmed in Los Angeles-area locations. For example, public forum scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools, and a town meeting scene in the episode [...] "Eagleton" [...] was shot at the Toluca Lake Sports Center in the Toluca Lake district of Los Angeles. Other Eagleton scenes were also shot at the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens, located in San Marino. Elaborate festival setting and corn maze sets featured in [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] was filmed at a real-life festival setting at Los Angeles Pierce College, a community college in Woodland Hills, California. Schur said an aerial shot of the harvest festival {{at the end of the}} episode was the most expensive shot in the entire series.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This chapter investigates {{an episode}} where a supervising teacher on {{playground}} duty asks two boys to each {{give an account}} of their actions over an incident that had just occurred on some climbing equipment <b>in</b> the <b>playground.</b> Methodology This paper employs an ethnomethodological approach using conversation analysis. The data are taken from a corpus of video recorded interactions of children, aged 7 - 9 years, and the teacher, <b>in</b> school <b>playgrounds</b> during the lunch recess. Findings The findings show the ways that children work up accounts of their playground practices when asked by the teacher. The teacher initially provided interactional space for each child to give their version of the events. Ultimately, the teacher’s version of how to act <b>in</b> the <b>playground</b> became the sanctioned one. The children and the teacher formulated particular social orders of behavior <b>in</b> the <b>playground</b> through multi-modal devices, direct reported speech and scripts. Such public displays of talk work as socialization practices that frame teacher-sanctioned morally appropriate actions <b>in</b> the <b>playground.</b> Value of paper This chapter shows the pervasiveness of the teacher’s social order, as she presented an institutional social order of how to interact <b>in</b> the <b>playground,</b> showing clearly the disjunction of adult-child orders between the teacher and children...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{refereed}} conference paper. Current {{research indicates}} {{that the use of}} playgrounds by older adults would provide many health benefits. The paper explores the attitudes and barriers faced by older UK adults towards the concept of using playgrounds for exercise. Interviews and discussion groups were held involving in total 125 older adults between the ages of 58 and 100. The views of equipment manufacturers and those with a professional interest <b>in</b> <b>playground</b> provision were also sought using interviews and postal questionnaires. Whilst the older adults sampled were currently making very little use of playground equipment, there was notable interest in the concept of playground use. Considerable social barriers to playground use were however highlighted. Placing <b>playgrounds</b> <b>in</b> a controlled supervised environment and partaking <b>in</b> <b>playground</b> use with grandchildren were seen as the most popular ways of overcoming such barriers. Even when functionally inclusive equipment is available it is important that all social barriers are overcome, if older adults are to use playgrounds...|$|R
