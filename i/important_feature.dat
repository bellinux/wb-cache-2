5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of anti-de Sitter {{space is}} its {{boundary}} (which {{looks like a}} cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.|$|E
5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of {{the period}} was the {{development}} of the character makeup of superheroes. Young children and girls were targeted during the Silver Age by certain publishers; in particular, Harvey Comics attracted this group with titles such as Little Dot. Adult-oriented underground comics also began during the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a {{hot blast}} iron furnace located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States.

5|$|The Shapley–Folkman lemma enables {{researchers}} to extend results for Minkowski sums of convex sets to sums of general sets, which {{need not be}} convex. Such sums of sets arise in economics, in mathematical optimization, and in probability theory; {{in each of these}} three mathematical sciences, non-convexity is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of applications.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game. While causing much amusement when the side visited London in 1866, the header {{would become an}} <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of the national game.

5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most <b>important</b> <b>feature.</b> Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
5|$|The left-wing preoccupations {{were also}} an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of Libertatea. Its opening {{manifesto}} {{called for a}} large-scale social reform, which it claimed {{was more important to}} Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord. It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.|$|E

5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of English cathedrals, {{uncommon}} elsewhere {{except in}} Normandy, {{is the large}} and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> that {{distinguished}} Maqam al-Khawwas {{from the}} Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large groups of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{supported}} {{himself as}} an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As {{his reputation as a}} performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed financial security. He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni Sgambati and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poems would become an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's D minor piano trio, a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, {{following}} {{a survey of}} coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen Martello Towers were constructed along the western shore of Pevensey Bay, continuing as far as Tower73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of the town's seafront and {{was the subject of}} a painting by James Sant RA, and part of Tower68 forms the basement of a house on St.Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction took place of a fortress known as the Eastbourne Redoubt, which was built as a barracks and storage depot, and armed with 10cannons.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, {{fighting}} for the main position around Sattelberg commenced. The previous night, in order {{to prepare for the}} attack on the 2200 feature, the 2/48th Battalion captured Green Ridge, a small but <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> that dominated the Sattelberg road. The capture of the ridge secured a start line forward of Jivevaneng for Whitehead's 26th Brigade to launch the first stage of their attack upon Sattelberg. The following day, the 2/48th Battalion handed over responsibility for the defence of the ridge to a company from the 2/23rd Battalion, and the attack commenced amidst heavy supporting artillery and machine-gun fire. In response, the Japanese artillery from Sattelberg fired a limited barrage onto the Australians on Green Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of {{cellular}} innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, {{but can be}} called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of Seattle's weather. In the {{convergence}} zone, air arriving {{from the north}} meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
