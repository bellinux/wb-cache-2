40|$|Breaking waves (whitecaps) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and least understood processes associated with the evolution of the surface gravity wave field in the open sea. This process is the principal means by which energy and momentum are transferred away from a developing sea. However, an estimation of the frequency of breaking waves or the fraction of sea surface covered by whitecaps and the amount of dissipated energy induced by breaking is very difficult to carry out under real sea conditions. A controlled experiment, funded by the European Commission under the <b>Improving</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Potential</b> Access Infrastructures <b>programme,</b> was carried out in the Ocean Basin Laboratory at MARINTEK, Trondheim (Norway). Simulation of random waves of the prescribed spectra by wave makers provided a very realistic pattern of the sea surface.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the conjugative coupling protein TrwBΔN 70 from Escherichia coli plasmid R 388 was solved using two crystal forms. This large multimeric membrane protein of 437 residues per monomer is involved in cell-to-cell single-strand DNA transfer. Diffraction data to 2. 4 Å were available from trigonal crystals obtained from ammonium sulfate and to 2. 5 Å from monoclinic crystals grown from tartrate. A single tantalum bromide (Ta 6 Br 12 2 +) derivative of the trigonal form, which presented a protein hexamer with C 6 local symmetry in the asymmetric unit, was used in a three-wavelength MAD experiment to achieve 4. 5 Å resolution for initial phases. Sixfold averaging and phase extension increased the effective phasing resolution and eventually produced a straightforwardly traceable electron-density map. The monoclinic structure was solved by molecular replacement, i. e. a hexamer of the trigonal form {{was used as a}} search model. Two such hexamers are present in the asymmetric unit.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of H-(L-Tyr-D-Tyr) 4 -L-Lys-OH {{has been determined}} to 1. 3 Å resolution. The D,L-alternating peptide crystallizes in the tetragonal system, space group P 43212, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 27. 99 (3), c = 78. 93 (8) Å. The crystals contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit that form a double-stranded right-handed antiparallel β-helix. The structure has been solved by SIRAS using a crystal soaked in an iodide-containing solution for 1 min. The programs SHELXD and SHELXE {{were used to determine}} the iodide substructure and also the experimental electron-density map. Using the coordinates of known D,L-peptides deposited in the PDB, several attempts were made to solve the structure by molecular-replacement techniques. Although the backbone of the MR model selected shows great similarity and was used to trace the actual peptide structure in the map, {{it was not possible to}} obtain the correct solution before the experimental phases became available. The correct fragment orientations are easily determined, but the same does not apply to the translation search. Nevertheless, insights into fragment search and expansion were gained from the tests described in this paper. The correlation coefficient calculated with the resolution shell of data around 2. 4 Å, a distance corresponding to most 1 - 3 interatomic vectors, is a particularly good discriminator of correct orientations in the rotation search of small fragments. © 2004 International Union of Crystallography.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the complex of 7 -amino-actinomycin D with potentially single-stranded DNA has been studied by X-ray crystallography in the solid state, by NMR in solution and by molecular modelling. The crystal structures of the complex with 5 ′-TTAG[Br 5 U]T- 3 ′ provide interesting examples of MAD phasing in which the dispersive component of the MAD signal was almost certainly enhanced by radiation damage. The trigonal and orthorhombic crystal modifications both contain antibiotic molecules and DNA strands {{in the form of}} a 2 : 4 complex: in the orthorhombic form there is one such complex in the asymmetric unit, while in the trigonal structure there are four. In both structures the phenoxazone ring of the first drug intercalates between a BrU-G (analogous to T-G) wobble pair and a G-T pair where the T is part of a symmetry-related molecule. The chromophore of the second actinomycin intercalates between the BrU-G and G-BrU wobble pairs of the partially paired third and fourth strands. The base stacking also involves (A*T) *T triplets and Watson-Crick A-T pairs and leads to similar complex three-dimensional networks in both structures, with looping-out of unpaired bases. Although the available NOE constraints of a solution containing the antibiotic and d(TTTAGTTT) strands in the ratio 1 : 1 are insufficient to determine the structure of the complex from the NMR data alone, they are consistent with the intercalation geometry observed in the crystal structure. Molecular-dynamics (MD) trajectories starting from the 1 : 2 complexes observed in the crystal showed that although the thymines flanking the d(AGT) core are rather flexible and the G-T pairing is not permanently preserved, both strands remain bound to the actinomycin by strong interactions between it and the guanines between which it is sandwiched. Similar strong binding (hemi-intercalation) of the actinomycin to a single guanine was observed in the MD trajectories of a 1 : 1 complex. The dominant interaction is between the antibiotic and guanine, but the complexes are stabilized further by promiscuous base-pairing. © 2005 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.

These masers seem to be produced in the very inhomogeneous region between the star and the inner dust formation zone, placed at 5 - 7 R*, with expansion velocities below 10 km/s. We interpret the pumping mechanism as due to overlaps between v= 1 - 0 ro-vibrational lines of SiS and mid-IR lines of C 2 H 2, HCN and their 13 C isotopologues. The large number of overlaps found suggests the existence of strong masers for high-J v= 0 and v= 1 SiS transitions, located in the submillimeter range. In addition, it could be possible to find several rotational lines of the SiS isotopologues displaying maser emission. We {{want to thank the}} IRAM staff, M. J. Richter (NSF grant AST- 0307497), J.

Low genetic variability in northeastern Spanish populations of C. amporitana suggests long-distance dispersal from central Italy. The interior position of the single northeastern Spanish haplotype in a statistical parsimony network of trnL-trnF haplotypes however does not support this scenario and invokes other plausible phylogeographic explanations. The disappearance of geographically intermediate populations and genetic impoverishment by migration and isolation, both probably associated with Quaternary climatic oscillations, appears as an alternative hypothesis to explain the phylogeographic pattern. A recent hybridization event is reported between C. amporitana and a diploid from the C. pratensis group in central Italy {{on the basis of}} additive polymorphisms in ITS for all the 22 distinguishing nucleotides.

We {{report on}} the first far-IR {{detection}} of H 2 D+, using the Infrared Space Observatory, {{in the line of}} sight toward Sgr B 2 in the galactic center. The transition at λ= 126. 853 μm connecting the ground level of o-H 2 D+, 1 _ 1, 1 with the the 2 _ 1, 2 level at 113 K, is observed in absorption against the continuum emission of the cold dust of the source. The line is broad, with a total absorption covering 350 km s^- 1, i. e., similar to that observed in the fundamental transitions of H 2 O, OH and CH at 179, 119 and 149 μm respectively. For the physical conditions of the different absorbing clouds the H 2 D+ column density ranges from 2 to 5 x 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2, i. e., near an order of magnitude below the upper limits obtained from ground based submillimeter telescopes. The derived H 2 D+ abundance is of a few 10 ^- 10, which agrees with chemical models predictions for a gas at a kinetic temperature of 20 K.

Facultad de Ciencias el 02 / 10 / 2006. 163 pp. In this Thesis, we have {{addressed}} {{the study of the}} molecular recognition of glycomimetics and natural sugars by using NMR spectroscopy. Apart from my personal formation issue, we have selected this topic because we feel that it is timely, scientifically interesting, and very few examples have been described from a rigorous view point. Different biologically relevant systems have been selected that vary from toxins to enzymes, passing through a variety of plant and animal lectins. In all these cases, apart of the intrinsic nature of the investigation, we have tried to implement new methods and to extend the use of different NMR protocols. The experimental work is presented here in a format that includes a brief introduction to the topic followed by the published paper/s (or documents in submission) in scientific journals. Five different topics are here discussed, defined with regard to possible targets with particular biomedical interest. The project was supported by the <b>Improving</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Potential</b> Program under contract HPRN-CT- 2002 00173 (Glycidic Scaffolds Network).

40|$|Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Graph Transformation and Visual Modeling Techniques (GT-VMT 2007) Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) {{allow the}} {{specification}} of high-level rules modelling the synchronized creation of elements in two graphs related through a correspondence graph. Low-level operational rules are then derived to manipulate concrete graphs. However, TGG rules may become unnecessarily verbose when elements {{have to be}} replicated from one graph to the other, and their actual derivation cannot exploit the presence of reoccurring patterns. Moreover they do not take advantage from situations in which a normal creation grammar {{for one of the}} graphs exists, from which TGG operational rules can be derived to build the other graph. We present an approach to generating TGG operational rules from normal ones, reducing the information needed to derive them, through the definition of Triple Patterns, a high-level, compact, declarative, and visual notation for the description of admissible structures in a triple graph. Patterns can be expressed with respect to classes defined in a meta-model, and instantiated with derived classes at the model level, thus exploiting the inheritance hierarchies. The application of the generated rules results into the (synchronized or batch) creation of the structures specified in the patterns. We illustrate these concepts by showing their application to the synchronized incremental construction of visual models and of their semantics.
