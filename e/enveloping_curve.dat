40|$|Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) is {{used for}} {{estimating}} Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) which, in turn, {{is used for}} design of major hydraulic structures, such as dams and spillways, flood protection works, and nuclear power plants. One of the commonly used methods for estimating PMP is the statistical method that entails computation of frequency factor, adjustment of the frequency factor, construction of an <b>enveloping</b> <b>curve</b> of the frequency factor, estimation of PMP, choosing a probability distribution, and determination of the return period. This study determined the PMP values for different durations {{using data from the}} Brazos River basin, Texas. There are, however, uncertainties associated with the PMP values estimated using the statistical method. It was found that significant uncertainty in the PMP estimates can occur from the use of <b>enveloping</b> <b>curve</b> of the frequency factor, and uncertainty in sample mean and sample standard deviation. Hershfield?s curve yielded higher PMP estimates, therefore, a basin specific-enveloping curve is suggested. The return period of a PMP value was obtained from frequency analysis. From 24 commonly used statistical distributions, 5 goodness of fit tests and the use of hazard rate, the Burr XII distribution was found to be the best frequency distribution. It was observed that the return period was not significantly higher than that obtained from the hydrometeorological reports (HMRs) of National Weather Service and other studies. For quantifying uncertainty, design risk estimates along with probability bounds on the PMP values were determined. The relative contribution of each random variable to the total uncertainty was also determined. Then, risk analysis of extreme precipitation was also done to assess the damage a PMP event can cause. The damage due to a single PMP event of 12 -hour duration can be as high as 2 billion U. S. dollars in Harris County, Texas...|$|E

We {{study the}} average {{entanglement}} entropy of blocks of contiguous spins in aperiodic XXZ chains which possess an aperiodic singlet phase {{at least in}} a certain limit of the coupling ratios. In this phase, where the ground state constructed by a real space renormalization group method, consists (asymptotically) of independent singlet pairs, the average entanglement entropy is found to be a piecewise linear function of the block size. The <b>enveloping</b> <b>curve</b> of this function is growing logarithmically with the block size, with an effective central charge in front of the logarithm which is characteristic for the underlying aperiodic sequence. The aperiodic sequence producing the largest effective central charge is identified, and the latter is found to exceed the central charge of the corresponding homogeneous model. For marginal aperiodic modulations, numerical investigations performed for the XX model show a logarithmic dependence, as well, with an effective central charge varying continuously with the coupling ratio...|$|E

In this work, the generalized Dahl model is applied to rubber mounts used to support automotive engine cooling module. The general idea is to define an analytical model for the rubber mount, and to implement it into a global finite element model of the engine cooling module. The work presented illustrates the method on a simplified system. The rubber mounts exhibit a non-linear behavior which depends on preload and frequency. Analytical restoring force models are well adapted to simulate their behavior. An experimental investigation was conducted {{in order to identify}} the model parameters. The model considers: two <b>envelop</b> <b>curves</b> (upper and lower) which can be modeled by polynomial functions, a parameter beta that governs the transition between the compression and extension phases of the rubber mount. Based on the load-deflection hysteretic loops measured, an automated procedure was realized to extract the polynomial coefficients of the <b>envelop</b> <b>curves</b> and beta. The calculated coefficients are function of the preload and the excitation frequency. Hence, the behavior of the rubber mounts can predicted versus time. In a second time, the model identified is implemented in a finite element model of a cantilever beam supported by a rubber mount at its free end. The dynamic transient response to a forced excitation is predicted and compared to experimental results...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in nuclear engineering to use concrete as shielding material for nuclear facilities, thanks to its versatility, cheapness but also its capacity to absorb radiation, due to its intrinsic water content, namely hydrogen. The presence of this light-atomic weight element in the mixture of concrete is responsible for slowing down the produced neutrons, which is the reason why, in the nuclear field, concrete {{is referred to as}} a “biological” barrier. For gamma-rays shielding purposes, heavy elements are conceived of having good shielding properties, instead; therefore ordinary concrete mixtures are often enriched with heavy aggregates to ensure a good absorption of secondary radiation. Hence, the knowledge of the moisture content evolution with the work history of a nuclear facility is fundamental to ensure the maintenance of its biological shielding, which justifies the suggested thermo-hygro-mechanical approach for the durability assessment of a concrete radiation shielding, through a FEM research code developed in agreement with the theory of porous media, already implemented in its fundamental lines and upgraded to account for radiation damage effects on exposed concrete. The required damage law has been defined based on the <b>enveloping</b> <b>curve</b> of several empirical data describing the behaviour of the Young modulus of exposed specimens, with respect to that proper of blank samples, in function of the neutron fluence. The damage parameter is supposed to follow the isotropic damage theory.

The combined use of the Monte Carlo technique and the FEM code, upgraded {{to take into account the}} radiation exposure effects on concrete, has allowed us to identify in the thermal aspect, i. e. the temperature rise in the shielding due to radiation energy deposition, the most severe factor for prescribing a work scenario, for the nuclear facility under study, consistent with concrete durability, when no other protective device is present, such as outer metallic liners working as coats for the biological shield or the presence of a cooling systems of the walls...|$|E

A total of eight reinforced concrete (RC) and concrete-filled FRP tube (CFFT) columns were constructed and tested until failure. All columns had 1900 -mm in height and 213 -mm in diameter. The test parameters were: (1) internal reinforcement type (steel, glass FRP (GFRP), or carbon FRP (CFRP) bars) and amount, (2) GFRP tube thicknesses, and (3) nature of axial loading type (i. e. monotonic and cyclic). The experimental results revealed that the CFFT columns reinforced with GFRP bars exhibited similar responses compared to their counterparts reinforced with steel bars with {{no significant difference in}} terms of ultimate axial strength and strain capacities. Providing the GFRP tubes of the CFFT columns significantly enhanced the strength and strain capacities and attributed to change the mode of failure from axially dominated material failure (for the control columns) to instability failure (for the CFFT columns). Furthermore, the <b>envelop</b> <b>curve</b> of the CFFT reinforced column tested under axial cyclic loading is almost identical to the axial stress-strain curve of the same specimen tested under axial monotonic loading. However, the ultimate axial and hoop rupture strain was slightly larger for the specimen subjected to axial cyclic loading.

The Central Geological Survey, Taiwan (CGST), has launched a series of investigation on characterizing the active faults on the island. The CGST revealed that there are 33 active faults and their fault parameters are suggested in the latest publication in 2010. However, the uncertainties of return period and earthquake magnitude are not provided. The main objective of the paper is to study the impact of "unspecified" parameter uncertainties on recurrence earthquake probabilities.

The Meishan fault in Central Taiwan with the best-estimate return period of 162. years and earthquake magnitude of 7. 1 was used as an example. The analyses verified the impact of parameter uncertainties on the exceedance probability in fault-induced earthquake recurrence. When uncertainty is high, the exceedance probability associated with large magnitudes is high.

Then the dissipated energy further promoted cracks source expansion and caused energy to dissipate considerably. In Fig.  7 b, the external work converted into elastic and plastic energy. Further, the dissipated energy caused gradual energy release before peak stress.

Static incremental non-linear analyses are performed with both models to derive a capacity <b>curve</b> <b>enveloping</b> the experimental results and to reproduce the damage pattern at the displacement level where failure is reached. The comparison between experimental and numerical results points out the strong and weak points of the different models inside the procedure adopted, and the utility of an integration of results from both approaches. This study confirms, even for the rather difficult case at study, the capability of the pushover in reproducing the non-linear dynamic response, both at a global and a local level, and opens the way to the use of the models within a displacement-based design and assessment procedure...|$|R
40|$|Random {{acceleration}} vibration {{specifications for}} subsystems, i. e. instruments, equipment, are most times based on measurement during acoustic noise tests on system level, i. e. a spacecraft and measured by accelerometers, {{placed in the}} neighborhood of the interface between spacecraft and subsystem. Tuned finite element models can be used to predict the random acceleration power spectral densities at other locations than available via the power spectral density measurements of the acceleration. The measured and predicted power spectral densities do represent the modal response characteristics of the system and show many peaks and valleys. The equivalent random acceleration vibration test specification is a smoothed, enveloped, peak-clipped version of the measured and predicted power spectral densities of the acceleration spectrum. The original acceleration vibration spectrum can be characterized by a different number response spectra: Shock Response Spectrum (SRS), Extreme Response Spectrum (ERS), Vibration Response Spectrum (VRS), and Fatigue Damage Spectrum (FDS). An additional method of non-stationary random vibrations is based on the Rayleigh distribution of peaks. The response spectra represent the responses of series of SDOF systems excited at the base by random acceleration, both in time and frequency domain. The synthesis of equivalent random acceleration vibration specifications can be done in a very structured manner and are more suitable than equivalent random acceleration vibration specifications obtained by simple enveloping. In the synthesis process Miles’ equation plays a dominant role to invert the response spectra into equivalent random acceleration vibration spectra. A procedure is proposed {{to reduce the number of}} data point in the response spectra curve by dividing the curve in a numbers of fields. The synthesis to an equivalent random acceleration spectrum is performed on a reduced selected set of data points. The recalculated response spectra <b>curve</b> <b>envelops</b> the original response spectra curves. A real life measured random acceleration spectrum (PSD) with quite a number of peaks and valleys is taken to generate, applying response spectra SRS, ERS, VRS, FDS and the Rayleigh distribution of peaks, equivalent random acceleration vibration specifications.

40|$|The only {{endogenous}} protein inhibitor {{known for}} metallocarboxypeptidases (MCPs) is latexin, a 25 -kDa protein {{discovered in the}} rat brain. Latexin, alias endogenous carboxypeptidase inhibitor, inhibits human CPA 4 (hCPA 4), whose expression is induced in prostate cancer cells after treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors. hCPA 4 {{is a member of}} the A/B subfamily of MCPs and displays the characteristic α/β-hydrolase fold. Human latexin consists of two topologically equivalent subdomains, reminiscent of cystatins, consisting of an α-helix <b>enveloped</b> by a <b>curved</b> β-sheet. These subdomains are packed against each other through the helices and linked by a connecting segment encompassing a third α-helix. The enzyme is bound at the interface of these subdomains. The complex occludes a large contact surface but makes rather few contacts, despite a nanomolar inhibition constant. This low specificity explains the flexibility of latexin in inhibiting all vertebrate A/B MCPs tested, even across species barriers. In contrast, modeling studies reveal why the N/E subfamily of MCPs and invertebrate A/B MCPs are not inhibited. Major differences in the loop segments shaping the border of the funnel-like access to the protease active site impede complex formation with latexin. Several sequences ascribable to diverse tissues and organs have been identified in vertebrate genomes as being highly similar to latexin. They are proposed to constitute the latexin family of potential inhibitors. Because they are ubiquitous, latexins could represent for vertebrate A/B MCPs the counterparts of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases for matrix metalloproteinases. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

H 577 P CEE 2015 Zhengxxiv, 324 pages :illustrationsAs one of {{the most}} {{damaging}} natural disasters, strong earthquakes often cause numerous structures to collapse and many people to die, which were reflected over again in recent Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008, Tohoku Earthquake in 2011, and Nepal Earthquake in 2015. To prevent buildings from collapse when they are subjected to strong earthquakes, the dynamic collapse of reinforced concrete (RC) building structures has been investigated actively and extensively, in which the finite element (FE) -method-based collapse analysis of RC building structures is an effective method. However, all the current FE-method-based seismic collapse analyses are based on the removal of entire element, but the actual seismic collapse of a structure often starts from the failure of an element at some degree-of-freedoms (DOFs). The removal of an element without the failure at all its DOFs may lead to false structural collapse. More importantly, the current FE-method-based collapse analysis methods contain many uncertainties. The time-dependent compressive strength of concrete, the confinement effect of core concrete due to the stirrup, the creeping and shrinking effects of concrete, the strength enhancement effect of the reinforcement embedding in the concrete, and the existing damage in concrete and reinforcement due to previous earthquakes, among others, cannot be fully or partially considered in the current collapse analyses, which again may produce false structural collapse. On the other hand, as a cutting-edge technology, structure health monitoring (SHM) systems have been installed in some important buildings and bridges to monitor their functionality, safety, and integrity with the ultimate goal of preventing the buildings and bridges from collapse. Nevertheless, there are seldom studies on how to utilize the information recorded by a SHM system to eliminate the uncertainties existing in the current collapse analysis method and provide an evolutionary and accurate collapse analysis method including collapse prognosis. In view of the problems outlined above, this thesis aims at developing a SHM-based seismic collapse analysis (prognosis) method for RC structures under earthquake excitation. In consideration that the existing studies on RC bridge structures are much less than RC building structures and the collapse mechanism of RC bridge structures may be very different from that of RC building structures, this thesis focuses on seismic collapse analysis of RC bridge structures. A refined collapse analysis method for RC structures considering the DOF release other than the element removal is first proposed in this thesis. By considering the DOF release, the catenary effect of RC beams and the effect of axial force on RC columns can be considered. Three numerical case studies were performed to examine the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed DOF release method. The numerical results of the collapse analysis of a two-span RC continuous beam with its two ends fixed under a concentrated static load was first compared with the experimental results. The result comparisons show that the refined method gives a better agreement with the experimental results compared with the traditional element removal method. The refined dynamic collapse analysis method was then applied to a two-story RC frame structure to demonstrate the entire progress of dynamic collapse. The numerical results demonstrate again that the refined method gives more reasonable collapse results by taking the catenary effect into account than the traditional element removal method. Finally, a two-span continuous RC bridge with a two-column pier at its middle was taken as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the refined method to RC bridge structures. The results show that the collapse of the RC columns does not occur immediately after the DOFs associated with bending moment and shear force of the two columns are released, and that the final collapse of the two columns is due to excessive axial loads. This failure mode could not be predicted by the traditional element removal method. Therefore, the refined method based on DOF release is preferable for the collapse analysis of RC structures including RC bridge structures. A 1 : 12 scaled RC cable-stayed bridge model was then elaborately designed and constructed to experimentally study the seismic collapse of the RC bridge that was not designed for the seismic resistance and to provide measurement data for implementing the proposed SHM-based collapse analysis method. A comprehensive measurement (SHM) system was designed and installed on the RC bridge to record both the global responses and local responses of the bridge. Before the shaking table tests, each cable force of the as-built RC bridge was measured by the frequency method to ensure that the bridge configuration meets the design requirement. The dynamic characteristic test was then conducted to gain an insight of the properties of the bridge. Finally, a series of earthquake tests, which include small earthquake, moderate earthquake, large earthquake and collapse earthquake in terms of their peak ground accelerations (PGA) and spectra, were conducted. It was observed from the four shake table tests that: (1) the RC bridge performed linearly and elastically under the small earthquake excitation and the RC bridge kept intact conditions after the small earthquake excitation; (2) the RC bridge performed slightly nonlinearly and plastically under the moderate earthquake excitation. The concrete in the failure-vulnerable components cracked slightly; (3) the RC bridge performed severely nonlinearly and plastically under the large earthquake excitation. The concrete in the failure-vulnerable components crushed severely and the reinforcement in the failure-vulnerable components yielded severely; and (4) the RC bridge partially collapsed under the collapse earthquake excitation. The concrete in the failure-vulnerable components crushed severely and the reinforcement in the failure-vulnerable components yielded severely. The measured data acquired from the SHM system together with the dynamic characteristics provide plentiful information for the subsequent linear model updating of the intact bridge, the nonlinear model updating of the damaged bridge, and collapse prognosis for the damaged bridge, respectively. A 3 -D FE model of the physical RC cable-stayed bridge subject to shake table tests is established for conducting seismic collapse analysis. To get an accurate FE model of the bridge for further collapse prognosis, a linear model updating strategy using two types of objective functions, the objective function based on natural frequencies and the objective function based on acceleration and strain responses, is proposed with the purpose of updating key parameters of the intact bridge so as to eliminate the uncertainties related to the linear RC bridge structure. A total of 12 key parameters are identified by virtue of sensitivity-based FE model analyses and updated using natural frequencies as the objective function. Three accelerometers and three strain gauges are selected as the key sensor locations and their responses are used for the further model updating in the time domain. Various seismic response time histories computed using the two different updating methods are compared with the measured responses. The comparison results indicate that the two objective functions both can improve the quality of the FE model. The second objective function not only can be used as an alternate of the first one for nonlinear model updating but also provides better updating results than the first objective function. A nonlinear model updating method by using the measured acceleration responses and reinforcement strains of the RC cable-stayed bridge in the time domain is proposed to update the <b>envelop</b> <b>curves</b> of the materials of the nonlinear bridge without knowing its previous loading history. In the nonlinear model updating, the degradations of both unloading stiffness and reloading stiffness are accomplished in addition to the strength degradation. A total of 58 key parameters divided into the five groups are introduced to be updated. The optimization objective function used in the time domain {{is the same as the}} one presented for the linear model updating. Three accelerometers and three strain gauges are selected as the key sensor locations and their responses are used for the nonlinear model updating. The updated 58 key parameters are used to configure the <b>envelop</b> <b>curves</b> of the materials of the bridge due to the previous earthquakes and these curves are then used to calculate the seismic responses of the bridge subject to current earthquake excitation. Various seismic response time histories computed using the nonlinear updated results are compared with the measured responses. The comparison results indicate that the updated results of the key parameters are correct and the nonlinear model updating method is feasible. To further verify the SHM-based seismic collapse prognosis method, it is applied to the RC bridge subject to the collapse test. Since the seismic collapse prognosis of a structure shall be carried out based on the current damage conditions of the structure, the SHM-based nonlinear model updating is necessary to find out the current damage conditions of the structure. In this regard, the 58 key parameters of the RC bridge were updated by considering the bridge subject to the latest earthquake ground motion and using the nonlinear model updating method proposed. The results show that the values of the most updated parameters of the bridge under the latest large earthquake excitation became much smaller compared with those identified for the bridge subject to a moderate earthquake excitation. The values/thresholds of the failure criteria of the four zero-length failure elements of the RC bridge were also determined based on the current damaged conditions and compared with those from the undamaged conditions. The comparative results show that the values/ thresholds of the failure criteria of the four zero-length failure elements of the RC bridge determined based on the current damaged conditions are very different from those based on the undamaged conditions. The collapse prognosis of the RC bridge subject to two future earthquake ground excitations were finally performed base on the updated FE model of the bridge to find out which earthquake will cause the true bridge collapse. The computed results showed that the RC bridge did not collapse when it was subjected to the first future earthquake excitation of relatively small intensity. The computed results showed that when the bridge was subjected to the second earthquake excitation of relatively large intensity, the RC southwest pier, as {{one of the}} failure-vulnerable component, triggered the flexure failure at 3. 133 second of the earthquake excitation and it was separated from the RC bridge structure. The other three failure-vulnerable components experienced severe damage but not failed. A series of computed seismic responses such as acceleration, strain and reaction force of the RC bridge subject to the second earthquake excitation were compared with the shake table test results recorded by the SHM system installed on the bridge. The comparison results showed that the computed results and collapse process are compatible with the test results recorded by the SHM system. The SHM-based collapse prognosis proposed in this chapter is feasible and effective. An ideal SHM system installed on a bridge is useful in monitoring the loading conditions, updating the FE model, assessing the linear and nonlinear performance, and making collapse prognosis of the bridge. Two sets of SHM systems for the prototype RC bridge are established using two different methods. These systems have demonstrated significantly different results in terms of sensor location and sensor number. The SHM system that uses the multi-sensor placement method includes 16 strain gauges and 12 accelerometers, whereas the proposed SHM system includes 24 strain gauges and 10 accelerometers. The sensors of the strain gauge in the proposed SHM system are all placed in the failure-vulnerable components, such as the tower legs beneath the girder and the two south piers, whereas only several strain gauges in the current SHM system are placed on the girder, transverse beam, and stay cable. These differences can be attributed to the fact that the current SHM system is utilized to assess the linear performance of the bridge under service loadings, whereas the proposed SHM system is used to make a collapse prognosis of the RC bridge under seismic loadings. To demonstrate the difference of the current collapse analysis method and the proposed SHM-based collapse analysis method, an SHM-based collapse prognosis of the earthquake-damaged bridge was conducted. In reality, the damage condition of the bridge can be determined using the nonlinear model updating technique in Chapter 6 and the information that is acquired from the proposed SHM system installed on the bridge. In this way, the uncertainties in the FE model of the bridge can be eliminated and provide a critical support for the collapse prognosis. In this study, the damaged state was specified by conducting a nonlinear seismic analysis for absence of SHM system. For comparison, a collapse analysis of the prototype RC bridge is also conducted using the current collapse analysis method. The entire collapse processes from the two collapse analysis/prognosis methods are significantly different: (1) the seismic intensity used for the current collapse analysis method is larger than that used for the proposed SHM-based collapse prognosis method; and (2) the proposed method has detected a partial collapse in the southwest pier, whereas the current collapse analysis method has detected a partial collapse in the southeast pier. Therefore, the proposed SHM-based collapse prognosis is a promising method to prognosticate the behavior of the existing RC bridges under future earthquakes, whereas the current collapse analysis can be only used for the bridge at design stage.
