To take advantage of this program, offenders have to plead guilty to the charge, agree to take part in treatment, regular drug screenings, and regular reporting to the drug court judge for a minimum of one year, as well as pay heavy fines and monthly drug court fees. Drug court systems in some areas utilize a color code system, whereas each offender is assigned a designated color, one of which is selected daily by the drug court for drug screening. Offenders must call the [...] "color code" [...] office each morning to see if their color has been selected for screening. Should the offender fail to comply with {{one or more of the}} requirements they may be removed from the drug court and incarcerated at the judge's discretion. If they complete the drug court program the charges brought against them are dropped or reduced.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drug</b> Treatment <b>Courts</b> and Their Progeny: Overcoming Their Winding Trajectory to Make the Concept {{work for}} the Long Term Author: Caroline S. Cooper Abstract The {{introduction}} of the <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> model in 1989 jumpstarted a revolution {{in terms of the}} criminal justice system’s approach for dealing with drug involved defendants. Many lessons have come out of this experience, including the recognition of the complexity of factors that often lead to drug use, the complexity of services needed to address it, both in the short and longer term, that therapeutic approaches and quality treatment services are far more effective in treating drug addiction than in incarceration and associated punitive mechanisms, and that to keep these programs effectively running, significant judicial oversight is needed to keep their many “moving parts” in sync. The author provides a summary overview of the evolution of the <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> model in the U. S. along with some of the challenges that have surfaced based on the technical assistance and training she provided to hundreds of <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> programs. Although more refined data is clearly needed, anecdotally it is reported that over 5, 000 judges have served as <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> judges, many of whom report the significant value and insights the <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> experience provided for their judicial perspectives and skills as they dealt with their general caseload, not simply the <b>drug</b> <b>court.</b> With over {{a quarter of a century}} of experience in implementing the <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> model, the time is ripe to reexamine in greater depth the <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> experience and current issues that have emerged, and to develop a more structured and systematic approach for sustaining the <b>drug</b> <b>court</b> model over the long term.

50|$|The first Drug {{court in}} the United States took shape in Miami-Dade County, Florida in 1989 as a {{response}} to the growing crack-cocaine problem plaguing the city. Chief Judge Gerald Wetherington, Judge Herbert Klein, then State Attorney Janet Reno and Public Defender Bennett Brummer designed the court for nonviolent offenders to receive treatment. This model of court system quickly became a popular method for dealing with an ever increasing number of drug offenders. Between 1984 and 1999, the number of defendants charged with a drug offense in the Federal courts increased 3% annually, from 11,854 to 29,306.
