5|$|The lower {{power house}} also {{underwent}} major rehabilitation measures. It {{was shut down}} in December 1974 due to the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> operation and maintenance. In 1984 a new power plant was built adjoining the old powerhouse, with installation of 6.7 MW capacity.|$|E
5|$|Hounds of Love was {{released}} in 1985. Because of the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace. Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{began the}} {{physical}} {{exploration of space}} during the 20th century {{with the advent of}} high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E

5|$|In late November 2009 Syracuse Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon began {{attempts}} {{to have an}} American Hockey League (AHL) outdoor game for his franchise. Cost estimates for hosting the game were close to $1 million. Unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic, the league did not run the event, meaning the Crunch had to finance the entire project. The <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> hosting was a reason for other franchises not pursuing outdoor games prior.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands {{in order to prevent}} further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> some Zinfandels.|$|E

5|$|The <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft, a lack {{of clear}} air-to-air {{missions}} due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on exports, {{and development of the}} more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production. A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009, and the last F-22 was delivered to the USAF in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply {{could be used for}} the electric fire engine system.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnant of}} the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would connect with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan's West Side.

40|$|Price indices for {{thirteen}} Canadian {{cities for}} 1900 to 1950 demonstrate large regional differences in <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living until 1914. After 1914 regional price levels converged. Before the war, western Canadian cities had the <b>highest</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living. After 1920 cities in Ontario had the <b>highest</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living. Accounting for these trends in regional <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> living reveals that regional real wage and real income structures {{have been present}} and stable since at least 1901. Thus, regional wage and income disparities are long-standing and persistent features of the Canadian economy. ...|$|R

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during {{the whole of the}} 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{publishers}} {{would no}} longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets. Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular and widely circulated among anti-interventionists. Two of them, The <b>High</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> Hate and America Has No Enemies In Asia, had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, There Is No Halfway Neutrality printed 30,000 copies.
