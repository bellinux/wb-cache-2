In that way, Serbia got unique Criminal Code which includes all provisions of material criminal law except provisions related to the criminal position of juveniles. System of criminal sanctions for juvenile off enders, procedure for their imposition and the way, procedure and terms for their execution are regulated by the provisions of the separate law - the Law on juvenile off enders and criminal protection of juveniles. Some of the most important novelties introduced by new juvenile criminal law are system of diversion, i. e. system of <b>diversion</b> <b>orders,</b> which aim at excluding the imposition of criminal sanctions in the cases when criminal sanction is not necessary from the perspective of crime suppression. Bearing that in mind, this paper is dedicated to forms of <b>diversion</b> <b>orders</b> as a form of measures that lead to more efficient system of restorative justice within our new juvenile criminal legislation. ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{selected}} for the Indigenous All Stars side to face the NRL All Stars in the inaugural All Stars match on 13 February, Inglis was ruled out due to a hip injury. Inglis recovered in time {{to play for the}} Storm in their victory over the Super League champions Leeds Rhinos in the 2010 World Club Challenge which the Storm won, 18-10. In Round 4 against the Penrith Panthers, Inglis played his 100th NRL match in the Storms' 16-10 win at Penrith Stadium. For the 2010 Anzac Test, Inglis was selected to play for Australia at centre in their 12-8 victory against New Zealand at AAMI Park. The assault allegation affair ended in April 2010 when Inglis avoided a conviction, accepting a <b>diversion</b> <b>order.</b> In April 2010, It was revealed that the Storm had been breaching the salary cap since 2005, and were subsequently stripped of their NRL Premiership victories in 2007 and 2009. They were also stripped of their 2006, 2007 and 2008 Minor Premiership trophies. Finally, they were stripped of their accumulated premiership points that season and were barred from obtaining any competition points from the 2010 NRL Season, meaning they would inevitably get the wooden spoon, the first in the club's history. Inglis was still allowed to continue to be recognised as the Clive Churchill Medallist from the 2007 grand final. In May 2010, Inglis was invited to trial with National Football League teams Buffalo and Denver.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} children committing {{crime and the}} realisation that the existing legislature dealing with offenders failed to cater for the rights and needs of child offenders {{gave rise to the}} introduction of the Child Justice Act 75 of 2008. This Act enables the South African criminal justice system to deal with children in a manner appropriate to their developmental stage. One of the initiatives introduced by the Act is termed ‘diversion’, where children are diverted from the criminal justice system into restorative developmental programmes, offered by organisations such as NICRO (National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders). Their parents or guardians are tasked with the responsibility of monitoring their compliance with the <b>diversion</b> <b>order</b> in terms of Section 24 (5) of the aforementioned Act. The monitoring responsibility assigned to the parents of diverted adolescents prompted the research question and aim of this study, namely to explore parents’ experiences in monitoring their adolescents’ compliance with diversion orders and to identify service needs in supporting parents in fulfilling their role as stipulated in the Act. This was a qualitative study that was exploratory-descriptive and contextual in nature. A non-probability purposive sampling technique was employed to identify the parents or guardians of adolescents aged 14 to 17 years that had been diverted to NICRO between June 2011 and June 2012. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with the selected parents, and the data collected was analysed using thematic data analysis. The trustworthiness of the research process and the findings was enhanced by employing a variety of data verification strategies. This research contributes to a greater understanding of parents’ monitoring experiences of their adolescents’ compliance with diversion orders. The study revealed that most parents experienced their role as an additional responsibility; they needed access to counseling and information on the child justice process...|$|E
