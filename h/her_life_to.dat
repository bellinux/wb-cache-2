To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan.

5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E

Doro attracted immediately {{the attention of}} fans and press, becoming the spokesperson and the main means of promotion for the band. The mix of traditional heavy metal and power ballads, together with her voice and stage presence led Warlock to success, an exception in the 80s' metal scene dominated by male-fronted metal bands. Warlock signed a new contract with the major label Phonogram and released the albums Hellbound in 1985 and True as Steel in 1986, sharing the stage of European rock festivals {{with some of the}} best hard rock and heavy metal bands of the period. On 16 August 1986, Doro was the first woman to front a metal band at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, the most important European rock meeting of the 80s. Warlock's long tours in Europe, supporting W.A.S.P. and Judas Priest, pushed Doro to give up her day job as a graphic designer to devote <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> music.

5|$|Aloy {{helps the}} Nora tribe {{fight off the}} Eclipse and then enters the door beneath the Nora mountain. She finds a {{recording}} left behind by GAIA, revealing that a signal of unknown origin caused HADES to activate and seize control of her functions. As a last resort, GAIA self-destructed {{in order to stop}} HADES. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the entire system began to break down. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Dr. Sobeck in the form of Aloy, in the hope that she would find GAIA's message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA's functions. Aloy learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> ensure the Faro robot swarm would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the System Override necessary to destroy HADES. Sylens admits that he was the original founder of the Eclipse, originally tempted by HADES' promises of knowledge. With Sylens's help, Aloy surmises that HADES wants to send a signal to reactivate the Faro robots so that they can once again extinguish all life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off waves of corrupted machines, before stabbing HADES with Sylens' lance, ending the war. Aloy then journeys to Dr. Sobeck's old home, where she finds her corpse, and has a moment of mourning for her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, HADES is shown to still be alive, but trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it in the first place.|$|E
5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E
