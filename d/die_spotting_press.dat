40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is a complex design of the <b>spotting</b> <b>press</b> with a nominal force of 500 kN, which is {{intended}} for mating of the both halves of pressing tool for the automotive industry. The press ram is fitted with a hydraulic mechanism which allows the upper clamping board to be tilted in range of 0 ° - 180 ° and removed from the working space of the press along a profile track. The lower clamping board {{is a part of}} moving bolster, which is equipped with a mechanism for lifting and centring. The concept of motion screws is used to drive the ram. Motion screws are mounted in a multiple-part frame and driven by servomotors. The thesis contains background research of the issue, solutions of the main design nodes of the press including calculations, detailed 3 D model of the device and partial drawing documentation...|$|R

50|$|Spotted tilapia feed {{mainly on}} plant matter and {{males and females}} never feed at the same time. Instead, one will feed while the other stays close by {{and then they will}} switch. There are a number of factors that {{contribute}} to the natural mortality of spotted tilapia. Their predators include the electric catfish Malapterurus electricus which preys on the eggs of spotted tilapia, and African pike and obscure snakehead which prey on the adults. Spotted tilapia are also prone to heavy intestinal infection caused by nematode parasites which causes death. Also, they sometimes get swept away from their streams by flooding caused by rain into small residual pools over the banks of the stream where they become stranded. Then, when the rain stops the pools dry out they <b>die.</b> <b>Spotted</b> tilapia are important ecologically as well as commercially and as a result are commonly exploited and cultured.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century resulted in the need for a larger factory, as the company located at the center of the historic city became too small. A spacious factory for constructing hydraulic fruit, wine and oil presses was built. After the Second World War the Dieffenbacher group specialized in heavy equipment construction and could gain ground in the timber industry in 1954. The first chipboard and inlay presses were built. Furthermore, plywood facilities and pattern facilities to refine chipboards were adopted in the product range. In the mid-60’s Dieffenbacher developed a <b>spotting</b> <b>press</b> with pivoting slide plates and extendable desk. This type of press is the precursor of today’s tryout press. From 1960’s onwards Dieffenbacher built presses for fiber-reinforced polyester plastic processing and became the market leader of this branch in the 1970s. With the entry of Wolf-Gerd Dieffenbacher as managing director in 1980 the development to a complete system manufacturer and the internationalization of the company with numerous start-ups, acquisitions and worldwide expansion of sales offices and service-centers. The Dieffenbacher group is represented in 22 locations worldwide today.|$|R
