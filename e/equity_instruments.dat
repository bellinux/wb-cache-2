2500|$|Sukuk were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many Muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in non-Sharia-compliant activities (gambling, alcohol, pork, etc.). [...] Sukuk securities are structured to comply with Sharia by paying profit, not interest—generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment. For example, Sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company (and held in a Special Purpose Vehicle), so that sukuk holders can collect the property's profit as rent, (which is allowed under Islamic law). Because they represent ownership of real assets and (at least in theory) do not guarantee repayment of initial investment, sukuk resemble <b>equity</b> <b>instruments,</b> but like a bond (and unlike equity) regular payments cease upon their expiration. However, most sukuk are [...] "asset-based" [...] rather than [...] "asset-backed"—their assets are not truly owned by their Special Purpose Vehicle, and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments.|$|E

The work itself is divided into five chapters. First chapter provides general description of the notion of the share in the limited liability company and defines its nature. Further, possible variations of issue of shares in the limited liability company such as issue of different classes of shares and the option of ownership of multiple shares in one company are examined. In the second chapter, the concept of the share as a thing in itself (personal property) and the selected implications of this concept are discussed.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{for companies to}} repurchase and hold own shares has been forbidden in Sweden {{for more than a}} century. On March 10 th, 2000, the Swedish government abolished this prohibition and companies now have the possibility of using the <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> of own shares. This demanded for a revision of the 7 th Chapter of the Companies Act and, to some extent, also the Annual Accounts Act, which we have explored. We have also been studying international accounting methods for own shares. Furthermore,, international norms and recommendations that have impacted the design of the Swedish regulation on how to account for own shares have also been explored. In the empirical part, we discovered how this new <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> influences companies. Advantages and disadvantages have been discussed, as well as if own shares is profitable for all parties. Standard setters and auditors have also been interviewed about this issue. Through an analysis of the theoretical and empirical findings we presented how own shares shall be accounted for in Sweden. We further discovered that the Swedish regulation is somewhat too detailed within certain areas, which makes transactions with own shares somewhat more complicated than necessary. Even though the legislator did not consider protection for the minority, we have found a connection between own shares and this protection. We have analysed the cost-, par value- and EC-method and studied positive and negative features compared to the Swedish regulation of accounting. Our contribution with this thesis is an improved method of how the accounting for own shares could be conducted in Sweden...|$|R

30|$|The key {{characteristic}} of the LCA is the possibility, but not the requirement, of investor ownership (Dean and Geu 2008). Investors may obtain ownership by purchasing common stock, preferred stock, or some other <b>equity</b> <b>instrument.</b> By comparison, patron ownership is manifested by the right and obligation to supply or deliver a given commodity such as corn or chicken. Similar to NGCs, member patrons may face substantial supply and non-redeemable equity requirements to facilitate scale economies in processing. As two distinct types of owners, member patrons and member investors receive a return on patronage and investment, respectively. However, the ULCAA contains an allocation constraint, which states member patrons must be allocated at least 50 % of the profits and losses to preserve the cooperative nature of the entity. Thus, the ULCAA departs from other cooperative state law innovations in Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa, and Tennessee, where the percentage of profits and losses allocated to member patrons may decrease to 15 %, as well as Wisconsin, which set the floor at 30 % (Geu and Dean 2009 b).|$|R
40|$|Accounting for {{financial}} instruments {{has been the most}} controversial area {{in the development of the}} IASB’s standards. The FASB and the IASB are currently working together towards a comprehensive standard of accounting {{for financial}} instruments with characteristics of equity, liability, or both. The main problem is how to distinguish liabilities from equity. According to the FASB, a new standard is necessary because current accounting literature addressing this issue is inconsistent, subject to structuring and difficult to understand and apply. This paper examines the current situation in classifying preferred stocks. A detailed comparison of common and preferred stocks, and debt securities and preferred stocks is then presented. Three theories of equity (proprietary theory, entity theory and residual equity theory) are described and compared, and the legal and economics approach to determining the difference between liabilities and equity are discussed. Finally, the IASB rules set up in IAS 32 and the Estonian rules set up in Commercial Code and accounting guideline RTJ 3 are discussed.

40|$|Almost {{everyone}} agrees that equity-based incentive compensation {{can play an important}} role in increasing shareholder value, but there is considerable disagreement as to what that role should be and how equity pay should be packaged. What's more, there has been a backlash against equity pay that has compensation committees, investors, and corporate watchdogs on full alert. The authors of this article provide some basic guidelines for equity pay that could help to restore confidence in this useful element of compensation-guidelines that encompass the type of <b>equity</b> <b>instrument,</b> the level of equity-based pay, the extent to which equity pay is performance based, and the structure of the equity package in terms of vesting, exercise, and expiry. They start by acknowledging that the role of equity pay is limited by the extent to which shareholder value can be affected by the manager in question. They recommend building steadily to a constant level of stock price exposure and then gradually reducing this level after retirement. For most companies, equity-based pay should be significant only for a handful of employees; performance based cash bonuses provide better "line-of-sight," especially for operating managers who are somewhat removed from corporate-wide decisions. And disclosure-both internal and external-is perhaps the most important aspect of equity-based pay plans. 2004 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R

5000|$|The International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 help to give further {{direction}} for the proper accounting of derivative financial instruments. IAS 32 defines a “financial instrument” as “any contract that {{gives rise to a}} financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or <b>equity</b> <b>instrument</b> of another entity”. Therefore, a forward contract or option would create a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability for another. The entity required to pay the contract holds a liability, while the entity receiving the contract payment holds an asset. These would be recorded under the appropriate headings on the balance sheet of the respective companies. IAS 39 gives further instruction, stating that the financial derivatives be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.IAS 39 defines two major types of hedges. The first is a cash flow hedge, defined as: “a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and (ii) could affect profit or loss”. In other words, a cash flow hedge is designed to eliminate the risk associated with cash transactions that can affect the amounts recorded in net income.|$|R

Results from the CFA and reliability analysis indicated that all the items representing the four components were valid and can be used to measure the brand equity of organizations that are practicing CSR. The study tried to set an empirical basis for brand equity and CSR related research which could be used by future researchers in different industries and geographical locations. The study also implies the need for organizations to assess the success of their CSR efforts through the use of the proposed instrument in order to gauge whether all their CSR efforts translate to improved brand equity...|$|R
