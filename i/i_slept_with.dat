500|$|The group {{finale of}} [...] "Don't Stop" [...] {{received}} good grades—"A" [...] from Gonzales and [...] "B+" [...] from Benigno, {{and four of}} five stars from Berk. Kubicek found a bright spot in that Sam got to sing a solo. The performance received encomiums such as [...] "pretty great" [...] from Semigran and [...] "inspired" [...] from Futterman. The portion of an original song for the April Rhodes musical sung by April and Will, [...] "Nice to Meet You, Have <b>I</b> <b>Slept</b> <b>with</b> You?", received little commentary, though Flandez made specific mention of [...] "her operatic range, and their charismatic stage presence".|$|E

50|$|Emin's work Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-1995 (1995) {{was first}} {{exhibited}} in the show, and Childish's name was displayed prominently in it.|$|R
500|$|All six {{songs from}} Rumours {{covered in the}} episode were {{released}} as singles, available for digital download. Chenoweth and Morrison were featured on [...] "Dreams", McHale sang [...] "Never Going Back Again", Rivera covered [...] "Songbird", Monteith and Agron duetted on [...] "I Don't Want to Know", Michele sang [...] "Go Your Own Way", and the glee club combined on [...] "Don't Stop".

[...] "The Chain", also from Rumours, was used as backing music in the second motel stakeout scene.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, {{and for a long time}} <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> a loaded gun beside my bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry." [...] Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing.|$|E
60|$|All night {{a strong}} wind blew up the valley, and the acorns fell pattering over me from the oak. Yet on this first night of October, the air was as mild as May, and <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> the fur thrown back.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 May 2004, {{a fire in}} {{a storage}} {{warehouse}} destroyed some works from the Saatchi collection, including the Chapman Brothers' Hell and Tracey Emin's [...] "tent", Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-1995.|$|R
60|$|At last I {{rose with}} a sigh to seek help, and as I rose I {{felt that there was}} {{something}} set about my neck. It was the collar of great emeralds which Guatemoc had given to me, and that I had given to Otomie. She had set it there while <b>I</b> <b>slept,</b> and <b>with</b> it a lock of her long hair. Both shall be buried with me.|$|R
5000|$|... 2004 - A {{fire in the}} Momart storage {{warehouse}} destroyed many {{works from}} the collection, including the major Tracey Emin work Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-95 ("the tent"), and Jake and Dinos Chapman's tableau Hell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{comprehend}} nothing, Pierre; {{there is}} nothing these eyes have ever looked upon, Pierre, that this soul comprehended. Ever, as now, do I go all a-grope amid the wide mysteriousness of things. Yes, she shall come; it is only one mystery the more. Doth she talk in her sleep, Pierre? Would it be well, if <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> her, my brother?" ...|$|E
60|$|And so it {{was that}} Lop-Ear became a {{bachelor}} once more. That night <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> him in the old cave, and our old life of chumming began again. The loss of his mate seemed to cause him no grief. At least he showed no signs of it, nor of need for her. It was the wound in his leg that seemed to bother him, and it was all of a week before he got back again to his old spryness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Long, low, and narrow, bearing one mast {{with a red}} sail, and rowed by fifteen oars a-side,' {{the knight}} answered. 'At her bows was a deck under which men might lie, and at her stern another shut off by a painted door from the rowers' benches. Here Hugh and <b>I</b> <b>slept,</b> <b>with</b> Witta and the Yellow Man, upon {{tapestries}} as soft as wool. I remember'--he laughed to himself--'when first we entered there a loud voice cried, [...] "Out swords! Out swords! Kill, kill!" [...] Seeing us start Witta laughed, and showed us it was but a great-beaked grey bird with a red tail. He sat her on his shoulder, and she called for bread and wine hoarsely, and prayed him to kiss her. Yet she {{was no more than}} a silly bird. But--ye knew this?' He looked at their smiling faces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ghosts be blowed!" [...] said Higgs vulgarly, [...] "if {{there were}} such things <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> too many mummies {{not to see}} them. That confounded Joshua is the wizard who raises your ghosts. Look here, old boy," [...] he added, [...] "let me camp with you to-night, since Quick {{must be in the}} tunnel, and Adams has to sleep outside in case he is wanted on the army business." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} {{we came to the}} cairn I was dog-tired. Throwing myself upon the sand <b>I</b> soon <b>slept,</b> and <b>with</b> Raja {{stretched}} out beside me I felt a far greater security than I had enjoyed for a long time.|$|R
5000|$|Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-1995 was a tent appliquéd with 102 {{names of}} the people she had <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> up {{to the time of}} its {{creation}} in 1995. The title is often misinterpreted as a euphemism indicating sexual partners and the work termed [...] "a list of all the people that Emin has ever had sex with", but is in fact intended more inclusively: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lieutenant Butzow is {{partially}} correct--he honestly {{believes that he}} is entirely so," [...] replied the American. [...] "He did ride with me from Lustadt to Blentz to save the man who lies dead here at your feet. The lieutenant {{thought that he was}} riding with his king, just as your highness thought that he was riding with his king during the battle of Lustadt. You were both wrong--you were riding with Mr. Bernard Custer, of Beatrice. I am he. I have no apologies to make. What I did I would do again. I did it for Lutha and for the woman I love. She knows and the king knew that I intended restoring his identity to him with no one the wiser for the interchange that had taken place. The king upset my plans by stealing back his identity while <b>I</b> <b>slept,</b> <b>with</b> the result that you see before you upon the floor. He has died as he had lived--futilely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Different {{people have}} {{different}} ways of telling a story," [...] he said. [...] "Mine is the methodical way--I begin at the beginning. We will start, if you please, in the railway--we will proceed in a one-horse chaise--and we will stop at a village, situated in a hole. It was the nearest place to Sir Jervis's house, and it was therefore my destination. I picked out {{the biggest of the}} cottages--I mean the huts--and asked the woman at the door if she had a bed to let. She evidently thought me either mad or drunk. I wasted no time in persuasion; the right person to plead my cause was asleep in her arms. I began by admiring the baby; and I ended by taking the baby's portrait. From that moment I {{became a member of the}} family--the member who had his own way. Besides the room occupied by the husband and wife, there was a sort of kennel in which the husband's brother slept. He was dismissed (with five shillings of mine to comfort him) to find shelter somewhere else; and I was promoted to the vacant place. It is my misfortune to be tall. When I went to bed, <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> my head on the pillow, and my feet out of the window. Very cool and pleasant in summer weather. The next morning, I set my trap for Sir Jervis." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{first began}} my visits, {{he had lived}} in the town itself, and close to a disreputable {{neighbourhood}} called the Burrough, till one evening, while he sat over his dinner, he heard a man and woman quarrelling under his window. [...] "I mind the time," [...] shouted the man, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> you and your daughter in the one bed." [...] My uncle was horrified, and moved to a little house {{about a quarter of a}} mile into the country, where he lived with an old second-sighted servant, and a man-servant to look after the racehorse that was browsing in the neighbouring field, with a donkey to keep it company. His furniture had not been changed since he set up house for himself as a very young man, and in a room opposite his dining-room were the saddles of his youth, and though he would soon give up riding, they would be oiled and the stirrups kept clean and bright till the day of his death. Some love-affair had gone wrong when he was a very young man; he had now no interest in women; certainly never sought favour of a woman, and yet he took great care of his appearance. He did not let his beard grow, though he had, or believed that he had, for he was hypochondriacal, a sensitiveness of the skin that forced him to spend an hour in shaving, and he would take to club and dumb-bell if his waist thickened by a hair's breadth, and twenty years after, when a very old man, he had the erect shapely figure of his youth. I often wondered why he went through so much labour, for it was not pride, which had seemed histrionic in his eyes--and certainly he had no vanity; and now, looking back, I am convinced that it was from habit, mere habit, a habit formed when he was a young man, and the best rider of his district.|$|E
5000|$|Tracey Emin calls Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-1995 [...] "my tent" [...] or [...] "the tent" [...] and {{considers}} {{it to be}} one of the two [...] "seminal pieces" [...] she has created (the other being My Bed); she has described both pieces as [...] "seminal, fantastic and amazing work".|$|R
2500|$|The {{result was}} her [...] "tent" [...] Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963–1995, which was first {{exhibited}} in the show. It was a blue tent, appliquéd {{with the names of}} everyone she has <b>slept</b> <b>with.</b> These included sexual partners, plus relatives she <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> as a child, her twin brother, and her two aborted children. Although considered by some a shameless exhibition of her sexual conquests, others considered it a piece about intimacy in a more general sense.|$|R
5000|$|Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-1995 (1995), {{also known}} as [...] "The Tent", was an artwork created by Tracey Emin. The work was a tent with the appliquéd names of, literally, {{everyone}} she had ever <b>slept</b> <b>with,</b> but not necessarily in the sexual sense. It achieved iconic status, was owned by Charles Saatchi, and was destroyed in the 2004 Momart London warehouse fire. She has refused to re-create it.|$|R

5000|$|She {{and another}} woman {{claimed that they}} had sex with Robbie Williams, which she later has {{admitted}} was a lie. In 2005 Williams said about the two women [...] "You two are big liars. You are fine, and <b>I</b> would have <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> you. Dere to er store løgnere. Dere er flotte, og jeg ville ha ligget med dere".|$|R
5000|$|... "Fucked My Way Up To the Top" [...] {{was written}} about an {{undisclosed}} female singer who, at first, mocked {{her for her}} supposedly unauthentic style, but then [...] "stole and copied it" [...] and became successful with it. Asked {{about the meaning of}} the song, Del Rey said [...] "It's commentary, like, [...] "I know what you think of me", and I'm alluding to that. You know, <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> <b>with</b> a lot of guys in the industry, but none of them helped me get my record deals. Which is annoying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the placing of the bride's cake {{beneath the}} pillow {{in order that}} the sleeper may have {{pleasant}} dreams. That {{is one of several}} instances which you will find set forth in a small brochure which I am myself writing upon the subject. But {{to come back to the}} point, <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> one night <b>with</b> this funnel beside me, and I had a dream which certainly throws a curious light upon its use and origin." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, {{her work}} Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963–1995, a tent appliquéd {{with the names}} of {{everyone}} the artist had ever shared a bed with was shown at Charles Saatchi's Sensation exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London.

5000|$|On 24 May 2004, {{a fire in}} the Momart storage {{warehouse}} destroyed many {{works from}} the collection, including the Tracey Emin work Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-95 ("the tent"), and Jake and Dinos Chapman's tableau Hell. A gallery spokesman said that Saatchi was distraught at the loss: [...] "It is terrible. A significant part of the work in his collection has been affected." [...] One art insurance specialist valued the lost work at £50m.|$|R
5000|$|Semple was {{commissioned}} {{to create a}} memorial with debris collected from the 2004 Momart warehouse fire. [...] Semple packaged them in 8 plastic boxes under the title Burn Baby Burn. The boxes were then painted over and had slogans in pink lettering, including [...] "RIP YBA", which referred to the Young British Artists, by whom much of the destroyed work had been created. Semple stated that amongst the debris collected there were fragments of Tracey Emin's artwork, Everyone <b>I</b> Have Ever <b>Slept</b> <b>With</b> 1963-1995 ("the tent").|$|R
