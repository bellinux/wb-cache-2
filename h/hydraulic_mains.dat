This regulated the hydraulic pressure of the extensive network of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mains</b> around the basin supplying the coal-handling machinery. The associated steam raising plant and hydraulic pumps have been removed. The building was converted by Dransfield Owens de Silva for the London Docklands Development Corporation to function as a viewing platform. It (and the basin itself) is now owned by the British Waterways Board; and is a Grade II listed building, and is open every year during Open House Weekend, usually the third weekend in September.|$|E

50|$|However, {{after the}} early years of gas, {{research}} proved that a very deep, excessive seal on the hydraulic main threw a backpressure upon all the retorts as the coal within was gasifying, and this had deleterious consequences; carbon would likely deposit onto the insides of retorts and ascension pipes; and the bottom layer of tar with which the gas would have to travel through in a deeply sealed main robbed the gas of some of its illuminating value. As such, after the 1860s, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mains</b> were run at around 1 inch of seal, and no more.|$|E
2500|$|After its closure, {{the tunnel}} gained a new purpose as a route for <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>mains</b> {{operated}} by the LHPC and for water mains. It was damaged during the Second World War when a German bomb fell in the river near Tower Pier in December 1940, and exploded on the river bed {{very close to the}} tunnel's roof. The shock of the blast compressed the tunnel radially, reducing its diameter to [...] at the point of impact, but the tunnel's lining was not penetrated. During the course of repair work, it was found that– apart from the bomb damage– the tunnel had survived seventy years of use in excellent condition.|$|R
50|$|Many dockyards used small {{portable}} jiggers {{mounted on}} wheeled carriages. These could be {{moved around the}} quays as needed, and plumbed into outlets in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mains</b> with screwed pipe unions. They were used as portable winches for all manner of tasks. A typical task would be winching bales out of the hold of a ship, up a sloping gangway. Bales of bulk products such as jute or cotton were made too large and heavy for dockers to lift by hand, and the jigger appeared {{at a time when}} cranes were still only in limited numbers.|$|E

5000|$|From the retort, the gas {{would first}} {{pass through a}} tar/water [...] "trap" [...] (similar to a trap in plumbing) called a {{hydraulic}} main, where a considerable fraction of coal tar was given up and the gas was significantly cooled. Then, it would pass through the main out of the retort house into an atmospheric or water-cooled condenser, {{where it would be}} cooled to the temperature of the atmosphere or the water used. At this point, it enters the exhauster house and passes through an [...] "exhauster", an air pump which maintains the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mains</b> and, consequently, the retorts at a negative pressure (with a zero pressure being atmospheric). It would then be washed in a [...] "washer" [...] by bubbling it through water, to extract any remaining tars. After this, it would enter a purifier. The gas would then be ready for distribution, and pass into a gasholder for storage.|$|E
50|$|Guncotton was {{not made}} again in Faversham until 1873, when the Cotton Powder Company, {{independent}} of the gunpowder factories, opened a new plant on a remote site near Uplees, about four km northwest of the town centre. It was still within the parish, but alongside the River Swale, the deep-water channel that divides mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. Deliveries of raw materials — cotton waste and sulphuric and nitric acids — could readily be made, and the product was easily dispatched by water.With a buoyant market, the factory rapidly expanded, producing each new high explosive as it was formulated. Adjoining it to the west in 1913 an associate venture, the Explosives Loading Company, built a plant to fill bombs and shells. Both plants were high-tech state-of-the-art, with a power station, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mains</b> and an internal telephone and tramway systems. Together they occupied an area of 500 acres (two km²) — almost as large {{as that of the}} City of London.|$|E
