40|$|Persons {{living with}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) are living longer and therefore {{are more likely to}} suffer significant morbidity due to potentially treatable liver diseases. Liver diseases alone have been shown to have a significant negative effect on one's health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Clinical evidence suggests that persons living with <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> disease, a growing number of individuals, may have a poorer HRQOL than persons living with HIV who do not have liver disease. Thus, this study examined the multiple components of HRQOL by testing Wilson and Cleary's model in persons with HIV and in persons living with <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> disease using structural equation modeling. This secondary analysis used de-identified baseline and medical record review data from a parent study testing interventions to improve medication adherence in persons living with HIV (R 01 NR 04749). The Wilson and Cleary model components include: biological/physiological factors (HIV viral load, CD 4 counts), symptom status (Beck Depression Inventory II, Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey [MOS-HIV] mental function), functional status (missed appointments, MOS-HIV physical function), general health perceptions (Perceived burden visual analogue scale, MOS-HIV health transition), and overall QOL (Satisfaction with Life Scale, MOS-HIV overall QOL). Characteristics of the individual and environment were also explored. The Wilson and Cleary (1995) model was found to be useful in linking clinical indicators to patient-related outcomes. The findings provide the foundation for development and future testing of a targeted bio-behavioral nursing intervention to improve HRQOL in persons living with <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} reported that persons co-infected with <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> hepatitis C virus (HCV) had liver disease stages similar to HIV-uninfected {{individuals who were}} approximately 10 years older. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) levels have long been known to decline with advancing age in humans and non-humans alike. We examined whether HIV infection affects the expected decline in IGF- 1 in persons with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and if that alteration in IGF- 1 decline contributes to the link between <b>HIV,</b> aging, <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> disease progression. Methods: A total of 553 individuals with HCV infection were studied from the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort for whom more than 10 years of follow-up was available. Serum IGF- 1 levels were determined by ELISA and evaluated according to baseline characteristics and over time by <b>HIV</b> status <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> disease progression. Linear regression with generalized estimating equations {{was used to determine}} whether IGF- 1 decline over time was independently associated with liver disease progression. Results: Baseline IGF- 1 levels were strongly associated with age (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) but not with gender or HIV infection. Levels of IGF- 1 declined at a rate of - 1. 75 ng/mL each year in HCV mono-infected individuals and at a rate of - 1. 23 ng/mL each year in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). In a multivariable linear regression model, progression of liver fibrosis was associated with <b>HIV</b> infection <b>and</b> age, as well as with a slower rate of IGF- 1 decline (P[*]=[*] 0. 001); however, the rate of IGF- 1 decline did not alter the strength of the associations between <b>HIV,</b> <b>liver</b> disease, <b>and</b> age. Conclusions: The normal decline in IGF- 1 levels with age was attenuated in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals compared to those with HCV mono-infection, and slower IGF- 1 decline was independently associated with liver disease progression.

40|$|Accelerated {{fibrosis}} {{in patients}} co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) {{has been a major}} cause of mortality in the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) era. However, the role of co-infection in accelerating the progression of liver fibrosis, particularly with regard to the effects of co-infection on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), remains unclear. We hypothesized that <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> HCV induce <b>liver</b> fibrosis synergistically by altering the regulation of epimorphin production, and thereby indirectly alter HSC function. Here, we examined the effects of epimorphin on HSC proliferation and invasion, and the changes in fibrogenesis-related gene activity in HSCs (LX 2) in the presence of inactivated CXCR 4 -tropic <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> HCV (JFH 1). The combination of <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> HCV significantly increased epimorphin expression, which increased the proliferation and invasion capabilities of HSCs. Epimorphin also induced the expression of profibrogenic tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP 1) in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) -dependent manner. These data indicated that the effects of HIV/HCV co-infection on hepatic fibrosis might be mediated in part by EPM. Strategies to limit the expression of EPM might represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the progression of hepatic fibrosis during HIV/HCV co-infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{cornerstone}} of tuberculosis management is a 6 -month course of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Compliance {{is crucial for}} curing tuberculosis. Adverse effects often negatively affect the compliance, because they frequently require a change of treatment, which may have negative consequences for treatment outcome. In this paper we review the incidence, pathology and clinical features of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity, discuss the metabolism and mechanisms of toxicity of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, and describe risk factors and management of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The reported incidence of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity, the most serious and potentially fatal adverse reaction, varies between 2 % and 28 %. Risk factors are advanced age, female sex, slow acetylator status, malnutrition, <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> pre-existent <b>liver</b> disease.

Our objective was to estimate the association between <b>HIV</b> infection <b>and</b> selected types of cancers among patients hospitalized for diagnosis or treatment of cancer in West Africa. A case-referent study was conducted in referral hospitals in Côte d'Ivoire and Benin. Each participating clinical ward enrolled all adult patients seeking care for a confirmed diagnosis of cancer and clinicians systematically proposed an HIV test. HIV prevalence was compared between AIDS-defining cancers and a subset of selected non-AIDS defining cancers to a referent group of non-AIDS defining cancers not reported in the literature to be positively or inversely associated with HIV. An unconditional logistic model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of the risk of being HIV-infected for selected cancers sites compared to a referent group of other cancers. The HIV overall prevalence was 12. 3 % (CI 10. 3 - 14. 4) among the 1, 017 cancer cases included. A total of 442 patients constituted the referent group with an HIV prevalence of 4. 7 % (CI 2. 8 - 6. 7). In multivariate analysis, Kaposi sarcoma (OR 62. 2 [CI 22. 1 - 175. 5]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4. 0 [CI 2. 0 - 8. 0]), cervical cancer (OR 7. 9 [CI 3. 8 - 16. 7]), anogenital cancer (OR 11. 6 [CI 2. 9 - 46. 3]) <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> cancer (OR 2. 7 [CI 1. 1 - 7. 7]) were all associated with HIV infection.

In vitro studies suggest that HIV-envelope proteins can modulate the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and fibrogenesis. We investigated the influence of HIV tropism on <b>liver</b> fibrosis <b>and</b> the concentration of HCV RNA in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. METHODS: We used a phenotypic assay to assess HIV tropism in 172 HCV-HIV co-infected patients: one group (75 patients) had mild fibrosis (score ≤F 2) and the other (97 patients) had severe fibrosis (score >F 2). We also assessed the relationship between <b>HIV</b> tropism <b>and</b> HCV RNA concentration in all these patients. We also followed 34 of these patients for 3 years to determine the evolution of <b>HIV</b> tropism <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> fibrosis, estimated by liver stiffness. RESULTS: Initially, most patients (91. 8 %) received a potent antiretroviral therapy. CXCR 4 -using viruses were found in 29 % of patients. The only factor associated with a CXCR 4 -using virus infection in multivariate analysis was the nadir of CD 4 cells: < 200 /mm(3) (OR: 3. 94, 95 %CI: 1. 39 - 11. 14). The median HCV RNA concentrations in patients infected with R 5 viruses, those with dual-mixed viruses and those with X 4 viruses, were all similar. The prevalence of CXCR 4 -using viruses in patients with mild fibrosis (≤F 2) (31 %) and those with severe fibrosis (F 3 -F 4) (28 %, p =  0. 6) was similar.

At a mechanistic level using gene-expression arrays, we found that ATIII treatment down-regulated multiple host cell signal transduction factors involved in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, including Jun, Myc and BMP 2. Using a protein interactive network analysis we found that changes in gene-expression caused by ATIII were dependent on three nodes previously implicated in HCV disease progression or HCV replication: NFκB, P 38 MAPK, and ERK 1 / 2.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between the South African Grade 11 Life Sciences curriculum documents, <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge and behavioural preferences of students was investigated. The Life Sciences curriculum and textbooks used in Grade 11 Life Sciences were analysed to determine the curriculum ideology of the subject and concepts related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS that are prescribed for teaching with the aim of educating students about <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS and promoting safe behaviour. Life Sciences and non-Life Sciences students were compared to determine whether academic <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge taught in Life Sciences was related to functional <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge and behavioural preferences. Findings indicate that Life Sciences does not promote safe behaviour related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS. Furthermore Life Sciences is knowledge-oriented <b>and</b> integrates <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge as extra content. In addition Life Sciences does not have a clear curriculum ideology for <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS education even though it has characteristics of various curriculum ideologies with greater emphasis on the scholar academic ideology. The Life Sciences curriculum makes provisions for the construction <b>and</b> application of <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge, but it does not provide guidance with regards to application of knowledge. Moreover textbooks are not consistent with regard to presentation of content and do not present sufficient content for meaningful application in everyday life. Results also showed that academic <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge improves some students’ knowledge of functional <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge. It was also found that <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS knowledge does not significantly correlate with some students’ behaviour presumably because students have difficulty in relating Life Sciences knowledge to real life. Consequently some students do not fully know some <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS concepts, and they rely on alternative means to respond to questions for which {{they do not have the}} necessary content knowledge. It was also found that some students do not take ownership of social problems related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS. The researcher believes that there is a need to review <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS education in Life Sciences by basing it on a precise curriculum ideology that will ensure that suitable scientific content, which may lead to behaviour transformation, is integrated.

40|$|Relatively high {{prevalence}} of <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS and food insecurity in Rufiji District whilst {{the linkage between}} the two problems was not known was {{the basis of this}} study. Data were collected amongst 225 households between November 2005 and October 2006 through participatory rural appraisal (PRA), household income and expenditure survey (HIES) and structured interviews. Binary logistic regression was used for analysis in which case the dependent variable was food security in terms of food insecure (0) and food secure (1) based on kilocalories consumed per adult equivalent per day. The independent variables included having been affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS in terms of not affected (0) and affected (1). The results reveal that the odds for households affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS to be food secure were 0. 705 times as high as the odds for households not affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS to be food secure. This means that households affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS {{were less likely to be}} food secure as opposed to those not affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS. The B statistic for having been affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS was negative (B = - 0. 350) meaning that being affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS had negative impact on food security. However, the Wald statistic which shows the magnitude of impact was small (0. 251) and not significant (p = 0. 617). This shows that <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS had little impact on food security. Based on these findings, it is concluded that although being affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS has negative impact on food security, it does not automatically make households food insecure, especially in a short run, and that some non-HIV and AIDS factors like high dependency ratio and low ability to buy food have bigger negative impact than that of <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS on food security. On the basis of the conclusion, it is recommended that efforts to improve food security amongst households affected by <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS should consider both <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS and non-HIV and AIDS factors...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{introduction}} of active HIV antiretroviral treatment, AIDS-related morbidity and mortality have markedly decreased <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> diseases are now a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Chronic liver injury encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases due to HCV and HBV coinfection, drug-related toxicity, and NASH. HIV-infected patients who are receiving treatment present with a high prevalence of metabolic complications and lipodystrophy. Those patients are at high risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the liver feature of the metabolic syndrome. This review will focus on (1) the liver injuries in HIV-infected patients; (2) both the current experimental and human data regarding PPAR <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> diseases; (3) the interactions between <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> PPAR; (4) the potential use of PPAR agonists for the management of HIV-related liver diseases.

40|$|Background. Liver {{fibrosis}} is accelerated in <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> hepatitis C coinfection, {{mediated by}} profibrotic effects of angiotensin. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine if angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) attenuate liver fibrosis in coinfection. Methods. A retrospective review of 156 coinfected subjects was conducted to analyze the association between exposure to ACE-Is <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> fibrosis. Noninvasive indices of liver fibrosis (APRI, FIB- 4, Forns indices) were compared between subjects who had taken ACE-Is and controls who had not taken them. Linear regression was used to evaluate ACE-I use as an independent predictor of fibrosis. Results. Subjects taking ACE-Is for three years were no different than controls on the APRI and the FIB- 4 but had significantly higher scores than controls on the Forns index, indicating more advanced fibrosis. The use of ACE-Is for three years remained independently associated with an elevated Forns score when adjusted for age, race, <b>and</b> <b>HIV</b> viral load (P< 0. 001). There were significant associations between all of the indices and significant fibrosis, as determined clinically and radiologically. Conclusions. There was not a protective association between angiotensin inhibition <b>and</b> <b>liver</b> fibrosis in coinfection. These noninvasive indices may be useful for ruling out significant fibrosis in coinfection...|$|R

40|$|Background: Co-infection with {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) and/or {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can alter {{the course of the}} disease. Objectives: In this study, we investigated the frequency of HIV and/or HCV co-infection in chronic HBV patients and related risk factors in acquiring the HCV <b>and</b> or <b>HIV</b> co-infectionit. Patients <b>and</b> Methods: We studied 264 chronic HBV patients who visited the Gastrointestinal <b>and</b> <b>Liver</b> Ward of the Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran between 2006 and 2010. Demographic information and records of possible risky behavior were obtained. Antibodies against HBV, HCV, <b>and</b> <b>HIV,</b> levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and conversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) to hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) were evaluated. Results: Of 264 patients with chronic HBV in this study, 184 patients (70 %) were men and 78 patients (30 %) were women. Only 1 patient (0. 37 %) was positive for anti-HIV antibody, whereas 12 patients (4. 54 %) were positive for anti-HCV antibody. None of the patients had co-infection with all 3 viruses (HBV, <b>HIV,</b> <b>and</b> HCV). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of HCV is higher than that of HIV in chronic HBV patients. Since HCV or HIV co-infection affects the therapeutic outcome in chronic HBV patients, testing for <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> HCV is recommended, especially for patients with a history of risky behavior...|$|R
