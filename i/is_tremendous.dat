500|$|In 2014, Chis Payne commented for Billboard magazine: [...] "Evancho’s stratospheric vocals are {{of course}} {{impressive}} for someone her age, though pipes like this are incredible for just about anyone." [...] in 2015, the reviewer for Digital Journal wrote: [...] "The control she displays over her voice <b>is</b> <b>tremendous,</b> and she tackles the high notes ... effortlessly, showcasing her angelic vocals and piercing pipes." [...] Robin Leach wrote of Evancho's 2015 concert in Las Vegas: [...] "She’s still got the voice of an angel. It’s remarkable, and her power is growing as she grows up. [...] had the audience on its feet with wild applause {{at the end of}} every song". Some reviewers, beginning in 2015, noticed a lack of connection with the text; a review in The Washington Post called her voice a [...] "bell-like instrument, devoid of any messy human emotions [...] an ethereally floating tone. ... But imagine what Evancho can achieve once she stops obsessing over just sounding pretty, and actually listens to the words she’s singing." [...] Reviewing one of Evancho's 2016 concerts, Steve Barnes similarly wrote for the Times Union that her voice is [...] "an instrument of pristine beauty. It peals with the purity of bells and lofts tones that shimmer with celestial iridescence" [...] but that her performance lacks [...] "an apparent interpretive style or emotional connection to the material".|$|E

The scale and {{resilience}} of the buildings and people is amazing – {{it is a world}} city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas – Dublin, or Boston, or Hamburg. The city <b>is</b> <b>tremendous,</b> and so, right up to the First World War, were the abilities of the architects who built over it…… The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of the bombings and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England."

This is a regional problem." [...] Igdir Mayor Nurettin Aras stated, [...] "We are in danger of a disaster. We will apply for the closing down of the nuclear plant," [...] and Kars Mayor Naif Alibeyoglu confirmed that, [...] "We are doing everything to close this plant, but not everything is in our power. It is essential that state authorities attend to this matter closely," [...] and, [...] "The Turkish government should start an initiative for the closure of the plant.

2500|$|On 20 July 2004, Paul Martin {{appointed}} Dion the Minister of the Environment. Shortly {{after his}} appointment, a Globe and Mail article described Dion as being [...] "bent on transforming the environment dossier {{from the traditional}} tree-hugger's last stand into a forward-thinking economic portfolio.". Dion championed a [...] "new industrial revolution" [...] focused on [...] "environmentally sustainable technologies and products", and he sought to nurture a collaborative relationship with big business rather than a confrontational one. His maiden speech before the Calgary Chamber of Commerce illustrates just how accommodating {{he was ready to}} be: [...] "Calgary is one of Canada's most impressive economic engines.... Alberta could soon be the second-largest oil-exporting jurisdiction on Earth, behind Saudi Arabia. This <b>is</b> <b>tremendous</b> blessing for Canada." [...] In October 2005, Dion nominated oil and gas executive Allan Amey to head up the government's $1-billion Clean Fund, the largest single element in Dion's Kyoto implementation strategy.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, Fatih Birol, {{the chief}} {{economist}} of the International Energy Agency, described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands as [...] "extremely low". The IEA forecasts {{that in the next}} 25 years oil sands production in Canada will increase by more than , but Dr. Birol said [...] "the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China — not even one day." [...] The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little time worrying about carbon emissions from oil sands. [...] "There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States {{and other parts of the}} world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low." [...] Dr. Birol acknowledged that there <b>is</b> <b>tremendous</b> difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, [...] "I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{conformation}} shows, where dogs' conformation to a {{breed standard}} is evaluated, mixed-breed dogs normally cannot compete. For purebred dogs, their physical characteristics are judged against a single breed standard. Mixed-breed dogs, however, {{are difficult to}} classify except according to height; there <b>is</b> <b>tremendous</b> variation in physical traits such as coat, skeletal structure, gait, ear set, eye shape and color, and so on. When conformation standards are applied to mixed-breed dogs, such as in events run by the MBDCA, the standards are usually general traits of health, soundness, symmetry, and personality. The Kennel Club (UK) operates a show called Scruffts (a name derived from its prestigious Crufts show) open only to mixed-breeds in which dogs are judged on character, health, and temperament. Some kennel clubs, whose purpose is to promote purebred dogs, still exclude mixed-breeds from their performance events. The AKC and the FCI are two such prominent organizations. While the AKC does allow mixed-breed dogs to earn their Canine Good Citizen award, mixed-breed dogs {{are not permitted to}} enter AKC [...] "all breed" [...] events, though through their [...] "Canine Partners" [...] program, mixed breed dogs can be registered to compete in AKC Agility, Obedience, and Rally events.|$|E

2500|$|Generally, most student-athletes are {{legitimate}} students who study and pass and succeed academically, {{but in some}} schools {{there is a small}} percentage of athletes, particularly in revenue-producing sports such as basketball and football, in which there are academic improprieties. A major allegation in this particular scandal is that the university funneled students into [...] "make-believe courses" [...] and subsequently stamped their transcripts with [...] "inflated grades", such that the students received [...] "little or no real education". That colleges have been admitting some academically ill-prepared but talented athletes for many decades is an [...] "age-old problem", and once in school, the schools must maintain the pretense that these admitted students are remaining in good academic standing, but it is difficult for some of these student-athletes to keep up academically. A CNN investigation estimated that the percentage of so-called [...] "revenue sport athletes" [...] who were reading at an elementary school level was approximately 7% to 18%, with some schools having even higher percentages reading at below college levels; an analysis by Oklahoma professor Gerald Gurney estimated that a tenth of revenue-sport athletes were reading below a fourth-grade level. Still, in the drive to win victory in NCAA tournaments, there <b>is</b> <b>tremendous</b> pressure to recruit top athletes to these schools regardless of their academic ability. Many schools believe that excellent tutoring and extra attention off the field help their athletes succeed after school.|$|E

60|$|For {{the larger}} kinds of game, such as {{elephants}} and buffaloes, experienced sportsmen mostly prefer guns of immense Bore, carrying round bullets that weigh {{a quarter of}} a pound.

The guns must be strong, because very large charges of powder are invariably used where great power of penetration is required.
