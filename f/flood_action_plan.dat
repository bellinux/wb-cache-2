40|$|Based on {{the results}} of recent studies a renewed vision for flood risk {{management}} in Flanders took shape under the name of multi-layered water safety. The multi-layered water safety aims at reducing flood risk to a socially and economically acceptable level through an optimal mix of protective, preventive and preparedness measures, in which all actors in flood risk management face up to their responsibility. A new approach to develop a <b>flood</b> risk <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> based on the vision of multi-layered water safety was applied to the pilot case of the catchment of the Maarkebeek. Using a methodology based on quantitative economic as well as social risk values, potential measures are assessed taking climate change and land use projections into account. Measures and combinations that have a positive (or marginally but acceptable negative) cost-benefit ratio and a large social benefit are retained. These serve {{as a starting point for}} the debate on flood risk management with all the actors and for the consultation of the stakeholders. As a result of several actor meetings a ‘river contract’ was drafted. The river contract is a commitment of all actors to realise the listed measures, securing the collaborative effect. The river contract is an integrated response to the flood risk problem at catchment scale and aims at providing solutions to all affected households. This approach, applying multi-layered water safety to a local river catchment, combines an objective model-based assessment with intense stakeholder deliberation resulting in a widely accepted and objectively effective <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> i. e. the river contract, to manage flood risk in an efficient and sustainable wa...|$|R

The goals {{of this study are}} to: determine whether it is feasible for patients to make <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in the primary care visit; determine whether patients report carrying out their action plans; and describe the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> patients choose. Methods: Forty-three clinicians in 8 primary care sites were recruited to hold action-plan discus-sions with patients. Research assistants contacted patients by telephone 3 weeks later to assess whether patients had conducted their <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Eighty-three percent of enrolled patients (228) made an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> during a primary care visit. Of the 79 % who recalled making the <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> when interviewed by telephone 3 weeks later, 56 % recalled the details of their <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> and an additional 33 % recalled the general nature of the <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> At least 53 % of patients making an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> reported making a behavior change consistent with that <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions: Most patients reported making a behavior change based on an <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> suggesting that <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> may be a useful strategy to encourage behavior change for patients seen in primary care.

However, according to Chadwick the plan was criticised by some donors and civil society. The planned participation of civil society was hampered by the military dictatorship that governed the country at that time. Later, the national government approved the FAP's final report, called the Bangladesh Water and Flood Management Strategy (BWFMS), in 1995 with the support of donor agencies. Among other things, the strategy proposed the formulation of a comprehensive national water management plan, increased user participation and environmental impact assessment as integral parts of planning. Consequently, the Flood Planning Coordination Organization (FPCO), which had been established in 1992 to co-ordinate the studies, was merged with WARPO in 1996.|$|E

The Welsh system is bottom-up with an increasing role for market and civil society to take responsibilities. Citizens generally insure themselves against flood damage. The Welsh system has enhanced community engagement and creating awareness is important. Dealing with big strategic issues seems to be difficult. The Dutch flood governance is more top-down which means less room for citizen initiatives. Citizens are not insured for flood damage since the government profiles itself responsible for floods therefore awareness amongst citizens is low. The Dutch system has benefits when dealing with large scaled projects but has issues with creating awareness as well as engaging citizens in water development.

40|$|Bangladesh {{is located}} on a delta where the {{combination}} of such factors as the monsoon rain and the enormous run-off from the Himalayan drainage system creates a characteristic hydrological zone which is often fl ooded. In this region farmers have adapted well to such disadvantageous conditions for rice cultivation in the rainy season. In a village located {{on the fringe of}} a haor, farmers have selected suitable rice varieties for different fl ood types; historically, they had adopted boro rice for the main crop instead of the vulnerable broadcast aman rice in response to the change of the local hydrological environment. The Bangladesh government invested considerable effort in the Flood Control, Drainage and/or Irrigation (FCD/I) project, under which more than several thousand embankments were built. Those embankments disturbed local hydrological conditions and, consequently, local people destroyed some of them to save their own lands and lives. Serious losses and damage led subsequently to the implementation of the <b>Flood</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> (FAP) in 1989. The concept of "living with fl ooding" has become widespread through the FAP, although the concept "fl ood control" was dominant at its initial stage.

This organizational structure was intended to enhancing preparedness and response to weather-related natural hazards (Brunei Darussalam Government 2009; Oxford Business Group 2009).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to assess risk for diarrheal disease in rural Bangladesh by analyzing the complex and dynamic interaction of biological, socioeconomic, cultural/behavioral and environmental factors over time and space. Risk factors of cholera and non-cholera water diarrheal disease are calculated to compare {{the relative importance of}} risk for several independent variables. Diarrheal disease data were collected for people who were hospitalized at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR) hospital from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 1994. Using laboratory and hospital records, cases were assigned to one of two diarrhea disease categories (cholera or non-cholera watery diarrhea) that were used as dependent variables in the analysis stage of the research. Age-matched individuals were randomly chosen from the community to be controls. Information was collected for independent variables that were hypothesized to be related to watery diarrhea. This information was collected by administering questionnaires, obtaining secondary data from the ICDDR's demographic surveillance system records and community health worker record books and calculating variables using a geographic information system database. Sanitation and water availability and use are extremely important in the effort to reduce secondary cholera and non-cholera, watery diarrhea transmission. Water use and availability variables were more important for non-cholera watery diarrheal risk than for cholera but nevertheless they were important for both. Socioeconomic status is an important indirect cause of both of these diseases because poverty is the root cause of many of the other variables, such as lack of sanitation and clean water. Flood-control was related to both types of diarrhea but it is not understood why. Since the Bangladesh <b>Flood</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> will continue to build and maintains flood-control embankments, it is important to investigate whether there is a pattern to this relationship throughout the country and to investigate why the relationship exists.

40|$|Institutional {{arrangements}} {{are a key}} issue for sustainable natural resource management. Recent water and fisheries management projects in Bangladesh have established new local institutions for floodplain management based on community organizations. Although the <b>Flood</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> (FAP) {{was the culmination of}} an earlier emphasis on technical and structural `solutions' to managing floods and water in Bangladesh, the expected large engineering works were never built. One legacy of FAP lies in a contested process that accelerated emphasis on public participation, smaller scale hazard adjustments and maintaining a wider range of floodplain resource values including conserving and restoring fisheries. This paper compares institutional arrangements and outcomes in two fisheries and two water management projects taken up after FAP. Local organizations appeared generally successful in sustaining themselves and continuing floodplain resource management. Facilitation, the extent of consensus among different stakeholders, and fit between institutional arrangements and scale of resource were all important influences on effectiveness. Local organizations have sustained in smaller floodplains, but in larger areas co-management bodies were a key to effective coordination and troubleshooting among a series of linked community organizations. Local leaders tend to dominate after projects end, especially where planning was less participatory and organizational structures were determined from above. Participants stressed that for continued success formally recognized well-run organizations are needed with accountable and adaptable decision-making processes and good leaders. This process built on participatory guidelines from FAP but the local institutions have not addressed hazard risks. Community resource management institutions could develop a more integrated approach that internalizes the interactions between water, land and fishery management. So far, local planning for floods has been a notable gap in the activities of community institutions, but the enhanced social capital could be a basis for adaptation to climate change. For this, an enabling policy environment is needed, which could be facilitated by the open high-profile debate on floodplain issues that characterized FAP...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} improve the {{transition}} from an intention {{to a change in}} health behaviour, <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> is a frequently used behavioural change method. The quality of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in terms of instrumentality and specificity is important in terms of supporting a successful change in health behaviour. Until now, little has been known about the predictors of <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> generation and the predictors of high quality <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and, therefore, the current study investigates these predictors. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted to improve physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption using a web-based computer tailored intervention. During the 8 -week intervention period, participants in the intervention arm (n[*]=[*] 346) were guided (step-by-step) to generate their own <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> to improve their health behaviours. Demographic characteristics, social cognitions, and health behaviour were assessed at baseline by means of self-reporting. Whether participants generated <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> was tracked by means of server registrations within two modules of the intervention. Results The <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component of the intervention regarding physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption was used by 40. 9 and 20. 7  % of the participants, respectively. We found that participants who were physically active at baseline were less likely to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> concerning physical activity. With regards to generating fruit and vegetable <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> participants with a high risk perception and a strong intention to eat fruit and vegetables on a daily basis made more use of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component for this behaviour. Finally, the large majority of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> for physical activity (96. 6  %) and fruit and vegetable consumption (100  %) were instrumental and about half of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be highly specific (PA[*]=[*] 69. 6  %/FV[*]=[*] 59. 7  %). The specificity of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> is associated with having a relationship and low levels of negative outcome expectancies. Conclusion Risk perception and intention are predictors of using the application of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Increasing the motivation to change behaviour should be prioritised in interventions concerning changes in health behaviour before participants are asked to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> This would also make the intervention suitable for unmotivated people. For those participants who already perform the desired health behaviour prior to the intervention, <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> might be less relevant. Nevertheless, using a guided step-by-step approach to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> resulted in highly instrumental and specific <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and might be integrated into other interventions concerning changes in health behaviour.

40|$|This thesis quantifies the occurrence, {{morphology}} {{and flow}} dynamics of dune bcdforms {{in the main}} rivers of Bangladesh: the Jamuna, Meghna and Ganges. Field work was conducted {{as part of the}} River Survey Project (Bangladesh <b>Flood</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> 24) between November 1993 and March 1996, hence encompassing two flood hydrographs. River surveying was accomplished using a differential global positioning system to obtain vessel position and high resolution echo sounders and side scan sonar to monitor bed morphology. Flow, turbulence and suspended sediment transport were investigated using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) which measured both the instantaneous three-dimensional velocity structure and the relative suspended sediment concentration for the entire flow column beneath the survey vessel. Dunes are ubiquitous in the Jamuna and range in height from 0. 15 to over 6 m and in wavelength from 3 to 300 m. Both dune height and wavelength alter systematically with flow stage, increasing by factors of 6 and 8 respectively between low and high flow conditions. Lee side angle, which effects flow separation downstream of the dune crest and hence turbulence production and flow resistance, ranges from 2 ° to 58 ° and steepens with flow stage. There is little evidence of dune flattening with increasing flow stage, indicating that flow conditions do not reach the transition to upper-stage plane beds. An important corollary of this is that dunes are the dominant bedform at all flow stages and hence will dominate the preserved sediments of such alluvial channels. Existing models of dune morphology and occurrence are poor predictors at high flow stage in the Jamuna, most likely because of the low Froude numbers associated with such deep channels. Mean flow and turbulence fields, obtained from at-a-point profiling during different flow stages, have been examined for dunes with steep (> 20 °) and low (< 10 °) lee side angles. No flow separation was detected over dunes with low lee face angles. Over dunes with steep lee face angles, mean negative downstream velocities do not occur downstream of dune crests, although intermittent flow separation (flow reversals) has been measured at both low and high flow stages, with instantaneous velocity reversals reaching - 60...|$|E

Developing successful commu-nity-based comanagement that enables entire wetland ecosystems while also ensuring productive fisheries {{and the needs of}} resource users is a major challenge. This case study brings together the importance of adaptive management, successful leadership, multidisciplinary approaches, and lessons drawn from more than eight years of experience to support community-based comanage-ment. The Management of Aquatic Ecosystems through Community Husbandry (MACH) project in Bangladesh used a holistic integrated approach and enabled the achievement of sustainable and environmentally sound development. Background and Setting Despite its small area (144, 000 km 2), the inland freshwater fish production of Bangladesh ranks third in the world behind China and India. With extensive rivers and floodplain wetlands of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, {{more than half of the}} country can be termed as wetlands that are a source of food and income for about 70 million rural households. In Bangladesh about 4 million hectares of land are inundated with water every year in the mon-soon (rainy) season, and more than half the country is under water in an exceptional flood year (Ali 1997). In the dry season, the wetlands reduce in size to form a system of rivers, beels (depressions and lakes that hold water permanently or seasonally), and baors (oxbow lakes). The floodplains of Bangladesh are one of the world’s most important wetlands and home to hundreds of species of plants, fish, birds, and other wildlife. The wetlands provide habitat for more than 260 fish species (Rahman 1989), hundreds of thousands of migrating birds (BirdLife International 2004), and are an important source of income and nutrition for millions of households in rural Bangladesh, espe-cially the poor. As many as 80 % of rural households catch fish for food or sale (<b>Flood</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> 16 1995), and about 60 % of animal protein consumption comes from fish (Bangladesh Bureau o...|$|E
40|$|After the {{disastrous}} floods in Bangladesh in 1987 the <b>Flood</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> (FAP) was initiated. The FAP was a co-ordinated action {{to study the}} flood problems of Bangladesh. The Meghna Estuary Study (MES) was drawn up {{as a component of}} the FAP. The overall goal of MES is to ensure the physical safety and social security of the people living in the coastal areas and on the islands of the Meghna Estuary. This goal is to be realised by retaining and increasing knowledge of the hydraulic and morphological processes and by developing appropriate techniques for efficient land reclamation as well as effective river bank protection. In particular during the monsoon season erosion of the river banks occurs throughout the Meghna Estuary. The erosion causes direct land loss (including loss of livelihood and impoverishment) and, where embankments are eroded, results in flooding of homesteads and agricultural land. Looking at the planform development of the Lower Meghna it is expected that in future years the eastern river bank of the Lower Meghna river starting south of Chandpur up to Haimchar is going to be subject to severe erosion. The river banks are highly erosive due to the non-cohesiveness of the sediments, the small particle size and the high flow velocities. Previous studies carried out have shown that protection of the river bank using conventional river bank protection methods is not generally economically viable at the current level of economic development in Bangladesh. It is expected that at the current level of economic development in Bangladesh alternative Iow cost bank protection measures are the only viable option to protect the river banks against erosion on a large scale. Nevertheless it must be stated that the circumstances are severe and the possibilities and necessary know-how have to be assessed by further research and execution of experiments. Under MES several pilot projects have been executed to study alternative ways of river bank protection. In part I of this study the author has studied the application of flexible bottom screens in combination with permeable spurs. In part II the application of bottom screens to create a roughness field is subject of discussion. Both studies are conducted under the responsibility of the Technical University Delft. One of the pilot projects executed by MES is the Hanar Char erosion control pilot scheme in which flexible bottom screens and permeable spurs are applied as an alternative way of river bank protection. This pilot scheme was executed from March to July 1999 and is part of the proposed Haimchar erosion control pilot project, which covers the complete eastern river bank from Chandpur up to Haimchar. However, up till August 2000 only a part of the Haimchar erosion control pilot project has been executed. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether flexible bottom screens and permeable spurs are an effective way of river bank protection in the river dominated part of the Meghna Estuary. This is done by studying the available literature and the influence of the structures on the flow pattern and morphology. Flexible bottom screens Flexible bottom screens show great analogy with so called bottom vanes which are placed at a certain angle of attack with the flow. The vanes cause the passing flow to attain a circular motion downstream from it. The sediment-rich bottom flow is directed to the river bank and the erosive upper current is directed towards the centre of the river. In the available literature on bottom vanes the distinction is made between vanes placed at a small angle of attack with the flow and vanes placed at a high angle of attack with the flow.
