40|$|Both superplastic {{deformation}} and {{the accompanying}} microstructural development in st 2124 Al/ 18 vol%SiCp, metal matrix composite have been investigated. Mechanical property results comparable {{to those found in}} similar materials have been achieved, the optimum superplastic elongation being 430 % at a strain rate of almost 0. 1 s(- 1). The anomalously high activation energy which has been observed in other studies was also reproduced. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the optimum temperature in the current material was significantly below the temperature at which melting began, however, in contrast to some previous work. Microstructural investigation showed that both the optimum elongation, and the onset of the high activation energy regime, coincided with the temperature above which the majority of the intermetallic particles present at lower temperatures started to dissolve. It is concluded that the high apparent activation energy is an artefact caused by microstructural changes. The deformation and microstructural changes observed are consistent with grain boundary sliding accommodated by slip in the aluminium matrix.

Strength tests, hysteresis tests and creep tests of mushrooms compressed between two parallel plates were carried out. Values of the index WP of the work of deformation inputs, modulus of elasticity EC and stress σobl were calculated. Susceptibility to creeping through calculation of the number of days to doubling of the strain value based on MacLeod equation was determined. Anisotropy of mechanical properties was reported, depending on the direction of loading and the size of a mushroom. Modulus of elasticity EC has a value of 0. 5 MPa at the load in the axial direction and 0. 3 MPa in the radial direction not {{depending on the size of}} a mushroom.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation of mechanical deformation in an amorphous structure and an X-ray diffraction {{observation of the}} creep-induced structural anisotropy were performed in order to investigate the microscopic mechanism of deformation. Earlier {{computer simulation}} {{studies have shown that}} during deformation the atomic displacements are not spatially uniform, but are localized at several deformation sites. However, the atomic arrangements in those deformation sites have not been clearly identified. In this study bonds between the nearest neighbor atoms were assumed to be the basic units of the structure. The topology of an amorphous structure can be described by the network consisting of these nearest neighbor bonds. The topology of the bond network is conserved by elastic deformation, but it is changed by non-elastic deformation. The local atomic arrangements of the deformation sites were also analysed using the concept of bond network. Shear units in which one bond is exchanged with another bond were found to be important basic units of anelasticity. Small deformation units can be connected with others to form a larger <b>deformation</b> <b>unit,</b> which explains the wide distribution of the activation energies associated with deformation and relaxation. A diffraction study of the anisotropy in the structure factor for an amorphous metal using the energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXD) technique provided valuable information on the atomic scale mechanism of deformation. We found that the distribution of the bond orientations after creep had been shifted toward the direction perpendicular to the tensile axis. This behavior {{can be explained by the}} bond rearrangement mechanism of deformation. The study of recovery of the creep-induced structural anisotropy and the effect of preannealing showed that the observed structural anisotropy is due solely to anelastic effect, not due to plastic deformation. In conclusion, we have shown that non-elastic deformation of amorphous metals can be described in terms of the local rearrangements of the atomic bonds, and that the structural anisotropy induced by such bond rearrangements can be experimentally observed by X-ray diffraction. ...|$|E

40|$|Methods for the {{prediction}} of pile performance are mainly developed from model pile tests and full-scale pile tests of less than 40 m long in transported soils. Their predictability for high capacity long driven H-piles in weathered soils is in doubt. In this thesis, the final sets of 4, 278 H-piles of 28 - 80 m long, dynamic measurements of 255 of them and static loading tests of 13 instrumented piles from a site are studied. Pile behaviours caused by a hammer impact and under static test load are compared with 361 H-piles of 14 - 25 m long from another site and theoretical predictions. Measured data revealed that the load-transfer mechanism varied with pile length and applied load. Piles deformed almost linearly with increased load and might fail in buckling with or without large plastic <b>deformation.</b> <b>Unit</b> side resistance degraded after prolonged hard driving. Maximum impact forces at final set were scatter but their means were insensitive to hammer type, ram weight, ram drop and pile length. Maximum impact compression of pile and affected pile length existed. Creep settlement and set-up effect in weathered soils were quantified. Geotechnical design parameters for local soils were calibrated. Factors affecting dynamic soil parameters were explained. Two improvements to {{the prediction}}s were proposed. The energy-based equation uses the final sets and energy transferred to pile head to estimate the affected pile length. Piles longer than the length estimated will be considered as long piles and existing theories have to be applied with caution. If this length is used instead of full pile length in Hiley formula, predictability of the formula can be improved. The advantages of this modification to Hiley formula are its simplicity to use in field and the low cost compared with the stress-wave monitoring techniques. The new Case damping model approximates the Case damping factor as the sum of hysteretic damping of pile and viscous damping of surrounding soil. Based on this model, the effects of variation in load-distribution along pile shaft and set-up of pile in layered soils, and the incomplete mobilization of soil at pile toes to the Case damping factor can be explained...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the first marine gas hydrate {{drilling}} expedition of Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS- 1) in northern continental slope of the South China Sea revealed a variable distribution of gas hydrates in the Shenhu area. In this study, comparisons between the eight sites with gas-hydrate petroleum system were used to analyze and re-examine hydrate potential. In the Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area, all the sites were located in a suitable low-temperature, high-pressure environment. Biogenic and thermogenic gases contributed {{to the formation of}} hydrates. Gas chimneys and some small-scale faults (or micro-scale fractures) compose the migration pathways for gas-bearing fluids. Between these sites, there are three key differences: the seafloor temperatures and pressures; geothermal gradient and sedimentary conditions. Variations of seafloor temperatures and pressures related to water depths and geothermal gradient would lead to changes in the thickness of gas hydrate stability zones. Although the lithology and grain size of the sediments were similar, two distinct sedimentary units were identified for the first time through seismic interpretation, analysis of deep-water sedimentary processes, and the Cm pattern (plotted one-percentile and median values from grain-size analyses), implying the heterogeneous sedimentary conditions above Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs). Based on the analyses of forming mechanisms and sedimentary processes, these two fine-grained sedimentary units have different physical properties. Fine-grained turbidites (Unit I) with thin-bedded chaotic reflectors at the bottom acted as the host rocks for hydrates; whereas, finegrained sediments related to soft-sediment <b>deformation</b> (<b>Unit</b> II) characterized by thick continuous reflectors at the top would serve as regional homogeneous caprocks. Low-flux methane that migrated upwards along chimneys could be enriched preferentially in fine-grained turbidites, resulting in the formation of hydrates within Unit I. However, overlying fine-grained sediments related to soft-sediment deformation would hinder the further migration of gases/fluids, causing the extremely low methane concentration in Unit I. Three of the eight sites with hydrates from recovered core samples were located within sedimentary Unit I, and the other five sites were not. Because, the most significant difference between the eight sites is the nature and type of sedimentary deposits above the BSRs, it is suggested therefore that sedimentary conditions are the crucial factor controlling the formation and occurrence of gas hydrates in the Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area, northern South China Sea...|$|E

It shows that the yield strength, the plastic deformation ability, the density of shear bands of the metallic glass increase with decreasing temperature. In order to understand the mechanisms for the changes of the mechanical behaviour at low temperatures, in Part II of this study, the stress-time sequence in the plastic strain regime is characterized by a comprehensive dynamical and statistical analysis. The stress-time sequence is found to exhibit a chaotic state at high temperatures (> 203 K), whereas a self-organized critical state is obtained at low temperatures (≤ 203 K) due to the freezing effect. The reasons for the transition between these two distinct spatio-temporal dynamical states are elucidated by investigating the effect of temperature on the <b>deformation</b> <b>units</b> (shear transformation zones) and the elastic interactions between neighbouring shear bands.

It then uses the morphological operation to remove noise and to capture the organs of facial expression, such as the eyes, mouth, eyebrow, and nose.
