5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one publisher at the same age.

All these issues must {{be kept in mind}} when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E

In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E

5|$|The {{indeterminate}} specimen TMP2002.76.1 is {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to Achelousaurus, the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. Achelousaurus would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one formation. Both animals occur right below the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP2002.76.1 is about 500,000years older than the Achelousaurus fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.|$|E

5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{collection}} of specimens, gathered <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{a decade of}} Arctic and Antarctic travel, required a permanent home. Bruce himself needed a base from which the detailed scientific reports of the Scotia voyage could be prepared for publication. He obtained premises in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, in which he established a laboratory and museum, naming it the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, with the ultimate ambition that it should become the Scottish National Oceanographic Institute. It was officially opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906.|$|E
5|$|CBS began a shortwave {{listening}} {{program in}} September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the National Lawn Tennis Championships at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location {{was found to}} have good reception, and monitors relayed European shortwave news to CBS headquarters in New York between tennis matches. Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, Associated Press, United Press International and International News Service, and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of juvenile material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences <b>from</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E

After Red Dogs release date was pushed up by several days, Drive replaced it as the Melbourne International Film Festival's closing night film. The film was also screened during FilmDistrict's studio panel presentation at the San Diego Comic-Con function.
