5|$|Italy now {{effectively}} {{became an}} occupied country, as the Germans poured in troops. Italy's decision to switch sides created contempt <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> among both the Allies and Germans, {{which was to}} have far-reaching consequences.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting target <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians,</b> who saw it as {{a refuge}} for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|The 1985 European Cup Final was Liverpool's fifth such final. Before {{the match}} at the Heysel Stadium began, Liverpool fans {{breached}} a fence separating opposing fans. As Juventus fans fled to safety, {{the accumulation of}} people against a perimeter wall caused it to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. The wall collapse was followed by Juventus fans rioting at the stadium's other end. The match was delayed two hours before starting with fear abandonment would cause further violence. Michel Platini's penalty won the final 1–0 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians.</b>|$|E

5|$|When the Italo-Turkish War {{began on}} 29 September 1911, Varese {{assigned}} to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, together with her sisters Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio. While her sisters bombarded Tripoli on 3–4 October, Varese {{appears to have been}} deployed seaward to provide security <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians.</b> On 13 October, the three sisters sailed to Augusta, Sicily to recoal. The ship escorted two troop transports and a hospital ship on her return voyage several days later. On 16 October, she escorted a troop convoy to Homs and bombarded the town after the Ottoman commander refused to surrender. Bad weather prevented any landings until 21 October and the ship continued to provide fire support for the Italian troops.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 29 June, {{the rebels}} {{attacked}} the Ustaše {{in a village}} on the Mostar–Nevesinje road. Prohaska demanded help from Mostar, and planned to send a force from Nevesinje to assist. From Mostar, a company of the 21st Battalion was despatched to relieve the Ustaše, who had managed to hold off the rebels. The Home Guard company then took over the post from the Ustaše. The same day, two new battalions arrived in Mostar, the 23rd Battalion from Osijek and the 15th Battalion from Travnik. These reinforcements arrived just as Prpić received confirmation that Avtovac had been captured by the rebels. The remaining small garrison in Gacko, consisting of only 20 gendarmes and 30 Ustaše, were holding out but expecting more attacks by the rebels. In the morning, the attack by elements of the 10th Battalion stalled until the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Julije Reš, personally took command of the operation, clearing the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians.</b> The promised Italian intervention commenced about midday, and about 100 trucks of Italian soldiers arrived in Gacko about 17:00. As they had passed through Avtovac, the rebels had left the town and withdrawn to villages to the east. About 18:00, the 10th Battalion relieved the besieged gendarmes in the village schoolhouse. ZNDH aircraft from Mostar airfield flew reconnaissance sorties over the area and dropped leaflets over Stolac, Stepen, Avtovac, Gacko and Plužine.|$|E
5|$|Totti did recuperate in {{time and}} was {{eventually}} named to Lippi's final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup. Despite initial concerns over his match fitness, Totti was an important player in Marcello Lippi's team, and played in all seven games for Italy, including the victorious final against France, which Italy won on penalties, although he was substituted off in the 61st minute. He played the entire time in Germany with metal plates and screws in his ankle that {{had yet to be}} removed following the surgery. Throughout the tournament, he usually played as an attacking midfielder, in front of deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo, and behind strikers Luca Toni, Alberto Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta, or Filippo Inzaghi; these players were supported defensively by Gennaro Gattuso, Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi in midfield. Totti finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists, along with his teammate Pirlo, Juan Román Riquelme, Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Luís Figo (4). Totti set up Pirlo's goal from a short corner in Italy's opening 2–0 win against Ghana, Marco Materazzi's goal from a corner in Italy's final group match, a 2–0 win against the Czech Republic, and two goals in a 3–0 win against Ukraine in the quarter-finals: the opener by Gianluca Zambrotta, and one of Luca Toni's goals. Totti also scored a goal via an injury-time penalty in Italy's 1–0 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June, and was involved in Del Piero's last-minute extra-time goal in the semi-final, which sealed a 2–0 victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> over hosts Germany, and a place in the World Cup final. Throughout the competition, Totti completed 185 passes and took 19 shots; in recognition of a successful tournament, he was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team.|$|E

25|$|After World War I in 1925, Trans-Juba, {{which was}} then a part of British East Africa, was ceded to Italy. This {{concession}} was purportedly a reward <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> having joined the Allies in World War I.|$|E
25|$|Some senior British {{officials}} {{thought that}} defeat was inevitable {{and that it}} was a Pyrrhic victory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians,</b> who had used irreplaceable resources, increased the dispersion of the military forces in the AOI and lost the means to follow alternatives, which might have brought more success.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1935, General Emilio De Bono {{advanced}} into Ethiopia from Eritrea {{without a}} declaration of war, leading a force of approximately 100,000 Italian and 25,000 Eritrean soldiers towards the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. In December, after {{a brief period of}} inactivity and minor setbacks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians,</b> De Bono was replaced by Badoglio.|$|E

25|$|The {{last piece}} of land {{acquired}} by Italy in Somalia in order to form Italian Somaliland was the Jubaland region. Britain ceded the territory in 1925 as a reward <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> having joined the Allies in World War I. The British retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD).|$|E
25|$|The VII Army Corps of the Regio Esercito {{was able}} to occupy Corsica, which was still under the formal {{sovereignty}} of Vichy France, without a fight. Because of the initial lack of perceived partisan resistance and to avoid problems with Marshal Philippe Pétain, no Corsican units were formed under Italian control (except for a labour battalion in March 1943). The Corsican population initially showed some support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians,</b> partly {{as a consequence of}} irredentist propaganda.|$|E
25|$|Jubaland was {{subsequently}} ceded to Italy in 1924-25, {{as a reward}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> having joined the Allies in World War I, and had a brief existence as the Italian colony of Trans-Juba (Oltre Giuba) under governor (16 July 1924 – 31 December 1926) Corrado Zoli (1877–1951). Italy issued its first postage stamps for the territory on 29 July 1925, consisting of contemporary Italian stamps overprinted Oltre Giuba (Trans-Juba). Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD).|$|E

25|$|The {{territory}} {{was subsequently}} ceded to Italy, purportedly {{as a reward}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> having joined the Allies in World WarI, and had a brief existence as the Italian colony of 'Trans-Juba (Oltre Giuba). The Italians subsequently referred to the city as Chisimaio. Kismayo and the northern half of the Jubaland region were then incorporated into neighboring Italian Somaliland on 30 June 1926. The colony had a total area of 87,000km² (33,000 sq mi), {{with a population of}} 120,000 inhabitants. Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD).|$|E
25|$|Despite help <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> {{from the}} local population, {{including}} the island's small ELAS partisan detachments, the Germans enjoyed complete air superiority and their troops had extensive combat experience, {{in contrast with the}} conscripts of Acqui, who were no match for the Germans. In addition, Gandin had withdrawn the Acqui from the elevated position on Mount Kardakata and that gave the Germans an additional strategic advantage. After several days of fighting, at 11:00 hours on 22 September, following Gandin's orders, the last Italians surrendered, having run out of ammunition and having lost 1,315 men killed. According to German sources, the losses were 300 Germans and 1,200 Italians. 15 Greek partisans were also killed fighting alongside the Acqui.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{the team}} fired Dragoni and {{replaced}} him with Franco Lini. Chris Amon partnered Bandini {{to drive a}} somewhat improved version of the 1966 V12 car. At the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix, Bandini crashed and suffered heavy injuries when he was trapped under his burning car; several days later he succumbed to his injuries. Ferrari re-hired Mike Parkes, but Parkes suffered career-ending injuries weeks later at the 1967 Belgian Grand Prix. A fatal crash, another bad crash, no race win, and only 5th in the Constructors' Championship marked a bad year <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians.</b> In addition, the new Ford Cosworth DFV engine that had its debut in the Lotus 49 would dominate F1 in the 15 years to come.|$|E

25|$|Following the Italian {{occupation}} of Albania in 1939, the Chams became a prominent propaganda tool <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> and irredentist elements among them became more vocal. As a result, {{on the eve}} of the Greco-Italian War, Greek authorities deported the adult male Cham population to internment camps. After the {{occupation of}} Greece, large parts of the Muslim Cham population collaborated with Italian and German forces. This fueled resentment among the local Greek population and in the aftermath of World War II the entire Muslim Cham population had to flee to Albania. Most Chams settled in Albania, while others formed émigré communities in Turkey and the United States, and today their descendants continue to live in these countries. Since the fall of Communism in Albania, Chams have campaigned for right of return to Greece and restoration of confiscated properties.|$|E
25|$|By 1935, Mogadishu {{began to}} serve as a major naval base and port <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians.</b> Then Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini {{regarded}} Greater Somalia (La Grande Somalia) as the crown jewel in Italy's colonial empire on the continent. He viewed himself less as an invader than as a liberator of the occupied Somali territories, including the Ogaden region, to which the Ethiopian Empire laid claim. On this basis, he justified his plan to invade Ethiopia. In October 1935, the southern front of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was launched into Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland. The Italian General Rodolfo Graziani commanded the invasion forces in the south. Over 40,000 Somali troops served in the war, mostly as combat units. They backed up the over 80,000 Italians serving alongside them {{at the start of the}} offensive. Many of the Somalis were veterans from serving in Italian Libya. During the invasion of Ethiopia, Mogadishu served as a chief supply base.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September, the Italian {{garrison}} on {{the island}} of Kastelorizo surrendered to a British detachment, which was reinforced during the following days by ships of the Allied navies. The next day, a British delegation, headed by Lord Jellicoe, was dropped by parachute on Rhodes, to persuade the Italian commander, Admiral Inigo Campioni, to join the Allies. The swift action of the German forces forestalled the Allies. Without waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> to decide, Kleemann attacked the 40,000-strong Italian garrison on 9 September and forced it to surrender by 11 September. The loss of Rhodes dealt a critical blow to Allied hopes. The government of the Kingdom of Italy surrendered and many Italian soldiers in the Aegean were tired of the war and had become opposed to Mussolini. Italian Fascist loyalists remained allied to Germany in the Greek campaign. German forces in Greece convinced 10,000 Italians in the Aegean to continue to support their war effort.|$|E
