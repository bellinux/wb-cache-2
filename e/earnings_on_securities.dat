40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} for the neutrality of money under flexible exchange rates in an extended real-wage Mundell-Fleming model, with special emphasis on the specification of the behavior functions to correspond to their foundations in closed-economy macrotheory. It is shown that monetary expansion causes output first to decline, to eventually rise above its original level. However, if interest <b>earnings</b> <b>on</b> foreign <b>securities</b> dominate the trade balance in the expression for the exchange rate, monetary expansion leads to {{an appreciation of the}} exchange rate, while having an expansionary output effect. Money is neutral in the long run if either the wealth effect or foreign interest payments are abstracted from; if both are abstracted from, it is neutral also in the short run. Short and long-run neutrality results also if wealth consists only of foreign securities. The above responses hold both for net creditors and - with a minor qualification - debtors.

The returns, before transaction costs, are not marginal; over a 12 -month holding period, excess returns are 18. 2 %.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{heterogeneous}} interacting agent {{model of a}} sequential monetary production economy. We use a basic dynamic flow model in an interacting agent context. The economy {{is assumed to be}} closed. There are three classes of agents: a single homogeneous representative consumer, heterogeneous firms and a banking system. Bounded rationality agents make decisions by optimizing an objective function based on expectations about the future formed on past data. There are three asset classes (or debts) : a single homogeneous physical good, money and debt securities. The homogeneous commodity is produced by firms and, if saved, increases their capital stock. Firms issue debts to finance growth. Firms are homogeneous as regarding marginal costs of production but are heterogeneous relative to their objective functions. Firms make different investment decisions that can ultimately result in the firm's growth or bankruptcy. The income of the homogeneous consumer depends <b>on</b> wage <b>earnings,</b> interest <b>on</b> debt <b>securities</b> and firms profit. Consumers spend their income to purchase consumption goods and corporate debt; money is also considered a reserve of value. Portfolio allocation depends on the interest rate. The money supply is exogenous and is the main control parameter of the system. The model is able to reproduce endogenous large scale economic fluctuations by means of the interplay between money supply and the interactions of heterogeneous agents. heterogeneous agents, financial markets and the macroeconomy, computer simulation...|$|R
