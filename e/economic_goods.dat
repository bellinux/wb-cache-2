2500|$|In China, the {{earliest}} known geographical Chinese writing {{dates back to the}} 5th century BC, during the beginning of the [...] Warring States (481–221 BC). This was the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu chapter of the Shu Jing or Book of Documents. The book describes the traditional nine provinces, their kinds of soil, their characteristic products and <b>economic</b> <b>goods,</b> their tributary goods, their trades and vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and lakes listed and placed accordingly. The nine provinces in the time of this geographical work were very small in size compared to their modern Chinese counterparts. The Yu Gong's descriptions pertain to areas of the Yellow River, the lower valleys of the Yangtze, with the plain between them and the Shandong Peninsula, and to the west the most northern parts of the Wei River and the Han River were known (along with the southern parts of modern-day Shanxi province).|$|E

2500|$|As {{soon as it}} is {{admitted}} that, in the real world, all <b>economic</b> <b>goods</b> can trade at prices above or below their real production-cost, {{it can no longer}} be true, that the only source of all profits is the exploitation of wage labor. The reason is, that profit income can arise simply from selling the same priced good for more than it was purchased for, resulting in a capital gain for the seller, where this capital gain can be completely unrelated (or quite disproportional) to any identifiable labor cost. Effectively, more labor can exchange for less labor, and vice versa, and in the real world, this happens – fortunately or unfortunately – all the time. That insight is the basis of the theory of unequal exchange. According to this theory, exploitation is not something that is limited only to [...] "the point of production" [...] of the revolutionary classical orthodox Marxists. Exploitation could occur in all sorts of ways, including at the level of international trade. In turn, that means that profit rates can be influenced by the terms of market trade, quite independently of production (as long as everybody can make gains, then even if the gains are not equal, it may attract no attention; but when incomes fall, the problem becomes manifest). Profit rates may not fall, because products are made cheaply {{in one part of the}} world, and resold somewhere else for a much higher price. The financial gain involved in the resales is not made explicit by value-added statistics, except indirectly.|$|E

It is in the matters that politicians usually ignore-- science and art, human relations, and the joy of life --that Anarchism is strongest, and it is chiefly for the sake of these things that we included such more or less Anarchist proposals as the ``vagabond's wage.'' It is by its effects outside economics and politics, {{at least as much as}} by effects inside them, that a social system should be judged.

5000|$|In Neoclassical terms, a {{commodity}} {{is a good}} or service that can be traded or exchanged in the marketplace for another commodity or money,. Commodification is routed in Marxist political theory and entails {{the creation of an}} ‘economic good’ that previously was not prescribed an economic value. This takes place through the application of market mechanisms with the intended result being a standardized class of goods or services. Once commodified an <b>economic</b> <b>good</b> can be bought or sold at a price determined by market exchange, and as such market values replace social values previously attached to the good. It is this transformation from a public <b>good</b> to an <b>economic</b> <b>good</b> that neoliberals claim leads to better management and allocation of a resource, such as water. In accordance with welfare economics, this view infers the more efficiently managed a resource is the higher a society’s welfare.

40|$|The {{discussion}} on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) {{has been very}} rich on institutional change (basin organizations, apex water bodies, legal reform) and on process management (multi-stakeholder processes, consultation and participation), but attention to the financial dimension of IWRM has been less developed. The gist of IWRM is that in water management {{there are many different}} functions to be managed simultaneously. Through investment and manage-ment interventions, values are created (or destroyed) in connection to these functions: productivity values, amenity values, property values, environmental conservation values, and more. The challenge in IWRM is to, at a minimum, balance these different functions and values, yet preferably to optimize them. This paper further argues that these different values need to be captured and, when possible, help finance the management of water resource systems in an integrated way. We present this as an improvement of the principle of “water as an <b>economic</b> <b>good.</b> ” The <b>economic</b> <b>good</b> argument has, in our view, often led to reductionist strategies, focusing on recovering the financial cost of water only and not maximizing and recovering the values associated with the many functions of water. This paper first clarifies some definitions and then discusses how to capture values and turn them into financial contributions to IWRM using illustrations from several parts of the world. The paper then comments on the principle of water as an <b>economic</b> <b>good,</b> long considered as the financial underpinning of IWRM. We look particularly at water pricing for demand management, closely associated with the theory of water as an <b>economic</b> <b>good.</b> It argues that a broader financial strategy, based on balancing, improving, and capitalizing on increased values related to water management, is more promising in funding IWRM and making it work. Finally, some institutional aspects of this approach are explored...|$|R

50|$|Rodbertus {{stated the}} Labor Theory of Value as three {{connected}} propositions. First, only those goods {{that result from}} labor may be thought to be <b>economic</b> <b>goods</b> - other goods, like sunlight, which do not result from labor are natural goods and consequently {{have nothing to do}} with economics. Second, an economic good is solely the product of the labor - any other view of it is to be left to physicists. No part of the value of grain, for example, is to be attributed to sunshine or soil. Third, <b>economic</b> <b>goods</b> are products of the labor that went into their composition and the labor that created the instruments that enabled that production. The value of grain, for example, is not to be found merely in the ploughman but also in the work of those who manufactured the plough.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{last decade}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the idea of treating water as an <b>economic</b> <b>good.</b> There is, however, a lot of confusion about the meaning of treating water as an <b>economic</b> <b>good.</b> It relates to making the right choices about optimal use and optimal allocation of water among users on the basis of socioeconomic trade-off analysis. This is completely different from water pricing (charging), which {{can be used as a}} policy instrument for demand management and cost recovery. This distinction is important for irrigated agriculture, since it usually faces high opportunity costs, while the ability to pay for irrigation water is often low. Water pricing is, however, only one of the various policy instruments for demand management.
