The geographic observational unit used was the microrregion (Brazil is divided in more than five hundred microrregions). Parameter estimation is done by maximum quasi-likelihood, based on foreign trade data. The results confirmed conclusions from other studies in the literature: the geographic factors and internal transportation costs are very important for importers and exporters decisions. Based on the estimated models, we simulate potential impacts of different scenarios for changes in internal transportation costs on the inter port competition in Brazil...|$|R

This gravity-based model is used to theoretically demonstrate that disregarding the activities of multinational enterprises leads to an upward bias in the measurement of home bias.
