25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break {{the news of the}} death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E

500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I {{feel that it}} is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|Visual art {{combined}} new influences from continental monastic styles with {{development of}} earlier English features, {{and is often}} described as the [...] "Winchester style" [...] or [...] "school" [...] although this was only one of the centres involved. Although the foundation of new communities reduced in the early eleventh century, art continued to flourish as the existing monasteries grew richer. The Benedictional of St. Æthelwold (Winchester, probably 970s, now British Library) is recognised as the most important of a group of surviving illuminated manuscripts, lavishly illustrated with extravagant acanthus leaf borders. According to the dedicatory poem, Æthelwold [...] "commanded... many frames well adorned and filled with various figures decorated with numerous beautiful colours and with gold", and he <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> asked for. It is described by Andrew Prescott as the [...] "outstanding work of art to have survived from this period". According to Barbara Yorke, [...] "The artistic workshops established at Æthelwold's foundations during his lifetime were to continue as influential schools of craftsmen after his death, and had a widespread influence both in England and on the Continent." ...|$|E

She states that he reassured her by saying, [...] "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal". Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, [...] "Well, I got a controversial video."

500|$|In [...] "Point of No Return", Castiel helps Sam to keep Dean from {{becoming}} Michael's vessel. He leaves after hearing {{a signal from}} the angels, and finds a resurrected Adam Milligan – Sam and Dean's half-brother who had been previously killed by ghouls. When Dean escapes and tries to contact the angels, Castiel finds him, and angrily attacks him for making Castiel's rebelling against Heaven worthless. Later, he carves a banishing sigil into his own chest and activates it {{in the presence of}} multiple angels in order to clear the way for Sam and Dean to attack Zachariah and save Adam. The effects of the sigil send him onto a fishing boat, now completely human. Despite his lack of power, he is able to defeat the Horseman Pestilence using what appears to be what little is left of his angelic strength, and assists Bobby and Sam in preventing nationwide distribution of the Croatoan virus. In the fifth-season finale, [...] "Swan Song", Castiel loses faith after Sam fails to overpower Lucifer when he possesses him and suggests they get drunk and wait for the end to come. When Dean refuses to give up, Castiel and Bobby follow him and Castiel uses a Molotov cocktail of Holy Fire to temporarily banish Michael to buy Dean time to try to reach Sam. [...] Angry that Castiel attacked his brother, Lucifer obliterates Castiel with a snap of his fingers. After Sam and Dean avert the Apocalypse, Castiel is resurrected once more by God, now more powerful than ever. [...] He heals Dean's injuries and resurrects Bobby and reminds Dean that he <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted: no Apocalypse, no Paradise, just more of the same. [...] Castiel then heads back to Heaven to restore order and become its new leader, believing it to be in chaos as Sam trapped Michael in Lucifer's Cage as well.|$|E

He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} recurring characters was Sardo (Richard Dumont), owner of [...] "Sardo's Magic Mansion" [...] (a magic shop). He would often attempt to sell a character a [...] "prized" [...] item, succeeding almost every single time. He often had items in his shop that contained real properties of magic, yet did not know until it was revealed in the story. One {{of the most memorable}} recurring jokes in the series occurred when someone would address him as [...] "Mr. Sardo." [...] He would then get irritated and exclaim: [...] "That's SarDO! No mister; accent on the doh!" [...] Another recurring line was: [...] "Have you seen our vomit?" [...] Additionally, when selling someone an item, he would often ask a rather high price. The main character would mention how much money they had, and Sardo would grab the money saying, [...] "But I'm losing on the deal." [...] Although he rarely <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted, he would often end up helping the characters, often unintentionally.

2500|$|Three {{months later}} Poirot goes {{to visit the}} convent Casey's {{daughter}} entered, in a remote part of the western coast of Ireland. He discovers that she had died two months earlier. Poirot makes the acquaintance {{of one of the}} locals who helps him break into the convent – where he recovers the goblet. He returns it to Power and tells him that the nuns were using it as a chalice. Casey's daughter probably took it there to atone for her father's sins and the nuns were ignorant of its ownership and ancient history. Poirot deduced it would be at the convent as there had been no trace of anyone having the goblet after it was stolen. Therefore, it was somewhere where [...] "ordinary material values did not apply". The mention of Casey's daughter being a nun supplied the obvious place. Poirot shows Power how, during the Renaissance, the Pope used a hidden mechanism in the goblet to put the poison in the victim's drink. Poirot suggests no good will come out of owning an object with such an evil history. If it is given back to the convent, the nuns will say masses for Power's soul. He reminds Power of his boyhood in western Ireland. Power agrees; he has <b>got</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants, which was to own the goblet. Poirot returns the goblet to the convent as the gift of a man so unhappy he does not know he is unhappy.|$|E
