40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{coupling}} between global financial markets has made the financial village prone to systemic collapses. Here we present a new methodology to assess and quantify <b>inter-market</b> <b>relations.</b> The approach is based on meta-correlations (correlations between the intra-market correlations), and a Dependency Network analysis approach. We investigated the relations between six important world markets â€” U. S., U. K., Germany, Japan, China and India from January 2000 until December 2010. Our findings show that while the developed Western markets (U. S., U. K., Germany), are highly correlated, the inter-dependencies between these markets and the Eastern markets (India and China) are very volatile and with noticeable maxima at times of global world events. Finally, using the Dependency network approach, we quantify {{the flow of information}} between the different markets, and how markets affect each other. We observe that German and U. K. stocks show a large amount of coupling, while other markets are more segmented. These and additional reported findings illustrate that this methodological framework provides a way to quantify interdependencies in the global market and their evolvement, to evaluate the world financial network, and quantify changes in <b>inter-market</b> <b>relations.</b> Such changes can be used as precursors to the agitation of the global financial village...|$|E
40|$|The broadness and {{inherent}} non-linearities in {{the market}} integration concepts have resulted in diversities in modelling framework. We critically review the current frontier models of market integration and highlight their weaknesses {{within the framework of}} competitive equilibrium theory and arbitrage dynamics. While the methods developed based on the former theoretical framework provide deeper equilibrium notions of markets functionality and implied efficiency, the study reveals that unaccounted time dynamics from <b>inter-market</b> <b>relations</b> can result in erroneous market outcomes and loss of crucial policy information. The extents to which techniques currently applied in dynamic frame are limited by non-linear complexities imposed by transactions costs and switching equilibrium conditions are also demonstrated. Sample splitting technique is suggested to address higher level nonlinearities imposed by switching equilibrium conditions and transactions cost...|$|E

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a new methodology to assess and quantify <b>inter-market</b> <b>relations.</b> The approach {{is based on the}} correlations between the market index, the index volatility, the market Index Cohesive Force and the meta-correlations (correlations between the intra-correlations.) We investigated the relations between six important world markets [...] U. S., U. K., Germany, Japan, China and India [...] from January 2000 until December 2010. We found that while the developed "western" markets (U. S., U. K., Germany) are highly correlated, the interdependencies between these markets and the developing "eastern" markets (India and China) are volatile and with noticeable maxima at times of global world events. The Japanese market switches "identity" [...] it switches between periods of high meta-correlations with the "western" markets and periods when it behaves more similarly to the "eastern" markets. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The methodological framework presented here provides a way to quantify the evolvement of interdependencies in the global market, evaluate a world financial network and quantify changes in the world inter market relations. Such changes can be used as precursors to the agitation of the global financial village. Hence, the new approach can help to develop a sensitive "financial seismograph" to detect early signs of global financial crises so they can be treated before they develop into worldwide events...|$|E

Here we present a new methodology to assess and quantify <b>inter-market</b> <b>relations.</b> The approach {{is based on the}} correlations between the market index, the index volatility, the market Index Cohesive Force and the meta-correlations (correlations between the intra-correlations.) We investigated the relations between six important world markets - U. S., U. K., Germany, Japan, China and India from January 2000 until December 2010. We found that while the developed ``western'' markets (U. S., U. K., Germany), are highly correlated, the interdependencies between these markets and the developing ``eastern'' markets (India and China) are very volatile and with noticeable maxima at times of global world events (2001 : 9 / 11 -attacks, 2003 : Iraq war, SARS, etc). The Japanese market switches ``identity'' - it switches between periods of high meta-correlations with the ``western'' markets and periods that it behaves more similar to the ``eastern'' markets. These and additional reported findings illustrate that the methodological framework provides a way to quantify the evolvement of interdependencies in the global market, to evaluate a world financial network and quantify changes in the world inter market relations. Such changes can be used as precursors to the agitation of the global financial village. Hence, the new approach can help to develop a sensitive ``financial seismograph'' to detect early signs of global financial crises so they can be treated before developed into world wide eventsfinancial markets, comovement, financial crisis, stock correlations, networks...|$|E
