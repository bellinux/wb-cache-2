5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled <b>hydroxyapatite</b> crystals) between the prisms (bundles of <b>hydroxyapatite</b> crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the <b>hydroxyapatite</b> crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|The tooth enamel is well {{preserved}} {{over most}} of the tooth. It consists of prisms—bundles of <b>hydroxyapatite</b> crystals—with an average diameter of 3.8m. Most are entirely surrounded by a sheath, but in some the sheath is open. The prisms are slightly curved toward the outer surface of the tooth. Between the prisms, and oriented at an angle of about 45° to them, are crystals of interprismatic material. On average, the prisms are 6.57μm apart, so that there are about 27,247 per mm2.|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} of sparingly soluble calcium phosphates on PHEMA hydrogels, both in vitro and in vivo, {{can be modified}} by the incorporation of citric acid into the PHEMA hydrogels. In the presence of citrate anions the formation of <b>hydroxyapatites</b> was prevented. The calcium phosphate deposits which formed in vitro on PHEMA were mainly monocalcium phosphate monohydrate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate. The types of deposits formed in vivo were quite different from those formed in vitro. The in vivo deposits formed on PHEMA were mostly <b>hydroxyapatites</b> deficient in calcium and hydroxyl ions. Citrate anions were also observed to prevent significantly the deposition in vivo of protein onto PHEMA hydrogels...|$|R
40|$|SiC {{nanotubes}} {{can become}} candidate reinforcement materials for dental and orthopedic implants {{due to their}} light weight and excellent mechanical properties. However, the development of bioactive SiC materials has not been reported. In this study, <b>hydroxyapatites</b> were found on SiC nanotubes treated with NaOH and subsequently HCl solution after soaking in simulated body fluid. On the other hand, <b>hydroxyapatites</b> did not deposit on as-received SiC nanotubes, the SiC nanotubes with NH 4 OH solution treatment and SiC bulk materials with NaOH and subsequently HCl solution treatment. Therefore, we succeeded {{in the development of}} bioactive SiC nanotubes by downsizing SiC materials to nanometer size and treating with NaOH and subsequently HCl solutions for the first time...|$|R
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the <b>hydroxyapatite</b> in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly <b>hydroxyapatite),</b> 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is <b>hydroxyapatite,</b> {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E
50|$|Kantam {{has made}} {{outstanding}} contributions towards {{the development of}} specially designed homogeneous/heterogeneous catalysts for chemical reactions with innovative scientific inputs to achieve highest possible atom economy. In particular, utilization of nanomaterials, hydrotalcites and <b>hydroxyapatites</b> as supports and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis and C-C / C-N coupling reactions is noteworthy.|$|R
30|$|TGA {{data of the}} {{obtained}} <b>hydroxyapatites</b> {{showed the}} decrease of weight below 200  °C which corresponds to loss of water adsorbed on the crystal surface (see Table  1 and Figure S 1 in Additional file 1). The second weight loss in the range 200 – 400  °C may be assigned to lattice water. The gradual loss of weight between 400 and 700  °C correspond to the decomposition of carbonates, common impurities of <b>hydroxyapatites</b> [29]. The data shows that the total water content is similar in the HA and Mn-HA samples (5.2 and 5.4  %, respectively) and in the SeO 3 -HA and the Mn-SeO 3 -HA samples (7.6 and 7.3  %, respectively). It can be assumed that the higher content of water in selenite-containing samples is due to their smaller crystal size and the high tendency to agglomerate.|$|R
40|$|Ti-addition to <b>hydroxyapatites</b> [Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 –HA] with 5. 0 wt. % Ti content, was {{successfully}} deposited on titanium substrate by mechanical alloying (MA) method. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) {{data indicated that}} some changes {{take place in the}} HA lattice {{as well as in the}} Ti substrate. The coating thickness of the as-synthesized sample was about 91. 1 μm. Ti incorporation into the apatite structure caused lattice shrinkage. The heat treated sample shows that dominant phase was HA up to 600 °C. The Ti-doped HA steadily transformed to β- and α-tricalcium phosphate at 800 °C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observations revealed cracks above the temperature of 600 °C. The presence of cracks could be due to the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion of Ti-doped HA and Ti-alloy substrate.

5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of <b>hydroxyapatite</b> crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends {{all the way through}} the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of <b>hydroxyapatite</b> crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the <b>hydroxyapatite</b> of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{series of}} <b>hydroxyapatites</b> {{containing}} Mg 2 + and 23 CO − are {{prepared by the}} precipita-tion method with independently varying concentrations of 23 CO − and Mg 2 +. All the compounds are characterized by infrared spectra (IR); powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and elemental analy-sis. The physical analysis {{results show that the}} prepared compounds are pure B-type carbonate apatite. The presence of Mg 2 + and 23 CO − in the apatite cause the following effects on its physical properties: a decrease in a-dimension but no changes in c-dimension and a decrease in crystallin-ity as shown in XDR patterns and IR spectra. The results of the chemical analysis allow us to pre-dict the predominant substitution mechanisms for the 23 CO − and the Mg 2 + incorporations in the calcium <b>hydroxyapatites</b> and to calculate their relative contributions x, y and z...|$|R

5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel <b>hydroxyapatite</b> into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{reasoning}} stating that <b>hydroxyapatite</b> orbital implants without a motility peg would yield a superior artiﬁcial eye motility, when similar surgical techniques are used unpegged porous (<b>hydroxyapatite)</b> enucleation implants and donor sclera-covered nonporous (acrylic) spherical enucleation implants yield comparable artiﬁcial eye motility. In two studies {{there were no}} differences in maximum amplitude between <b>hydroxyapatite</b> and acrylic or silicone spherical enucleation implants, thus indicating that the implant material itself may not have a bearing on implant movement as long as the muscles are attached directly or indirectly to the implant and the implant is not pegged.|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} of a bisphosphonate bone resorption inhibitor (Zoledronate) with calcium deficient <b>hydroxyapatites</b> (CDAs) was studied {{as a potential}} route to local drug delivery systems active against bone resorption disorders. A simple mathematical model of the Zoledronate–CDA interaction was designed that correctly described the adsorption of Zoledronate onto CDAs. The resulting Zoledronate-loaded materials were found to release the drug in different phosphate-containing media, with a satisfactory agreement between experimental data and the values predicted from the model...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Na+- and CO 32 [...] {{containing}} <b>hydroxyapatites</b> (NCAps) and K+- and CO 32 [...] containing <b>hydroxyapatites</b> (KCAps) {{were prepared}} by the hydrolysis of monetite in solutions with independently varied CO 32 - and alkalimetal (M(+)) concentration. The chemical and physical analysis results show that both the CO 32 - and the M(+) incorporation in apatite can affect {{the dimensions of the}} hexagonal lattice. From the composition of the unit cell of these apatites, the contributions of the substitution mechanisms for the incorporation of CO 32 - and M(+) could be calculated. Generally, the contributions of the predominant mechanisms, (Ca 2 ++PO 43 -+OH- V-Ca+CO 32 -+V-OH) and (Ca 2 ++PO 43 - M(+) +CO 32 -) with V-X a vacancy on a regular X lattice site, vary as can be expected {{on the basis of the}} variation of the driving force in the hydrolysis solution. Their behavior seems to suppress the appearance of the less stable mechanisms: (Ca 2 ++OH- M(+) +V-OH) for the NCAps and (Ca 2 ++ 2 PO(4) (3 -) V-Ca+ 2 CO(3) (2 -)) for the KCAps. This suggests that, although there is no intrinsic coupling between the fundamental substitution mechanisms, an indirect correlation can occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{biocompatibility}} and bioactivity {{properties of}} <b>hydroxyapatites</b> (HAs) modified through lithium addition were investigated. <b>Hydroxyapatites</b> obtained from bovine bone were mixed with lithium carbonate (Li), in {{the proportions of}} 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 00, and 2. 00 %[*]wt, and sintered at 900 °, 1000 °, 1100 °, 1200 °, and 1300 °C, creating LiHA samples. The osteoblast culture behavior was assessed {{in the presence of}} these LiHA compositions. The cellular interactions were analyzed by evaluating the viability and cellular proliferation, ALP production and collagen secretion. The cytotoxic potential was investigated through measurement of apoptosis and necrosis induction. The process of cellular attachment {{in the presence of the}} product of dissolution of LiHA, was evaluated trough fluorescence analysis. The physical characteristics of these materials and their cellular interactions were examined with SEM and EDS. The results of this study indicate that the LiHA ceramics are biocompatible and have variable bioactivities, which can be tailored by different combinations of the concentration of lithium carbonate and the sintering temperature. Our findings suggest that LiHA 0. 25 %[*]wt, sintered at 1300 °C, combines the necessary physical and structural qualities with favorable biocompatibility characteristics, achieving a bioactivity that seems to be adequate for use as a bone implant material...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructive {{surgery is}} {{presently}} {{struggling with the}} problem of infections located within implantation biomaterials. Of course, the best antibacterial protection is antibiotic therapy. However, oral antibiotic therapy is sometimes ineffective, while administering an antibiotic at the location of infection is often associated with an unfavourable ratio of dosage efficiency and toxic effect. Thus, the present study aims to find a new factor which may improve antibacterial activity while also presenting low toxicity to the human cells. Such factors are usually implemented along with the implant itself and may {{be an integral part of}} it. Many recent studies have focused on inorganic factors, such as metal nanoparticles, salts, and metal oxides. The advantages of inorganic factors include the ease with which they can be combined with ceramic and polymeric biomaterials. The following review focuses on <b>hydroxyapatites</b> substituted with ions with antibacterial properties. It considers materials that have already been applied in regenerative medicine (e. g., <b>hydroxyapatites</b> with silver ions) and those that are only at the preliminary stage of research and which could potentially be used in implantology or dentistry.
