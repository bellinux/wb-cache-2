40|$|Abstract. Wepropose a {{numerical}} procedure to extend to <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> the acoustic far-field pattern (FFP) when measured in only few observation angles. The reconstruction procedure is a multi-step technique that combines a total variation regularized itera-tive method {{with the standard}} Tikhonov regularized pseudo-inversion. The proposed approach distinguishes itself from existing solution methodologies by using an exact representation of the total variation which is crucial for the stability and robustness of Newton algorithms.

5000|$|In 1968, Leitz {{responded to}} the critics of the non-TTL meter of the {{original}} Leicaflex by introducing its successor the Leicaflex SL with a TTL meter. The SL designation in the name was an abbreviation of [...] "Selective Light", the name chosen by Leitz for its implementation of TTL metering. This system metered a limited area represented by the viewfinder's central microprism spot. At a time when SLR manufacturers were divided between those embracing TTL metering at <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> (such as Nikon and Konica), and those with mounts which permitted only stop-down metering (such as Pentax and Canon), Leitz chose to implement <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> metering on the Leicaflex SL.|$|R
40|$|A high {{resolution}} {{inverse synthetic aperture}} radar (ISAR) technique is presented using modified Doppler history based motion compensation. To this purpose, a novel wideband ISAR system is developed that accommodates parametric processing over extended aperture length.

It is dedicated to wide aperture ISAR imaging and exhibits robust performance against unstable targets having non-linear motions. We demonstrate that the Doppler histories of the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> ISAR echoes from disturbed targets are efficiently retrieved with good fitting models. Experiments have been conducted on real aircraft targets and the feasibility of the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> ISAR processing is verified through the acquisition of high resolution ISAR imagery...|$|R

They use a regularized Newton algorithm where the total variation of the FFP is incorporated as a regularization term. The third step consists in applying the standard Tikhonov regularization technique to recover the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> of the FFP from the previously extended field.

2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working <b>aperture</b> and <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> when pressed a second time.|$|R

40|$|Partially {{coherent}} migration {{reduces the}} spurious details introduced by velocity macro-model imperfections. In a partially coherent migration, instead of summing coherently over the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> to achieve maximum lateral resolution, (i) a coherent stack is performed over a limited window width, and then (ii) {{the collection of}} coherent stacks for different windows along the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> are summed incoherently to produce an amplitude value for each output point. Amplitude accuracy of a migration is improved with some sacrifice in spatial (lateral) resolution. A parameter in partially coherent migration is the running coherent window width, which accounts for the spatial correlation of errors in the velocity model. The coherent window width controls the trade-off between signal-to-noise and lateral resolution.

50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at <b>full</b> <b>aperture.</b> For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at <b>full</b> <b>aperture,</b> retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|R
40|$|The {{detectability}} of an {{interference signal}} {{will depend on}} the visibility of the fringes. Re-solved sources will have low visibility in any case, and it is important to minimize losses of visibility caused by atmospheric or instrumental degradation. In the visible spectral range, apertures will have to be limited to a few 10 's of centimeters without adaptive optics, and still will suer a signicant visibility degradation. In the infrared the <b>full</b> <b>apertures</b> can be used with reduced visibility. The use of visible light for fringe tracking will be limited by the small apertures which can be used without AO. Adaptive optics of low order (for the infrared) to moderate order (for the visible) can greatly increase the visibility transfer function of the array, allowing use of the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> in the visible. Laser beacons are required for the array to achieve its ultimate performance limits...|$|R
40|$|A method using subapertures {{that are}} prefocused {{near the middle}} of the region of {{interest}} is proposed as a substitute for composite focusing commonly used in abdominal ultrasound imaging. In that method M transmit zones are stitched together in order to achieve close to dynamic transmit focusing. The depth of focus of each zone is proportional to the inverse square of the aperture D, and the focused region is approximately M times that. In the proposed method, the aperture is divided into non-overlapping subapertures of size D/N. Each subaperture transmits a pre-focused beam with dynamic focusing on the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> on reception. Data from the subapertures is combined using synthetic aperture processing. The depth of focus for each subaperture is N*N times that of the <b>full</b> <b>aperture.</b> Thus the equivalent of composite focusing with M=N*N zones is achieved with N subapertures. Thus a framerate increase of N is achieved. In addition to the increase in framerate, the focusing is of more uni [...] ...|$|R
