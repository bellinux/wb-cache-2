40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic approach for switching multiple reference models, within the Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) framework, {{in response to}} {{major changes in the}} plant operating conditions. Following a rule base, the fuzzy switching scheme effectively monitors changes in operating conditions or such drastic changes in plant. A fuzzy inference engine then fires appropriate rules, which gives a fuzzified output value. Defuzzification <b>is</b> then <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> the reference model in a predefined domain. The whole process is conducted on line, monitoring the plant auxiliary inputs at selected control intervals. The main contribution of the paper is that the proposed fuzzy switching scheme can <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> online and <b>is</b> very well suitable for multi modal jump systems. Unlike, static multiple model algorithms for switching (non-interacting individual model-based filters) or switching dynamic algorithms (susceptible to numerical overflow), this scheme provides an interactive multiple model environment with soft switching. The scheme is computationally feasible, effective and efficient. The proposed scheme is applied to an example system with disturbed model parameters to show its effectiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{exchange}} of hydrogen and deuterium {{is used to}} determine metal surface areas of solid catalysts. The measurements are carried out in situ, i. e. no transfer of the catalyst from the catalytic reactor to a probing chemisorption device is necessary. This makes the method suitable for measurements at any instant of catalyst activation or kinetic testing. The principle of operation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> gas <b>switches</b> from H 2 to D 2 (deuterium) at various hydrogen partial pressures under dynamic flow conditions using Ar as balance. When switching the gas, D 2 reacts with the adsorbed H atoms and with H 2 remaining in the gas phase, producing HD molecules. The exchange is followed mass spectrometrically. A linear relationship {{between the number of}} detected HD molecules and the hydrogen partial pressure is observed. The extrapolation to pH 2 = 0 gives access to the number of H atoms adsorbed on the catalyst surface before switching gases. Provided the hydrogen/ metal adsorption stoichiometry is known the specific surface area of the metal can be determined. This approach is methodically new and has been validated by comparing the surface areas of pure metallic Co samples (without any support) and their BET surface areas from measurements in the same experimental set-up.

For instance, in some simulations, {{a huge amount}} of phase equilibrium calculations is required (the {{most important part of the}} computational effort). Moreover, a single failure may cause significant error propagations leading to false solutions. Thus, it is imperative that calculation algorithms are efficient and highly robust. The most difficult regions in mixture phase envelopes are in the vicinity of singularities: critical points for flash {{calculations and}} the stability test limit locus for stability analysis. For these conditions, all algorithms have difficulties to converge. Traditionally, a number of successive substitution iterations (SSI) <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> before <b>switching</b> <b>to</b> the second-order Newton method (many SSI iteration may be required before <b>switch</b> very close <b>to</b> singularities). The Trust-Region method has the advantage of performing a Newton step whenever the Hessian is definite positive; otherwise, the Trust-Region corrects the Hessian matrix by adding a diagonal element to make it positive definite, thus a descent direction is guaranteed. The Trust-Region limits the solution within a trust-radius, which is updated automatically at each iteration level, depending on the quality of the quadratic approximation. If the function is convex, the trust-radius enables larger changes in iteration variables, otherwise restricted steps are used to ensure a progress towards the solution. The proposed Trust-Region algorithm, as well as a hybrid methodology that combines SSI, Newton and Trust-Region steps, are tested for multiphase flash calculations and stability analysis on a variety of mixtures involving hydrocarbon components, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, exhibiting complicated phase envelopes. The proposed method compares favorably to the widely used SSI-Newton methods with various independent variables. The more difficult a test point is, the more spectacular the algorithm acts from both efficiency and reliability perspectives. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Optical packet {{switching}} (OPS) {{is one of}} the more promising solutions for meeting the diverse needs of broadband networking applications of the future. By virtue of its small data traffic granularity as well as its nanoseconds switching speed, OPS can be used to provide connection-oriented or connectionless services for different groups of users with very different networking requirements. The optical buffer and the switch fabric are two of the most important components in an OPS router. In this research, novel designs for the optical buffer and switch fabric are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In particular, an optical buffer that is based on a folded-path delay-line tree architecture will be discussed. This buffer is the most compact non-recirculating optical delay line buffer to date, and it uses an array of high-speed ON-OFF optical reflectors to dynamically reconfigure its delay within several nanoseconds. A major part of this research is devoted to the design and performance optimization of these high-speed reflectors. Simulations and measurements are used to compare different reflector designs as well as to determine their optimal operating conditions. Another important component in the OPS router is the switch fabric, and it <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> space <b>switching</b> for the optical packets. Optical switch fabrics are used to overcome the limitations imposed by conventional electronic switch fabrics: high power consumption and dependency on the modulation format and bit-rate of the signals. Currently, only those fabrics that are based on the broadcast-and-select architecture can provide truly non-blocking multicast services to all input ports. However, a major drawback of these fabrics is that they are implemented using a large number of optical gates based on semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA). This results in large component count and high energy consumption. In this research, a new multicast-capable switch fabric which does not require any SOA gates is proposed. This fabric relies on a passive all-optical gate that is based on the Four-wave mixing (FWM) wavelength conversion process in a highly-nonlinear fiber. By using this new switch architecture, a significant reduction in component count can be expected. Ph. D.

40|$|The subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) and the BOP control system {{were the most}} important contributors to the Macondo accident in April 2010. A BOP is a large valve system used during the drilling phase; to seal, control, and monitor oil and gas wells. As a consequence of the Macondo accident, improved methods for reliability assessment of BOPs are now required. Over the years, several subsea BOP reliability studies have <b>been</b> <b>performed,</b> where technical solutions and potential failures are thoroughly investigated. As a result of the information gained, both maintenance and reliability of the BOP systems have improved. Despite overall improvements, the BOP is still a main contributor to risk and downtime in the drilling phase. A deeper look into the reliability reports reveals the control system of the BOP as the root of the majority of failures. Most subsea BOPs are equipped with a multiplex control system with a combination of electronics and hydraulics, used to operate the different functions of the BOP. Despite the high level of redundancy, several sections of the system are subject to critical system failures. To prevent BOP failures, national regulations and standards have been developed in several countries. Most of the national requirements are similar, but there are also differences. These similarities and differences are illustrated in this study through a detailed comparison between the relevant regulations and standards in Norway and the United States, with respect to general-, design- and operational BOP requirements. The main focus of this study is the multiplex subsea BOP control system. The potential critical failures of this system are identified and analyzed in a detailed failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). This analysis shows that the shuttle valve, the pod selector valve, the subsea accumulators, and the fluid reservoir are the most safety-critical parts of the control system. The BOP control system has several redundant elements and these may be vulnerable to common-cause failures. The potential common-cause failures are examined in this study and found to have a significant influence on the reliability of the control system. Improving current reliability assessments of subsea BOP control systems requires a thorough review of both the system and the previously used methods. In this study, a fault tree analysis <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> reveal the relevant failure combinations. To improve reliability calculations provided by common fault tree analysis programs, a post-processing of the minimal cut sets in a spreadsheet (i. e., Excel) is proposed to cover the effect of common-cause failures. The method gives a more conservative and accurate approximation compared to the existing methods. An event tree analysis <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> cover the <b>switching</b> phases between the two pods, showing the time dependencies that can influence the consequences. This type of switching cannot be modeled in the fault tree, therefore, recommendations to apply the event tree analysis to similar situations to get a more accurate reliability estimate, is given.

However, in an expanded analysis of the subsea BOP control system, such components will be involved, therefore, adding the contribution from the proof test coverage factor to components prone to imperfect testing, is recommended...|$|R

The main results of this work are presented below: (1) 3 - 5 -year-olds’ cognitive flexibility develops with age, yet its development is not of the same speed in extra-dimensional switch tasks and inter-dimensional reversal tasks. 3 -year-olds manifest some cognitive flexibility, but their performance is significantly worse than that of 4 - and 5 -year-olds. For the 3 -year-olds, in reversal tasks, although 80 % of the children passed the post-switch phrase in color task; less then 60 % children passed the post-switch phrase in shape, number and direction tasks. In extra-dimensional tasks, 3 -year-olds performance is worse than that in the reversal tasks. Less than 50 % of the children passed the tasks. Children’s cognitive flexibility develops fast from 3 -year-olds to 4 -year-olds. Both 4 -year-olds and 5 -year-olds demonstrate high flexibility without significant difference between them. (2) Children’s flexibility in the conceptual domains of shape, color, number and direction follows different developing patterns. In inter-dimensional reversal tasks, 3 -year-olds’ performance is not the same in the 4 conceptual domains, but the difference among the domains is insignificant in 4 -and- 5 -year-olds. In extra-dimensional switching tasks, children’s performance on the 4 domain tasks is significantly different from one another in 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-olds. (3) The way the stimuli are presented affects children’s {{development of}} cognitive flexibility. In inter-dimensional reversal tasks, 3 -year-olds’ performance in consecutive presentation is significantly better than that in simultaneous presentation. 4 - and 5 -year-olds’ performance in the 2 presentations is not significantly different from each other. In extra-dimensional switch tasks, 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-olds’ performance in the consecutive presentation is not significantly better than that in the simultaneous presentation (4) 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-olds’ self-issued labeling aids their performance on the switching tasks. Children’ performance in the labeling condition is significantly better than that of no labeling. (5) 3 - 5 -year-olds’ cognitive flexibility is highly correlated with their working memory and inhibition. Children’ development of cognitive flexibility is a process that involves activation of working memory and inhibition, in which the complexity of the task also plays a role. 认知灵活性是指个体根据具体的情况从一种解决问题方法转换到另外一种方法的能力，是个体适应环境变化的一种重要能力。据认为认知灵活性是执行功能的三个主要成分之一，对儿童认知灵活性的发展研究已经成为当前国际认知发展领域的一个热门话题。研究者曾以演绎任务和归纳任务等不同的实验范式探查儿童认知灵活性的发展，并提出了各种不同的理论主张。但这些理论分别从外部课题任务条件或内部心理过程解释幼儿认知灵活性的发展机制，对儿童认知灵活性的发展过程的研究还不够系统、深入。为此，本研究以 3 - 5 岁幼儿为研究对象，通过系统地操纵和改变课题任务条件，简化实验程序，降低任务难度以探查幼儿认知灵活性的发展过程和特点，挖掘幼儿的认知潜力，揭示其发展机制和促进认知灵活性发展的内外部条件。所得研究结果不仅能在理论上加深对执行功能和其发展机制的认识，而且能在教育实践上为促进幼儿认知灵活性发展提供理论和方法上的指导。 本研究在演绎任务范式下，采用图片分类任务对幼儿做个别测查。研究内容包括刺激物属性的一维度、二维度转换，刺激物逐一、同时两种呈现方式，刺激物选自形状、颜色、数量和方位等不同概念范畴内的转换任务以及对刺激物特点的标记和不标记，从而揭示刺激物的不同维度数量、呈现方式、概念任务类型和语言标记对幼儿认知灵活性发展的影响。本研究还通过相关研究探查了幼儿的分类能力、工作记忆加工能力、抑制能力与幼儿认知灵活性的关系。 在本研究条件下，我们得到以下研究结果： (1) 3 - 5 岁幼儿的认知灵活性呈年龄发展趋势，从刺激物的一维度规则转换发展到对刺激物的二维度规则转换。 3 岁幼儿认知灵活性刚刚开始发展，其成绩显著低于 4 岁和 5 岁成绩。在刺激物一维度转换条件下，仅在逐一呈现颜色任务上成绩较高，通过率为 80 %，在其他任务上的通过率都未超过 60 %。在刺激物二维转换条件下，幼儿的成绩更差。逐一呈现时，幼儿在各任务上的通过率都不超过 50 %。从 3 岁到 4 岁，幼儿的认知灵活性呈现快速发展趋势，而 4 岁组和 5 岁组幼儿认知灵活性水平差异不显著。在刺激物一维度转换条件下， 4 岁、 5 岁幼儿表现出较高的灵活性水平，各概念任务上的通过率都超过 80 %；在二维转换条件下，幼儿在各个任务上的通过率有所下降，但 5 岁幼儿在逐一呈现条件下的形状－颜色任务上保持了较高的灵活性 (90 %) ，在其他两项任务 (形状－数量、形状－上下方位) 的通过率也都达到 63 %。 (2) 不同概念任务类型是影响幼儿认知灵活性水平的一个重要因素，其影响作用依任务的维度数量和被试年龄而变化。一维度转换任务中， 3 岁幼儿在不同概念任务上的成绩差异显著，表现出发展的不同步，而 4 岁和 5 岁幼儿在这些任务上的成绩差异不显著；在二维转换任务中，幼儿在 4 种概念任务上的成绩差异均显著。 (3) 刺激物的呈现方式是影响幼儿认知灵活性水平的一个重要因素，其影响作用依转换的维度数量和被试年龄而变化。在一维转换任务中， 3 岁幼儿在逐一呈现时的成绩优于同时呈现时的成绩， 4 岁和 5 岁儿童在两种呈现方式下的成绩差异不显著；在二维转换任务中，各年龄组幼儿均是逐一呈现时的成绩优于同时呈现条件时的成绩。 (4) 幼儿自己对刺激物的维度特征做语言标记能促进幼儿认知灵活性的发展，并且这种促进作用带有普遍性，不受维度数量、呈现方式和任务概念类型的影响。 (5) 3 - 5 岁幼儿的认知灵活性水平既与任务的结构复杂性有关，也与个体的分类能力、工作记忆加工能力、抑制能力有关...|$|R
