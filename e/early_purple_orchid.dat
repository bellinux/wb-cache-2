2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{adjacent}} to the pond is Nightingale Wood. This is a cool, shady haven, containing many different tree species and is a valuable site for <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} part has mature coppiced hornbeams together with ash and field maple. There are breeding birds such as great spotted woodpeckers and sparrowhawks. The site also has open rides which provide a habitat for insects such as white admiral butterflies and wild flowers including bluebells, wood anemones and <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids.</b> There are many ponds which support aquatic invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{an ancient}} coppice wood on chalky boulder clay. It is mainly {{hornbeam}} with other trees such as pedunculate oak, ash and field maple. The understorey is dominated by bluebells and dog's mercury. Ramsons are common, and there are occasional orchids.

50|$|The 65 {{roadside}} nature reserves {{maintained by}} the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, under a local-government scheme dating back to 1960, include one that covers both verges of the Braceby-Walcot road south-east of the village. The list of plants found at this reserve runs to 250 species. Notable among them are <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids</b> (Orchis mascula), common orchids (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and cowslips (primula veris).|$|R
50|$|The site is {{hornbeam}} woodland, and it {{is divided}} into sections which are coppiced every sixteen years. Older trees are gnarled in shape as a result. In spring there are bluebells and wild daffodils on the forest floor, and other plants such as wood anemone and <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids</b> are indicators that the woodland is ancient. Breeding birds include nuthatch, great spotted woodpecker and treecreepers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the higher}} levels grow {{mountain}} arnica and maiden pinks, and in the valley areas western marsh <b>orchids</b> and <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids.</b> Near the Jägersburg near Odershausen are found a few rare dwarf beeches. In cool and damp stream dales grows the rare, highly poisonous common monkshood. In light beech and oak forests with limy subsoil is found the martagon lily. In a few places are found great stands of the rare wild daffodil.|$|R
50|$|Other orchid species found growing under beech at {{this site}} include Bird's-nest Orchid, <b>Early</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Orchid</b> and Narrow-leaved Helleborine; Spurge-laurel is also found.|$|E
50|$|These {{adjacent}} woods {{are mainly}} coppiced small-leaved lime, {{with a small}} stream and many flowering plants, including wood anemones, sweet violets, spurge laurel, stinking iris and <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{calcareous}} {{species such}} as cowslip, quaking grass and dwarf thistle thrive in the reserve's old quarry and spoil heaps. The <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchid</b> is also common in some areas.|$|E
50|$|Located at , {{this site}} of coppiced ancient {{woodland}} includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice {{on the hill}} sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by Dog's Mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant Herb Paris (Paris quadrifolia), Toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), Twayblade and <b>Early</b> <b>Purple</b> <b>Orchids</b> (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, Wild Daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} {{dominated}} on its southern side {{by a large}} hill, the southern slope of which and the quarry at its western end form the Uphill Cliff Site of Special Scientific Interest, notable for its species-rich calcareous grassland. It consists of species-rich calcareous grassland and rock-face situated on Carboniferous Limestone. Steeper banks and knolls in the grassland have a flora which includes orchids, Somerset Hair Grass (Koeleria vallesiana), and Honewort (Trinia glauca), and the Goldilocks Aster (Galatella linosyris) along with several species of butterfly and Weevil (Curculionoidea). The hill and Walborough common, which are adjacent to each other, are local nature reserves making a total area of 38.14 ha. There are a range of flowers including cowslip, primrose and green-winged orchid. The Salt marsh has sea barley, slender hare's-ear and sea clover and limestone grassland with Somerset hair-grass, honewort, green-winged and <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids.</b> These attract redshank, dunlin, shelduck, black-tailed godwit, skylark, linnet, rock and meadow pipit.|$|R
40|$|Deer {{can have}} an adverse impact on {{woodland}} vegetation and simplify vertical structure by selectively browsing on herbs, shrubs and young trees. Vegetation changes brought about by deer browsing are also detrimental to some vertebrate and invertebrate woodland fauna. Without appropriate management, deer populations will impose long-term changes on the composition of native woodlands. Available data suggest that densities of deer in upland habitats {{should be in the}} region of 4 – 7 per km 2 to ensure adequate regeneration and to protect sensitive flora and fauna. Further data are needed for lowland habitats. Recommendations for establishing effective deer management and tree protection measures are given. flowering plants are also now known to be susceptible to deer. Bluebells (Hyacynthoides non-scripta) and dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis) can be depleted by muntjac browsing[3, 4] and oxlips (Primula elatior) by red deer[5]. Muntjac also feed on <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids</b> (Orchis mascula), common spotted orchids (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), wood anemones (Anemone nemorosa) and ladies smock (Cardamine pratensis), and reduce pollination and reproductive success in lords and ladies (Arum maculatum) [3, 4, 6]...|$|R

5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and <b>early</b> <b>purple</b> <b>orchids</b> (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|R
