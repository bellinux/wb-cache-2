40|$|Abstract-The {{provision}} of security services in <b>fieldbus</b> <b>systems</b> will gain in importance in the coming years. A need for such services is easiest seen in <b>fieldbus</b> <b>systems</b> for building automation as they give ample opportunities For mischievous adversaries to tamper with.

40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the vertical integration of <b>fieldbus</b> <b>systems.</b> It presents a generic technique to expose data and control of <b>fieldbus</b> <b>systems</b> in a semantically rich way to applications located at the level of operational management. To provide a high degree of interoperability between the operational level and different <b>fieldbus</b> <b>systems</b> we utilize standardized techniques such as XML, HTTP, and Web services which can be deployed independently of the platform. The proposed service is based on the interface file system for TTP/A smart transducers. The defined interface provides high level abstractions appropriate for the integration into business applications and considers the latency introduced by the internet protocols. The operations of the service are automatically generated from meta-data descriptions of the smart transducers and their combination into larger clusters. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the success}} of {{wireless}} technologies in consumer electronics, standard wireless technologies are envisioned for the deployment in industrial environments as well. Industrial applications involving mobile subsystems or just the desire to save cabling make wireless technologies attractive. Nevertheless, these applications often have stringent requirements on reliability and timing. In wired environments, timing and reliability are well catered for by <b>fieldbus</b> <b>systems</b> (which are a mature technology designed to enable communication between digital controllers and the sensors and actuators interfacing to a physical process). When wireless links are included, reliability and timing requirements are significantly more difficult to meet, due to the adverse properties of the radio channels.

40|$|Abstract — The idea {{of having}} a {{wireless}} PROFIBUS is appealing, since this can bring benefits like reduced cabling need and mobile stations to the factory floor. But unfortunately wireless transmission is error-prone, which affects the timeliness and reliability behavior users expect from a <b>fieldbus</b> <b>system</b> (hard real-time). In this paper we compare two different approaches for the medium access control and link layer of a wireless PROFIBUS system with respect to their so-called real-time performance in the presence of transmission errors. Specifically, we compare the existing PROFIBUS MAC and link layer protocol with a simple round-robin protocol. It shows up that round-robin delivers significantly better real-time performance than the PROFIBUS protocol under bursty error conditions. In a second step we propose three add-ons to round-robin and we show that they further increase the real-time performance of round-robin. The add-ons take certain characteristics of the wireless medium into account...|$|E

A “smart node ” consisted of a personal computer, containing custom control software, is attached to the above installation and executes the control process program. The controlled parameter is the indoor thermal comfort of the installation zone expressed by the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) function. The software deployed on the “smart node ” makes use of the measurements collected from the sensors and gives the appropriate output values to the actuators using various fuzzy logic algorithms. By application of past studies results, a minimal Fuzzy PD thermal comfort controller is implemented and evaluated.
