5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess water off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or <b>emptied</b> <b>of</b> equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E

In subsequent operations, the vagotomy group underwent either antrectomy or pyloroplasty, and the antrectomy and pyloroplasty groups were vagotomized. Vagotomy significantly inhibited the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> both liquids and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact.

5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were <b>emptied</b> <b>of</b> people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover <b>emptied</b> <b>of</b> their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to stick it out on the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{proximal}} and distal stomach in the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> solids and liquids from the stomach remains unclear. We have used a dual isotope technique to quantify proximal and distal stomach <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> a solid (100 g of 99 mTc labelled liver/ground beef) liquid (either 200 ml of normal saline (eight subjects) or 25 % dextrose (seven subjects) labelled with 113 mIn-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) mixed meal. A manometric catheter simultaneously measured antral, pyloric, and duodenal motor activity. The liquid component dispersed rapidly throughout the stomach and emptied after a minimal lag period. The <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the 25 % dextrose was delayed compared with the saline. This delay was associated with increased retention of the liquid in the distal stomach, {{a significant increase in}} localised phasic pyloric contractions, and a suppression of antral contractions. The solid component initially resided wholly within a proximal stomach reservoir area. Solids then redistributed from proximal to distal stomach during the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> liquid from the stomach. Dextrose delayed gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> solids compared with saline by increasing the solid lag period and retention in {{the proximal}} stomach. There {{was no significant difference between}} saline and dextrose meals in the distal stomach retention of solid or in the linear rate <b>of</b> <b>emptying</b> after the lag period. We conclude that, contrary to general opinion, the proximal stomach plays an important role in the control <b>of</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> solids while the distal stomach is important in the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> nutrient liquids...|$|R
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be <b>emptied</b> <b>of</b> all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

40|$|The gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> maltose, sucrose, lactose and {{lactulose}} {{was compared}} in young adult rats with ontogenic lactase deficiency. Eight animals were employed for each sugar meal at each time of study (total {{number of animals}} = 192). Each animal received a test meal consisting of a solution of the sugar (100 mg/ml) and phenol red as marker and gastric retention was measured at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min after orogastric infusion of the test meal. Gastric retention was determined by measuring the concentration of the marker in the residual test meal recovered from the stomach after killing the animal. There {{was no difference between}} the gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> lactose and lactulose. The gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> maltose was significantly slower during the initial 30 min and the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> sucrose was identical to that of maltose only at 5 min and could not be distinguished from that of lactose and lactulose at later times.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effects of posture on gastric emptying, intragastric distribution, and satiation after a meal containing oil and aqueous phases in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Five patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) consumed 60 ml 99 mTc-labeled (V) -thiocyanate olive oil and 290 ml 113 mIn-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid soup while sitting and while lying in the left lateral decubitus position. Hunger and fullness before and after the meal were recorded. Results were compared with those obtained in 11 normal volunteers. In both postures <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil was faster (P < 0. 01) in CF patients. <b>Emptying</b> <b>of</b> the aqueous phase was faster (P < 0. 01) in CF patients in the decubitus position. In normal subjects there was no overall difference in <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil between the two postures, whereas <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the aqueous phase was delayed (P < 0. 01) in the decubitus position. In CF patients <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil was faster (P < 0. 01) in the decubitus position, and <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the aqueous phase was only slightly faster (P < 0. 05) in the sitting position.
