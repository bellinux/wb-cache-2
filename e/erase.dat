5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure <b>Erase</b> in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure <b>erase</b> is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the drive back to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure <b>Erase</b> {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure <b>Erase</b> command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure <b>erase.</b>|$|E

40|$|Learning by <b>erasing</b> {{means the}} process of {{eliminating}} potential hypotheses from further consideration thereby converging to the least hypothesis never eliminated and this one must be {{a solution to the}} actual learning problem. The present paper deals with learnability by <b>erasing</b> of indexed families $L$ of languages from both positive data as well as positive and negative data. This refers to the following scenario. A family $L$ of target languages and a hypothesis space for it are specified. The learner is fed eventually all positive examples (all labeled examples) of an unknown target language L chosen from $L$. The target language L is learned by <b>erasing</b> if the learner <b>erases</b> some set of possible hypotheses and the least hypothesis never <b>erased</b> correctly describes L. The capabilities of learning by <b>erasing</b> are investigated in dependence on the requirement of what sets of hypotheses have to be or may be, <b>erased,</b> and in dependence of the choice of the hypothesis space. Class preserving learning by <b>erasing</b> ($L$ has to be learned w. r. t. some suitably chosen enumeration of all and only the languages from $L$), class comprising learning by <b>erasing</b> ($L$ has to be learned w. r. t. some hypothesis space containing at least all the languages from $L$), and absolute learning by <b>erasing</b> ($L$ has to be learned w. r. t. all class preserving hypothesis spaces for $L$) are distinguished. For all these models of learning by <b>erasing</b> necessary and sufficient conditions for learnability are presented. A complete picture of all separations and coincidences of the learning by <b>erasing</b> models is derived. Learning by <b>erasing</b> is compared with standard models of language learning such as learning in the limit, finite learning and learning without overgeneralization. The exact location of these types within the hierarchy of the learning by <b>erasing</b> models is established...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLearning by <b>erasing</b> {{means the}} process of {{eliminating}} potential hypotheses from further consideration thereby converging to the least hypothesis never eliminated. This hypothesis must be {{a solution to the}} actual learning problem. The capabilities of learning by <b>erasing</b> are investigated in relation to two factors: the choice of the overall hypothesis space itself and what sets of hypotheses must or may be <b>erased.</b> These learning capabilities are studied for two fundamental kinds of objects to be learned, namely languages and functions. For learning languages by <b>erasing,</b> the case of learning indexed families is investigated. A complete picture of all separations and coincidences of the considered models is derived. Learning by <b>erasing</b> is compared with standard models of language learning such as learning in the limit, finite learning and conservative learning. The exact location of these types within the hierarchy of the models of learning by <b>erasing</b> is established. Necessary and sufficient conditions for language learning by <b>erasing</b> are presented. For learning functions by <b>erasing,</b> mainly the case of learning minimal programs is studied. Various relationships and differences between the considered types of function learning by <b>erasing</b> and also to standard function learning are exhibited. In particular, these types are explored in Kolmogorov numberings that can be viewed as natural Gödel numberings of the partial recursive functions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for function learning by <b>erasing</b> are derived...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the challenge of}} operating a reliable bit that can be rapidly <b>erased.</b> We find that both <b>erasing</b> and reliability times are non-monotonic in the underlying friction, leading to a trade-off between <b>erasing</b> speed and bit reliability. Fast erasure is possible {{at the expense of}} low reliability at moderate friction, and high reliability comes at the expense of slow erasure in the underdamped and overdamped limits. Within a given class of bit parameters and control strategies, we define 'optimal' designs of bits that meet the desired reliability and <b>erasing</b> time requirements with the lowest operational work cost. We find that optimal designs always saturate the bound on the <b>erasing</b> time requirement, but can exceed the required reliability time if critically damped. The non-trivial geometry of the reliability and <b>erasing</b> time scales allows us to exclude large regions of parameter space as suboptimal. We find that optimal designs are either critically damped or close to critical damping under the <b>erasing</b> procedure...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} Random <b>Erasing,</b> a {{new data}} augmentation method for training the {{convolutional neural network}} (CNN). In training, Random <b>Erasing</b> randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and <b>erases</b> its pixels with random values.

Random <b>Erasing</b> is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random <b>Erasing</b> is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.
