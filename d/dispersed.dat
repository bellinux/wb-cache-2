40|$|A large {{variety of}} food systems is treated in <b>dispersing</b> {{operations}} {{in order to}} generate a homogeneous <b>disperse</b> microstructure which allows to adjust structure-related quality characteristics of the final products. For fine <b>dispersing</b> of <b>disperse</b> structures like solid particles/biological cells, emulsion drops, gas cells and aggregates thereof, the volumetric power and energy inputs are the crucial integral processing parameters but are not sufficient in order to optimize the <b>dispersing</b> efficiency. The flow field characteristics are of additional importance. For most concentrated food systems containing a <b>disperse</b> phase, the <b>dispersing</b> flow field in any apparatus is laminar. However the ratio of shear and elongational laminar flow contributions influences the <b>dispersing</b> efficiency strongly. Beside <b>disperse</b> components most multiphase food systems contain also macromolecular stabilizing components in the continuous phase as well as surfactants at the interfaces. The various <b>disperse</b> and macromolecular components have in general different sensitivity to mechanical stresses acting in <b>dispersing</b> flows. Consequently, {{there is a need}} to optimize <b>dispersing</b> flow apparatus and adapt the stresses acting during processing in order to adjust the resulting microstructure. The most important structural characteristics for the <b>disperse</b> phase(s) are size, size distribution and shape which have a strong impact on the rheology of the fluid system and which are preferably focussed within the work reported here.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Disperse</b> dyes {{are common}} sensitizers, {{but are not}} {{currently}} included in the European baseline series. OBJECTIVES: To justify {{the inclusion of a}} textile dye mix in the European baseline patch test series. METHODS: A survey of the reported frequencies of contact allergy to textile dyes and textile dye mixes was performed by searching PubMed ([URL] last accessed 14 December 2014). The results from a multicentre study performed within the European Environmental Contact Dermatitis Research Group (EECDRG) and published in 2014 formed the final basis for the recommendation. RESULTS: The EECDRG study performed in Europe and the United States showed that 2. 1 - 6. 9 % of consecutively tested dermatitis patients reacted to a 6. 6 % wt/wt textile dye mix consisting of eight <b>disperse</b> dyes. The clinical relevance was ascertained in > 30 % of the positive cases. A high frequency of simultaneous sensitivity to <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3 (DO 3) and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) was seen. Active sensitization to the mix was not noted. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended to include a 6. 6 % textile dye mix consisting of eight <b>disperse</b> dyes in the European baseline series, even though one component, DO 3, may be superfluous, owing to its frequent cross-reactivity with PPD. Removal of DO 3 from the mix would need further study. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{spite of}} {{sporadic}} data {{pointing at the}} role of textile dyes as important contact allergens, only few studies have {{addressed the issue of}} the frequency of sensitization to textile dyes in populations of consecutive patients. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the prevalence of sensitization to <b>disperse</b> dyes, to investigate cross reactivity between azo dyes and para-amino compounds, to describe azo-dye-positive patients, and to study the correlation between clinical aspects and sensitization to different <b>disperse</b> dyes. METHODS: From January 1996 to December 2000, 6, 478 consecutive patients were tested with 7 textile dyes: <b>Disperse</b> Blue 124, <b>Disperse</b> Blue 106, <b>Disperse</b> Red 1, <b>Disperse</b> Yellow 3, <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3 (DO 3), para-aminoazobenzene (PAAB), and para-dimethylaminoazobenzene (PDAAB). RESULTS: Of the above, 437 patients were allergic. The most common sensitizers were <b>Disperse</b> Blue (DB) dyes and <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3. Both the clinical aspect and the localization of the lesions were unusual in a fair percentage of cases, especially in DB-positive subjects. Involvement of skin folds was observed in 27 % of <b>disperse</b> dye-positive patients, mainly comprising DB-sensitive women. Cross-reactivity between azo-dyes and paraphenylenediamine (PPD) was frequent in DO 3 -, PAAB-, and PDAAB-positive subjects, but not in DB-allergic ones. Moreover, cross reactions between DB 106 and DB 124 were observed in 59 % of DB 106 - and/or DB 124 -positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of <b>disperse</b> dye allergy is higher than generally estimated. Further studies, using routine diagnostic testing with <b>disperse</b> dyes, are needed to investigate whether this increasing trend is present outside of Europe...|$|R

40|$|Os azo corantes atualmente são considerados um assunto preocupante no que se refere à saúde pública e ambiental, pois quando lançados nos efluentes industriais contaminam o meio ambiente. Infelizmente, o método convencional de tratamento de efluentes têxteis, bem como de águas brutas que os recebem não são capazes de remover de maneira eficaz os corantes bem como sua toxicidade. Dentro deste contexto, este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a eficiência do tratamento de amostras aquosas por fotoeletrocatálise em comparação com a cloração convencional como método alternativo de degradação de azo corantes, usando os corantes <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1, <b>Disperse</b> Red 1 e <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 como modelo. Adicionalmente, foi avaliada a citotoxicidade dos corantes originais em condrócitos bovinos e células HepG 2 em cultura em monocamadas e 3 D. Para tanto, soluções desses corantes originais, clorados e fotoeletrocatalisados foram avaliadas utilizando ensaios de genotoxicidade/mutagenicidade, citotoxicidade e ecotoxicidade. Todos os corantes originais e clorados foram genotóxicos para as células HepG 2 no ensaio cometa. Para o ensaio com Salmonella, a cloração reduziu a mutagenicidade dos corantes para a linhagem YG 1041 e aumentou o efeito para a linhagem TA 98, exceto o <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 que teve a mutagenicidade reduzida para as duas linhagens após cloração. A fotoeletrocatálise removeu tanto a genotoxicidade quanto a mutagenicidade. Somente o <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 induziu apoptose pelo ensaio com anexina V, mas essa citotoxicidade foi removida após os tratamentos. Os corantes <b>Disperse</b> Red 1 e <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 foram tóxicos para D. similis enquanto somente o <b>Disperse</b> Red 1 foi tóxico para V. fischeri, sendo que os tratamentos por cloração e fotoeletrocatálise diminuíram a toxicidade apresentada. Os corantes <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 e <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 passaram a ser tóxicos para V. fischeri após cloração, sendo que a fotoeletrocatálise do <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 também gerou produtos tóxicos para esse organismo. Assim, embora seja um método de tratamento promissor, atenção deve ser dada na avaliação e aplicação da fotoeletrocatálise como um método alternativo à cloração. Os corantes originais <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 e <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 diminuíram a atividade mitocondrial dos condrócitos, sendo que o <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 também diminuiu a produção de lactato. Todos os corantes reduziram a atividade mitocondrial das células HepG 2 em monocamadas, ao passo que o <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 deixou de exercer esse efeito no cultivo em 3 D. Somente o <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 diminuiu a atividade de desidrogenases das células HepG 2 e tal efeito foi observado tanto no cultivo em monocamadas quanto em 3 D. The {{azo dyes}} are {{currently}} {{considered as a}} concern regarding the environmental and public health, since when released in industrial effluents they pollute the environment. Unfortunately, the conventional method of treatment of textile effluents {{is not able to}} effectively remove both dyes and their toxicity. Within this context, this study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the treatment of aqueous samples by photoelectrocatalysis compared to conventional chlorination as an alternative method of degradation of azo dyes, using the dyes <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1, <b>Disperse</b> Red 1 and <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 as a model. Additionally, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of the original dyes using HepG 2 cells and chondrocytes cultured in monolayer and in 3 D. To this end, solutions of these original dyes, chlorinated and photoelectrocatalysed were evaluated using tests of genotoxicity / mutagenicity, cytotoxicity and ecotoxicity. All the dyes, original and chlorinated, were genotoxic to HepG 2 cells in the comet assay. For the test with Salmonella, chlorination reduced the mutagenicity of the dyes for the YG 1041 strain and increased the effect for the TA 98 strain, except <b>Disperse</b> Red 13, which had the mutagenic effect reduced for both strains after chlorination. The photoelectrocatalysis removed both genotoxicity and mutagenicity. Only <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 induced apoptosis by annexin V assay, but this cytotoxicity was removed after treatment. The dye <b>Disperse</b> Red 1 and <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 were toxic to D. similis while only the <b>Disperse</b> Red 1 was toxic to V. fischeri, and the treatment by chlorination and photoelectrocatalysis decreased the toxicity showed. The dyes <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 and <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 began toxic to V. fischeri after chlorination, and the photoelectrocatalysis of the <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 generated toxic products for this organism. So, while it is a promising treatment method, attention should be given in the evaluation and application of photoelectrocatalysis as an alternative to chlorination. The dyes <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 and <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 decreased the mitochondrial activity of chondrocytes, and the dye <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 also decreased the production of lactate. All the dyes reduced the mitochondrial activity of the HepG 2 cells cultured in monolayer, while the <b>Disperse</b> Orange 1 did no show this effect in 3 D. Only <b>Disperse</b> Red 13 decreased the activity of dehydrogenases of HepG 2 cells and this effect was observed both in monolayer and in 3 D...|$|R
