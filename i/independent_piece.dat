In 2011 in Hanover at the Agritechnica show, Fendt {{presented}} their driverless tractor model called the GuideConnect. The GuideConnect is a tractor programmed to mirror the movements of another tractor. An operator-driven tractor maneuvers through a field or through crops and is followed by a driverless tractor. Because the first tractor has a driver, he or she can manually steer to avoid obstacles with the driverless tractor following. Instead of focusing on a completely <b>independent</b> <b>piece</b> of technology, Fendt made GuideConnect to work together with operator-controlled machinery. GuideConnect is connected by satellite navigation and radio to the operator-driven tractor. The two perform as one unit. The one with the driver leads while the one without the driver follows.|$|E

When King Edward died in 924, Æthelstan initially faced opposition at the West Saxon court, but was accepted as king in Mercia.|$|E

2500|$|As was {{the case}} for most of the operas in the Licht cycle, {{component}} sections of Dienstag were commissioned and composed separately, and given seriatim premieres. The first component of this opera was in fact {{the first part of the}} entire Licht cycle to be composed: Jahreslauf (Course of the Years), which became the first act of Dienstag, was originally written in 1977 as an <b>independent</b> <b>piece</b> for gagaku ensemble. Stockhausen finished it in Kyoto in the fall of 1977, and it was premiered by the Imperial Gagaku Ensemble at the Tokyo National Theatre on 31 October. This version is dedicated to Jaynee Stephens. A concert version for European instruments, with the slightly different title Der Jahreslauf (The Course of the Years), was performed in the Large Broadcasting Hall of the WDR, Cologne, on 10 February 1979. The day before the premiere, a studio recording was made for commercial release, and the same musicians participated in five staged performances of this act produced by the Paris Opera at the Opéra-Comique [...] from 20 to 24 November 1979 [...] It was while working on this piece in Japan that the idea occurred to him of composing a seven-part cycle of operas, all based on a single, multi-layered musical formula [...] In the spring of 1991 Stockhausen added a narrative frame for Michael and Lucifer [...]|$|E

40|$|Can {{coherence}} among <b>independent</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of evidence}} make them credible even if each piece has no individual credibility? It is generally agreed among recent epistemologists that coherence of <b>independent</b> <b>pieces</b> of evidence {{can make them}} more credible if each piece already has some credibility of its own. Take a group of somewhat questionable witnesses. Even if each witness’s report has only a modest amount of credibility, a close match among many independently produced reports makes people quite confident that they are true. Acknowledging this effect, even the opponents of coherentism in epistemology usually agree that coherence of <b>independent</b> <b>pieces</b> of evidence enhances their existing credibility. 1 Our question, however, is whether coherence among <b>independent</b> <b>pieces</b> of evidence with no individual credibility at all can make them credible. We will call this type of evidential support “justification by coherence from scratch ” (JCS for short). JCS has some initial appeal. To continue the example of testimonial evidence, {{even if we have}} no trust at all in what each witness says individually, a surprising match among their reports will prompt people to reconsider their assessment, provided it is clear that these reports are produced independently of each other. The reason is that it is highly unlikely—or so it seems intuitively—that unreliable witnesses testifying independently of each other happen to produce matching reports. However, intuition can be misleading especially in matters of probability (Kahneman, et al. 1982). This is not merely a general note of caution in the case of JCS. There have been formal arguments against JCS by the use of the probability calculus (Huemer 1997; Olsson 2002). If JCS is impossible by the rules of the probability calculus, we should regard its intuitive appeal as another instance of bias in our pre-theoretical intuitions. Against this background we aim at three goals in this paper. First, we will confirm formally that coherence does not make <b>independent</b> <b>pieces</b> of evidence credible if each piece has no individual credibility. 2 There are some limitations in the recent forma...|$|R

50|$|Some {{experimental}} cameras, {{for example}} the planar Fourier capture array (PFCA), do not require focusing {{to allow them to}} take pictures. In conventional digital photography, lenses or mirrors map all of the light originating from a single point of an in-focus object to a single point at the sensor plane. Each pixel thus relates an <b>independent</b> <b>piece</b> of information about the far-away scene. In contrast, a PFCA does not have a lens or mirror, but each pixel has an idiosyncratic pair of diffraction gratings above it, allowing each pixel to likewise relate an <b>independent</b> <b>piece</b> of information (specifically, one component of the 2D Fourier transform) about the far-away scene. Together, complete scene information is captured and images can be reconstructed by computation.|$|E
