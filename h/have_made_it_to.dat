5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton {{from the}} Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season {{in exchange for}} their 1st- and 2nd-round draft picks, and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in 1967 and were 7–3 through ten games in 1968. Leaving them one game behind Capitol Division leader Dallas. However, New York dropped its final four games to again finish 7–7. Notably, in 1968, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl; it wasn't until 2010 that another Giants receiver, (Steve Smith), would make the Pro Bowl. Since Smith, Victor Cruz (2012) and Odell Beckham Jr. (2014–16) <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Pro Bowl.

5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E

Midland High has also earned eight consecutive playoff berths, and 20 overall since 1983. Since 1950, Midland High has had only 5 losing seasons. The annual Midland High vs. Dow High game is considered one of the biggest high school football games in the state of Michigan, generally drawing around 10,000 spectators. Midland has dominated the series with a 31-10 overall record.

25|$|Brazil's President, Getúlio Vargas, {{wanted to}} {{industrialize}} Brazil, {{allowing it to}} be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, {{perhaps as many as}} 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay. It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its Führer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, one {{can identify}} significantly regulated genes {{first and then}} find patterns by comparing the list of significant genes to sets of genes known to share certain associations. One can also work the problem in reverse order. Here is a very simple example. Suppose there are 40 genes associated with a known process, for example, a predisposition to diabetes. Looking at two groups of expression profiles, one for mice fed a high carbohydrate diet and one for mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, one observes that all 40 diabetes genes are expressed {{at a higher level}} in the high carbohydrate group than the low carbohydrate group. Regardless of whether any of these genes would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a list of significantly altered genes, observing all 40 up, and none down appears unlikely {{to be the result of}} pure chance: flipping 40 heads in a row is predicted to occur about one time in a trillion attempts using a fair coin.|$|E
