The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis {{consists of}} two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, which are flanked by five accessory cells. Both gametic and accessory cells are vital for fertilization; however, the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> fate are unknown. In a screen for regulators of egg cell fate, we isolated the lachesis (lis) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> fate, indicating that LIS {{is involved in a}} mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP 4, indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions...|$|E
40|$|Histones are {{essential}} for packaging of eukaryotic genomic DNA in nucleosomes, and histone gene expression is normally coupled with DNA synthesis. Some of the flowering plant histone genes show strictly male gamete-specific expression. However, mechanisms underlying their male gamete-specific expression have not been elucidated so far. Here we report {{the isolation of the}} male gamete-specific histone gcH 3 promoter from Lilium longiflorum and its activity in the male <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> of the flowering plant. The OCT motif, which is well conserved in plant histone promoters regulating S phase-specific expression, is not conserved in the gcH 3 promoter. Instead sequence motifs identical to GC box 1 and GC box 2, the transcriptional activator and suppressor for mammalian testis-specific histone H 1 t, are present in the gcH 3 promoter, suggesting that plants and animals share the mechanism which governs the specificity of gene expression in male gametic cells. Male gamete-specific activation of the gcH 3 promoter has been confirmed by microprojectile bombardment in lily pollen. The sperm cell carrying gold particles showed reporter gene expression, while green fluorescent protein (GFP) was absent in the other sperm cell which had no particles, confirming that the gcH 3 promoter is activated in the male <b>gametic</b> <b>cell,</b> and sperm cells have transcriptional and translational machinery that is independent of the vegetative cell of pollen.

40|$|The role of {{the male}} gamete—the sperm cell—in the process of {{fertilization}} is to recognize, adhere to, and fuse with the female gamete. These highly specialized functions {{are expected to be}} controlled by activation of a unique set of genes. However, male <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> traditionally have been regarded as transcriptionally quiescent because of highly condensed chromatin and a very reduced amount of cytoplasm. Here, we provide evidence for male gamete-specific gene expression in flowering plants. We identified and characterized a gene, LGC 1, which was shown to be expressed exclusively in the male <b>gametic</b> <b>cells.</b> The gene product of LGC 1 was localized at the surface of male <b>gametic</b> <b>cells,</b> suggesting a possible role in sperm–egg interactions.

40|$|Antisera raised against {{vegetative}} and gametic flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardi {{have been}} used to probe dynamic properties of the flagellar membranes. The antisera, which agglutinate cells via their flagella, associate with antigens that are present on both vegetative and gametic membranes and on membranes of both mating types (mt + and mt). <b>Gametic</b> <b>cells</b> respond to antibody presentation very differently from vegetative cells, mobilizing even high concentrations of antibody towards the flagellar tips; the possibility is discussed that such "tipping" ability reflects a differentiated gametic property relevant to sexual agglutinability. <b>Gametic</b> <b>cells</b> also respond to antibody agglutination by activating their mating structures, the mt + reaction involving a rapid polymerization of microfilaments. Several impotent mt + mutant strains that fail to agglutinate sexually are also activated by the antisera and procede to form zygotes with normal mt- gametes. Fusion does not occur between activated cells of like mating type. Monovalent (Fab) preparations of the antibody fail to activate mt + gametes, suggesting that the cross-linking properties of the antisera are essential for their ability to mimic, or bypass, sexual agglutination. KEY WORDS microfilament polymerization membrane mobility cell fusion membrane mutants During the sexual agglutination reaction of the eukaryotic protist Chlamydomonas reinhardi, gametes of mating-type plus (mt +) recognize, and make contact via their flagellar tips with, gametes of mating-type minus (mt) (28, 32). The ability to agglutinate sexually is acquired during gametic differentiation: vegetative mt § and mt cells show no flagellar interactions with one another or with gametes. The reaction is, moreover, specific for both mating type and species: mt + gametes agglu-tinate only with mt + gametes, never with themselves or with gametes of other species of Chtamydomonas.

40|$|During {{the mating}} {{reaction}} between mt+ and mt ~ gametes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two novel endopeptidases, {{each of which}} was able to digest the B chain of insulin, were released into the culture medium, together with a gamete lytic enzyme (GLE) {{which is responsible for}} diges-tion of the <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> walls. Both endopeptidases and GLE were copurified from the mating medium by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and concanavalin A. Gel nitration sepa-rated the peptidases, which were unable to digest <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> walls, into two fractions, endopep-tidase- 1 and endopeptidase- 2. These enzymes were also separated from GLE, which was unable to digest the B chain of insulin. Endopeptidase- 1, with a molecular mass of about 200 kDa, cleav-ed the B chain of insulin at the Ala 14 -Leu 15 peptide bond, and this activity was inhibited by EDTA. Endopeptidase- 2, with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa, digested the peptide at the Leul 5 -Tyr 16 peptide bond and was sensitive to iodoacetate and chymostatin. When the cell walls of gametes of either mating-type were digested prior to mating with exogenously added GLE, the two endopeptidases were released into the medium, a result that suggests that they are stored, like GLE, outside the plasmalemma.

40|$|The {{formation}} of gametes {{is a key}} step in {{the life cycle of}} any sexually reproducing organism. In flowering plants, gametes develop in haploid structures termed gametophytes that comprise a few cells. The female gametophyte forms gametic cells and flanking accessory cells. During a screen for regulators of egg-cell fate, we isolated three mutants, lachesis (lis), clotho (clo) and atropos (ato), that show deregulated expression of an egg-cell marker. We have previously shown that, in lis mutants, which are defective for the splicing factor PRP 4, accessory cells can differentiate <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> fate. Here, we show that CLOTHO/GAMETOPHYTIC FACTOR 1 (CLO/GFA 1) is necessary for the restricted expression of egg- and central-cell fate and hence reproductive success. Surprisingly, infertile gametophytes can be expelled from the maternal ovule tissue, thereby preventing the needless allocation of maternal resources to sterile tissue. CLO/GFA 1 encodes the Arabidopsis homologue of Snu 114, a protein that is considered to be an essential component of the spliceosome. In agreement with their proposed role in pre-mRNA splicing, CLO/GFA 1 and LIS co-localize to nuclear speckles. Our data also suggest that CLO/GFA 1 is necessary for the tissue-specific expression of LIS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATO encodes the Arabidopsis homologue of SF 3 a 60, a protein that has been implicated in pre-spliceosome formation. Our results thus establish that the restriction of <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> fate is specifically coupled to the function of various core spliceosomal components. 7531...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii elaborates two biochemically and morphologically {{distinct}} cell walls {{during its}} life cycle: one surrounds the vegetative and <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> {{and the other}} encompasses the zygote. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) constitute {{a major component of}} both walls. We describe the isolation and characterization of a zygote-specific gene encoding a wall HRGP. The derived amino acid sequence of this alga 1 HRGP is similar to those of higher plant extensins, rich in proline and serine residues and possessing repeating amino acid motifs, notably X(Pro), and (Ser-Pro),. Antiserum against this zygote wall protein detected common epitopes in several other zygote polypeptides, at least one of which is also encoded by a zygote-specific gene.

40|$|Histones {{are vital}} {{structural}} proteins of chromatin that influence its dynamics and function. The tissue-specific expression of histone variants {{has been shown}} to regulate the expression of specific genes and genomic stability in animal systems. Here we report on the characterization of five histone H 3 variants expressed in Lilium generative cell. The gcH 3 and leH 3 variants show unique sequence diversity by lacking a conserved lysine residue at position 9 (H 3 K 9). The gH 3 shares conserved structural features with centromeric H 3 of Arabidopsis. The gH 3 variant gene is strongly expressed in generative cells and gH 3 histone is incorporated in to generative cell chromatin. The lysine residue of H 3 at position 4 (H 3 K 4) is highly methylated in the nuclei of generative cells of mature pollen, while methylation of H 3 K 4 is low in vegetative cell nuclei. Taken together, these results suggest that male <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> of Lilium have unique chromatin state and histone H 3 variants and their methylation might be involved in gene regulation of male <b>gametic</b> <b>cells.</b> Takashi Okada, Mohan B.

40|$|The non-Mendelian {{erythromycin}} resistance mutation ery-u 1 shows bidirectional {{uniparental inheritance}} in crosses between homothallic ery-u 1 and ery-u 1 + strains of Chlamydomonas monoica. This inheritance pattern supports a general model for homothallism invoking intrastrain differentiation into opposite compatible mating types and, further, suggests that non-Mendelian inheritance is under mating-type (mt) control in C. monoica as in heterothallic species. However, {{the identification of}} genes expressed or required by one <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> type, but not the other, is essential to verify {{the existence of a}} regulatory mating-type locus in C. monoica and to understand its role in cell differentiation and sexual development. By screening for a shift from bidirectional to unidirectional transmission of the non-Mendelian ery-u 1 marker, a mutant with an apparent mating-type-limited sexual cycle defect was obtained. The responsible mutation, mtl- 1, causes a 1000 -fold reduction in zygospore germination in populations homozygous for the mutant allele and, approximately, a 50 % reduction in germination for heterozygous (mtl- 1 /mtl- 1 +) zygospores. By next screening for strains unable to yield any viable zygospores in a cross to mtl- 1, a second putative mating-type-limited mutant, mtl- 2, was obtained. The mtl- 2 strain, although self-sterile, mates efficiently with mtl- 2 + strains and shows a unidirectional uniparental pattern of inheritance for the ery-u 1 cytoplasmic marker, similar to that observed for crosses involving mtl- 1. Genetic analysis indicates that mtl- 1 and mtl- 2 define unique unlinked Mendelian loci and that the sexual cycle defects of reduced germination (mtl- 1) or self-sterility (mtl- 2) cosegregate with the effect on ery-u 1 cytoplasmic gene transmission. By analogy to C. reinhardtii, the mtl- 1 and mtl- 2 phenotypes can be explained if the expression of these gene loci is limited to the mt+ <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> type, or if the wild-type alleles at these loci are required for the normal formation and/or functioning of mt + gametes only...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the first}} hour of zygote maturation, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells stop synthesizing certain polypeptides that {{characterize}} the vegetative and gametic stages {{of the life cycle}} and initiate the synthesis of novel, zygote-specific polypeptides.

40|$|The unique double {{fertilisation}} {{mechanism in}} flowering plants depends upon {{a pair of}} functional sperm cells. During male gametogenesis, each haploid microspore undergoes an asymmetric division to produce a large, non-germline vegetative cell and a single germ cell that divides once to produce the sperm cell pair. Despite the importance of sperm cells in plant reproduction, relatively {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms controlling germ cell proliferation and specification. Here, we investigate the role of the Arabidopsis male germline-specific Myb protein DUO POLLEN 1, DUO 1, as a positive regulator of male germline development. We show that DUO 1 is required for correct male germ cell differentiation including the expression of key genes required for fertilisation. DUO 1 is also necessary for male germ cell division, and we show that DUO 1 is required for the germline expression of the G 2 /M regulator AtCycB 1; 1 and that AtCycB 1 : 1 can partially rescue defective germ cell division in duo 1. We further show that the male germline-restricted expression of DUO 1 depends upon positive promoter elements and not upon a proposed repressor binding site. Thus, DUO 1 is a key regulator in the production of functional sperm cells in flowering plants that has a novel integrative role linking <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> specificatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{generative}} cell, {{the male}} <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> progenitor in flowering plants, undergoes mitotic division to produce two sperm cells. We {{have examined the}} gene expression profile of the Lilium longiflorum (lily) generative cell by sequencing expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A total of 886 ESTs derived from the generative cell cDNA library were clustered into 637 unique ESTs comprising 123 cluster ESTs and 514 singleton ESTs. Thirty-nine percent of non-redundant ESTs showing similarity to Arabidopsis genes with known function were thus assigned putative functions. Genes related to the ubiquitin system were abundant, suggesting the key role of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in gametogenesis. A total of 168 and 129 non-redundant lily generative cell ESTs showed significant similarity to maize sperm cell ESTs and Arabidopsis male gametophyte-specific transcripts, respectively. Fifty-five ESTs appeared to have significant similarities to both maize sperm cell ESTs and Arabidopsis male gametophyte-specific genes, indicating conservation of male gamete-expressed genes across different plant genera. Thus our data provide a handle to identify Arabidopsis gamete-expressed genes and to investigate their function. Several of these genes are potential candidates for analyzing the molecular basis of fertilization and for investigating mechanisms of gamete-specific transcriptional regulation in Arabidopsis through bioinformatics-based approaches.

40|$|AbstractFlowering plant male gametic cell-specific gene {{expression}} {{has been reported}} recently but the regulatory elements controlling specificity of such genes expressed in generative cell and sperm cells have not been identified and studied. Here, we report the 0. 8 kb promoter sequence upstream of {{the start of the}} transcription site of the generative cell-specific gene, LGC 1, sufficient to regulate the expression of reporter genes in a cell-specific manner. In addition, the diphtheria toxin A-chain- (DT-A) -coding region {{under the control of the}} LGC 1 promoter sequence confirmed unequivocally the lack of LGC 1 expression in vegetative tissues. Transgenic tobacco plants carrying the LGC 1 -DT/A construct showed normal phenotype except for anthers of these plants that contained sterile and aborted pollen. Truncation and internal deletion analysis of the LGC 1 promoter identified − 242 bp as the minimal sequence necessary for male gametic cell-specific expression. In addition, a regulatory sequence required for determining generative cell-specific expression of LGC 1 was identified. Deletion of this regulatory sequence led to loss of the generative cell specificity resulting in activation of this promoter in other tissues where it is normally repressed. Therefore, male <b>gametic</b> <b>cell</b> specificity of the LGC 1 gene seems to be regulated by factors that suppress its activation in other plant cells. This is the first report of a male gametic cell-specific promoter, hence can be used as a novel tool in molecular analyses and experimental manipulation of flowering plant spermatogenesis and fertilization...|$|E

Synthesis of both classes requires cell fusion between gametes. Cycloheximide fails to inhibit early mRNA synthesis, indicating that transcription factors must preexist in the gametes and be activated by cytoplasmic confluence. By contrast, cycloheximide blocks synthesis of the late transcript, suggesting that an early protein product(s) is required for expression of the late gene.

50|$|In some populations, the {{majority}} of the beetles are female. In these populations, 80-90% of the offspring of a female are female. The cause of this anomaly is the presence of symbiotic bacteria living within the <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> of the female lady beetles. The bacterium is too large to live in the male gametes (sperm), so the bacterium can be transmitted to the next generation only through female gametes. When it ends up in a male, it will die when the male dies. Therefore, it kills most of the male embryos in the newly laid eggs. These dead embryos then serve as food for their sisters when they emerge from their eggs. This trait is associated with a variety of different bacteria (Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma), which are present in between 0 and 20% of females, depending on locality.|$|R
40|$|In the ovules of most sexual {{flowering}} plants female gametogenesis is initiated {{from a single}} surviving <b>gametic</b> <b>cell,</b> the functional megaspore, formed after meiosis of the somatically derived megaspore mother cell (MMC) (1, 2). Because some mutants and certain sexual species exhibit more than one MMC 2 - 4, and many others are able to form gametes without meiosis (by apomixis) (5), {{it has been suggested}} that somatic cells in the ovule are competent to respond to a local signal likely to have an important function in determination(6). Here we show that the Arabidopsis protein ARGONAUTE 9 (AGO 9) controls female gamete formation by restricting the specification of gameto-phyte precursors in a dosage-dependent, non-cell-autonomous manner. Mutations in AGO 9 lead to the differentiation of multiple gametic cells that are able to initiate gametogenesis. The AGO 9 protein is not expressed in the gamete lineage; instead, it is expressed in cytoplasmic foci of somatic companion cells. Mutations in SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 exhibit an identical defect to ago 9 mutants, indicating that the movement of small RNA (sRNAs) silencing out of somatic companion cells is necessary for controlling the specification of gametic cells. AGO 9 preferentially interacts with 24 -nucleotide sRNAs derived from transposable elements (TEs), and its activity is necessary to silence TEs in female gametes and their accessory cells.

Here, we report a mitochondrial protein, GAMETE CELL DEFECTIVE 1 (GCD 1), enriched in gametophytes that is essential for final maturation of female gametes. Using Arabidopsis gcd 1 mutants, we found that final maturation of the egg and central cells is not required for double fertilization but is necessary for embryogenesis initiation and endosperm development. Furthermore, nonautonomous effects, observed when GCD 1 or AAC 2 function is disrupted, suggest that mitochondrial function influences reciprocal signaling between central and egg cells to regulate maturation of the partner (egg or central) cell. Our findings confirm that cell-to-cell communication is important in functional maturation of female <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> and suggest that both egg and central cells sense and transmit their mitochondrial metabolic status as an important cue that regulates the coordination of gamete maturation...|$|R
40|$|Glycosyl {{transferase}} ectoenzyme {{systems that}} transfer galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, mannose, and fucose {{have been detected}} on vegetative cells and gametes of Chlamydomonas moewusii. Gametes {{have higher levels of}} activity of the transferase ectoenzyme systems than morphologically identical vegetative cells, as determined by transfer of monosaccharide onto endogenous cell surface acceptors. When (plus) and (minus) gametes are mixed, there is {{a significant increase in the}} activity of transferase ectoenzyme systems. No enhancement in activity of transferase ectoenzyme systems occurs when (plus) and (minus) vegetative cells are mixed. Flagellar membrane vesicles obtained from (plus) and (minus) gametes show high activity of transferase ectoenzyme systems per mg of protein and also demonstrate enhanced activity upon mixing. Therefore, glycosyl transferases and acceptors seem to be located on the flagellar membrane and appear to have a function particularly related to <b>gametic</b> <b>cells.</b> The mechanism of cellular adhesion or recognition proposed by Roseman (1970, Chem. Phys. Lipids 5, 270 - 297), involving glycosyl transferases and acceptors, is strongly suggested by our data for the mating reaction in Chlamydomonas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPea early {{browning}} virus (PEBV) is {{a member}} of the genus, Tobravirus. It is transmitted by soil-inhabiting trichodorid nematodes and through seeds from diseased plants. By introducing mutations into the PEBV genome, we have studied the viral determinants of seed transmission in pea. Neither deleting a portion of the genome containing the three nonstructural genes in RNA 2 nor the interuption of any of the three genes individually prevented PEBV seed transmission. However, a comparison of two PEBV isolates indicated a minor role for RNA 2 or its products. In contrast, the removal of the coding sequence of the 12 K gene in RNA 1 almost completely abolished viral seed transmission. The virus lacking the 12 K gene caused more severe symptoms on leaves and pods, and accumulated to a higher level than the wild-type virus in both types of tissues. However, the 12 K deletion mutant accumulated poorly in anthers and carpels, and could not be detected in pollen grains and ovules. These results suggest that the 12 K gene is involved in the infection of the <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> and hence the seed transmission of PEBV in pea...|$|R
40|$|In plants, gametes, {{along with}} {{accessory}} cells, are {{formed by the}} haploid gametophytes {{through a series of}} mitotic divisions, cell specification and differentiation events. How the cells in the female gametophyte of flowering plants differentiate into gametes (the egg and central cell) and accessory cells remains largely unknown. In a screen for mutations that affect egg cell differentiation in Arabidopsis, we identified the wyrd (wyr) mutant, which produces additional egg cells {{at the expense of the}} accessory synergids. WYR not only restricts gametic fate in the egg apparatus, but is also necessary for central cell differentiation. In addition, wyr mutants impair mitotic divisions in the male gametophyte and endosperm, and have a parental effect on embryo cytokinesis, consistent with a function of WYR in cell cycle regulation. WYR is upregulated in <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> and encodes a putative plant ortholog of the inner centromere protein (INCENP), which is implicated in the control of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in yeast and animals. Our data reveal a novel developmental function of the conserved cell cycle-associated INCENP protein in plant reproduction, in particular in the regulation of egg and central cell fate and differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} spur growth of early stage <b>gametic</b> <b>cells</b> {{recovered}} from neonates {{could lead to}} significant advances in rescuing the genomes of rare genotypes or endangered species that die unexpectedly. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine, for the first time, the abili-ty of two substantially different cryopreservation approaches, slow freezing versus vitrifica-tion, to preserve testicular tissue of the neonatal sheep and subsequently allow initiation of spermatogenesis post-xenografting. Testis tissue from four lambs (3 - 5 wk old) was pro-cessed and then untreated or subjected to slow freezing or vitrification. Tissue pieces (fresh, n = 214; slow freezing, then thawing, n = 196; vitrification, then warming, n = 139) were placed subcutaneously under the dorsal skin of SCID mice and then grafts recovered and evaluated 17 wk later. Grafts from fresh and slow frozen tissue contained the most ad-vanced stages of spermatogenesis, including normal tubule architecture with elongating spermatids in ~ 1 % (fresh) and ~ 10 % (slow frozen) of tubules. Fewer than 2 % of seminifer-ous tubules advanced to the primary spermatocyte stage in xenografts derived from vitrified tissue. Results demonstrate that slow freezing of neonatal lamb testes was far superior t...|$|R
40|$|Double fertilization, uniquely {{observed}} in plants, requires successful sperm cell delivery by the pollen tube {{to the female}} gametophyte, followed by migration, recognition and fusion of the two sperm cells with two female <b>gametic</b> <b>cells.</b> The female gametophyte not only regulates these steps but also controls the subsequent initiation of seed development. Previously, we reported that loss of LORELEI, which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored protein, in the female reproductive tissues causes a delay in initiation of seed development. From these studies, however, it was unclear if embryos derived from fertilization of lre- 5 gametophytes continued to lag behind wild-type during seed development. Additionally, it was not determined if the delay in initiation of seed development had any lingering effects during seed germination. Finally, it was not known if loss of LORELEI function affects seedling development given that LORELEI is expressed in eight-day-old seedlings. Here, we showed that despite a delay in initiation, lre- 5 /lre- 5 embryos recover, becoming equivalent to the developing wild-type embryos beginning at 72 hours after pollination. Additionally, lre- 5 /lre- 5 seed germination, and seedling and root development are indistinguishable from wild-type indicating that loss of LORELEI is tolerated, at least under standard growth conditions, in vegetative tissues...|$|R
