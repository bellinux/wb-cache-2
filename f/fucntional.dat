We give a new {{proof of}} the Dalang-Morton-Willinger theorem, {{relating}} the no-arbitrage condition in stochastic securities market models {{to the existence of}} an equivalent martingale measure with bounded density for a d-dimensional stochastic sequence (Sn) N n= 0 of stock prices. Roughly speaking, the proof is reduced to the assertion that under the no-arbitrage condition for N = 1 and S ∈ L 1 there exists a strictly positive linear <b>fucntional</b> on L 1, which is bounded from above on a special subset of the subspace K ⊂ L 1 of investor’s gains. 1...|$|E

The inequalities include the free form of the transportation, Log-Sobolev, HWI interpolation and Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for strictly convex potentials. Sharp constants and some extended versions are put forward. The paper also addresses two versions of free Poincaré inequalities and their interpretation in terms of spectral properties of Jacobi operators.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of strong topological insulators led to enormous activity in {{condensed matter physics}} and the {{discovery of}} new types of topological materials. Bisumth based chalcogenides are exemplary strong three dimensional topological insulators that host an odd number of massless Dirac fermionic states on all surfaces. A departure from this notion {{is the idea of}} a weak topological insulator, wherein only certain surface terminations host surface states characterized by an even number of Dirac cones leading to exciting new physics. Experimentally however, weak topological insulators have proven to be elusive. Here, we report a discovery of a weak topological insulator (WTI), BiSe, of the Bi-chalcogenide family with an indirect band gap of 42 meV. Its structural unit consists of bismuth bilayer (Bi$_ 2 $), a known quantum spin hall insulator sandwiched between two units of Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ which are three dimensional strong topological insulators. Angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on cleaved single crystal flakes along with density <b>fucntional</b> theory (DFT) calculations confirm the existence of weak topological insulating state of BiSe. Additionally, we have carried out magneto-transport measurements on single crystal flakes as well as thin films of BiSe, which exhibit clear signatures of weak anti-localization at low temperatures, consistent with the properties of topological insulators...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine A 2 A receptors have {{a unique}} {{cellular}} and regional distribution in the basal ganglia (BG) being particularly concentrated in areas richly innervated by dopamine (DA) such as the caudate-putamen, otherwise called striatum, and the globus pallidus. Adenosine A 2 A and DA D 2 receptors are capable of forming <b>fucntional</b> heteromeric complexes and are colocalised in striatopallidal neurons. Based on the peculiar cellular and regional distribution of this receptor and in line with data showing that A 2 A receptor antagonists improve motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in animal models and in clinical trials, A 2 A receptor antagonists have emerged as an attractive non-dopaminergic target to improve the motor deficits that characterise PD. Experimental data have also shown that A 2 A receptor antagonists are capable of exerting a neuroprotective effect and do not induce neuroplasticity phenomena that complicate long-term dopaminergic treatments. The present review will provide an updated summary of results {{reported in the literature}} concerning the biochemical characteristics and BG distribution of A 2 A receptors. We subsequently aim {{to examine the effects of}} adenosine A 2 A antagonists in rodent and primate models of PD and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Finally, conclusive remarks will be made on the neuroprotective effects of A 2 A antagonists and on the translation of adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists in the treatment of PD...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} developed fundamental measure <b>fucntional</b> [J. Chem. Phys. vol. 107, 6379 (1997) ] is used {{to study}} the phase behavior {{of a system of}} parallel hard cubes. The single-component fluid exhibits a continuous transition to a solid with an anomalously large density of vacancies. The binary mixture has a demixing transition for edge-length ratios below 0. 1. Freezing in this mixture reveals that at least the phase rich in large cubes lies in the region where the uniform fluid is unstable, hence suggesting a fluid-solid phase separation. A method is develop to study very asymmetric binary mixtures by taking the limit of zero size ratio (scaling the density and fugacity of the solvent as appropriate) in the semi-grand ensemble where the chemical potential of the solvent is fixed. With this procedure the mixture is exactly mapped onto a one-component fluid of parallel adhesive hard cubes. At any density and solvent fugacity the large cubes are shown to collapse into a close-packed solid. Nevertheless the phase diagram contains a large metastability region with fluid and solid phases. Upon introduction of a slight polydispersity in the large cubes the system shows the typical phase diagram of a fluid with an isostructural solid-solid transition (with the exception of a continuous freezing). Consequences about the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard core particles are then drawn. Comment: 14 pages, 6 eps figures, uses revtex, amstex, epsfig, and multicol style file...|$|E

In order to determine the most effective adsorption for each of heavy metals,we had come out in development of molecular-imprinted technology. Molecular-imprinted technique tends to give a higher adsorption rates and higher selectivity towards target metals. In order to achieve the objectives of this research,it would based on four main scopes of study which is to know effect of imprinting ions concentration on biosorption,effect of time on biosorption,effect of initial concentration of Pb 2 + in solution and also to compare the different type of metals on adsorption selectivity of the biosorbent. The adsorption uptake was analyzed by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer AAS). In the preparation, with the imprinted ion Pb 2 + concentrations increasing,the more <b>fucntional</b> groups(-OH) were protected and the more imprinting sites on the surface were retained. So,the loading amount of imprinted ions in preparation was 2 mg/g selected as the optimum loading amount. For the effect of time in adsorption,the optimum condition was described as the shortest time that the biosorbent can absorbed the metals. So,in this experiment,the shortest time that it can achieved with a high adsorption capacity was 30 minutes. It can be said as satisfactory adsorption compare to without imprinted biosorbent. The existence of functional group of (-OH) can be proved by using FTIR analysis. It was recommended that this research was furthered by using wastewater from metal industry,to recover back the Plumbum that had attached to the biosorbent,and can be applied in adsorption column...|$|E
40|$|Ram semen {{processing}} laboratories are sometimes {{confronted with the}} need to use semen of high genetic merit rams with relatively low semen quality. Thus, any method that would increase sperm viability in low viability ejaculates could be useful. In this study the possibility of a glass beads filtration method by estimating the beads Total Surface Provided (TSP) for adhesion of spermatozoa, was evaluated. Initially, two different TSP (102 cm 2 and 154 cm 2) achieved by various sizes of beads (1500, 2000 και 3000 μm in diameter) were tested. No significant difference in sperm viability improvement was noticed for the same TSP by different beads (P> 0. 05). Optimization tests were then performed in which three different funnels were used for filtration at a standard TSP (154 cm 2). The pear shaped funnel was found to be the most appropriate for filtration, since semen volume recovery and sperm viability improvement were more pronounced (P 0. 05). Filtrated spermatozoa were more resistant to the HOS test than the untreated samples in 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours (P< 0. 05). Significant difference between groups in ROS production was detected after 72 hours of storage (P< 0. 05). Analysis of the results revealed that the efficiency of the filtration procedure is increased in the breeding season of rams. Estimation of the reproductive value of the filtrated samples using the <b>Fucntional</b> Sperm Fraction (F. S. F.) index system revealed that the filtrated samples can be used for AI up to 24 hours after their filtration within the breeding season. In conclusion, ram sperm viability improvement by more than 20 % of its initial value και semen volume recovery by more than 60 %, along {{with the fact that the}} total filtration time did not exceed three minutes in any case, suggest that through further development this method could be successfully used during ram {{semen processing}}. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} towards modelling extended defects in nuclear graphite. Programmatic tools {{have been created}} which allow the implementation of displacement fields for basal and prismatic dislocations in graphite using the anisotropic elastic equations. These dislocation displacements have also been used to accommodate other defects which may be represented using dislocation formalisms. Structures such as prismatic loops, dislocation dipoles, folds, surface ridges and turbostratic graphite have been created {{for the purpose of}} generating structures for modelling. We have investigated the X-ray diffraction simulations resulting from the various structures containing defects and compared these directly with experimental results from samples of neutron irradiated graphite. We have shown that some of the line defects, such as the ruck and tuck fold, reproduce characteristic diffraction phenomena as seen in the literature, providing evidence for the existence of such defects in the relevant temperature range. Powder diffraction patterns also show diffraction peaks at small angles, in line with what is expected from long range disorder. With the use of molecular modelling software with interatomic potentials, we have shown that the spiro interstitial defect, which binds adjacent layers, may not be a sufficient barrier to prevent the glide of partial basal dislocations past one another, especially when the shear constant for graphite is reduced by the presence of disregistry or stacking faults. In addition, we have shown that basal dislocations with large Burgers vectors (superedge dislocations) give rise to delamination across the glide plane, whereas a 90 ° partial basal dislocation does not. Finally we treat graphene as a continuum membrane, performing calculations of the formation energy due to free bending, and compared the results for the nanotube with Density <b>Fucntional</b> Theory (DFT) calculations with good agreement. As such, the same method has been applied to other, more exotic structures for layer deformations, such as a buckles, folds and a wave packet like structure representing a local ripple in a layer, thought to occur when dislocation motion is inhibited and in-plane strain is relieved as out-of-plane deformations...|$|E
40|$|Although a long {{standing}} convention maintained that G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) {{exist in the}} plasma membrane solely as monomers, substantial work {{over the last two}} decades has demonstrated that these ubiquitous receptors can and in many cases, preferentially, exist as homodimers, heterodimers, or higher order oligomers. Often, two GPCRs of the same class heterodimerize; it is less common for two GPCRs of different signaling pathways to interact. The work presented here studied the physical and functional interaction of two GPCRs from discrete classes, the Beta 2 Adrenergic Receptor (β 2 AR), a Gαs-coupled receptor, and Bradykinin type 2 Receptor (Bk 2 R), a Gαq coupled receptor. These data show that Bk 2 R and β 2 AR are physically coupled when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and in pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells and in freshly isolated murine ventricular myocytes, two systems that endogenously express these receptors. This physical coupling led to functional consequences in heterologous and endogenous expression systems, as Bk 2 R was able to transactivate β 2 AR signaling via its direct interaction with the receptor. Furthermore, coexpression of Bk 2 R shifted the dose response curve of β 2 AR for its selective agonist rightward in Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology experiments, suggesting the presence of Bk 2 R negatively affected β 2 AR native pharmacology. Up to thirty minutes of either bradykinin (BK) or isoproterenol exposure did not change the relative amount of Bk 2 R/β 2 AR heterodimer in PC 12 cells, a rat adrenal medulla tumor cell line that endogenously expresses these receptors. Despite the obvious signaling consequences, the Bk 2 R/β 2 AR heterodimer accounted for only 10 % of the total β 2 AR protein detected and 20 % of the total Bk 2 R protein detected. When other Bk 2 R-specific ligands were also tested to examine the extent of β 2 AR transactivation, our data showed that both Lys-des-Arg-Bradykinin, a Bk 2 R partial agonist and NPC 567, a Bk 2 R antagonist, transactivated β 2 AR to the same extent as BK. Taken together, our data provide a novel mode of receptor regulation and signaling via Bk 2 R/β 2 AR heterodimerization. Because a large percentage of therapeutics target GPCRs, a greater understanding of how a GPCR heterodimer functions could be beneficial for targeting new drugs and refining existing drugs. Understanding the Bk 2 R/β 2 AR heterodimer provides a new perspective on the myriad of <b>fucntional</b> consequences that occur when a GPCR is activated. Ph. D.
