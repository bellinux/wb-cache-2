Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I was {{in the back of the}} landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E

The song [...] "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling {{vibrator}} in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, [...] "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something I had to write a song about – {{to get it out}} of my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies.

Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts.

500|$|Espinosa {{landed the}} lead role of the film Gloria in 2014. The film is a biopic about singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, and her {{relation}} with her manager, record producer Sergio Andrade. The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but once I got the role <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has a lot of fans, I had to do it well. It is a very complex character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes. Espinosa watched Trevi's interviews, concerts and films to be able to play her. [...] "The role was meant for me", Espinosa said to Noticine.|$|E
500|$|Gopalakrishan wanted fresh faces {{for both}} the lead roles and he had written letters to various heads of colleges and {{universities}} for the auditions. However, he did not receive any response from anywhere. For the female lead, Gopalakrishnan approached Sharada, {{one of the most successful}} actresses of her time. She was acting in commercial films when Gopalakrishnan asked her to star in Swayamvaram. Sharada was initially reluctant to commit herself to an art film, but agreed when Gopalakrishnan narrated the complete story to her at Prasad Studios, in Chennai. The male lead for the film, Madhu, was an old friend of Gopalakrishnan and had expressed a desire to act in one of his films. By the time Gopalakrishnan finished his studies and returned from FTII, Madhu was already a star in Malayalam cinema. Gopalakrishnan then decided to cast him opposite Sharada. Mentioning about his experience working with Gopalakrishnan and Swayamvaram, Madhu recollected in an interview that [...] " [...] when Gopalakrishnan narrated the story of Swayamvaram, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be different."

The song was written and produced by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri for the 2009 film [...] According to the film, when main character Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus) was young, her father Robby Ray Stewart (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), would often {{tell her that}} while a caterpillar {{may not be able}} to move much, it can still dream about the butterfly it will one day be. This comment became a recurring motif in the film and provided the basis for the lyrics to [...] "Butterfly Fly Away", which use a caterpillar's metamorphosis as a metaphor for a child's coming of age. In Hannah Montana: The Movie, the Cyruses perform the song as their characters in [...] "a tender movie scene under a gazebo in the rain". Billy Ray said filming the scene was [...] "a pretty special moment. The song itself was written by Glen Ballard, a masterful songwriter who wrote 'Man in the Mirror' for Michael Jackson. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a pretty special song [...] and it certainly comes at a nice spot in the movie." ...|$|E

He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein {{spent a lot}} of time in {{the studio}} with the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most."

TV Squad's Jay Black said that Michael summed up [...] "Night Out" [...] perfectly when he said [...] "Best. Night. Ever." [...] Black went on to praise both of the storylines, and the ability of the show to achieve success both in as well as out of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton building. Similar to Black's statements, Gretchen Hansen of Entertainment Weekly stated that Best. Night. Ever.' Oh, so true, Michael." [...] She also stated that [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be a good}} episode of The Office when I had two pages of scribbled notes before the first commercial break." [...] Hansen went on to praise both the acting and the writing of the episode as points that contributed to the success of the episode. Rachel Cericola, of TV Fodder, praised the writing of the episode by Mindy Kaling.

And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation.

[...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E
