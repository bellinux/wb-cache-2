5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes {{so that the}} eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many {{of the victims were}} sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E

25|$|The {{eyes are}} often a focus of {{abduction}} claims. They are said to not move or focus in any observable way to the naked eye. Claims often describe a Grey staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions. Although abduction claimants often say that the Grey was only inches from their face during the staring mindscan procedure, they often subsequently claim to not feeling breath or seeing the Grey's chest move from breathing.|$|E
25|$|Bald-faced hornets are omnivorous, and are {{considered}} to be beneficial due to their predation of flies, caterpillars, and spiders. However, their aggressively defensive nature makes them a threat to humans who wander too close to a nest or when a nest is constructed too close to human habitation. They vigorously defend the nest, with workers stinging repeatedly, as is common among social bees and wasps. However, the baldfaced hornet has a unique defense in that it can squirt venom from the stinger <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> vertebrate nest intruders. The venom causes immediate watering of the eyes and temporary blindness.|$|E
25|$|Experiments on twin {{children}} in concentration camps {{were created to}} show {{the similarities and differences}} in the genetics of twins, as well as to see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated. The central leader of the experiments was Josef Mengele, who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz. About 200 people survived these studies. The twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in barracks between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> twins to see whether it would change their color to sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins.|$|E

25|$|In Ohio, {{courts have}} held {{that the act of}} {{flashing}} one's headlights so as to alert oncoming drivers of a radar trap does not constitute the offense of obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties, where there was no proof that the warned vehicles were speeding prior to the warning. In another case, where a driver received a citation under an ordinance prohibiting flashing lights on a vehicle, a court held that the ordinance referred to the noun of flashing lights and did not prohibit the verb of flashing the headlights on a vehicle. In a different case, a court held that a momentary flick of the high beams is not a violation of Ohio R.C. 4513.15 (which prohibits drivers from aiming glaring rays <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> oncoming drivers).|$|E

As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
25|$|In Bayonetta 2, a {{few months}} after the events of the first game, Bayonetta and Jeanne are {{fighting}} an outbreak of angels when a supernatural summoning goes wrong and Jeanne is killed by Gomorrah. Bayonetta then sets out to rescue Jeanne's soul from a realm called Hell, heading to the sacred mountain of Fimbulvintr to find the doorway to Inferno. Arriving at the town of Noatun, she encounters a mysterious boy named Loki who serves as her guide to the mountain. She also reunites with Luka, who tells her about the legend of the deity Aesir, who created and ruled the human realm. During their journey, the pair is attacked by a masked Lumen Sage who targets Loki. When they reach the Gates of Hell, Bayonetta meets, Loptr, who is apparently working with the Masked Lumen and knows Loki very well. Through a vision, he reveals to her that her father Balder was not responsible for the witch hunts and he tried to save her mother. But Rosa was killed by an unknown assailant who looks like Loki. To escape their attackers, Bayonetta and Loki flee into Hell but the Masked Lumen follows them. Separated from the boy, Bayonetta fights through hordes of demons and successfully rescues Jeanne's soul. However, she finds Loki being attacked again by the Masked Lumen. Intervening, Bayonetta fights the Sage, who is revealed to be her father Balder at a young age. Balder had been targeting Loki for Rosa's murder. Suddenly, Loki unwillingly sends both Bayonetta and Balder back into the past during the Witch Hunts. Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa, and the two of them fight against the angels. During the battle, she fights a younger version of Loptr, and she realizes that he was Rosa's murderer and framed Loki for the crime. Later encountering Balder, the pair enter the Umbran Witch sanctuary to find that Loptr had killed Rosa. When he escapes, Bayonetta tells Balder that the killer was not Loki. She then opens a time portal and the two of them return to the present. With the help of Jeanne flying a fighter jet, Bayonetta and Balder set out for Fimbulvientr to confront Loptr, who has captured Loki. He reveals that he and Loki are the two halves of Aesir. When Aesir divided his power <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>of</b> the World, he split his soul into two: Loki being the good half and Loptr being the evil half. But Loptr decided to take back his power and become Aesir once again. Draining Loki of his power, Loptr takes the Eyes from both Bayonetta and Balder and transforms into Aesir. While the Witch and the Sage team up to fight Aesir, Loki uses his hidden power to erase the Eyes and weaken Loptr. Bayonetta and Balder defeat Loptr and split his soul from his body. When he tries to escape into the past to be reborn, Balder stops him by sealing the soul inside his body, despite Loki warning that it will corrupt him. Bayonetta tearfully bids farewell to her father as he is transported back into the past and becomes the corrupted Father Balder. As Loki begins to fade, he promises to Bayonetta that they will meet again when he is reborn.|$|E

That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E

The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'.
