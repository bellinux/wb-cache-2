40|$|After the November 23, 1980 Irpinia {{earthquake}} (Mw 6. 9), several seismically {{induced effects}} at surface have been identified. Among these, a strong {{variation of the}} Sanità spring flow rate (from 4. 5 m 3 /sec, in the days preceding the quake, to 7. 5 m 3 /sec, in December 1980) occurred. a multidisciplinary approach aiming at the identification of sectors of the central Apennines where carbonate reliefs (carbonate hydrostructures), affected by active normal faults, are characterised by springs related to permeability thresholds and by karst systems. In particular, we investigate the southern sector of the carbonate ridge that bounds the Marsica region to the West, where the Posta Fibreno springs (10 m 3 /sec) are located, acting as the present base level for <b>karstic</b> <b>erosion.</b> This sector is affected by {{a portion of the}} regional tectonic structure known in the literature as "Val Roveto-Atina Line", here represented by the Posta Fibreno fault, which places in contact the cretaceous-miocenic carbonate sequences with the miocenic flysch and with quaternary continental sequences hosted by the Posta Fibreno depression. Several epigeous and hypogeous karstic landforms (dolines, abandoned valleys and karstic conducts) developed in this area along tectonic features NW-SE trending; the not well developed hydrographic network is characterised by abandoned valley which originate from the rims of the main dolines (i. e. Fossa Maiura, Pozzo la Pescura). These landforms show evidence of different stationary phases of the <b>karstic</b> <b>erosion</b> probably due to hydrological base level of the Posta Fibreno springs...|$|E
50|$|The Central Bükk, a gently sloping {{mountainous area}} with an {{altitude}} between 400 and 600 m, is situated between Diósgyőr and Lillafüred; {{the area is}} made up of limestone, slate, dolomite and other rocks from the Triassic period.

40|$|EnSalento, in {{the south}} east of Italy, is a <b>karstic,</b> cave-punctuated peninsula. <b>Erosion</b> of the calcarenitic {{limestone}} (which is the main basset of the peninsula) is carrying on from 65 million years. During this time the sea level changed many times reaching 200 m under its actual position, so offering a bigger portion of the limestone to the erosive action of atmospheric waters. Ancient pathways of underground rivers opened along the primitive coast-line when they could erode deeply in the rock. Many of these openings are submerged today and represent {{one of the most}} important littoral environments in the region which, in turn, is {{one of the most important}} site of marine caves in the Italian peninsula. In particular, the "Neretina" coast (on the Ionian Sea) and the coastline which goes from the "Capo di Leuca" to the "Capo d’otranto" (on the Otranto Channel), are sites with high density of marine caves, (many of them waiting for a first description) none of which had never been studied from an ecological point of view notwithstanding rare works witnessed the faunistic importance of such environments. The present work should like to stimulate researches in this direction by offering the state of art of marine spelaeobiology in Salento peninsula. It reports of the only 53 marine caves which have been numbered and described. The work was supported by the consultation of dozen of papers found with difficulties because their publication age, and their limited diffusion. One of us had personally visited all the cited caves during a period of at least 20 years. The first biologic survey carried out in some submerged caves started only one year ago, but preliminary data already show numerous faunistic novelties either for the Italian peninsula or the entire Mediterranean area...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to show the {{relationship}} between karstic landforms and neo-tectonics in the southern sector of the Western Marsica region. The investigated area {{is located in the}} Colle Rotondo-Colle Terelle structure (southern Latium) between the towns of Pescosolido and Alvito. It is an elongated Apennine-trending morphological place, bounded by some of the most relevant regional tectonic features of the whole Apennines, such as the Simbruini-Ernici Mts. leading thrust and the Val Roveto-Atina-Caserta line. Here the Meso-Cenozoic carbonate deposits of the Latium-Abruzzi sequence, the Upper Miocene terrigenous and Plio-Quaternary continental deposits outcrop. In more detail the area belongs to a sector of the Apennines, which has been intensively deformed by Neogene-Quaternary compressional and extensional tectonics. This sector of the chain mostly formed in Neogene times {{in the context of the}} eastwards piggy-back propagation of thrust sequence and was broken up by Plio-Quaternary distensive tectonics. Intepretation of aerial photographs and field surveys allowed a detailed analysis of hydrography, karstic morphology and Quaternary tectonic evidence. The Colle Rotondo-Colle Terelle structure is a still active karstic area; the coexistence of epigeous forms and processes at different grades of evolution makes it a nearly unique zone. At the foot of the structure the copious Fibreno springs are located, which act as the present base level for <b>karstic</b> <b>erosion.</b> Along the Apenninic-trending tectonic alignments the greatest karstic phenomena of the whole area are present. The main dolines of the area, developed along tectonic directions with Apennine trend, show morphological evidence of stasis periods in their evolution, related with Quaternary tectonic activity. They are represented as different erosional surfaces within the dolines themselves as well as abandoned valleys. The analysis and classification of the both karstic forms and their mutual relationships show that the main Quaternary tectonic events modified the karstic morphogenesis...|$|E
