50|$|As {{with the}} 7.5 cm Pak 40, the muzzle brake of the KwK 40 and StuK 40 {{went through a}} series of design changes. Five types of muzzle brakes were used, {{gradually}} increasing the area of exposure to the blast. The designs progressed from tubular type double baffle muzzle brakes to single baffle ball shape muzzle brakes, which proved to be insufficient in reducing recoil, followed by a <b>double</b> <b>flange</b> type from May 1943. The front flange and rear disk type was used from March 1944, followed finally by the double disc type.|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic fluid {{collections}} (PFCs) {{represent a}} complication of acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic management of PFCs {{is an alternative}} to surgery [1]. Classic strategies include access to the collection under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guidance and placement of several double-pigtail stents. PFCs containing organized necrosis are classified as walled-off necrosis (WON). In those cases necrosis is hardly evacuated and will require necrosectomy in most cases. Every necrosectomy session needs prior removal of the stents, dilatation of the tract, debridement and placement of new stents adding up a considerable overall cost to the intervention. A novel double-flanged lumen-apposing fully-covered self-expandable metal stent (FC-SEMS) with a 15  mm diameter accelerates exit of the necrosis and facilitates multiple necrosectomy sessions. We present a 60 year old patient admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} for severe acute pancreatitis that developed WON with superinfection. The intensivists and surgeons indicated endoscopic cystgastrostomy to evacuate the collection. Using the echoendoscope we found a large collection adherent to the gastric wall. The collection was accessed under EUS-guidance using the Hot AXIOS™ catheter that features a cautery tip, then a 15  mm AXIOS™ stent was deployed through the cystgastrostomy orifice to keep it patent. The patient required two necrosectomy sessions to clean the cavity. The WON resolved in 6 weeks and the stent was removed unevently. The patient was discharged. A <b>double</b> <b>flange</b> lumen apposing FC-SEMS used as a port for necrosectomy significantly improves management of walled-off pancreatic necrosis. Placement of this stents should be considered when multiple necrosectomy sessions are anticipated. Procedure time can be significantly decreased using a catheter that combines a cautery tip and stent delivery system...|$|E
25|$|The Cable Car has two cars, which {{start from}} {{opposite}} ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley {{at the top of the}} hill. A 185kW 550V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have <b>double</b> <b>flanges,</b> while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Scientific American of 28 March 1891, {{the steam}} {{locomotive}} and cars were in regular and continuous operation for passenger service during several {{weeks in the}} summer of 1890. The service was provided between the Gravesend and Coney Island areas of Brooklyn, on an abandoned section of an old standard gauge track of the Sea Beach and Brighton Railroad. The first locomotive weighed nine tons, and had two 10 by 12 inch cylinders, the piston rods of both being connected with cranks on each side the single 6 foot driving wheel, and the front of the locomotive being also supported by two 38 inch pony wheels, one behind the other. These wheels had <b>double</b> <b>flanges,</b> to contact with either side of the track rail, as also had similarly arranged pairs of 38 inch wheels arranged under and housed in the floors near each end of the passenger cars.” ...|$|R
40|$|The fixture used to {{hold the}} IH module while the EC Calorimeter is pul led over it {{consists}} of two tripod frames with a <b>double</b> wide <b>flange</b> between them. The two tripods have legs made of 6 -inch Schedule 40 pipe, these legs are tied together with 2 -inch Schedule 40 pipe. One of the legs sits on and {{is attached to a}} box made of 3 / 4 -inch plates. The fixture was analyzed using ANSYS. The element used was a 3 -D beam (STIF 4). Equivalent properties were figured for the <b>double</b> wide <b>flange.</b> The legs of the tripods were constrained in the Y direction (vertical). The box {{at the bottom of the}} tripod leg was not used in this analysis, the leg was constrained at the point of attachment to the box. The cross beam was loaded at two points representing the IH load. The reaction force at the point where the tripod leg attaches to the box was then used in an analysis of the box itself. The box was modeled using plate elements (STIF 63). The bottom of the box was constrained in the Y (vertical) direction. The top of the box was loaded in roughly a circular area to represent the pipe attachment area. The reaction force from the previous analysis was divided among these nodes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Encapsulated O-rings are {{specifically}} designed {{to address the problem}} of sealing the most hostile chemicals and extreme temperature applications. Ultrasonic vibration hot embossing and ultrasonic welding techniques provide a fast and reliable method to fabricate encapsulated O-ring. This paper performs the design and analysis method of the acoustic horns with double extrusion to process tube <b>double</b> side <b>flange</b> simultaneously. The paper deals with study through Finite Element Method (FEM) of ultrasonic stepped horn used to process a capsulated O-ring, the theoretical dimensions of horns, and their natural frequencies and amplitudes are obtained through the simulations of COMOSOL software. Furthermore, real horns were fabricated, tested and verified to proof the practical utility of these horns.

5000|$|Further {{development}} of the classic effect is attributed to Ken Townsend, an engineer at EMI's Abbey Road Studio, who devised the process {{in the spring of}} 1966. Tired of laboriously re-recording dual vocal tracks, John Lennon asked Townsend if there was some way for the Beatles to get the sound of double-tracked vocals without doing the work. Townsend devised Artificial Double Tracking or ADT. According to historian Mark Lewisohn, it was Lennon who first called the technique [...] "flanging". Lennon asked George Martin to explain how ADT worked, and Martin answered with the nonsense explanation [...] "Now listen, it's very simple. We take the original image and we split it through a <b>double</b> vibrocated sploshing <b>flange</b> with <b>double</b> negative feedback". Lennon thought Martin was joking. Martin replied, [...] "Well, let's flange it again and see". From that point, when Lennon wanted ADT he would ask for his voice to be flanged, or call out for [...] "Ken's flanger". According to Lewisohn, the Beatles' influence meant the term [...] "flanging" [...] is still in use today, more than 40 years later. The first Beatles track to feature flanging was [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] from Revolver, which was recorded on April 6, 1966. When Revolver was released on August 5, 1966, almost every song had been subjected to flanging.|$|R
500|$|A {{key feature}} of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal {{processing}} {{to shape the}} sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented by Townsend during the Revolver sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music. Martin playfully explained to Lennon that his voice had been [...] "treated with a <b>double</b> vibrocated sploshing <b>flange...</b> It <b>doubles</b> your voice, John." [...] Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as flanging, a label that was universally adopted by the music industry. Another important effect was varispeeding. Martin cites [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] as having the most variations of tape speed on Sgt. Pepper. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.|$|R
