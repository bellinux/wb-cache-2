When ordered to give its signal letters, the ship hoisted four letters which were not listed in British signal books. Leander made the secret challenge but received no reply and the ship maintained its course and speed. A boarding party was standing by and at 11:45a.m., the ship was ordered to stop instantly but no reply was received.

At 11:53a.m., the Italian ship opened fire and thirty seconds later, Leander replied. The Italian fire was inaccurate and it was estimated that only about three shells were fired from each gun.|$|E

5000|$|On 22 February 1942 General MacArthur had {{requested}} direct support from Honolulu rather than Australia {{as it was}} lacking in resources. Within a day {{a very high level}} study of the situation concluded three old ex destroyers converted into fast commercial <b>fruit</b> <b>carriers,</b> now named Masaya, Matagalpa and Teapa, and recently taken over under bare boat charter by the War Department with intentions to use them as inter-island transports would be suited to that supply requirement. Under urgent Presidential orders to support the forces in Bataan and Corregidor the Army began to prepare the ships to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines. Cargoes were shipped to New Orleans for the three ships. They were originally due to sail on 28 February 1942 but difficulties, including securing naval gun crews [...] to put on the ships, delayed sailing. Masaya sailed on 2 March 1942, Matagalpa on 11 March and Teapa on 18 March. While the situation in the Philippines became desperate the three ships were forced to stop in Los Angeles for repair. On 13 April General MacArthur reported blockade running was [...] "useless," [...] but the War Department decided to make the attempt. The ships were reloaded with Matagalpa loaded for Mindanao and arriving in Honolulu on 8 May 1942, too late to relieve Corregidor. Matagalpa and the other ships intended for supply of the Philippines, were diverted to Australia.|$|R
40|$|Effect of carrier food type on {{in vitro}} {{gastrointestinal}} survival and adhesion ability of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB- 12 and Propionibacterium jensenii 702 were evaluated using goat's milk ice cream, plain and <b>fruit</b> yogurts. <b>Carrier</b> food matrix {{had a significant}} influence on the in vitro gastrointestinal tolerance of all three probiotics when exposed to both highly acidic conditions (pH 2. 0) and 0. 3 % bile. Exposure to conditions of lower pH (pH 2. 0) resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} probiotic viability during simulated gastric transit tolerance compared to pH levels of 3. 0 and 4. 0. However, ice cream was generally found to improve the acid and bile tolerance of the probiotics compared to plain and stirred fruit yogurts. In a similar manner, the in vitro adhesion ability of probiotics was found to be influenced by the carrier food matrix, with fruit yogurt providing the most favorable outcomes, although in all cases a substantial number of viable bacteria (10 ⁵– 10 ⁶ cfu/g) were able to attach to the Caco- 2 cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This work {{aimed to}} study the use of <b>fruit</b> salads as <b>carriers</b> for Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN 001. We {{evaluated}} the viability of this probiotic in fruit salads and the phsyico-chemical, microbiological and sensory properties of this food. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to verify microorganism adhesion on the fruit tissues. The viability of L. rhamnosus in fruit salads was 8. 49 log CFU. g- 1 after 120 hours. SEM images showed that fruit tissue provided protection for probiotic. Adhesion sites were observed in higher quantity in banana, apple and guava. The addition of L. rhamnosus did not alter texture of fruits (p > 0. 05). Fruit salads containing probiotic had different values of pH and acidity compared to the control (p 0. 05). Fruit salads containing L. rhamnosus showed counts of psychotrophic microorganisms of at least 2. 0 log CFU. g- 1 lower than control salad after 120 h of refrigerated storage. The fruit salad was well accepted by consumers. Therefore, this product {{can be used as}} a carrier for probiotic and an alternative to consuming functional foods...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{agriculture}} means increasing {{yields and}} profits without degrading {{the natural resources}} which {{are the most important}} for agricultural production. The aim is to meet the people’s needs for food and {{improve the quality of life}} while preserving the environment. Among hundreds of forest species, particular attention is drawn to the wild relatives of cultivated fruit trees, so called indigenous fruit trees, whose regular collection, production and use can affect all aspects of agricultural economy. The natural habitats of the Republic of Serbia include 15 families and 26 genera with 100 species of wild fruit trees. The primary use of the indigenous fruits is for human consumption (either fresh or processed). A number of wild relatives of cultivated fruit trees could be used in the future as rootstocks for fruit production, or for large-scale production, either organic or conventional. In addition, indigenous <b>fruit</b> species are <b>carriers</b> of genes for resistance to economically important diseases and pests, and they can be used in breeding of fruit trees and grapevines. Wild species of fruit trees are used as planting materials for afforestation and erosion prevention, some for timber production, as well as some decorative forms in landscape architecture, while some species are important bee pastures...|$|R
40|$|Modern drying {{technology}} {{provides the}} opportunity to obtain dried fruits with high concentrations of bioactive compounds. Such products may also be fortified with functional ingredients. The adoption of dried <b>fruit</b> as a <b>carrier</b> of functional ingredients for consumers is indispensable to launch this kind of product successfully on file market. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to collect data on consumer perceptions and interests in dried fruits (plain or fortified) through a questionnaire distributed on the Internet to 1, 092 Dutch, French, and Polish respondents. In this quantitative study, the respondents were first asked to rank statements about a product with different positive influences on human health. Products which lowered the risk of cancer or heart diseases were mainly of interest to Polish and Dutch respondents, whereas French consumers emphasised the prevention of intestinal problems. Furthermore, we checked the level of consumer interest in dried fruits enriched with a particular functional ingredient (e. g., anti-oxidants, natural fruit sugars, or prebiotics). Products with anti-oxidants seemed to be the most promising in all three countries investigated. Among five different forms of product (i. e., candy, fruit teas, cereals, bars, or cookies) in which dried fruit could be incorporated, cereals were selected by approx. 33 % of all respondents as the best product to which a functional dried fruit could be added. In summary, dried fruits can be adopted as carriers of functional ingredients, especially when promoted as a source of anti-oxidants...|$|R
