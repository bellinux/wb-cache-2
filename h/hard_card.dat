In November 2011, Faith No More reunited with Trey Spruance for a performance at the Maquinaria festival, during which the album was played in its entirety.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> {{has to be}} {{no longer}} than 10" [...] inches long, and 8 bit {{to work in a}} Tandy 1000 computer, and usually has to be in slot 1, because of the overhang. Unless one is willing to remove the case cover and modify the metal frame. The Tandy 1000 60 watt power supply is also under powered, so a lower powered <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> is preferable.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>cards</b> {{were the}} most {{desirable}} and easiest way to add a hard drive to the original Tandy 1000 lines that had 8-bit slots such as the Sx, Tx, Sl, Tl series. However Tandy offered a size reduced 10 1/2" [...] slot, where as Plus <b>hard</b> <b>cards</b> took a full length 13 inches.|$|R

5000|$|In 1985, Tandy {{introduced}} the Tandy 1000. Tandy offered its own proprietary <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> for $799 for 20meg. Only the Tandy 1000 {{that had an}} 8-bit slot could accommodate a <b>hard</b> <b>card,</b> preserving the drive bays for disk drives and cd-rom's. The 8-bit slots were electronically compatible slots, but the physical length was only 10 1/2 inch long instead of 13 inches long. As a result many hard drive cards such as Plus development would not fit within the size reduced case, and hence were not compatible. Thus hard cards had to be certified as Tandy compatible {{to see if they}} work in a Tandy 1000 model such as the sx, tx, sl, tl series. It is possible to get a Plus development <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> to work on a tandy 1000, provided that the plastic case is completely removed and metal frame is cut, to allow the longer card 13" [...] card to fit.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> is {{the only}} way to add a hard drive {{internally}} to a Tandy, while leaving the drive bays open to accept either 3.5" [...] or 5 1/4" [...] floppy, or even a CD-ROM in some models.|$|E
50|$|There were autographed {{versions}} of a few key players. By far the <b>hardest</b> <b>card</b> to find was the Babe Ruth Card. There were two separate Babe Ruth issues, the Piece of History card (Run of 350) and the Piece of History 500 (print run of only 50). These cards were scattered across various Upper Deck 1999 brands and into some year 2000 products. Upper Deck also issued cards of other members that have joined the club over the years. These have included cards of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey, Jr., Rafael Palmiero, Frank Thomas and Jim Thome.|$|R

5000|$|Hard cards usually must {{be placed}} in slot 1 in order to fit without cutting the metal frame and {{removing}} the case cover (which is also a way to accommodate a 13" [...] card). The Tandy 1000 60 watt power supply is relatively low-powered, so an energy-efficient <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> is preferable.|$|E

It is a Texas gambling song that was popularized by Blind Lemon Jefferson. It was sung by railroad men who had lost money playing conquian. At least twelve white artists recorded the tune before World War II. The song has been recorded under various titles such as [...] "A Corn Licker Still in Georgia" [...] (Riley Puckett) and [...] "Rye Whiskey" [...] (Tex Ritter).|$|E

5000|$|Tandy used {{industry}} standard 8-bit XT ISA slots in their desktop models, including the 1000sx, tx, sl, tl series, {{but the actual}} length was limited to 10.5 inches or shorter, and not the {{industry standard}} XT length of 13 inches. 8-bit XT ISA cards {{would have to have}} a physical length shorter than 10.5" [...] to be able to fit in the case. Many 8-bit cards that met this length requirement include modem cards, sound cards, graphics cards such as second generation EGA and VGA, network cards, 286 express etc. Some cards required the standard 13" [...] length such as <b>hard</b> <b>cards</b> and EMS memory cards and multifunction cards would not fit in the tandy 1000 case.|$|R
5000|$|Hard cards—a {{hard drive}} and drive {{controller}} combination that fits {{in a single}} ISA slot—were a way to add hard disk capacity while preserving the drive bays for disk drives and CD-ROMS. The first such <b>hard</b> <b>card</b> was released in October 1985 by Plus Development. However, these cards and similar designs from other companies were 13 inches long; since Tandy 1000 card slots are only 10.5" [...] long and are 8-bit only, hard cards had to be certified as Tandy-compatible to verify whether they would work in a Tandy 1000 model such as the SX, TX, SL, and TL series.|$|E

5000|$|The cost of {{flash memory}} is high as {{compared}} to <b>hard</b> disk. Memory <b>card</b> (for example, CompactFlash) with a 192 MB capacity typically costs more than a hard drive with a capacity of 40 GB.|$|R
50|$|Compact Flash (CF) cards {{can be used}} as {{secondary}} storage. Because {{they use}} a slightly modified Parallel ATA (PATA) interface, a simple adapter is all that is needed to connect CF cards to function as an PATA or PC <b>Card</b> <b>hard</b> disk. CF <b>cards</b> are also small, allowing SFF PCs to be made, produce no noise, use very little power (further reducing heat output in the AC/DC conversion in the PSU), and an insignificant amount of heat. However, they are very expensive per GB and are only available in small capacities and there are also issues regarding the maximum number of writes to each sector.|$|R

50|$|The {{duplicate}} Harvard architecture {{central processor}} or CC (Central Control) for the 1ESS operated at approximately 200 kHz. It comprised five bays, each two meters high and totaling about four meters in length per CC. Packaging was in cards approximately 4x10 inches (10x25 centimeters) {{with an edge}} connector in the back. Backplane wiring was cotton covered wire-wrap wires, not ribbons or other cables. CPU logic was implemented using discrete diode-transistor logic. One <b>hard</b> plastic <b>card</b> commonly held the components necessary to implement, for example, two gates or a flipflop.|$|R

5000|$|Larger {{organisation}} or shredding services sometimes use [...] "mobile shredding trucks", typically {{constructed as}} a box truck with an industrial-size paper shredder mounted inside and space for storage of the shredded materials.

50|$|Within {{one year}} of the Plus Development {{introduction}} of Hardcard, 28 companies had released similar products. At that time, {{all of the other}} products were using a standard hard drive with a 1.6 inch/40.6 mm height forcing the card to hang over the adjacent PC slot. The hard drive was located on the opposite side away from the connector sometimes enabling a short half-length expansion card to be installed in the adjacent slot. These <b>hard</b> drive <b>cards</b> were usually described as occupying 1.5 expansion slots.Below are some of companies and product names with a similar product to the Plus Hardcard.|$|R
50|$|Type-III PC Card {{devices are}} 16-bit or 32-bit. These cards are 10.5 mm thick, {{allowing}} them to accommodate devices with components that would not fit type I or type II height. Examples are <b>hard</b> disk drive <b>cards,</b> and interface cards with full-size connectors {{that do not require}} dongles (as is commonly required with type II interface cards).|$|R
5000|$|Generally, one card can {{be moved}} at a time. The most {{prevalent}} rule regarding moves of sequences is that sequences {{can be moved}} as a whole. However, there is a rule set which does not allow moving groups of cards, effectively making the game <b>harder</b> (mentioned in <b>Card</b> Games Made Easy by Marks and Harrod, [...] ).|$|R
