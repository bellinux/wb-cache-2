40|$|We visualized the {{epicardial}} capillary {{network of}} the beating canine heart in vivo, using our high resolution intravital CCD videomicroscopy system, {{in order to}} elucidate its functional role under control conditions and during reactive hyperemia (RH). We used 10 hearts of open chest, anesthetized dogs. The pencil-lens videomicroscope probe was placed over capillaries fed by the left anterior descending artery in A-V blocked hearts paced at 60 - 90 beats per minute. In individual capillaries under control conditions flow was predominant either during systole or during diastole, indicating that the watershed between diastolic arterial and systolic venous flows is located within capillaries. The capillary flow increased rapidly during RH and reached a peak flow-velocity (2. 0 ± 0. 2 mm/s), {{twice as high as}} the control flow-velocity (1. 0 ± 0. 3 mm/s), with enhancement of intercapillary cross-connection flow. Furthermore, the mean diameter increased by 15 % compared with the control value, additionally facilitating oxygen supply to myocardial cells, but there was a time lag of about 1. 5 s for refilling the capillaries, indicating their function as capacitance vessels during RH. In conclusion, the coronary capillary network functions as 1) the major watershed between diastolic-dominant arterial and systolic-dominant venous flows, 2) a capacitor, and 3) a local <b>flow</b> <b>amplifier</b> and homogenizer of blood supply during RH...|$|E

40|$|The {{researchers}} use a 32 cm plasma electrode Pockels cell (PEPC) prototype at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{to determine}} switching {{performance in the}} presence of external magnetic fields. The interaction with external magnetic fields is important because of the B-fields generated by the high current <b>flow</b> through <b>amplifier</b> flashlamp arrays, and their proximity to the PEPC. We have experimentally determined what is the maximum allowable magnetic induction for good PEPC operation, and then calculate the magnetic induction generated by a flashlamp array to determine the minimum PEPC to amplifier spacing. The researchers have also experimentally determined the effect of a tandem PEPC placement. Several cathode designs are considered. The researchers revisit the hollow cathode design and investigate the tradeoffs between the hollow cathode and planar magnetron. The recent development of a metallic body for the future lx 2 PEPC has led to experiments with a biased boundary in the PEPC.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for synthesizing low-power Nested Transconductance(G m) -Capacitance Compensation (NGCC) amplifiers through global optimization over generally nonconvex polynomials. Specifically, a nonconvex optimization problem is formulated, which is then efficiently solved through convex programming techniques based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxation. Such framework allows both polynomial inequality and equality constraints, thereby facilitating more accurate transistor modelings. Compared to conventional nonlinear programming (NLP) approach such as genetic algorithm (GA), the proposed methodology exhibits superior computational efficiency, and guarantees convergence to globally optimal parameters.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{address the}} issues of design automation of analog and mixed signal CMOS circuits. An interactive platform has been created {{for the design of}} CMOS circuits. The user interactive design platform generates device sizes and operating points from a given set of specifications and provides an easy to use interface in-order to tune the performance of the circuit for a given application. A novel combination of a knowledge-based circuit parameter estimation and a simulation driven design flow is used for the design of these circuits. The tool also provides a variety of outputs including a Spice netlist, plots for transient, DC and AC analysis and a tabulated overall system description. ^ In-order to validate the performance of the design <b>flow,</b> three <b>amplifier</b> topologies namely a two-stage miller compensated circuit, a transconductance and a folded cascode amplifier have been designed. Each of these amplifier topologies have been implemented using different process parameters and supply voltages. Mixed signal circuits such as analog to digital converters, specifically the pipeline and SAR (successive approximation register) architectures have been implemented using this design flow. Finally a selection criterion for amplifier as well as analog to digital data converters(ADC) has been designed. ...|$|R
40|$|Closed-loop {{control of}} an <b>amplifier</b> <b>flow</b> is {{experimentally}} investigated. A feed-forward algorithm is implemented {{to control the}} flow downstream a backward-facing step. Upstream and downstream data are extracted from real-time velocity fields to compute an ARMAX model used to effect actuation. This work, done at Reynolds number 430 investigates the practical feasibility of this approach which has shown great promise in a recent numerical study by Hervé et al (2012). The linear nature of the regime is checked, 2 D upstream perturbations are introduced, {{and the degree to}} which the flow can be controlled is quantified. The resulting actuation is able to effectively reduce downstream energy levels and fluctuations. The limitations and difficulties of applying such an approach to an experiment are also emphasized...|$|R
40|$|A general {{formulation}} {{is proposed}} {{to control the}} integral amplification factor of harmonic disturbances in weakly non-parallel <b>amplifier</b> <b>flows.</b> The sensitivity of the local spatial stability spectrum to a base-flow modification is first determined, generalizing the results of Bottaro et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 476, 2003, pp. 293 - 302). This result is then {{used to evaluate the}} sensitivity of the overall spatial growth to a modification of the inlet flow condition. This formalism is applied to a non-parallel Batchelor vortex, which is a well-known model for trailing vortices generated by a lifting wing. The resulting sensitivity map indicates the optimal modification of the inlet flow condition enabling the stabilization of the helical modes. It is shown that the control, formulated using a single linearization of the flow dynamics carried out on the uncontrolled configuration, successfully reduces the total spatial amplification of all convectively unstable disturbances...|$|R
40|$|The {{oscillating}} LPA(Laminar Proportional <b>Amplifier)</b> <b>flow</b> sensor having bilateral feedback loops {{is available}} for the measurement of small volume flow. Pattern of LPA and feedback loops were sculpted on a flat plane. The relationship between the oscillating frequency and the geometry of the oscillating LPA flow sensors were measured. As the result of experiments, it was appeared that the oscillating frequency of the oscillating LPA flow sensor closely connected with the geometry and the sizes of the sensor, and the signal transport time through the feedback loop was about a half of the acoustic time delay, and it was proved that the signal transport time on the supply jet from the supply nozzle to the splitter were occupied about 60 % of the oscillating frequency. It was demonstrated that the range ability of the oscillating LPA flow sensor could be extended by arranging the pattern of LPA and feedback loops in the same plane...|$|R
40|$|Convectively {{unstable}} <b>flows</b> {{behave as}} <b>amplifiers,</b> and their laminar region {{can be extended}} by lowering the level of external disturbances. At first sight, complete laminarization appears possible in principle. However, it was sometimes {{pointed out in the}} past (e. g. Betchov 1961) that the velocity fluctuations associated with molecular agitation (those responsible of thermal noise and Brownian motion) in a fluid are 80 to 100 dB below the level of turbulent fluctuations, and thus of the order of magnitude required to provoke transition. Nevertheless, quantitative receptivity calculations have only ever been applied to external disturbances of acoustic or vortical origin or due to surface roughness, omitting thermal noise. Here the amplification of thermal noise by a boundary layer is explicitly computed, confirming that transition can be induced in this way. Therefore, even in a perfect environment with zero disturbances the extent of laminar flow is bounded. In addition, this computed upper bound is not far from practically observed transition lengths, implying that in some environments external disturbances may actually be negligible, and knowledge of their level unneeded to predict transition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceControl of <b>amplifier</b> <b>flows</b> poses a great challenge, {{since the}} {{influence}} of environmental noise sources and measurement contamination is a crucial component {{in the design of}} models and the subsequent performance of the controller. A model-based approach that makes a priori assumptions on the noise characteristics often yields unsatisfactory results when the true noise environment is different from the assumed one. An alternative approach is proposed that consists of a data-based system-identification technique for modelling the flow; it avoids the model-based shortcomings by directly incorporating noise influences into an auto-regressive (ARMAX) design. This technique is applied to flow over a backward-facing step, a typical example of a noise-amplifier flow. Physical insight into the specifics of the flow is used to interpret and tailor the various terms of the auto-regressive model. The designed compensator shows an impressive performance as well as a remarkable robustness to increased noise levels and to off-design operating conditions. Owing to its reliance on only time-sequences of observable data, the proposed technique should be attractive in the design of control strategies directly from experimental data and should result in effective compensators that maintain performance in a realistic disturbance environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnsteadiness in noise <b>amplifier</b> <b>flows</b> {{is driven}} and {{sustained}} by upstream environmental perturbations. A dynamic mode decomposition performed with snapshots {{taken in the}} statistically steady state extracts marginally stable dynamic modes, which mimic the sustained dynamics but miss the actual intrinsic stable behaviour of these flows. In this study, we present an alternative data-driven technique which attempts to identify and separate the intrinsic linear stable behaviour from the driving term. This technique uses a system-identification algorithm to extract a reduced state-space model of the flow from time-dependent input–output data. Such a model accurately predicts {{the values of the}} velocity field (output) from measurements of an upstream sensor that captures the effect of the incoming perturbations (input). The methodology is illustrated on a two-dimensional boundary layer subject to Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities, a canonical example of flow acting as a noise amplifier. The spectrum of the identified model compares well with the results reported in literature for the full-order system. Yet the comparison appears to be only qualitative, due to the poor robustness properties of eigenvalue spectra in noise-amplifier flows. We therefore advocate the use of the frequency response between the upstream sensor and the flow dynamics, which is revealed to be a robust quantity. The frequency response is validated against full-order computations and compares well with a local spatial stability analysis...|$|R
40|$|A new {{framework}} {{for the analysis of}} unstable oscillator flows is explored. In linear settings, temporally growing perturbations in a non-parallel flow represent unstable eigenmodes of the linear flow operator. In nonlinear settings, self-sustained periodic oscillations of finite amplitude are commonly described as nonlinear global modes. In both cases the flow dynamics may be qualified as being endogenous, as opposed to the exogenous behaviour of <b>amplifier</b> <b>flows</b> driven by external forcing. This paper introduces the endogeneity concept, a specific definition of the sensitivity of the global frequency and growth rate with respect to variations of the flow operator. The endogeneity, defined both in linear and nonlinear settings, characterizes the contribution of localized flow regions to the global eigendynamics. It is calculated in a simple manner as the local point-wise inner product between the time derivative of the direct flow state and an adjoint mode. This study demonstrates for two canonical examples, the Ginzburg-Landau equation and the wake of a circular cylinder, how an analysis based on the endogeneity may be used for a physical discussion of the mechanisms that drive a global instability. The results are shown to be consistent with earlier 'wavemaker' definitions found in the literature, but the present formalism enables a more detailed discussion: a clear distinction is made between oscillation frequency and growth rate, and individual contributions from the various terms of the flow operator can be isolated and separately discussed.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} backward-facing step flow is a canonical {{example of}} noise amplifier flow: global linear stability analysis predicts {{that it is}} stable, but perturbations can undergo large amplification {{in space and time}} as a result of non-normal effects. This amplification potential is best captured by optimal transient growth analysis, optimal harmonic forcing, or the response to sustained noise. In view of reducing disturbance amplification in these globally stable open flows, a variational technique is proposed to evaluate the sensitivity of stochastic amplification to steady control. Existing sensitivity methods are extended in two ways to achieve a realistic representation of incoming noise: (i) perturbations are time-stochastic rather than time-harmonic, (ii) perturbations are localised at the inlet rather than distributed in space. This allows for the identification of regions where small-amplitude control is the most effective, without actually computing any controlled flows. In particular, passive control by means of a small cylinder and active control by means of wall blowing/suction are analysed for Reynolds number Re= 500 and step-to-outlet expansion ratio Γ= 0. 5. Sensitivity maps for noise amplification appear largely similar to sensitivity maps for optimal harmonic amplification at the most amplified frequency. This is observed at other values of Re and Γ too, and suggests that the design of steady control in this noise <b>amplifier</b> <b>flow</b> can be simplified by focusing on the most dangerous perturbation at the most dangerous frequency.

40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{and reach}} of jets issuing from tangential control ports at {{the periphery of}} a vortex amplifier’s swirl chamber depend largely on design geometry, size and pressures applied. Excessive control port pressure causes these jets to extend too far {{across the face of}} the radial supply ports, to impact on the opposing supply port wall whereupon, they bifurcate to create back diffusion of control port flow along the supply port channels. <b>Flow</b> through vortex <b>amplifier</b> geometry is simulated using a baseline Reynolds stress turbulence model with CFX automatic wall treatment. Anisotropic stress and vortex stretching in the swirl chamber and outlet have not prevented convergence (based on normalised vortex <b>amplifier</b> residuals). Known <b>flow</b> structures are reproduced. This paper is focussed on simulation close to pressures needed for bifurcation. Just before the point on an operating characteristic at which bifurcated tangential flow appears, the recirculation zone crossing most of the radial supply stretches to intermittently cut off the radial flow. The steady state results indicate asymmetry between the four ports, as smoke visualisation tests also imply. The transient results are sufficient to demonstrate time-dependent structures and suggest periodicity of flow structures. The model can be used to inform design and operability studies. Moreover, a curious near-wall structure of spinning flow not previously reported has been predicted close to the axis and hugging the swirl chamber wall opposite the outlet, at radii within the forced part of the Rankine vortex...|$|R
50|$|The SNSPD {{consists}} of a thin (≈ 5 nm) and narrow (≈ 100 nm) superconducting nanowire. The length is typically hundreds of micrometers, and the nanowire is patterned in a compact meander geometry to create a square or circular pixel with high detection efficiency. The nanowire is cooled well below its superconducting critical temperature and biased with a DC current that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current of the nanowire. A photon incident on the nanowire breaks Cooper pairs and reduces the local critical current below that of the bias current. This results {{in the formation of}} a localized non-superconducting region, or hotspot, with finite electrical resistance. This resistance is typically larger than the 50 ohm input impedance of the readout amplifier, and hence most of the bias current is shunted to the amplifier. This produces a measurable voltage pulse that is approximately equal to the bias current multiplied by 50 ohms. With most of the bias current <b>flowing</b> through the <b>amplifier,</b> the non-superconducting region cools and returns to the superconducting state. The time for the current to return to the nanowire is typically set by the inductive time constant of the nanowire, equal to the kinetic inductance of the nanowire divided by the impedance of the readout circuit. Proper self-resetting of the device requires that this inductive time constant be slower than the intrinsic cooling time of the nanowire hotspot.|$|R
40|$|Designing analog {{circuits}} {{that can}} operate from low supply voltages has become of increasing importance in recent years. The {{rapid growth of}} battery operated portable devices and biomedical implant systems require low power dissipation to achieve long battery life and minimum battery size. The ever-increasing trend in the density of integrated circuits and smaller feature sizes has necessitated the supply voltage to be scaled down {{in order to reduce}} power dissipation and maintain reliability. Reducing supply voltage {{is one of the most}} effective ways to achieve low power dissipation. Within these low voltage integrated circuits, the analog circuits are always suffering from poor performance and become the bottleneck of the system. The objective of this thesis is to develop circuit techniques for the realisation of high performance low voltage CMOS operational amplifiers and digital-to-analog converters. In order to support the digital-to-analog converter and other mixed-signal systems, high speed and low voltage digital logic circuit technique was also developed for standard CMOS process. By studying both conventional and recent developments in analog circuit designs, reduction in supply voltage is always limited. Due to the fundamental limitation of transistor threshold voltage, alternative design techniques must be employed to further reduce the supply voltage. Several novel circuit techniques have been proposed in this thesis to regain circuit performance under low voltage condition. These include the reduction in transistor stacking to maximize the gate-source voltage, the use of floating-gate devices to perform dual functions in a single transistor, and by driving the back gate of a transistor to explore the extra current <b>flow.</b> Three operational <b>amplifiers,</b> three digital-to-analog converters and some high-speed digital circuits have been designed and fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed techniques. All designed circuits are operated in genuinely low voltage as neither low threshold devices or charge pump circuitry is used. Experimental results are presented to show that supply voltage range from as low as 0. 9 V is sufficient...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA realistic, {{efficient}} and robust technique {{for the control}} of <b>amplifier</b> <b>flows</b> has been investigated. Since this type of fluid system is extremely sensitive to upstream environmental noise, an accurate model capturing the influence of these perturbations is needed. A subspace identification algorithm {{is not only a}} convenient and effective way of constructing this model, it is also re a l is tic {{in the sense that it}} is based on input and output data measurements only and does not require other information from the detailed dynamics of the fluid system. This data-based control design has been tested on an amplifier model derived from the Ginzburg-Landau equation, and no significant loss of efficiency has been observed when using the identified instead of the exact model. Even though system identification leads to a realistic control design, other issues such as state estimation, have to be addressed to achieve full control efficiency. In particular, placing a sensor too far downstream is detrimental, since it does not provide an estimate of incoming perturbations. This has been made clear and quantitative by considering the relative estimation error and, more appropriately, the concept of a visibility length, a measure of how far upstream a sensor is able to accurately estimate the flow state. It has been demonstrated that a strongly convective system is characterized by a correspondingly small visibility length. In fact, in the latter case the optimal sensor placement has been found upstream of the actuators, and only this configuration was found to yield an efficient control performance. This upstream sensor placement suggests the use of a feed-forward approach for fluid systems with strong convection. Furthermore, treating upstream sensors as inputs in the identification procedure results in a very {{efficient and}} robust control. When validated on the Ginzburg-Landau model this technique is effective, and it is comparable to the optimal upper bound, given by full-state control, when the amplifier behaviour becomes convection-dominated. These concepts and findings have been extended and verified for flow over a backward-facing step at a Reynolds number Re = 350. Environmental noise has been introduced by three independent, localized sources. A very satisfactory control of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability has been obtained with a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in the averaged perturbation norm. The above observations have been further confirmed by examining a low-order model problem that mimics a convection-dominated flow but allows the explicit computation of control-relevant measures such as observability. This study casts doubts on the usefulness of the asymptotic notion of observability for convection-dominated flows, since such flows are governed by transient effects. Finally, it is shown that the feed-forward approach is equivalent to an optimal linear-quadratic-Gaussian control for spy sensors placed sufficiently far upstream or for sufficiently convective flows. The control design procedure presented in this paper, consisting of data-based subspace identification and feed-forward control, was found to be effective and robust. Its implementation in a real physical experiment may confidently be carried out...|$|R
40|$|While {{a lot of}} {{time and}} {{resources}} have been placed into transceiver design, due to the pace of a conventional engineering design process, the design of a power amplifier is often completed using scattered resources; and not always in a methodological manner, and frequently even by an iterative trial and error process. In this thesis, a research question is posed which enables for the investigation of the possibility of streamlining the design <b>flow</b> for power <b>amplifiers.</b> After thorough theoretical investigation of existing power amplifier design methods and modelling, inductors inevitably used in power amplifier design were identified as a major drawback to efficient design, even when examples of inductors are packaged in design HIT-Kits. The main contribution of this research is engineering of an inductor design process, which in-effect contributes towards enhancing conventional power amplifiers. This inductance search algorithm finds the highest quality factor configuration of a single-layer square spiral inductor within certain tolerance using formulae for inductance and inductor parasitics of traditional single-π inductor model. Further contribution of this research is a set of algorithms for the complete design of switch-mode (Class-E and Class-F) power amplifiers and their output matching networks. These algorithms make use of classic deterministic design equations so that values of parasitic components can be calculated given input parameters, including required output power, centre frequency, supply voltage, and choice of class of operation. The hypothesis was satisfied for SiGe BiCMOS S 35 process from Austriamicrosystems (AMS). Several metal- 3 and thick-metal inductors were designed using the abovementioned algorithm and compared with experimental results provided by AMS. Correspondence was established between designed, experimental and EM simulation results, enabling qualification of inductors other than those with experimental results available from AMS by means of EM simulations with average relative errors of 3. 7 % for inductors and 21 % for the Q factor at its peak frequency. For a wide range of inductors, Q-factors of 10 and more were readily experienced. Furthermore, simulations were performed for number of Class-E and Class-F amplifier configurations with HBTs with ft greater than 60 GHz and total emitter area of 96 μm² as driving transistors to complete the hypothesis testing. For the complete PA system design (including inductors), simulations showed that switch-mode power amplifiers for 50 Ω load at 2. 4 GHz centre frequency can be designed using the streamlined method of this research for the output power of about 6 dB less than aimed. This power loss was expected, since it can be attributed to non-ideal properties of the driving transistor and Q-factor limitations of the integrated inductors, assumptions which the computations of the routine were based on. Although these results were obtained for a single micro-process, it was further speculated that outcome of this research has a general contribution, since streamlined method can be used with a much wider range of CMOS and BiCMOS processes, when low-gigahertz operating power amplifiers are needed. This theory was confirmed by means of simulation and fabrication in 180 nm BiCMOS process from IBM, results of which were also presented. The work presented here, was combined with algorithms for SPICE netlist extraction and the spiral inductor layout extraction (CIF and GDSII formats). This secondary research outcome further contributed to the completeness of the design flow. All the above features showed that the routine developed here is substantially better than cut-and-try methods for design of power amplifiers found in the existing body of knowledge.
