2500|$|The source {{locations}} can {{be combined}} with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to create magnetic source images (MSI). [...] The two sets of data are combined by measuring {{the location of a}} common set of <b>fiducial</b> points marked during MRI with lipid markers and marked during MEG with electrified coils of wire that give off magnetic fields. [...] The locations of the <b>fiducial</b> points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional MEG data onto the structural MRI data ("coregistration") is possible.|$|E

[...] By this method, functional information from SPECT or positron emission tomography can be related to anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Similarly, <b>fiducial</b> points established during MRI can be correlated with brain images generated by magnetoencephalography to localize the source of brain activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a 4 D inverse {{planning}} strategy capable of controlling the appearance of the implanted <b>fiducial(s)</b> in segmented IMRT fields for cine MV or combined MV∕kV image-guided IMRT. This work is focused on enhancing the visibility of the implanted <b>fiducial(s)</b> in 4 D IMRT inverse planning, whose goal is to derive a set of time-resolved (or phase-tagged) MLC segments to cater for the motion of the patient anatomy extracted from the emerging 4 D images. The task is to optimize the shapes and weights of all the segments for each incident beam, with the <b>fiducial(s)</b> being forced∕encouraged to be inside the segmented fields. The system is modeled by a quadratic objective function with inclusion of a hard∕soft constraint characterizing the authors’ level of preference for the <b>fiducial(s)</b> to be included in the segmented fields. A simulated annealing algorithm is employed to optimize the system. The proposed technique is demonstrated using two clinical cases. A segment-based inverse planning framework for 4 D radiation therapy, capable of providing tempospatially optimized IMRT plans, has been established. Furthermore, using the described 4 D optimization approach, it is demonstrated that the MLC blockage of the implanted <b>fiducial(s)</b> during the segmented delivery is avoided without severely compromising the final dose distribution. The visibility of implanted <b>fiducials</b> in 4 D IMRT can be improved without significantly deteriorating final dose distribution. This is a foundation for the authors to use cine MV or combined MV∕KV to effectively guide the 4 D IMRT delivery...|$|R

2500|$|Fermilab {{has been}} {{approved}} and currently stands {{to become the world}} leader in Neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility.

Fermilab will be the site of LBNF's future beamline, and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), in Lead, SD, is the site selected to house the massive far detector. The term [...] "baseline" [...] refers to the distance between the neutrino source and the detector. The far detector current design is for four modules of instrumented liquid argon with a <b>fiducial</b> volume of 10 kilotons each. The first two modules are expected to be complete in 2024, with the beam operational in 2026. The final module is planned to be operational in 2027.|$|E
60|$|For {{convenience}} in enlarging or reducing, I {{take care}} that {{the intersection of}} the vertical <b>fiducial</b> line with that which passes through the pupils of the eyes shall correspond to the optical axis of the camera. Then, as I enlarge or reduce, that point in the image remains fixed. The uppermost horizontal <b>fiducial</b> line continues to intersect the pupils, and the vertical one continues to divide the face symmetrically. The mouth has alone to be watched. When the mouth is adjusted to the lower <b>fiducial</b> line, the scale is exact. It is a great help having to attend to no more than one varying element. The only inconvenience is that the image does not lie in the best position on the plate when the point between the eyes occupies its centre. This is easily remedied by using a larger back with a suitable inner frame. I have a more elaborate contrivance in my apparatus to produce the same result, which I need not stop to explain.|$|E
60|$|As {{regards the}} <b>fiducial</b> lines, {{they might be}} drawn on the glass screen; but black lines are not, I find, the best. It is far easier to work with {{illuminated}} lines; {{and it is important}} to be able to control their brightness. I produce these lines by means of a vertical transparency, set in an adjustable frame, connected with A, and having a gas-light behind it. Below the eye-hole e, through which I view the glass-screen g, is a thin piece of glass set at an angle of 45°, which reflects the <b>fiducial</b> lines and gives them the appearance of lying on the screen, the frame being so adjusted that the distance from the thin piece of glass to the transparency and to the glass-screen g is the same. I thus obtain beautiful <b>fiducial</b> lines, which I can vary from extreme faintness to extreme brilliancy, by turning the gas lower or higher, according to the brightness of the image of the portrait, which itself depends on the density of the transparency that I am engaged upon. This arrangement seems as good as can be. It affords a gauge of the density of the negative, and enables me to regulate the burners behind it, until the image of the portrait on g is adjusted to a standard degree of brightness.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} <b>fiducials</b> for precise image {{registration}} is of major practical importance in computer vision, especially in automatic inspection applications. We analyze the subpixel registration accuracy that can, and cannot, {{be achieved by}} some rotation-invariant <b>fiducials,</b> and present and analyze efficient algorithms for the registration procedure. We rely on some old and new results from lattice geometry and number theory and efficient computational-geometric methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{location}} and auto-alignment of sample <b>fiducials</b> for sample registration using widely available MATLAB/LabVIEW software is demonstrated. The method is robust, easily implemented, and applicable {{to a wide variety}} of experiment types for improved reproducibility and increased setup speed. The software uses image processing to locate and measure the diameter and center point of circular <b>fiducials</b> for distance self-calibration and iterative alignment and can be used with most imaging systems. The method is demonstrated to be fast and reliable in locating and aligning sample <b>fiducials,</b> provided here by a nanofabricated array, with accuracy within the optical resolution of the imaging system. The software was further demonstrated to register, load, and sample the dynamically wetted array...|$|R
50|$|Using three <b>fiducials</b> {{enables the}} machine to {{determine}} offset in both the X and Y axes, {{as well as to}} determine if the board has rotated during clamping, allowing {{the machine to}} rotate parts to be placed to match. Parts requiring a very high degree of placement precision, such as ball grid array packages, may have additional <b>fiducials</b> near the package placement area of the board to further fine-tune the targeting.|$|R
6000|$|... e The eye-hole {{through which}} the image is viewed on g; a thin piece of glass {{immediately}} below e, reflects the illuminated <b>fiducial</b> lines in the transparency at f, and gives them the appearance of lying upon g,--the distances f e and g e being made equal, the angle f e g being made a right angle, and {{the plane of the}} thin piece of glass being made to bisect f e g.|$|E
60|$|The apparatus, {{so far as}} it {{has been}} {{described}} with any detail, and ignoring what was said about an eye-hole, is little else than a modified copying-camera, by which an image of the transparency could be thrown on the ordinary focusing-screen, and be altered in scale and position until it was adjusted to <b>fiducial</b> lines drawn on the screen. It is conceivable that this should be done, and that the screen should be replaced by the dark slide, and a brief exposure given to the plate; then, that a fresh transparency should be inserted, a fresh focusing adjustment made, and a second exposure given, and so on. This, I say, is conceivable, but it would be very inconvenient. The adjusting screws would be out of reach; the head of the operator would be in an awkward position; and though these two difficulties might be overcome in some degree, a serious risk of an occasional shift of the plate during the frequent replacement of the dark slide would remain. I avoid all this by making my adjustments while the plate continues in position with its front open. I do so through the help of a reflector temporarily interposed between it and the lens. I do not use the ordinary focusing-screen at all in making my adjustments, but one that is flush, or nearly so, with the roof of the camera. When the reflector is interposed, the image is wholly cut off from the sensitised plate, and is thrown upwards against this focusing-screen, g. When the reflector is withdrawn, the image falls on the plate. It is upon this focusing-screen in the roof that I see the <b>fiducial</b> lines by which I make all the adjustments. Nothing can be more convenient than the position of this focusing-screen for working purposes. I look down on the image as I do upon a book resting on a sloping desk, and all the parts of the apparatus are within an easy arm's length.|$|E
60|$|The next is {{a series}} of four composites. The first {{consists}} of 57 hospital patients suffering under one or other of the many forms of consumption. I may say that, with the aid of Dr. Mahomed, I am endeavouring to utilise this process to elicit the physiognomy of disease. The composite I now show is what I call a hotch-pot composite; its use is to form a standard whence deviations towards any particular sub-type may be conveniently gauged. It will be observed that the face is strongly marked, and that it is quite idealised. I claim for composite portraiture, that it affords a method of obtaining pictorial averages, which effects simultaneously for every point in a picture what a method of numerical averages would do for each point in the picture separately. It gives, in short, the average tint of every unit of area in the picture, measured from the <b>fiducial</b> lines as co-ordinates. Now every statistician knows, by experience, that numerical averages usually begin to agree pretty fairly when we deal with even twenty or thirty cases. Therefore we should expect to find that any groups of twenty or thirty men of the same class would yield composites bearing a considerable likeness to one another. In proof that this is the case, I exhibit three other composites: the one is made from the first 28 portraits of the 57, the second from the last 27, and the third is made from 36 portraits taken indiscriminately out of the 57. It will be observed that all the four composites are closely alike.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fiducials</b> {{imprinted}} on laser beams {{are used to}} perform video image based alignment of the beams in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In any laser beam alignment operation, a beam needs to be aligned to a reference location. Generally, the beam and reference <b>fiducials</b> are composed of separate beams, as a result only a single feature of each beam needs to be identified for determining {{the position of the}} beam or reference. However, it is possible to have the same beam image contain both the beam and reference <b>fiducials.</b> In such instances, it is essential to separately identify these features. In the absence of wavefront correction or when image quality is poor, the features of such beams may get distorted making it difficult to distinguish between different <b>fiducials.</b> Error checking and correction mechanism must be implemented to avoid misidentification of one type of feature as the other. This work presents the algorithm for multi-object detection and error correction implemented for such a beam line image in the NIF facility. Additionally, we show how when the original algorithm fails a secondary algorithm takes over and provides required location outputs...|$|R

50|$|However, <b>fiducial</b> {{inference}} {{is still}} being studied and its principles appear valuable for some scientific applications.

5000|$|Unfortunately Fisher did {{not give}} a general {{definition}} of the <b>fiducial</b> method and he denied that the method could always be applied.

40|$|Although well {{established}} {{for the treatment of}} intracranial and prostatic pathology, stereotactic radiosurgery has only recently emerged as a modality for the treatment of malignant lung lesions. Utilization of radio-opaque markers, called <b>fiducials,</b> facilitate dose-intensive radiation focused on the tumor with sparing of surrounding normal tissue. There is a paucity of literature regarding complications that occur secondary to placement of these <b>fiducials.</b> The following report details a case in which intracoronary migration resulted in a hemodynamically significant acute coronary syndrome.

40|$|In {{traditional}} vision-based Augmented Reality tracking systems, artificially-designed <b>fiducials</b> (or landmarks) {{have been}} used as camera tracking primitives. The 3 D positions of these <b>fiducials</b> should be pre-calibrated, which imposes limitations in ranges of tracking view. Fortunately, the advance of computer vision technologies combined with new point position estimation technology enable natural features to be detected, tracked, and calibrated to be used as camera tracking primitives. This paper describes how these technologies are used to track in an unprepared environment for Augmented Reality...|$|R
50|$|Another {{technology}} of image guidance that the CyberKnife system can use {{is called the}} Synchrony system or Synchrony method. This method uses a combination of surgically placed internal <b>fiducials</b> (typically small gold markers, well visible in x-ray imaging), and light emitting optical fibers (LED markers) mounted on the patient skin. LED markers are tracked by an infrared tracking camera. Since the tumor is moving continuously, to continuously image its location using X-ray cameras would require prohibitive amounts of radiation to be delivered to the patient's skin. The Synchrony system overcomes this by periodically taking images of the internal <b>fiducials,</b> and computing a correlation model between {{the motion of the}} external LED markers and the internal <b>fiducials.</b> Time stamps from the two sensors (x-ray and infrared LED) are needed to synchronize the two data streams, hence the name Synchrony.|$|R
5000|$|The general {{approach}} of <b>fiducial</b> inference was proposed by Ronald Fisher. [...] Here [...] "fiducial" [...] {{comes from the}} Latin for faith. <b>Fiducial</b> inference {{can be interpreted as}} an attempt to perform inverse probability without calling on prior probability distributions. <b>Fiducial</b> inference quickly attracted controversy and was never widely accepted. Indeed, counter-examples to the claims of Fisher for <b>fiducial</b> inference were soon published. These counter-examples cast doubt on the coherence of [...] "fiducial inference" [...] as a system of statistical inference or inductive logic. Other studies showed that, where the steps of <b>fiducial</b> inference are said to lead to [...] "fiducial probabilities" [...] (or [...] "fiducial distributions"), these probabilities lack the property of additivity, and so cannot constitute a probability measure.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fiducial</b> {{interval}} {{could be}} taken {{to be just a}} different name for a confidence interval and give it the <b>fiducial</b> interpretation. But the definition might not then be unique.

The PWBs with all components correctly placed will then move to the reflow process.|$|R
