5|$|After mating sperm {{is stored}} in the spermathecae, organs of the female {{reproductive}} tract, {{and can be used}} up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken <b>egg</b> <b>sac.</b> The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which {{are larger than}} those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs. In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays eggs in a dead leaf, but more usually in a silk <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E
25|$|Aggregations {{were also}} {{observed}} {{to attract more}} males as well as protect the females from predators. However, the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> in communal webs were attacked more often by parasitoids than the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> laid by solitary females.|$|R

40|$|Coloration of the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> of spiders {{varies widely}} {{to the human}} eye, both across and within taxonomic groups. These {{differences}} in coloration are expected with differences in the biology and ecology of different species. Here we measure the spectral properties of the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> of 15 species in six families. Ultraviolet chroma, red chroma, and particularly overall brightness vary widely across and within taxonomic groups. We discuss the spectral properties of the silk of the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> {{in the context of}} the physical characteristics of the silk, the reflective properties of the background, the environmental illumination, and the natural history and behavior of the spider species. In most cases, the spectral characteristics of the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> seem to reduce their conspicuousness against the background and in those cases in which the coloration does not reduce the contrast in relation to the background, the low environmental light available may help to camouflage the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs...</b>|$|R
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E

25|$|The <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> of the {{triangulated}} cobweb spider is {{made from}} loosely woven silk, and {{is about the same}} size as the spider itself. Each <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> contains approximately 30 eggs. Cobweb spiders typically live on windows or in dirt areas. They eat for a margin of their day and spend hours developing their web; it does not break if it is woven well. Below or in its web, there may be many dead insects, ranging from stinkbugs to other spiders, and even wasps.|$|E

50|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>sacs</b> number up to eight. They are oval in shape, 5 mm x 4 mm of tough, brown silk with a woolly appearance. <b>Egg</b> <b>sacs</b> {{are added}} across missing {{sectors of the}} web. Eggs are creamy, 0.8mm in diameter, 50 to 60 in number, not sticky.|$|R
25|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>sacs</b> are tear shaped white {{pendants}} (sometimes with {{a slightly}} yellow centre) usually hanging {{from the roof of}} the habitat by a silk thread approximately 20mm long. <b>Egg</b> <b>sacs</b> are usually laid {{in the vicinity of the}} cave entrance, where the air flow velocity ranges between 0.3 and 0.6m/s.|$|R
25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will lay her eggs in an <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually after two or three weeks. Only then will she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary for a few more weeks before setting out on their own.|$|E
25|$|This {{species can}} live {{for more than}} a year after {{reaching}} maturity. Each <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> contains from 100 to more than 400 eggs, with a single female producing up to 17 egg sacs. The hatchlings remain in the mother's web for several days.|$|E
25|$|Oonops domesticus {{is a tiny}} spider (males about 1.5mm, females 2mm) from Western Europe to Russia. It is of a bleak light red, with {{a reddish}} to whitish abdomen. It is found only in buildings, where it builds a retreat in corners and between old paper. It hunts at night, {{probably}} with booklice their common prey. The translucent flat <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> contains only two eggs.|$|E
50|$|Adult males do {{not build}} webs and stop eating. They die shortly after mating. Females may {{live long enough}} to guard their young, but {{sometimes}} die before hatching occurs. The flattened, elliptical <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> are up to 20 mm long, with a bluish to greenish hue, and up to ten <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> can be produced by a female.|$|R

Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư traced the ancestry of the Hùng kings to Consort Âu and Lord Lạc Long who had 100 sons from an <b>egg</b> <b>sac.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spiders {{generally}} {{change their}} skin {{for the first}} time while still inside the <b>egg</b> <b>sac,</b> and the spiderling that emerges broadly resembles the adult. The number of moults varies, both between species and genders, but generally will be between five times and nine times before the spider reaches maturity. Not surprisingly, since males are generally smaller than females, the males of many species mature faster and do not undergo ecdysis as many times as the females before maturing.|$|E
25|$|Females that dwell indoors {{would usually}} live for over {{one or two}} years on the same web, with some {{residing}} for as long as seven years in rarely disturbed places (attics, basement or cellar parts, storage rooms, etc.). Outdoor females perish with cold weather and males rarely live for over a year. In late fall (autumn), an <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> is made containing up to 50 eggs and put in the very tip of the funnel, protected by the female.|$|E

50|$|Wolf spiders {{resemble}} nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders {{carry their}} <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> by attaching {{them to their}} spinnerets (Pisauridae carry their <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders.|$|R
50|$|Hynobiid {{salamanders}} practice external fertilization, or spawning. And, {{unlike other}} salamander families which reproduce internally, male hynobiids focus on <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> rather than females during breeding. The female lays two <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> at a time, each containing up to 70 eggs. Parental care is common. A few species have very reduced lungs, or no lungs at all. Larvae can sometimes have reduced external gills if {{they live in}} cold and very oxygen-rich water.|$|R
25|$|A hungry {{individual}} will wait halfway outside its burrow for a meal. Male trapdoor spiders can overcome the female's aggressive reactions to their approach, {{but it is}} not known how. Females never travel far from their burrows, especially if they have an <b>egg</b> <b>sac.</b> During this time, the female will capture food and regurgitate it to feed her spiderlings. Enemies of the trapdoor spider include certain pompilids (spider wasps), which seek out the burrows and manage to gain entrance. They sting the owner and lay their eggs (usually one per spider) on its body. When the egg hatches, the larva devours the spider alive.|$|E
25|$|Studies on Mexican {{species in}} the wild showed that pre-adult and adult spiders molt {{towards the end of}} the dry season, which lasts from June to November. After their last molt, adult males search for females, the west coast species {{travelling}} in the daytime, particularly in the morning and evening, and the east coast species travelling at night. Females produce an <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> before they molt. The eggs hatch a few weeks before the rainy season begins. The spiderlings molt every two weeks for the first few months, then less frequently as they mature. A full-grown Brachypelma may molt as infrequently as once a year.|$|E
25|$|One mated female P. clarus can lay {{well over}} 100eggs per sac, and many females lay {{more than one}} <b>egg</b> <b>sac,</b> in a thick silken cover. An average clutch {{contains}} 135eggs. The egg membrane is shed in 2426days, but the hatchlings (the first instar) continue to mature in the cocoon. The first molt occurs 2428days after the membrane is shed, and two to threedays later the spiderlings leave their protective cover and become active, independent individuals. They do not hunt immediately, even if prey is available, but spend several hours engaged in apparently random activity before seeking cover, where they remain between twohours and twodays. About 10% of spiderlings build retreats during this period, while the rest do so only after they have fed.|$|E

25|$|Like black widows, {{the female}} S. grossa is 6-10.5mm {{in length and}} dark colored with a round, bulbous abdomen. Typical {{coloration}} ranges from purplish brown to black, with light-colored markings. Unlike black widows, redbacks, and other Latrodectus species, S. grossa {{does not have a}} bright red hourglass pattern or any other bright markings. Like many spiders, the male is sometimes smaller but can many times be nearly as long as the females. It measures 4.1-10.0mm in length and is thinner than the female. The two sexes are colored similarly; however, the sexually mature male almost always has lighter, more reddish-coloured legs than the female. S. grossa spiders may shed up to six times (instars) before reaching maturity. They can go several months without feeding, provided they have access to water. A well-fed female can lay three or more egg sacs each year. Each <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> typically contains between 40-100 eggs. The mother can often be observed watching her eggs for hours, even days, at a time once the eggs start changing color and grow close to hatching. At normal household temp/humidity, an egg will usually hatch within a month of being laid. The spiderlings are independent from time of hatch.|$|E
500|$|The females {{lay their}} eggs in November or December. The eggs are round, {{about the size of}} a mustard seed, and are a transparent, purply red. They are held {{together}} in a cream-coloured, round, ball shaped <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> which is about [...] in diameter. The female constructs five or six egg sacs over the next three to four weeks. Each <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> contains about 70 to 90 fertilised eggs. The egg sacs are hung in the centre of the spiders web and the female spins more silk over them. Over time the exterior of the <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> may become covered with sand. After six weeks of incubation, during January and February, the spiderlings hatch. The young spiders then disperse from the web. At present, little is known about the dispersal mechanism that the spiderlings use to move away from the nest. In one study, observing spiders over 24 hours, 28% used a ballooning method, which is where the young spiders use heat currents to carry themselves away from the nest suspended by a single web strand. While the majority, 61%, used a bridging method where the spiderling uses its silk to move to nearby plants, and 11% still remained in the nest. The young spiderlings reach full maturity the following spring.|$|E
500|$|Spiderlings hatch {{from their}} eggs after about 8 days and can {{emerge from the}} <b>egg</b> <b>sac</b> as early as 11 days after being laid, {{although}} cooler temperatures can significantly slow their development so that emergence does not occur for months. After hatching they spend about a week inside the <b>egg</b> <b>sac,</b> feeding on the yolk and molting once. [...] Baby spiders appear from September to January (spring to early summer). Male spiders mature through five instars in about 45–90 days. Females mature through seven–eight instars in about 75–120 days. Males live {{for up to six}} or seven months, while females may live between two and three years. Laboratory tests have shown that redbacks may survive for an average of 100 days, and sometimes over 300 days without any food, those starved at 10°C faring better than those kept without food at 25°C. Spiders are known to reduce their metabolic rates in response to starvation, and can distend their abdomens to store large amounts of food. Redbacks can survive temperatures from below freezing point to 40°C, though they do need relatively warm summers, with temperatures of 15 to 25°C for two to three months, to survive and breed.|$|E
50|$|Pimplinae are parasitoids of Endopterygota, {{often the}} pupae of Lepidoptera. Species of Tromatobia parasitize the <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> and adults of spiders, There are 95 genera.|$|R
50|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} February to late March. <b>Egg</b> <b>sacs</b> are coil-shaped. Clutch size in one female was 86 eggs of about 2.8 mm in diameter.|$|R
2500|$|Females usually attach their <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> on {{vegetation}} and other surfaces near {{the edges of}} their webs (including grass blades, leaves, and twigs). They are usually bound longitudinally with loose lengths of silk, but they can sometimes be found dangling. The <b>egg</b> <b>sacs</b> are around [...] in length and can vary in shape from circular to pointed at both ends. They are reddish brown to golden brown in colour, though rarely {{they may also be}} bright yellow. They are made from closely woven silk.|$|R
