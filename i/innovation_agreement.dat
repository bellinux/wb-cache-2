40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{telemedicine}} in {{the management}} of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that multidisciplinary comprehensive HF care could achieve better results when it is delivered using telemedicine. /nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 178 eligible patients with HF were randomized to either structured follow-up on the basis of face-to-face encounters (control group, 97 patients) or delivering health care using telemedicine (81 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms based on telemonitoring and structured follow-up by means of video or audio-conference. The primary end-point was non-fatal HF events after six months of follow-up. The median age of the patients was 77 years, 41 % were female, and 25 % were frail patients. The hazard ratio for the primary end-point was 0. 35 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 20 - 0. 59; p-value[*] [*] 0. 05). The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct hospital costs of € 3546 per patient per six months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:/nAmong patients managed in the setting of a comprehensive HF programme, the addition of telemedicine may result in better outcomes and reduction of costs.

40|$|This paper {{inspects}} {{the mechanism}} shaping government spending multipliers in various smallscale DSGE setups with endogenous labor supply and capital accumulation. We analytically characterize the short-run investment multiplier, which in equilibrium {{can be either}} positive or negative.

The response of investment to government spending shocks strongly affects short-run multipliers on output and consumption.

We find that the joint implementation of pro-competition structural reforms in the periphery, a fiscal expansion in the ‘core’, and forward guidance about the three policies: forward guidance re-inforces the expansionary effects of country-specific policies, and the latter in turn improve the effectiveness of forward guidance.

40|$|The {{euro area}} has been {{experiencing}} a prolonged period of weak economic activity and very low inflation. This paper reviews models of business cycle stabilization {{with an eye to}} formulating lessons for policy in the euro area.

The paper describes practical ways for the euro area to be able to implement an effective monetary-fiscal policy mix.

Noting certain remaining weaknesses in the existing Euro CAC, the paper closes by offering some modifications {{as well as more}} long term solutions to debt restructuring.

40|$|This paper uses an {{estimated}} sticky-price model to identify endogenous movements in government {{consumption in the}} U. S. economy. Two feedback effects are considered, one originating from the stock of public debt and one from contemporaneous output. The data provide significant statistical evidence in favor of such mechanisms, even though a subsample analysis reveals that their strength may have decreased over time. Monte Carlo simulations assessing a DSGE model with exogenous spending and various identified VARs suggest that failing to account for these feedbacks may induce a severe upward bias in estimated multipliers.

40|$|We study {{fiscal policy}} {{coordination}} and fiscal policy spillovers in Germany, France, Spain and Italy using a Time-Varying Coefficients VAR {{model for the}} period 1995 - 2014. While the four country-specific cycles share large commonalities, fiscal policy coordination across countries, measured as the time-varying correlation between government spending growth, is very low. Country-specific government spending shocks generate significant effects on the remaining countries. International spillovers are especially strong in the medium run and during the financial crisis. Also, we find heterogeneous and asymmetric response to spending across countries.

40|$|What {{would be}} the effect of {{imposing}} a 100 percent reserve requirement to depository institutions? This paper contends that reserves do not compete with loans on the asset side of bank’s balance sheets. Thus, they only affect liquidity provision by banks indirectly through {{their impact on the}} cost of loan and deposit creation. This cost could be driven to zero if, as the Eurosystem does, central banks remunerated required reserves at the same rate of their refinancing operations. The paper argues that the crucial constraint imposed by a fully backed banking system is collateral availability by depository institutions.

40|$|We re-examine {{the theory}} of {{rational}} voter participation where voting is by two collusive parties enforcing social norms through costly peer punishment. The model nests both the ethical voter model and the pivotal voter model. In the unique mixed strategy equilibrium the advantaged party gets all surplus. When the cost of enforcement of social norms is low and the benefit of winning/nthe election {{is the same for}} both parties, the larger party is always advantaged. When instead the enforcement of social norms is costly we have a result reminiscent of Olson, and the smaller party may be advantaged.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} financial networks that allow to optimally solve the trade-off between higher risk-sharing and contagion. With continuous shock distributions, the optimum features the segmentation {{of the system of}} firms into disjoint components, with uniform exposure within them. With positive mass on some large shocks, it is instead optimal to modulate the exposure level to different firms. When firms are heterogeneous in the risk characteristics of their shocks, optimality requires homogeneous components, while with heterogeneity in size, an irrelevance result holds. Also, the incentives of firms to establish linkages may not be aligned with social optimality.

40|$|Are {{production}} factors allocated efficiently across countries? To differentiate misallocation from factor intensity differences, we {{construct a}} new dataset of {{estimates for the}} output shares of natural resources for a large panel of countries. We find a significant and persistent degree of misallocation of physical capital. We also find a remarkable movement toward efficiency during last 35 years, associated with the elimination of interventionist policies and driven by domestic accumulation. In contrast, we find a much larger and persistent misallocation of human capital. Interestingly, when both production factors can be reallocated, capital would often flow from poor to rich countries.

40|$|In this paper, I show {{a strong}} {{positive}} correlation between the value-added share of manufacturing in 2000 and current account balances in 2007 for the Euro area countries. I propose asymmetries in the timing of trade liberalizations as a new mechanism affecting {{the dynamics of the}} current account. I build intuition using a simple model. Then, I use an international business cycle model to show how the asymmetric dynamics of trade costs in manufacturing and services in 2000 - 2007 can partially explain the rise in the German surplus. Lastly, I provide broad empirical support for the key predictions of the theory.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} labour and product market reforms on sectoral employment and productivity, following a difference-in-differences approach. Using industry-level data for the period 1997 - 2013, we show that employment protection deregulation has {{a positive effect on}} sectoral employment for industries more exposed to labour market legislation, despite having a non-positive impact on productivity. Upstream product market deregulation also increases sectoral employment for the downstream sectors more dependent on upstream inputs. Nevertheless, it has mixed effects on sectoral productivity: while upstream sectors face productivity losses, the downstream sectors more exposed to the deregulated sectors grasp productivity gains.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} DSGE-VAR {{methodology}} {{to assess the}} size of fiscal multipliers in the data and the relative contributions of two transmission mechanisms of government spending shocks, namely hand-to-mouth consumers and Edgeworth complementarity. Econometric experiments show that a DSGE model with Edgeworth complementarity is a better representation of the transmission mechanism of fiscal policy as it yields dynamic responses close to those obtained with the flexible DSGE-VAR model (i. e. an impact output multiplier larger than one and a crowding-in of private consumption). The estimated share of hand-to-mouth consumers {{is too small to}} replicate the positive response of private consumption.

40|$|We {{construct}} a dynamic theory of sovereign debt and structural reforms with three interacting frictions: limited enforcement, limited commitment, and incomplete markets. A sovereign country in recession issues debt to smooth consumption and makes reforms {{to speed up}} recovery. The sovereign can renege on debt by suffering a stochastic cost, in which case debt is renegotiated. The competitive Markov equilibrium features large fluctuations in consumption and reform effort. We contrast the equilibrium with an optimal contract with one-sided commitment. A calibrated model can match several salient facts about debt crises. We quantify the welfare effect of relaxing different frictions.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{productivity and}} welfare losses from capital misallocation {{in a general}} equilibrium model of occupational choice and financial intermediation. It studies the effects of risk sharing with default and imperfect monitoring on the optimal allocation of resources and derives endogenous leverage bounds. Information frictions have large impact on entrepreneurs' entry and firm-size decisions due to endogenous collateral requirements derived from incentive compatible allocations. Leverage bounds derived from default and asymmetric information constraints are then used to simulate the tradeoff from a macroprudential policy aimed at mitigating the effects of unanticipated changes in information regime.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Eurozone financial crisis {{through the lens}} of sovereign bond liquidity. Using novel data, I show that repo haircuts on peripheral government bonds sharply increased during the crisis, reducing their liquidity and amplifying the rise in their yields. I study the impact of this liquidity shock on asset prices and macroeconomic variables in a general equilibrium model with financial frictions calibrated for Ireland. The model confirms the rise in the required returns of illiquid government bonds and predicts a substantial drop in economic activity and deflation. Unconventional policy alleviates the effect of the liquidity shock.

40|$|In the {{standard}} model of sovereign default, as in Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) or Arellano (2008), default is driven by fundamentals alone. There is no independent role for expectations. We show that small variations of that model are consistent with multiple interest rate equilibria. Some of those equilibria correspond to the ones identified by Calvo (1988), where default is likely because rates are high, and rates are high because default is likely. The model is used to simulate equilibrium movements in sovereign bond spreads that resemble sovereign debt crises. It {{is also used to}} discuss lending policies similar to the ones announced by the European Central Bank in 2012.

40|$|The paper first takes {{a brief look}} at the {{economic}} and judicial justification for the independent status of central banks in general and will thereby also illustrate the different manifestations of independence {{that need to be}} distinguished. Recent developments will then form the initial point for a detailed analysis of the concrete range of the ECB’s independence. This analysis will end with a positive conclusion. Until today its independent status has not been violated by any of the analysed measures. Possible threats, however, continue to exist. Safeguarding the independent status of the ECB thus remains an important mission not only for legal scholars.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal time-consistent unemployment insurance policy {{in a search}} economy with incomplete markets. In a context of repeated choice without a commitment device, we show that the optimal replacement rate depends on how frequently in time the policy can be revised. The exact relation {{is dependent on the}} political process: if the utilitarian welfare criterion is used, the optimal rate is higher the shorter the choice periodicity. Self-insurance reduces the need for the public scheme but mostly because the policy cannot be changed often enough. The comparison with an economy where a commitment device is assumed shows that the commitment rate is close to time-consistent rates with very long choice periodicities.
