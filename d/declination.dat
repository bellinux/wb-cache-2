5|$|<b>Declination</b> is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the <b>declination</b> as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on <b>declination</b> for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed <b>declination).</b>|$|E
5|$|Changes in Earth's {{magnetic}} field on a time scale {{of a year}} or more are referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic <b>declination</b> is observed to vary over tens of degrees. A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.|$|E

It was further supplemented by the Cordoba Durchmusterung (580,000 stars), which began to be compiled at Córdoba, Argentina in 1892 under the initiative of John M.

30|$|At the {{individual}} (specimen/stratigraphic) level, {{two sets of}} inclinations and <b>declinations</b> are accommodated. First are directions before any correction or processing. They are labeled Dec raw and Inc raw. They are accompanied by an entry for the maximum angular deviation (MAD) if the ChRM direction was calculated using principal component analysis (Kirschvink 1980). Secondly, <b>declinations</b> and inclinations may be corrected for imperfections in the coring process. The database contains corrected <b>declinations</b> (Dec adj) and inclinations (Inc adj) and information on the methods of adjustment. The IDs for the types of adjustments are shown in two fields (Dec adj ID and Inc adj ID) and are linked to a metadata table describing the IDs.|$|R

5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as <b>declination.</b> The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a <b>declination</b> of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a <b>declination</b> has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have used}} {{compasses}} for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century. Although the magnetic <b>declination</b> does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from {{some types of}} bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.|$|E
5|$|Sirius can be {{observed}} in daylight with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly <b>declination</b> of Sirius.|$|E
30|$|From these curves, it {{is obvious}} that there are limited <b>declinations</b> between the {{simulated}} and experimental results. These <b>declinations</b> are mostly observed at upper and lower cutoff frequencies (1 and 43  Hz) as well as at 50  Hz. The passive components (resistors, capacitors) we used exhibit limited parasitic resistances and reactances that may provide degradations on the total circuitry response. Also, the printed circuit board microstrip lines may have a possible impact on the total response results. In order to measure the signal chain response at the frequency range of 1 – 100  Hz, we used our automated measurement setup that exhibits limitations on measuring and recording extra low amplitude signals. These limitations mainly provide the <b>declinations</b> between simulated and measured total response results at 50 -Hz frequency range.|$|R

30|$|The {{resultant}} <b>declinations</b> and inclinations of the ChRMs {{are shown}} in Fig.  6 a, c. The reversed polarity <b>declinations</b> were generally aligned to 180 °, and the inclinations after the tilting correction were aligned to ± 53 °, which would be expected given a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) at the core site. Large fluctuations in the <b>declinations</b> and inclinations were observed between depths of 67.03 and 64.38  m, and steep upward inclinations were observed at approximately 63.5  m depth. The VGP latitudes calculated from the ChRMs {{are shown in}} Fig.  6 e. The VGP moves across the equator from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere between 65.69 and 65.67  m depth. The VGP begins to move rapidly {{at a depth of}} 67.03  m, and the VGP settles at approximately 63.44  m after moving to the Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic <b>declination</b> {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a <b>declination</b> of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, when it will enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost <b>declination)</b> in 2173.|$|E

5|$|Hindu natal astrology {{originated}} with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The {{names of the}} signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for <b>declination</b> and planetary conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques {{may also have been}} augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.|$|E
5|$|NGC 6543 {{is a high}} {{northern}} <b>declination</b> deep-sky {{object and}} is near the apparent position of the North Ecliptic Pole. It has the combined magnitude of 8.1, with high surface brightness. Its small bright inner nebula subtends an average of 16.1 arcsec, with the outer prominent condensations about 25 arcsec. Deep images reveal an extended halo about 300 arcsec or 5 arcmin across, that was once ejected by the central progenitor star during its red giant phase.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory is a {{historical}} observatory located {{on the grounds of}} the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic <b>declination.</b> Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were responsible for this effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Juan Belmonte and Mauro Zedda {{measured}} the entrance orientations (<b>declinations</b> and azimuths) of 272 simple nuraghes {{and of the}} central towers of 180 complex ones. The data revealed clear peaks corresponding to orientations pointing to the sunrise at winter solstice and to the Moon at its southernmost rising position. These alignments remained constant {{throughout the history of}} nuraghe. The most common <b>declinations</b> revealed were of around −43° for the earlier nuraghes, shifting to just −45½° for the later. Zedda has suggested that the target is likely a star, quite possibly Alpha Centauri.|$|R

30|$|In Palau and Saipan, the easterly {{deflected}} <b>declinations</b> {{were observed}} in the lower to middle Miocene {{as well as in}} the Eocene and Oligocene (Haston and Fuller, 1991). This observation contradicts our model. On the other hand, the <b>declinations</b> of Palau and Saipan require significant rotation of the PHS Plate since the middle Miocene, which is inconsistent with the geology of the Japanese Islands, as mentioned above. The data from Palau and Saipan may have been affected by local tectonic movement because these islands belong to tectonically active regions, but further studies are needed to resolve the inconsistency.|$|R
5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar <b>declination</b> can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{can often}} be seen near the zenith in the mid-{{northern}} latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer. From mid-southern latitudes, {{it can be seen}} low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter. With a <b>declination</b> of +38.78°, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51°S. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America, including Punta Arenas, Chile (53°S). At latitudes to the north of +51°N, Vega remains continually above the horizon as a circumpolar star. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the <b>declination</b> will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded. It {{was one of the first}} stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements.
