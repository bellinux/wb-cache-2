40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the way a}} multiproduct firm, {{regulated}} through a dynamic price cap, can develop a price strategy that uses the regulatory policy to deter entry. We consider a firm that initially operates as a monopolist in two markets but faces potential entry {{in one of the}} markets. We conclude that the regulated firm can have the incentive to block the entry. This strategy leads to the reduction of the price in both markets. However, the final effect of the entry deterrence strategy on total consumer surplus is not always positive.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} uniform pricing, coverage {{constraints and}} price caps in markets newly opened to competition, e. g. broadband services. We {{show that the}} requirement of uniform pricing has strong repercussions on coverage decisions. Imposed on incumbents only it may distort their coverage decision downward to avoid duopoly entry. If also imposed on entrants it {{increases the likelihood that}} entry leads to independent monopolies rather than competition. A sufficiently large coverage constraint on incumbents reestablishes incentives for duopoly entry, but may lead to higher prices.

40|$|Abstract Advertising {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be an important isolating mechanism through which firms may defend an established competitive advantage. However, there is relatively little empirical evidence on the extent of the strategic use of advertising either to deter or in response to entry. In this paper, I report on a study of the advertising practices of 843 medium‐sized and large UK‐based firms. Nearly one‐quarter of all the advertisers surveyed state that they attribute importance to entry deterrence as an aim of their advertising. Further, one in five managers of advertising firms state that they would increase advertising expenditure if a new rival company appeared in their market. It is also apparent that there is a strong correlation between the perceived importance of advertising as an entry‐deterring tool and the intensity of advertising spending. Multivariate modelling provides confirmation that the existence of a sheltered market position, and the profitability that typically accompanies this, provides a statistically significant determinant of the decision to use advertising as a strategic entry‐deterring weapon.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding repetitive structures and inherent patterns in a given string s of length n over a finite totally ordered alphabet. A border u of a string s is both a prefix and a suffix of s such that u= s. The computation of the border array of a string s, namely the borders of each prefix of s, is strongly related to the string matching problem: given a string w, find all of its occurrences in s. A Lyndon word is a primitive word (i. e., {{it is not a}} power of another word) which is minimal for the lexicographical order of its conjugacy class (i. e., the set of words obtained by cyclic rotations of the letters). In this paper we combine these concepts to introduce the Lyndon Border Array L β of s, whose i-th <b>entry</b> <b>L</b> β(s) [i] is the length of the longest border of s[1 i] which is also a Lyndon word.

40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} {{strategic}} choice of compatibility between two initially incompatible network goods in a two‐stage game played by an incumbent and an entrant firm. Compatibility may {{be achieved by}} means of a converter. We derive a number of results under different assumptions {{about the nature of the}} converter (one‐way vs two‐way), the existence of property rights and the possibility of side payments. With incompatibility, entry deterrence occurs for sufficiently strong network effects. In the case of a two‐way converter, which can only be supplied by the incumbent, incompatibility will result in equilibrium unless side payments are allowed and the network externalities are sufficiently low. When both firms can build a one‐way converter and there are no property rights on the necessary technical specifications, the unique equilibrium involves full compatibility. Finally, when each firm has property rights on its technical specifications, full incompatibility is observed at the equilibrium with no side payments; when these are allowed the entrant sells access to its network to the incumbent which refuses to do the same and asymmetric one‐way compatibility results in equilibrium.

40|$|Internalin A, an internalin protein {{found in}} the food-borne {{pathogen}} Listeria monocytogenes, allows the pathogen to enter host cells through receptor-mediated internalization. Through Internalin A-mediated <b>entry,</b> <b>L.</b> monocytogenes invades enterocytes by binding to the receptor protein E-cadherin (Bergmann et al 2002). In this way, the pathogen is able to cross the intestinal barrier, a highly selective permeable interface {{that is responsible for}} allowing nutrients into the intestinal lumen while barring the entry of waste and pathogens. This study seeks to observe Internalin A-mediated entry of a pathogen mimetic system into epithelial cells. We use polystyrene carboxyl-terminated microspheres to display Internalin A, study the effect on internalization of ligand density {{and the size of the}} microsphere. A pGEX plasmid containing the inlA gene, which had previously been purified after transformation into MAX Efficiency DH 5 αF’IQ E. coli competent cells, was transformed into and expressed in OneShot BL 21 (DE 3) pLysS E. coli competent cells. The result of expression of the plasmid was the Internalin A protein (InlA), combined with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, in order to form a 75 kDa InlA-GST fusion protein. This fusion protein was subsequently purified through affinity chromatography. Concurrently, a protocol for labeling protein with fluorescein isothiocyanate dye (FITC) and covalently coupling the protein to 2 µm microspheres was also developed using ovalbumin. The future steps in this experiment are to successfully cleave the GST tag from Internalin A using sequence-specific protease, functionalize microspheres with purified InlA labeled with FITC and perform internalization studies with microspheres of different sizes and different densities of protein coating. Because InlA can effectively facilitate transport of L. monocytogenes into the cells of the intestinal epithelium, this study has important implications for improving the efficiency of drug delivery to the intestinal lumen.

Gendron, and P. Bates, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 : 8467 - 8472, 1998). Here we have shown that swapping the amino terminus of hLDL repeat 5 (hLDL-A 5) with that of Tva, {{in addition to the}} corresponding substitutions made in human LDL-A 4, was required to convert hLDL-A 5 into an efficient ASLV-A receptor. These results substantiated our previous findings regarding the role of the specific residues in the viral interaction domain of Tva and demonstrated the critical role of the amino terminus of the Tva LDL-A module in ASLV-A infection. Furthermore, we have shown that the residues between cysteines 2 and 3 of the Tva LDL-A module in a Tva/LDL-A 5 chimeric protein can be functionally replaced by the corresponding region of another LDL-A module, human LDL receptor-related protein repeat 22 (LDL-A 22), to mediate efficient ASLV-A entry. Since the only conserved feature between the C 2 -C 3 region of LDL-A 22 and the Tva LDL-A module is that both contain nine amino acids of which none are conserved, we conclude that the spacing between C 2 and C 3 of the LDL-A module of Tva is an important determinant for ASLV-A entry. Thus, the present study provides strong evidence to support our hypothesis that one role of the N terminus of the LDL-A module of Tva is to allow proper folding and conformation of the protein for optimal interaction with the viral glycoprotein EnvA in ASLV-A entry...|$|E
40|$|High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause 5 % of {{all human}} cancers worldwide. The HPV capsid {{consists}} of 72 disulfide-linked pentamers of major capsid protein L 1 and up to 72 molecules of minor capsid protein L 2. The viral genome (vDNA) is 8 KB circular dsDNA, condensed with histones and complexed with L 2. HPV infection requires the virion particle {{to get access to}} basal layer keratinocytes, binding and entry of the cells, uncoating, and transport of the viral genomes to the host cell nucleus. During infection, L 2 is important for transport of the viral genome from membrane bound vesicular compartments, through the cytosol and into the host cell nucleus. Previous work has identified a conserved disulfide bond between Cys 22 and Cys 28, which is necessary for HPV 16 infection. We hypothesize that endosomal reduction of this disulfide might be important for L 2 conformational changes that allow a hydrophobic transmembrane-like region in L 2 to span across endosomal membranes, exposing sorting adaptor binding motifs within L 2 to the cytosol. Prior research suggests that cytosolic glutathione (GSH) redox potential is important for reduction of disulfide-linked proteins within the lumen of endosomes. This is achieved by endosomal influx of cytosolic reduced cysteine, where it can reduce disulfide bonds in lumenal proteins. Cytosolic GSH regenerates the pool of reduced cysteine needed to maintain endosomal redox potential. Here we studied the relationship between cytosolic GSH and HPV 16 infection. siRNA knockdown of critical enzymes of the GSH biosynthesis pathway or the endosomal cystine efflux pump cystinosin caused partial abrogation of HPV 16 infection. Likewise, inhibition of the GSH biosynthesis pathway with L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO) blocked HPV 16 infection in multiple cell types, suggesting that cytosolic GSH redox may be important for HPV 16 infection. Further studies have revealed that the decrease of HPV 16 infection is not because of defects in binding, <b>entry,</b> <b>L</b> 2 cleavage or capsid uncoating, but rather is due to inefficient cytosolic translocation of L 2 /viral genome from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we show that L 2 is able to span the endosomal membrane and direct TGN localization in the presence of BSO. Lack of cytosolic GSH causes L 2 /viral genome to become trapped in the TGN lumen. This suggests that there are redox-sensitive viral or cellular factors necessary for L 2 /viral genome translocation at the TGN. Future research will focus on the redox state of the Cys 22 -Cys 28 disulfide bond during infection of normal and GSH-depleted cells...|$|E
