40|$|<b>DIAPH</b> 1 is a formin protein which {{promotes}} actin polymerization, stabilizes microtubules and consequently {{is involved in}} cytoskeleton dynamics, cell migration and differentiation. In contrast to the relatively well-understood signaling cascades that regulate <b>DIAPH</b> 1 activity, its spatial regulation of biogenesis is not understood. A recent report showed that synthesis of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 is confined in the perinuclear ER compartment through translation-dependent mRNA targeting. However, the underlying mechanism of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 local synthesis {{is yet to be}} elucidated. Here, we provide evidence to demonstrate that the 5 '-cap-mediated immediate translation of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 mRNA upon exiting nucleus is required for localizing the mRNA in the perinuclear ER compartment. This is supported by data: 1) Delayed translation of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 mRNA resulted in loss of perinuclear localization of the mRNA; 2) Once delocalized, <b>DIAPH</b> 1 mRNA could not be retargeted to the perinuclear region; and 3) The translation of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 mRNA is 5 '-cap dependent. These results provide new insights into the novel mechanism of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 local synthesis. In addition, these findings have {{led to the development of}} new approaches for manipulating <b>DIAPH</b> 1 mRNA localization and local protein synthesis in cells for functional studies. Furthermore, a correlation of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 mRNA and <b>DIAPH</b> 1 protein localization has been demonstrated using a new method to quantify the intracellular distribution of protein...|$|E

In most MTP, this phenotype arises because of altered regulation of platelet formation from megakaryocytes (MK). We report {{the identification of}} <b>DIAPH</b> 1, which encodes the Rho-effector diaphanous-related formin 1 (<b>DIAPH</b> 1), as a candidate gene for MTP using exome sequencing, ontological phenotyping and similarity regression.

40|$|The biochemical, ionic, and {{signaling}} {{changes that}} occur within cardiomyocytes subjected to ischemia are exacerbated by reperfusion; however, the precise mechanisms mediating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury have not been fully elucidated. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) regulates the cellular response to cardiac tissue damage in I/R, an effect potentially mediated by the binding of the RAGE cytoplasmic domain to the diaphanous-related formin, <b>DIAPH</b> 1. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of <b>DIAPH</b> 1 in the physiological response to experimental myocardial I/R in mice. After subjecting wild-type mice to experimental I/R, myocardial <b>DIAPH</b> 1 expression was increased, an effect that was echoed following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in H 9 C 2 and AC 16 cells. Further, compared to wild-type mice, genetic deletion of <b>Diaph</b> 1 reduced infarct size and improved contractile function after I/R. Silencing <b>Diaph</b> 1 in H 9 C 2 cells subjected to H/R downregulated actin polymerization and serum response factor-regulated gene expression. Importantly, these changes led to increased expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase and reduced expression of the sodium calcium exchanger. This work demonstrates that <b>DIAPH</b> 1 is required for the myocardial response to I/R, and that targeting <b>DIAPH</b> 1 may represent an adjunctive approach for myocardial salvage after acute infarction...|$|E

We have identified Diaphanous homolog 3 (<b>DIAPH</b> 3) as the gene responsible for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic auditory neuropathy (AUNA 1), which we previously mapped to chromosome 13 q 21 -q 24. Genotyping of additional family members narrowed the interval to an 11 -Mb, 3. 28 -cM gene-poor region containing only four genes, including <b>DIAPH</b> 3. DNA sequencing of <b>DIAPH</b> 3 revealed a c. - 172 G > A, g. 48 G > A mutation in a highly conserved region of the 5 ′ UTR. The c. - 172 G > A mutation occurs within a GC box sequence element and was not found in 379 controls. Using genome-wide expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR, we demonstrate a 2 - to 3 -fold overexpression of <b>DIAPH</b> 3 mRNA in lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals. Likewise, a significant increase (≈ 1. 5 -fold) in <b>DIAPH</b> 3 protein was found by quantitative immunoblotting of lysates from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from affected individuals in comparison with controls.

40|$|Steroid hormones {{are formed}} by the {{successive}} action of enzymes that are localized in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Compartmentalization of these enzymes in different subcellular organelles dictates the need for efficient transfer of intermediary metabolites between the mitochondrion and ER; however, the molecular determinants that regulate interorganelle substrate exchange are unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to define the molecular mechanism by which adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) signaling regulates communication between mitochondria and the ER during steroidogenesis. Using live cell video confocal microscopy, we found that ACTH and dibutyryl cAMP rapidly increased the rate of mitochondrial movement. Inhibiting tubulin polymerization prevented both basal and ACTH/cAMP-stimulated mitochondrial trafficking and decreased cortisol secretion. This decrease in cortisol secretion evoked by microtubule inhibition was paralleled by an increase in dehydroepiandrosterone production. In contrast, treatment with paclitaxel to stabilize microtubules or latrunculin B to inhibit actin polymerization and disrupt microfilament organization increased both mitochondrial trafficking and cortisol biosynthesis. ACTH-stimulated mitochondrial movement was dependent on RhoA and the RhoA effector, diaphanous-related homolog 1 (<b>DIAPH</b> 1). ACTH signaling temporally increased the cellular concentrations of GTP-bound and Ser- 188 phosphorylated RhoA, which promoted interaction with <b>DIAPH</b> 1. Expression of a dominant-negative RhoA mutant or silencing <b>DIAPH</b> 1 impaired mitochondrial trafficking and cortisol biosynthesis and concomitantly increased the secretion of adrenal androgens. We conclude that ACTH regulates cortisol production by facilitating interorganelle substrate transfer via a process that is mediated by RhoA and <b>DIAPH</b> 1, which act to coordinate the dynamic trafficking of mitochondria...|$|E

Given that some heritable copy number variants (CNVs) have been observed in patients as well as in healthy controls, to date little {{attention has been paid to}} the potential role of these non-de novo CNVs in causing autism. A normally intelligent patient with autism, with non-affected parents, was identified with a maternally inherited 10 Mb deletion at 13 q 21. 2. Sequencing of the genes within the deletion identified a paternally inherited non-synonymous amino acid substitution at position 614 of <b>DIAPH</b> 3 (proline to threonine; Pro 614 Thr). This variant, present in a highly conserved domain, was not found in 328 healthy subjects. Experiments demonstrated a transient expression of <b>Diaph</b> 3 in the developing murine cerebral cortex, indicating it plays a role in brain development. Transfection of Pro 614 Thr in murine fibroblasts demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of induced filopodia in comparison to the wild-type gene. <b>DIAPH</b> 3 is involved in cell migration, axon guidance and neuritogenesis, and is suggested to function downstream of SHANK 3. Our findings strongly suggest <b>DIAPH</b> 3 as a novel autism susceptibility gene.

40|$|The {{state of}} {{contraction}} in smooth muscle {{cells of the}} human uterus {{is dependent on the}} interaction of activated forms of actin and myosin. RHO proteins are small monomeric GTP binding proteins that regulate actin polymerization and myosin phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells. Their action is determined by their level of expression, GTP bound state, intracellular localization and phosphorylated status. Agonist activated RHO proteins bind to effector kinases such as Rho Kinase (ROCK) and diaphanous proteins (<b>DIAPH)</b> to regulate smooth muscle contraction by two mechanisms: ROCK activates smooth muscle myosin (MYL) either by direct phosphorylation at Ser 19 /Thr 18, or thorough inhibition of myosin phosphatase which is a trimeric protein regulated by ROCK and by other protein kinases. Actin polymerizing proteins such as <b>DIAPH</b> 1 increase filamentous actin assembly to enhance acto-myosin cross bridge formation and contraction.

When independent replication samples are not available, the training-testing sets approach is used to validate this procedure and a permutation method is used to obtain its P-value. We applied this method to the X chromosome (with 1804 SNPs) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We found a window of five SNPs over a 272 [*]kb region associated with AMD after Bonferroni correction. An examination of the odds ratio and the population attributable risks revealed a disease-preventive haplotype, ATGAC, on these five SNPs. For elderly females without this haplotype, the likelihood of AMD is increased by a factor of 4. 75 with a 95 % confidence interval (1. 43, 15. 82). The frequency of ATGAC in HapMap CEU is 0. 276.

To investigate the mechanism of deafness, we generated two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing Diap 3, the murine ortholog of <b>DIAPH</b> 3, on an FVB/NJ background. Line 771 exhibits a relatively mild 20  dB hearing loss at 12  kHz at 4 and 8 weeks of age, progressing to 40  dB and 60  dB losses at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively, at 12 and 24  kHz. Line 924 shows no hearing loss at 4 or 8 weeks, but manifests 35 and 50  dB threshold shifts at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively, at both 12 and 24  kHz. Notably, mice from the two transgenic lines retain distortion product otoacoustic emissions, indicative of normal cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) function despite elevation of auditory thresholds. Scanning electron microscopy of the organ of Corti demonstrates striking anomalies of the inner hair cell (IHC) stereocilia, while OHCs are essentially intact. Over time, IHCs of both lines develop elongated stereocilia that appear fused with neighboring stereocilia, in parallel to the time course of hearing loss in each line. Furthermore, we observe significant {{reduction in the number of}} IHC ribbon synapses over 24 weeks in both lines, although this reduction does not correlate temporally with onset and progression of hearing loss or stereociliary anomalies. In summary, overexpression of wild-type Diap 3 in two lines of transgenic mice results in hearing loss that recapitulates human AUNA 1 deafness. These findings suggest an essential role of Diap 3 in regulating assembly and/or maintenance of actin filaments in IHC stereocilia, as well as a potential role at the IHC ribbon synapse...|$|E

Because no clinical interventions overcome resistance to androgen ablation therapy, management of castration resistance and metastatic disease remains largely untreatable.

Here we design a platform that integrates actin functions with optimized phenotypic clustering and identify new cytoskeletal proteins, their functional hierarchy and pathways that modulate E-cadherin adhesion. Depletion of EEF 1 A, an actin bundling protein, increases E-cadherin levels at junctions without a corresponding reinforcement of cell–cell contacts. This unexpected result reflects a more dynamic and mobile junctional actin in EEF 1 A-depleted cells. A partner for EEF 1 A in cadherin contact maintenance is the formin <b>DIAPH</b> 2, which interacts with EEF 1 A.

Low Mitf levels lead to down-regulation of Dia 1, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased ROCK-dependent invasiveness, whereas increased Mitf expression leads to decreased invasiveness. Significantly the regulation of Dia 1 by Mitf also controls p 27 (Kip 1) -degradation such that reduced Mitf levels lead to a p 27 (Kip 1) -dependent G 1 arrest. Thus Mitf, via regulation of Dia 1, can both inhibit invasiveness and promote proliferation.

40|$|Formins are a {{widespread}} family of eukaryotic cytoskeleton-organizing proteins. Many species encode multiple formin isoforms, and for animals, {{much of this}} reflects the presence of multiple conserved subtypes. Earlier phylogenetic analyses identified seven major formin subtypes in animals (DAAM, <b>DIAPH,</b> FHOD, FMN, FMNL, INF, and GRID 2 IP/delphilin), but left a handful of formins, particularly from nematodes, unassigned. In this new analysis drawing from genomic data from {{a wider range of}} taxa, nine formin subtypes are identified that encompass all the animal formins analyzed here. Included in this analysis are Multiple Wing Hairs proteins (MWH), which bear homology to formin N-terminal domains. Originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster and other arthropods, MWH-related proteins are also identified here in some nematodes (including Caenorhabditis elegans), and are shown to be related to a novel MWH-related formin (MWHF) subtype. One surprising result of this work is the discovery that a family of pleckstrin homology domain-containing formins (PHCFs) is represented in many vertebrates, but is strikingly absent from placental mammals.

However, our understanding of their interplay, their kinetics, and the length distribution of the filaments that they nucleate within living cells is poor.

We find that formin-nucleated filaments are, on average, 10 times longer than Arp 2 / 3 -nucleated filaments. Although formin-generated filaments represent less than 10 % of all actin filaments, mechanical measurements indicate that they are important determinants of cortical elasticity.

Drf 1 (-/-) RhoB(-/-) mice are fertile and develop normally. Relative to age-matched Drf 1 (-/-) RhoB(+/-) mice, the age of myelodysplasia onset was earlier in Drf 1 (-/-) RhoB(-/-) animals [...] including abnormally shaped erythrocytes, splenomegaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. In addition, we observed a statistically significant {{increase in the number of}} activated monocytes/macrophages in both the spleen and bone marrow of Drf 1 (-/-) RhoB(-/-) mice relative to Drf 1 (-/-) RhoB(+/-) mice. These data suggest a role for RhoB-regulated mDia 1 in the regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cells...|$|E
40|$|Conserved non-protein-coding DNA {{elements}} (CNEs) often encode cis-regulatory {{elements and}} are rarely lost during evolution. However, CNE losses that do occur can {{be associated with}} pheno-typic changes, exemplified by pelvic spine loss in sticklebacks. Using a computational strategy to detect complete loss of CNEs in mammalian genomes while strictly controlling for artifacts, we find> 600 CNEs that are independently lost in at least two mammalian lineages, including a spinal cord enhancer near GDF 11. We observed several genomic regions where multiple independent CNE loss events happened; the most extreme is the <b>DIAPH</b> 2 locus. We show that CNE losses often involve deletions and that CNE loss frequencies are non-uniform. Similar to less pleiotropic enhan-cers, we find that independently lost CNEs are shorter, slightly less constrained and evolutionarily younger than CNEs without detected losses. This suggests that independently lost CNEs are less pleiotropic and that pleiotropic constraints contribute to non-uniform CNE loss frequencies. We also detected 35 CNEs that are independently lost in the human lineage and in other mammals. Our study uncovers an interesting aspect of the evo-lution of functional DNA in mammalian genomes. Experiments are necessary to test if these inde-pendently lost CNEs are associated with parallel phenotype changes in mammals...|$|E
40|$|Subject {{headings}} gastroesophageal reflux; esophagitis; Barrett’s esophagus; hiatus hernia; He-licobacter pylori; {{gastric acid}} DEFINITIONS Gastroesophageal reflux that predisposes an indivi-dual {{to the risk}} of physical complications, or produces symptoms leading to significantly impaired quality of life, is termed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [1]. Clinically, GERD encompasses a broad spectrum of separate, though related condi-tions that are sometimes conveniently grouped under two broad categories: endoscopic esophag itis and endoscopy negative reflux disease. Endoscopic esophagitis is considered to be present when there is endoscopically visible breakage of the mucosa[2], re-gardless of whether the patient has symptoms. The term “endoscopic negative reflux disease ” refers to GERD that is not associated with Barrett’s esopha-gus or esophageal mucosal breaks. It includes such conditions as esoph ageal mucosal acid sensitivity, which is symptomatic reflux induced by acid reflux and proven by objective means; abnormal esophageal acid exposure, which is excessive acid reflux confirmed by objective measures; and reflux-type symptoms (heartburn and/or acid regurgita-tion) that clearly dominate the patient’s com-plaints[3]. Barrett’s esophagus is the eponym applied to the columnar epithelium-lined lower esophagus that is acquired as a consequence of chronic gas troe-sophageal reflux[4]. Hiatus hernia, on the other hand, has been defined as a displacement of the gas-tric mucosa 1. 5 cm or more above the <b>diaph</b> ragmatic hiatus[5]...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Despite progress in therapeutic and surgical treatments, its survival period at 5  years is the lowest among major cancers, and remains unchanged {{in the last two}} decades. The growing epidemiological relevance of oral cancer emphasizes the need to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease and identify predictive tumor markers and therapeutic targets. To this end, we have used the DDRT-PCR analysis to profile the oral tumor transcriptome and identify differentially regulated genes that may be used as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our DDRT-PCR analysis identified 51 differentially expressed fragments, of which 25 were revalidated by reverse Northern analysis. Northern blot analysis further corroborated these findings for a few genes. In order to ascertain the utility of some of the identified genes as molecular markers and therapeutic targets, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out in a panel of matched oral normal and tumor samples, that confirmed GLTP, PCNA, RBM 28, C 17 orf 75 and <b>DIAPH</b> 1 as significantly upregulated, whereas TNKS 2, PAM and TUBB 2 C showed significant downregulation in tumor samples. Taken together, our DDRT-PCR analysis has revealed several genes, belonging to diverse cellular pathways, that have been associated with OSCC for the first time. Thus, these genes could be investigated as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for OSCC...|$|E
40|$|The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) {{include a}} {{spectrum}} of stem cell malignancies characterized by {{an increased risk of}} developing acute myeloid leukemia. Heterozygous loss of chromosome 5 q (del[5 q]) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in MDS. <b>DIAPH</b> 1 is localized to 5 q 31 and encodes one of the formin proteins, mDia 1, which is involved in linear actin polymerization. Mice with mDia 1 deficiency develop hematologic features with age mimicking human myeloid neoplasm, but its role in the pathogenesis of MDS is unclear. Here we report that mDia 1 heterozygous and knockout mice develop MDS phenotypes with age. In these mice, CD 14 was aberrantly overexpressed on granulocytes in a cell-autonomous manner, leading to a hypersensitive innate immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli through CD 14 /Toll-like receptor 4 signaling. Chronic stimulation with LPS accelerated the development of MDS in mDia 1 heterozygous and knockout mice that can be rescued by lenalidomide. Similar findings of CD 14 overexpression were observed on the bone marrow granulocytes of del(5 q) MDS patients. Mechanistically, mDia 1 deficiency led to a downregulation of membrane-associated genes and a specific upregulation of CD 14 messenger RNA in granulocytes, but not in other lineages. These results underscore the significance of mDia 1 heterozygosity in deregulated innate immune responses in del(5 q) MDS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hereditary {{hearing loss}} {{is one of}} the most common {{heterogeneous}} disorders, and genetic variants that can cause hearing loss have been identified in over sixty genes. Most of these hearing loss genes have been detected using classical genetic methods, typically starting with linkage analysis in large families with hereditary hearing loss. However, these classical strategies are not well suited for mutation analysis in smaller families who have insufficient genetic information. Methods Eighty known hearing loss genes were selected and simultaneously sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 8 Korean families with autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Results Five mutations in known hearing loss genes, including 1 nonsense and 4 missense mutations, were identified in 5 different genes (ACTG 1, MYO 1 F, <b>DIAPH</b> 1, POU 4 F 3 and EYA 4), and the genotypes for these mutations were consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of hearing loss in each family. No mutational hot-spots were revealed in these Korean families. Conclusion Targeted NGS allowed for the detection of pathogenic mutations in affected individuals who were not candidates for classical genetic studies. This report is the first documenting the effective use of an NGS technique to detect pathogenic mutations that underlie hearing loss in an East Asian population. Using this NGS technique to establish a database of common mutations in Korean patients with hearing loss and further data accumulation will contribute to the early diagnosis and fundamental therapies for hereditary hearing loss. </p...|$|E
40|$|Information from {{cochlear}} potentials {{and genetic}} mutations helps localize the lesion site in auditory neuropathy Rosamaria Santarelli* Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a disorder characterized by disruption of auditory nerve activity resulting from lesions involving the auditory nerve (postsynaptic AN), inner hair cells and/or the synapses with auditory nerve terminals (presynaptic AN). Affected subjects show impairment of speech perception beyond that expected for the hearing loss, abnormality of auditory brainstem potentials and preserved outer hair-cell activities. Furthermore, AN {{can be identified}} either as an isolated disorder or as an associated disorder with multisystem involvement including peripheral and optic neuropathies (non-isolated AN). Mutations in several nuclear and mitochondrial genes {{have been identified as}} underlying these forms of AN. Recently, new genes have been identified as involved in both isolated (<b>DIAPH</b> 3, OTOF) and non-isolated AN (OPA 1). Moreover, abnormal cochlear potentials have been recorded from patients with specific gene mutations by using acoustic stimuli or electrical stimulation through cochlear implant. In this review, different types of genetically based auditory neuropathies are discussed and the proposed molecular mechanisms underlying AN are reviewed. Auditory neuropathy: a rare disorder? Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a hearing disorder characterized by disruption of temporal coding of acoustic signals in auditory nerve fibers resulting in impairment of auditory perceptions that rely on temporal cues. Abnormal discharge of auditory fibers results from lesions involving the nerve fibers themselves (postsynaptic AN), the inner hair cells (IHCs) or thei...|$|E
40|$|Paramount to {{the success}} of {{persistent}} viral infection is the ability of viruses to navigate hostile environments en route to future targets. In response to such obstacles, many viruses have developed the ability of establishing actin rich-membrane bridges to aid in future infections. Herein through dynamic imaging of HIV infected dendritic cells, we have observed how viral high-jacking of the actin/membrane network facilitates one of the most efficient forms of HIV spread. Within infected DC, viral egress is coupled to viral filopodia formation, with more than 90 % of filopodia bearing immature HIV on their tips at extensions of 10 to 20 µm. Live imaging showed HIV filopodia routinely pivoting at their base, and projecting HIV virions at µm. sec− 1 along repetitive arc trajectories. HIV filopodial dynamics lead to up to 800 DC to CD 4 T cell contacts per hour, with selection of T cells culminating in multiple filopodia tethering and converging to envelope the CD 4 T-cell membrane with budding HIV particles. Long viral filopodial formation was dependent on the formin diaphanous 2 (<b>Diaph</b> 2), and not a dominant Arp 2 / 3 filopodial pathway often associated with pathogenic actin polymerization. Manipulation of HIV Nef reduced HIV transfer 25 -fold by reducing viral filopodia frequency, supporting the potency of DC HIV transfer was dependent on viral filopodia abundance. Thus our observations show HIV corrupts DC to CD 4 T cell interactions by physically embedding at the leading edge contacts of long DC filopodial networks...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Hereditary {{forms of}} hearing loss are {{classified}} as syndromic, when deafness is associated with other clinical features, or non-syndromic, when deafness occurs without other clinical features. Many types of syndromic deafness have been described, {{some of which have}} been mapped to specific chromosomal regions.  METHODS—Here we describe a family with progressive sensorineural hearing loss, cognitive impairment, facial dysmorphism, and variable other features, transmitted by apparent X linked recessive inheritance. Haplotype analysis of PCR products spanning the X chromosome and direct sequencing of candidate genes were used to begin characterising the molecular basis of features transmitted in this family. Comparison to known syndromes involving deafness, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and other clinical features was performed by review of published reports and personal discussions.  RESULTS—Genetic mapping places the candidate locus for this syndrome within a 48  cM region on Xq 1 - 21. Candidate genes including COL 4 A 5, <b>DIAPH,</b> and POU 3 F 4 were excluded by clinical and molecular analyses.  CONCLUSIONS—The constellation of clinical findings in this family (deafness, cognitive impairment, facial dysmorphism, variable renal and genitourinary abnormalities, and late onset pancytopenia), along with a shared haplotype on Xq 1 - 21, suggests that this represents a new form of syndromic deafness. We discuss our findings in comparison to several other syndromic and non-syndromic deafness loci that have been mapped to the X chromosome.    Keywords: deafness; mental retardation; X chromosome; learning disorde...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} {{identified a number of}} single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases. Increasing body of evidence suggests a complex connection of SNPs and the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, which is poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the interplay between genetic risk variants, shifts in methylation and mRNA levels in whole blood from 223 adolescents distinguished by a risk for developing psychiatric disorders. We analyzed 37 SNPs previously associated with psychiatric diseases in relation to genome-wide DNA methylation levels using linear models, with Bonferroni correction and adjusting for cell-type composition. Associations between DNA methylation, mRNA levels and psychiatric disease risk evaluated by the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) score were identified by robust linear models, Pearson's correlations and binary regression models. We detected five SNPs (in HCRTR 1, GAD 1, HADC 3 and FKBP 5) that were associated with eight CpG sites, validating five of these SNP-CpG pairs. Three of these CpG sites, that is, cg 01089319 (GAD 1), cg 01089249 (GAD 1) and cg 24137543 (<b>DIAPH</b> 1), manifest in significant gene expression changes and overlap with active regulatory regions in chromatin states of brain tissues. Importantly, methylation levels at cg 01089319 were associated with the DAWBA score in the discovery group. These results show how distinct SNPs linked with psychiatric diseases are associated with epigenetic shifts with relevance for gene expression. Our findings give a novel insight on how genetic variants may modulate risks for the development of psychiatric diseases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Low {{frequency}} {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (LFSNHL) is an uncommon clinical finding. Mutations within three different identified genes (<b>DIAPH</b> 1, MYO 7 A, and WFS 1) are known to cause LFSNHL. The majority of hereditary LFSNHL is associated with heterozygous mutations in the WFS 1 gene (wolframin protein). The goal {{of this study was}} to use genetic analysis to determine if a small American family's hereditary LFSNHL is linked to a mutation in the WFS 1 gene and to use VEMP and EcochG testing to further characterize the family's audiovestibular phenotype. Methods The clinical phenotype of the American family was characterized by audiologic testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), and electrocochleography (EcochG) evaluation. Genetic characterization was performed by microsatellite analysis and direct sequencing of WFS 1 for mutation detection. Results Sequence analysis of the WFS 1 gene revealed a novel heterozygous mutation at c. 2054 G>C predicting a p. R 685 P amino acid substitution in wolframin. The c. 2054 G>C mutation segregates faithfully with hearing loss in the family and is absent in 230 control chromosomes. The p. R 685 residue is located within the hydrophilic C-terminus of wolframin and is conserved across species. The VEMP and EcochG findings were normal in individuals segregating the WFS 1 c. 2054 G>C mutation. Conclusion We discovered a novel heterozygous missense mutation in exon 8 of WFS 1 predicting a p. R 685 P amino acid substitution that is likely to underlie the LFSNHL phenotype in the American family. For the first time, we describe VEMP and EcochG findings for individuals segregating a heterozygous WFS 1 mutation. </p...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to use microarray analysis to identify significant epithelial signalling pathways and genes in this process. Methods Microarray analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed when epithelial cells were grown in 3 D Matrigel culture with stromal co-culture compared to without stroma. Two culture models were employed: primary epithelial cells (ten samples) and an epithelial cell line (three experiments). A separate microarray analysis was performed on each model system and then compared to identify tissue-relevant genes in a cell line model. Results TGF beta signalling was significantly ranked for both model systems and in both models the TGF beta signalling gene SOX 4 was significantly down regulated. Analysis of all differentially expressed genes to identify genes that were common to both models found several morphology related gene clusters; actin binding (<b>DIAPH</b> 2, FHOD 3, ABLIM 1, TMOD 4, MYH 10), GTPase activator activity (BCR, MYH 10), cytoskeleton (MAP 2, MYH 10, TMOD 4, FHOD 3), protein binding (ITGA 6, CD 44), proteinaceous extracellular matrix (NID 2, CILP 2), ion channel/ ion transporter activity (CACNA 1 C, CACNB 2, KCNH 2, SLC 8 A 1, SLC 39 A 9) and genes associated with developmental pathways (POFUT 1, FZD 2, HOXA 5, IRX 2, FGF 11, SOX 4, SMARCC 1). Conclusions In 3 D prostate cultures, stromal cells increase lateral epithelial cell adhesions. We show that this morphological effect is associated with gene expression changes to TGF beta signalling, cytoskeleton and anion activity. </p...|$|E
