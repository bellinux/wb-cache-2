5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{was based}} in Gloucestershire. One night, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> punch his {{commanding}} officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour. In mid-November, he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle-upon-Tyne where he trained in the used of radar. During his stay there, Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match: the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems, particularly diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins was ticketed on November 24, 2007, for {{suspicion}} of {{contributing to the}} delinquency of a minor and two alcohol charges, {{one of which was}} underage possession of alcohol. He was due in court for an arraignment on December 19, 2007. According to local news sources, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> kill a local teenager, because he thought she had stolen his CD player. He was also convicted as a juvenile of a felony drug conviction while in foster care in Omaha.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of his age, and his family also felt he was too young for service. However, in the winter of 1863, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E

50|$|He makes {{acquaintance}} with young {{social worker and}} psychology student Ana (Ada Condeescu), who asks him {{to fill out a}} questionnaire. On the one hand he likes her, on the other hand <b>he</b> <b>threatens</b> <b>to</b> kill her with a piece of broken glass, and demands that his mother comes. Toward his mother <b>he</b> <b>threatens</b> <b>to</b> kill not only the girl but also himself, and makes her swear she will not take the brother to Italy.|$|R

5|$|By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, {{purchased}} NeXT, {{and named}} Jobs CEO, and Jobs {{is about to}} unveil the iMac at Davies Symphony Hall. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother {{to sell the house}} Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.|$|E
5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson {{backed the}} Marine {{position}} {{due to his}} concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|His {{contract}} having expired {{following the}} season, Johnson was a hold-out when the Rangers opened their training camp {{prior to the}} 1929–30 NHL season as the team was reluctant to meet his demands for increased pay. When the impasse dragged into November, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> quit the game altogether, before finally agreeing to a new three-year deal. He appeared in 30 games for the Rangers that season, but again missed significant time, this time suffering a broken jaw. Again, Johnson returned {{in time for the}} playoffs, but was forced to wear a steel mask to protect his face.|$|E

5|$|In 1788, Marshall {{announced}} his candidacy to be a {{delegate to the}} Virginia Ratifying Convention. The proposed constitution was very unpopular {{in all parts of}} Kentucky except Jefferson County, but Marshall openly favored its ratification. Hoping to wreck Marshall's candidacy, a man named Jordan Harris charged that Marshall had, in a letter to John Crittenden, Sr., acknowledged himself to be a liar. In the pages of the Kentucky Gazette, Marshall called on Harris to publish the letter. Harris was so insulted by Marshall's demand that <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> cane him. At their next meeting, Harris fired two pistols at Marshall. Neither shot injured Marshall, who retaliated by beating Harris with a stick severely enough to force his retreat from the encounter.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, at a journalists' briefing, {{he warned}} that the Royal Navy needed another £1 billion to meet future foreign policy demands and appealed to the Government for {{additional}} funding, {{a third of the}} navy's annual operating budget, to spend on building more modern ships. In a later interview with the Daily Telegraph he said that an increase of more than 30 per cent in the fleet's day-to-day budget was necessary to pay for better sailors' wages, the running of ships and improved accommodation. <b>He</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> resign as head of the navy if the Government failed to agree to pay for two new aircraft carriers – the Royal Navy CVF programme, which it had previously promised.|$|E

5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. <b>He</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> kill anyone and their {{followers}} who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Oates {{signed a}} four-year, $3 million {{contract}} extension with the Blues {{prior to the}} 1991–92 NHL season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid. After playing in his second career All-Star Game, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> walk off the team following the all-star break if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, 2006, one of Ono's bodyguards {{was arrested}} {{after he was}} {{allegedly}} taped trying to extort $2million from her. The tapes revealed that <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he {{pleaded not guilty to}} two counts of attempted grand larceny. In February 16, 2007 a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.|$|E

5|$|The 1964 Supreme Convention was {{scheduled}} to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. A few days before the Convention, new Supreme Knight John W. McDevitt learned the hotel admitted only white guests, under the state's racial segregation policy. <b>He</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> move the Convention to another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule to require that a new applicant could not be rejected by less than one-third of those voting. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.|$|E
5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for {{conflict between the}} Ottomans and Venice was still present, as evidenced in 1638, when a Venetian fleet attacked and destroyed a fleet of Barbary pirates that had sought protection in the Ottoman port of Valona, bombarding {{the city in the}} process. Sultan Murad IV was enraged: <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> execute all Venetians in the Empire, and put an embargo on Venetian trade. Eventually, and given that the Ottomans were still engaged in a war with the Persians, the situation was defused with the Republic paying the Ottomans an indemnity of 250,000 sequins.|$|E

5|$|Tracy's first post-MGM {{appearance}} was in The Mountain (1956) with Robert Wagner, who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played {{his son in}} Broken Lance). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). He again had to be convinced {{to stay with the}} film which met with a weak response.|$|E
5|$|With {{support from}} California (because {{the state had}} profited from the import of sugar), Kalākaua again {{approached}} Congress. When the United States still seemed uninterested in reciprocity, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand. Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|Wright did not {{consider}} the fellowship a formal school, instead viewing it as a benevolent educational institution. He also worked to ensure G.I. Bill eligibility for returning World War II veterans. The town of Wyoming, Wisconsin and Wright became embroiled in a legal dispute over his claim of tax-exemption. A trial judge agreed with the town, stating that since apprentices did much of Wright's work, it was not solely a benevolent institution. Wright fought {{the case to the}} Wisconsin Supreme Court. When Wright lost the case there in 1954, <b>he</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> abandon the estate. However, he was persuaded to stay after some friends raised $800,000 to cover the back taxes at a benefit dinner.|$|E
