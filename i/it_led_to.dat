5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from {{carrying out the}} Sejny Uprising. Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more opposed to the proposed union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, <b>it</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{the failure of the}} nationwide coup.|$|E
5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions <b>it</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> were a perfect fit for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{rejected}} the colonial Western format of education system. He stated that <b>it</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far {{greater emphasis on}} learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.|$|E
5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, {{in one form}} or another, by more than one hundred other countries, and many states have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and problem solving that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting <b>it,</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E

5|$|Portrait of Madame Cézanne (sometimes Portrait of Mrs. Cézanne) is a 1962 Pop art {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is a quotation of Erle Loran's diagram of a Cézanne {{painting of the}} same name. It {{was one of the}} works exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition in Los Angeles. The work became controversial in that <b>it</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a reconsideration of what constitutes art.|$|E
5|$|Stravinsky {{composed}} Threni in 1957–1958 for the Venice Biennale, and it {{was first}} performed there in September 1958. A performance in Paris two months later was a disaster, attributed to inadequate performers and insufficient rehearsals. <b>It</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> mutual recriminations between Stravinsky, Pierre Boulez and Robert Craft.

5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved {{insufficient to}} meet German industrial needs {{and had little}} effect economically.

5|$|The {{execution}} of an Anglo-Saxon king on {{the orders of}} another ruler was very rare, although public hanging and beheading did occur at this time, as has been discovered at the Sutton Hoo site. Æthelberht's death {{at the hands of}} the Mercians made the possibility of any peaceful union between the Anglian peoples (including Mercia) less likely than before. <b>It</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Mercia's domination of East Anglia, whose kings ruled over the kingdom for over three decades after Æthelberht's death.|$|E

5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for <b>it</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Michael Faraday's {{invention of the}} electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, <b>it</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E

The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E
