50|$|On the Boeing 707 the JT3D fan nacelle was {{relatively}} short, whereas the Douglas DC-8 installation {{had a full}} length <b>fan</b> <b>cowl.</b> Pratt & Whitney provided a kit whereby JT3Cs could be converted to the JT3D standard in an overhaul shop.|$|E
50|$|There is, however, another {{installation}} effect: freestream air scrubbing {{an exposed}} <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> {{and its associated}} pylon (where applicable) will create drag. Deducting this term from the streamtube net thrust yields the force applied by the engine to the airframe proper.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{nowhere near}} as {{successful}} as the Pratt & Whitney JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a very advanced engine for its time (late 50's). Like the JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a turbofan derived from a turbojet. General Electric's approach {{was to take the}} single spool CJ805-3 turbojet and incorporate an aft fan/turbine system into the exhaust system. Each turbine blade {{was an integral part of}} a blucket, the outboard section of which was a fan rotor blade. Running freely on a stub shaft, a series of bluckets, mounted on a disc, made up the aft rotor assembly. The efflux from the turbojet expanded through the (inner) turbine annulus. thus providing power directly to the fan blades located in the outer annulus. A full-length cowl, an annular exhaust system and a bucket thrust-reverser were fitted for the Convair 990. A relatively short <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> and thrust reverser [...] was used to demonstrate the engine on the Sud Aviation Caravelle. The CJ805-23, if chosen, would have replaced the Rolls-Royce Avon. Rolls-Royce quickly built and tested an aft-fan demonstrator Avon to compete with the greater thrust and lower sfc of the CJ805-23. In the end the Caravelle was re-engined with the P&W JT8D turbofan.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowl,</b> particularly the material {{of which it is}} made, on the acoustic noise emitted from PWM controlled induction machines is investigated. It is shown that there are significant harmonic excitation forces which can cause mechanical resonances of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowl.</b> The mechanical behaviour of both metal and plastic cowls is measured, using impulse force tests and random PWM excitation. The noise spectra and sound pressure level of a 1. 5 kW 3 -phase induction machine when equipped with a metal and a plastic <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> are investigated, and the noise spectra when the machine is supplied from sub-harmonic PWM, space vector PWM and random PWM inverter are compared. It shows that a metal <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> can significantly amplify the noise level, whilst the noise level with a plastic <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> is effectively the same as that with the cowl removed...|$|E
40|$|A tool {{to create}} {{parametric}} aerodynamic shapes using intuitive design variables based on class shape transformation (CST) curves is presented. To enable this, a {{system has been}} developed which accepts arbitrary constraints and automatically derives the analytical expressions which describe the corresponding class shape transformation curves. Parametric geometry definitions for <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> and intake aero-lines were developed using the generalized method. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> shows that despite the simple geometry definition, its performance characteristics are close to what would be expected of a finished design. The intake geometry was generated {{in a similar way}} and met the typical performance metrics for conventional intakes. This demonstrates the usefulness of the tool to quickly and robustly produce parametric aero-lines with good aerodynamic properties, using relatively simple intuitive design variables...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the location}} of the transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer flow on a hybrid laminar flow(HLF) engine nacelle flight tested on the DLR VFW 614 /ATTAS is carried out using the e N method of the local linear stability theory. The value of the limiting N factor N LIM required for the transition prediction has been derived from an analysis of flight tests with a natural laminar flow engine nacelle previously flight tested on the same aircraft at the same flight and engine operating conditions. In contrast to the flight trials with the natural laminar flow nacelle, for the HLF nacelle flight tests there existed an additional receptivity component due to the waviness of the forebody surface of the manufactured HLF nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> as result of the aerodynamic surface quality not complying with the manufacturing specification. For the validation of the transition prediction, results obtained using the infrared thermography as well as the external surface temperature distribution on the HLF nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> have been drawn upon. It is found that the transition location prediction by the e N method underestimates the longitudinal extent of the laminar boundary layer flow on the HLF nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> by about the same amount by which the experimentally determined transition location differs between the infrared thermography and the surface temperature measurement results...|$|E
40|$|Some {{lessons learned}} as regards flow {{transition}} detection {{in the course}} of flight-testing carbon fiber composite conventional and laminar flow nacelles are presented. The key objective of the flight trials was to examine the influences of environmental phenomena and of the engine nacelle structure regarding the interpretation of the nacelle infrared images and of the nacelle surface temperature measurements, both with reference to determining the location of the flow transition front on the nacelles. As regards the application of the infrared thermography, the study has yielded the result that the quality of the infrared images is influenced by heat radiation to space and from Earth, as well as by reflection of sunlight from the airframe. For good quality infrared images, only carbon fiber composites should be used as structural material for the nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowls.</b> In addition, the mechanical design of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowls</b> should not contain any stiffening frames in the substructure, but the should be designed as a uniform honeycomb skin structure. Concerning the surface temperature measurements, for good-quality results,a uniform honeycomb carbon fiber composite skin structure is just as essential as for the infrared imaging system...|$|R

40|$|Results {{are given}} of several {{analytical}} studies of nacelles suitable for advanced subsonic commercial transport aircraft. The {{impact on the}} nacelle of reduced aircraft noise and increased cruise Mach number is emphasized and initially developed {{in terms of the}} individual nacelle components: inlet, <b>fan</b> <b>cowl,</b> nozzle, etc. This is achieved by relating the noise and cruise speed constraints to which the aircraft system must be designed to specific limitations on the individual nacelle components.

40|$|A {{stability}} {{analysis of}} the laminar boundary layer on a natural laminar flow engine nacelle flight tested on the DLR VFW 614 /ATTAS is performed. Since the flow on this nacelle is effectively two-dimensional, only the flow transition due to Tollmien-Schlichting waves is considered. The e^N method of the local linear boundary layer stability theory is applied to determine the limiting N factors N_LIM for various flight Mach numers Ma and chord Reynolds numbers Rec making use of the SALLY code. The flight trials covered a flight Mach number regime 0. 26 < Ma < 0. 59 and the nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> chord Reynolds number range was 5. 5 x 10 hoch 6 < Rec < 8. 9 x 10 hoch 6. Key objective of the analysis was {{the determination of the}} effect of flight and engine operating conditions on the calculated limiting N factor. The results of the investigation show that the type of external surface static pressure distribution on the nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> has a marked effect on the magnitude of the limiting N factor. A comparison of the limiting N factors for the VFW 614 /ATTAS natural laminar flow nacelle flight tests with those from flight trials of a natural laminar flow wing glove on the VWF 614 /ATTAS and the LFU 205 shows for the nacelle the value of N_LIM with N_LIM = 9 - 10 to be lower by DeltaN_LIM = 4 - 5 than for the wing glove cases for the same flight Mach number and transition Reynolds number ranges...|$|E

40|$|Further experiments, to {{investigate}} the interference of the Jet stream issuing from a high bypass ratio engine mounted below a wing, are described. Tests have been made with a two-dimensional wing, and two nozzle shapes representing engues with different <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> lengths. A Jet blonng from these nozzles produced negligible interference on the wing upper surface. However, a change in th 8 lower surface pressure distribution occurred which was dependent only on the wing and nozzle geometry. This interference was dominated by a high suction peak, which appeared {{to be related to}} a region in the Jet where the alternate expansion and compression waves were not uniformly spaced. The tests were conducted mostly without an engine pylon. When a pylon was introduced the effect was reduced slightly, but the character of the Interference remained unaltered.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} high {{capital investment}} required for large autoclaves, ovens and facilities for the processmg of large composite components creates {{a number of}} financial constraints for the development and manufacturing of larger composite aircraft products. This thesis has investigated the use of heated tooling {{as an alternative to}} the use of autoclave and oven curing. A design and development methodology for heated tools has been proposed while a number of heated tooling options have been identified and described. Three representative heated tool options using heater mats, electro-conductive textiles and wire heater elements have been evaluated. The curing capability of a prototype heated tool incorporating wire heater elements has been proved by carrying out a number of curing tests on RFI (Resin Fihn Infusion) laminates. The moulded laminates indicate that a 78 - 83 % extent of cure is achieved prior to post-cure. The fibre and void content of cured laminates has also been verified through acid digestion and microscopy, where an acceptable fibre volume fraction (Vf) of 55 - 57 % and a void content of less than 2 % have been achieved. The usefulness of ID and 3 D thermal Finite Element Analysis for the design and simulation of heated tooling has also been studied. A manufacturing and cost analysis study carried out has identified potential production implications, while the cost effectiveness of heated tooling compared to oven and autoclave processmg has been indicated. Cost reductions are noted in capital investments, operational costs and production set-up costs per part. The work described in this thesis gives valuable information for the implementation of heated tooling as a new processing method for aerospace composite products.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} robust and {{efficient}} method to design a flap assembly to be resistant to a full scale experimental bird strike in according to the airworthiness certifications. In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including wing track attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the roller carriages, which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty seats. The flap model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by wing, <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage). Result overview allows the selection of the bird impact points based on links and composite failure criteria, in particular on the flap tracks metallic attachments, and lower skin and rear spar damage; Result of current work have allowed to establish robust criteria and to define most critical impact points need to be investigated by means of a strike test. Reducing number of shots a two location allow laboratories to perform test bus using of a unique test specimen saving time and cost. The conclusion of this activity is dedicated a comparison of test result performed and relevant analysis. For the two shots strain gauge and force reaction history acquisition will be compared...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design of}} a Low Noise ADP Research Fan stage. The fan is a variable pitch design which is designed at the cruise pitch condition. Relative to the cruise setting, the blade is closed at takeoff and opened for reverse thrust operation. The fan stage is a split flow design with fan exit guide vanes and core stators. This fan stage design was combined with a nacelle and engine core duct to form a powered fan/nacelle, subscale model. This model is intended for use in aerodynamic performance, acoustic and structural testing in a wind tunnel. The model has a 22 -inch outer fan diameter and a hub-to-top ratio of 0. 426 which permits the use of existing NASA <b>fan</b> and <b>cowl</b> force balance designs and rig drive system. The design parameters were selected to permit valid acoustic and aerodynamic comparisons with the PW 17 -inch rig previously tested under NASA contract. The fan stage design is described in detail. The results of the design axisymmetric analysis at aerodynamic design condition are included. The structural analysis of the fan rotor and attachment is described including the material selections and stress analysis. The blade and attachment are predicted to have adequate low cycle fatigue life, and an acceptable operating range without resonant stress or flutter. The stage was acoustically designed with airfoil counts in the fan exit guide vane and core stator to minimize noise. A fan-FEGV tone analysis developed separately under NASA contract was used to determine these airfoil counts. The fan stage design was matched to a nacelle design to form a fan/nacelle model for wind tunnel testing. The nacelle design was developed under a separate NASA contract. The nacelle was designed with an axisymmetric inlet, cowl and nozzle for convenience in testing and fabrication. Aerodynamic analysis of the nacelle confirmed the required performance at various aircraft operating conditions...|$|R
