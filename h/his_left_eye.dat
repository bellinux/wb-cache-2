5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} from poor eyesight, especially in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He {{appeared to have}} been near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.|$|E

Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> so badly in the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where his pants were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the threat was not carried out.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} with a {{deformed}} left arm from the effects of a rare object, known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus and meets clown Mana Walker (who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires). When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through Millennium Earl. Mana, revived as a demon known as an Akuma, cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens as an anti-Akuma weapon, later called , and destroys Mana. <b>His</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> allows him to see the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General Cross Marian soon adopts Allen as a disciple.|$|E
5|$|Davis's renewed {{service in}} the Senate was {{interrupted}} in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him {{with the loss of}} <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.|$|E
60|$|Petru {{returned}} to his brothers, and told them what had befallen him; but not long after it struck him that <b>his</b> father's <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> seemed to weep less, {{and the right to}} laugh more.|$|R

5|$|In {{his next}} title defense, Hughes fought Gil Castillo at , {{defeating}} the former Middleweight contender via TKO. Hughes started the match {{with a big}} slam {{and then began to}} attack from Castillo's guard with elbows and punches. Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo. As he passed to half guard, Castillo was bleeding above <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> The challenger's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere. The round ended with Hughes on top, ground-and-pounding his opponent. Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe to continue, and Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, {{who was a}} smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.|$|E
5|$|Kaldalis is a protoss zealot and a {{close friend}} of Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis takes pride {{in the history of the}} protoss and the Khala, though does not express {{prejudice}} towards the Nerazim, and believes that driving them away was a sin. A scar runs down <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> Kaldalis survived the zerg conquest of Aiur during the Great War. Afterwards, he joined the Protoss Protectorate led by Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' vision of a unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1939, 24 RAF Vickers Wellington bombers from Marham and Mildenhall bases {{attacked}} Heligoland. These were {{intercepted by}} I./ZG 26 {{along with other}} Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. Specht scored his third victory, shooting down a bomber over the North Sea. But he was also seriously injured by return fire from the Wellington's tail gunner, seriously wounding him in the face. Ditching into the sea, he {{was picked up by}} rescue craft. Losing the sight in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> he spent the next six months in recovery. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} fearless in defence of its nest and young, and, like other Strix owls, strikes for the intruder's head with its sharp talons. Because its flight is silent, {{it may not}} be {{detected}} until it is too late to avoid the danger. Dogs, cats and humans may be assaulted, sometimes without provocation. Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer Eric Hosking, who lost <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> when struck by a bird he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. He later called his autobiography An Eye for a Bird.|$|E

25|$|Late {{at night}} on 10 February 1942, Wavell {{prepared}} to board a flying boat, to fly from Singapore to Java. He {{stepped out of a}} staff car, not noticing (because of <b>his</b> blind <b>left</b> <b>eye)</b> that it was parked {{at the edge of a}} pier. He broke two bones in his back when he fell, and this injury affected his temperament for some time.|$|R
40|$|Lincoln was the 16 th President of the United States. He is {{credited}} with preserving the union, freeing the slaves. He had a good command of the English language as demonstrated in his Gettysburg Address. In this portrait Lincoln looks haggard with heavy lines in his face. <b>His</b> "lazy" <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> is noticeable. This is a positive of the collodion wet-plate negative portrait of Lincoln created by Alexander Gardner...|$|R
5|$|Trinidad {{defended his}} {{title for the}} next three years against several opponents. Trinidad's first fight in Las Vegas was against Héctor Camacho on January 29, 1994. He was {{cautious}} during the first rounds and received a cut over <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> In the third round he connected a solid combination that made Camacho change to a defensive stance. Throughout the fight Trinidad was on the offensive and won the fight by unanimous decision, in what was his first decision since he won the world championship. The scores awarded by the judges were 117–109, 116–110, and 119–106.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is {{severely}} wounded during an RAF air raid in Tunisia, losing his right hand, {{the ring and}} little finger on his left hand, and <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the Führers personal airplane. The bomb, however, is a dud and fails to detonate, and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht to find a replacement. After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht presents Stauffenberg {{at a meeting of}} the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life. The members include General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler, and Erwin von Witzleben. Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of what is to be done after Hitler's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{disagreement}} with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over {{the direction the}} party was heading, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded {{in a pile of}} burning wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public Holocaust denial meeting hosted by David Irving.|$|E
50|$|William Scott Elam, {{known as}} Jack Elam (November 13, 1920 - October 20, 2003), was an American film and {{television}} actor {{best known for his}} numerous roles as villains in Western films and, later in his career, comedies (sometimes spoofing his villainous image). His most distinguishing physical quality was <b>his</b> lazy <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> Before <b>his</b> career in acting, he took several jobs in finance and served two years in the United States Navy during World War II.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of his}} life, Chedwick {{was plagued}} with {{impaired}} vision, which {{led him to the}} practice of wearing prescription eyeglasses with dark lenses, which also aided in hiding <b>his</b> crossed <b>left</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>His</b> vision-related problems ultimately robbed him of his ability to drive a car. In 1990, he was diagnosed with a large, benign brain tumor. When news broke of the diagnosis, it sent a shock throughout Pittsburgh and a national community of pioneer artists who still felt in his debt. Friends including Little Anthony, Hank Ballard, Lou Christie, Wolfman Jack, Johnnie and Joe, Bobby Comstock, The Marcels, The Vogues, and Bo Diddley organized a benefit concert to help shoulder the huge medical bill for the operation from which he fully recovered. The surgery was performed at West Penn Hospital and drew more than five thousand get-well cards from fans and other supporters. Some remaining money from the fund-raiser was put into a trust fund against the day when Chedwick would need long-term residential or hospice care. Not long after Chedwick's brain surgery, he also underwent a second operation to correct <b>his</b> crossed <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> enabling him to see with clear lenses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have that Rat and {{the other}} gone?" [...] he asked of us, wiping his damp brow with his sleeve; and I saw that fear had sobered him and that for awhile the madness had <b>left</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Ben showed a {{developed}} vocabulary. In 1860, {{he was sent}} to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the American Civil War began. In 1863, he came home for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina). The South's desperate need for soldiers ended this plan, and in June 1864, still not yet 17, he withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a coastal artillery unit. These plans were scuttled as well when he fell ill at home. A cranial tumor led to the removal of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye,</b> and it was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.|$|E
5|$|In March 1792, the King {{commissioned}} Prince Ernest Augustus as {{a colonel}} into the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons. The Prince {{served in the}} Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian, and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head, {{which resulted in a}} disfiguring scar. During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794 his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>eye</b> faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786.|$|E
5|$|Singh turned {{professional}} as {{he signed}} a multi-year agreement with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions through IOS Sports and Entertainment. On 10 October 2015 Singh fought his first professional boxing match. He defeated his opponent Sonny Whiting by TKO. On 7 November, Singh knocked British boxer Dean Gillen in round 1 at the National Stadium in Dublin. In his third pro fight, Singh fought on the undercard of Lee-Saunders on December 19.

Singh won via 3rd-round TKO, knocking down Soldra in round 5 to mark his 6th professional win in a row, all coming by way of knockout.|$|E
