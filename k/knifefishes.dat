25|$|Their closest living {{relatives}} are the Characiformes (characins and allies), the Gymnotiformes (electric eel and American <b>knifefishes)</b> and the Siluriformes (catfishes).|$|E
25|$|Historically these {{included}} all the forms now {{placed in the}} superorder Ostariophysi except the catfish, which {{were placed in the}} order Siluriformes. By this definition, the Cypriniformes were paraphyletic, so recently the orders Gonorhynchiformes, Characiformes (characins and allies), and Gymnotiformes (<b>knifefishes</b> and electric eels) have been separated out to form their own monophyletic orders.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{fish are}} capable of {{generating}} an external electric fields or receive electric fields (electroreception). Electric fish can be further divided into three categories: strongly discharging, weakly discharging, and fish that sense but is unable to generate electric fields. Strongly electric fish generate strong electric field up to 500 volts for predatory purposes; Strongly electric fish include both marine and fresh water fishes (two freshwater taxa- African electric catfish (Malapterurus electricus) and the Neotropical electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and the marine torpedo rays (Torpedo)). Weakly electric fish generates electric fields mainly for communication and electrolocation purposes; weakly electric fish are found in fresh water only and includes African freshwater Mormyridae and Gymnarchus and Neotropical electric <b>knifefishes.</b> Lastly, fish that are only able to detect electrical signals includes sharks, rays, skates, catfishes, {{and a number of}} other groups (see Electroreception).|$|E

2500|$|Auto{{communication}} {{is a type}} {{of communication}} in which the sender and receiver are the same individual. The sender emits a signal that is altered by the environment and eventually is received by the same individual. The altered signal provides information that can indicate food, predators or conspecifics. Because the sender and receiver are the same animal, selection pressure maximizes signal efficacy, i.e. the degree to which an emitted signal is correctly identified by a receiver despite propagation distortion and noise. [...] There are two types of autocommunication. [...] The first is active electrolocation found in the electric fish Gymnotiformes (<b>knifefishes)</b> and Mormyridae (elephantfish) and also in the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). [...] The second type of autocommunication is echolocation, found in bats and Odontoceti.|$|E
2500|$|Obligate {{cavefish}} {{are known}} {{from a wide}} range of families: Characidae (characids), Balitoridae (hillstream loaches), Cobitidae (true loaches), Cyprinidae (carps and allies), Nemacheilidae (stone loaches), Amblycipitidae (torrent catfishes), Astroblepidae (naked sucker-mouth catfishes), Callichthyidae (armored catfishes), Clariidae (airbreathing catfishes), Heptapteridae (heptapterid catfishes), Ictaluridae (ictalurid catfishes), Kryptoglanidae (kryptoglanid catfish), Loricariidae (loricariid catfishes), Phreatobiidae (phreatobiid catfishes), Trichomycteridae (pencil catfishes), Sternopygidae (glass <b>knifefishes),</b> Amblyopsidae (U.S. cavefishes), Bythitidae (brotulas), Poeciliidae (live-bearers), Synbranchidae (swamp eels), Cottidae (true sculpins), Eleotridae (sleeper gobies) and Gobiidae (gobies). Many of these families are only very distantly related and do not form a monophyletic group, showing that adaptations to a life in caves has happened numerous times among fish. As such, the descriptive term [...] "cavefish" [...] is an example of folk taxonomy rather than scientific taxonomy. Strictly speaking some Cyprinodontidae (pupfish) are also known from sinkhole caves, famously including the Devils Hole pupfish, but these lack the adaptations (e.g., reduced eyes and pigmentation) typically associated with cavefish. Additionally, species from a few families such as Chaudhuriidae (earthworm eels), Glanapteryginae and Sarcoglanidinae live buried in the bottom of aboveground waters, and can show adaptions similar to traditional underground-living (troglobitic) fish. It has been argued that such species should be recognized as a part of the group of troglobitic fish.|$|E
50|$|The clown featherback, clown <b>knifefish,</b> or spotted <b>knifefish,</b> Chitala ornata, is a nocturnal {{tropical}} {{fish with}} a long, knife-like body.

50|$|The Gymnotiformes are a {{group of}} teleost bony fishes {{commonly}} known as the Neotropical or South American <b>knifefish.</b> They have long bodies and swim using undulations of their elongated anal fin. Found exclusively in fresh water, these mostly nocturnal fish are capable of producing electric fields for navigation, communication, and, {{in the case of the}} electric eel (Electrophorus electricus), attack and defense. A few species are familiar to the aquarium trade, such as the black ghost <b>knifefish</b> (Apteronotus albifrons), the glass <b>knifefish</b> (Eigenmannia virescens), and the banded <b>knifefish</b> (Gymnotus carapo).|$|R
