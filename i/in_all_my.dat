25|$|I {{must say}} that <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> conversations with you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> fifty years of public service I {{have never seen a}} document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Sons, these {{elements}} are all present; {{it takes place}} within a 24-hour period, has a protagonist suffering from a previous offense, and the punishment for that offense. Additionally, it explores the father-son relationship, also a common theme in Greek tragedies. Ann Deever could also be seen to parallel a messenger as her letter is proof of Larry's death.|$|E
25|$|Henrik Ibsen's {{influence}} on Miller is evidenced from the Ibsen play The Wild Duck, where Miller took {{the idea of}} two partners in a business where one is forced to take moral and legal responsibility for the other. This is mirrored <b>in</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Sons. He also borrowed {{the idea of a}} character’s idealism being the source of a problem.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{is known}} for the {{consciousness}} of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller <b>in</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Sons and John Proctor in The Crucible. Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Mattel created two dolls {{based on}} Erica Kane {{as part of}} the company's Daytime Drama Collection. They {{released}} the first one in 1998. Mattel modeled that doll after the character's appearance during the Crystal Ball, an annual event <b>in</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Childrens storylines. After that doll met with success, they released the second in 1999 called the Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane Doll. This one was based on the character as she was during the 1993 wedding to Dimitri Marick.|$|E

Nicole Linkletter and CariDee English were winning contestants of Cycles 5 and 7, respectively, of America's Next Top Model.

25|$|Arthur Miller’s writing <b>in</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Sons often shows {{great respect}} for the great Greek tragedies of the likes of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. In these plays the tragic hero or protagonist will commit an offense, often unknowingly, which will return to haunt him, {{sometimes}} many years later. The play encapsulates all {{the fallout from the}} offense into a 24-hour time span. During that day, the protagonist must learn his fate and suffer as a result, and perhaps even die. In this way the gods are shown to be just and moral order is restored.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{was sold}} in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, {{and for the past}} few years as a hotel. In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E
25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> dealings.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, several {{actors have}} {{remained}} {{playing the same}} character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap As the World Turns from its April 2, 1956 debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for twenty years or longer, occasionally {{on more than one}} show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both General Hospital and Port Charles from 1964 until 2007, and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane <b>in</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on One Life to Live from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012 and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.|$|E
500|$|James Felici, {{author of}} the Complete Manual of Typography, says that the topic of {{sentence}} spacing is [...] "the debate that refuses to die... <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> years of writing about type, it's still the question I hear most often, and {{a search of the}} web will find threads galore on the subject." [...] This subject is still widely debated today.|$|E
500|$|Coach Yost added: [...] "Schultz {{is without}} doubt the best {{center in the}} country. [...] In fact, Schulz is the best {{man in the middle}} of the line I have ever seen <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> {{football}} experience". [...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. [...] In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|E

500|$|The {{topic of}} Ulysses encountering the Sirens was {{well suited to}} Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, [...] "My aim <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> great {{pictures}} has been to paint some great moral on the heart... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, [...] "Their song is death, and makes destruction please./ Unblest the man whom music wins to stay/ Nigh the curs'd shore, {{and listen to the}} lay... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around/ Lie human bones that whiten all the ground./ The ground polluted floats with human gore/ And human carnage taints the dreadful shore." ...|$|E
500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{until her death}} in 2002, Howard {{returned}} to her lifelong fascination with light, night skies, the reflective surface of water. In these last paintings, there is a recurrence of circular elements, an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light. [...] Howard has stated: [...] "In my painting (as <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> work) I am deeply involved with light as the movement and inter-action of colours; the integrity of colour and form, hence with {{the integrity of the}} total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence, not representation. I am preoccupied with life's ambiguities and dualities and in my later work I am reaching more and more from the dark toward light, freedom, and a transcending exuberance." ...|$|E
