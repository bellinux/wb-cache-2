First a general result for arrays of cells, each cell consisting of two conducting cones with common apex, is devel-oped. This leads to formulas for an effective early-time rise and early-time polarization for the <b>far</b> <b>fields.</b> The general results are then applied to the special case in which each unit cell consists of a symmetrical planar bicone. For this case the formulas for early-time rise, polarization angle, and im-pedance are developed and plotted as functions of the bicone angle and angles to the distant observer...|$|R

25|$|This method {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the {{radiation}} resistance for any antenna whose <b>far</b> <b>field</b> radiation pattern has been found in terms of a specific antenna current. If ohmic losses in the conductors are neglected, the radiation resistance (considered relative to the feedpoint) is identical to the resistive (real) component of the feedpoint impedance.

25|$|<b>Far</b> <b>field</b> methods achieve longer ranges, often {{multiple}} kilometer ranges, {{where the}} distance {{is much greater}} than the diameter of the device(s). The main reason for longer ranges with radio wave and optical devices is the fact that electromagnetic radiation in the far-field can be made to match the shape of the receiving area (using high directivity antennas or well-collimated laser beams). The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.|$|E

25|$|The <b>far</b> <b>field</b> {{pattern is}} thus seen {{to consist of}} a {{transverse}} electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields {{at right angles to}} each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of r, as we assumed the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the θ direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the Z direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the φ direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly in phase. Both fields fall according to 1/r, with the power thus falling according to 1/r2 as dictated by the inverse square law.|$|E
