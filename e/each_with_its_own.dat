5|$|Organized into {{separate}} departments, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> chief reviewer, the Analytical Review focused on politics, philosophy, natural history, and literature.

5|$|After the {{successful}} {{invasion of the}} Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Caliph Abu Bakr sent an expedition to invade the Levant (Roman Syria). The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{from most}} of the {{architectural}} periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.|$|E

5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions {{had to be made}} on the basis of compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the Muslim {{world had}} {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, {{a preference for}} the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, {{was supported by the}} Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy.

Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose control of its respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E

Planting and {{the shape of the}} landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.|$|E

There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do's {{position}} as the biggest taekwondo school in Australia is supported by independently verifiable listings of dojang. It has at least 294 publicly listed dojang in Australia, with perhaps around 1,400 dojang in total at its peak. The claim might be disputed if the Australian member schools of the ITF and the WTF were considered as 'schools' as a whole, whether in terms of numbers of dojang or numbers of members. Rhee Taekwon-Do is, however, a single school under the direct leadership of Rhee while both the ITF and WTF are groups of schools (<b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> head) under a larger governing body.|$|E
