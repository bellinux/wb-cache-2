40|$|The Islamic {{bonds or}} sukuk market {{is one of}} the fastest growing {{segments}} of the nearly US$ 2 trillion global Islamic finance industry. However, lack of trading in secondary sukuk markets is a peculiar feature in this sector and both institutional and retail sukuk investors are known to adopt a <b>held-to-maturity</b> investment strategy. Consequently, there is a critical gap in literature in studying the portfolio diversification opportunities available to sukuk investors and evaluating these in the light of <b>held-to-maturity</b> strategies. This paper (using recently available data and continuous wavelet transform methodologies) has made an initial attempt to study the portfolio diversification strategies for Islamic bond (sukuk) portfolios across heterogeneous investment horizons using the Malaysian and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) sukuk markets as a case study. Our findings critically indicate that returns between local currency sukuk in different markets have low levels of long-term correlations, thus enabling portfolio diversification benefits. However, international currency sukuk issued in different markets exhibit high levels of long-term correlations which impede portfolio diversification benefits for <b>held-to-maturity</b> investments. A similar impediment is also witnessed in the domestic market context where diversification is intended by investing in different types of domestic sukuk. Overall, our findings critically highlight the feasibility of <b>held-to-maturity</b> sukuk investment strategies from a portfolio diversification perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|Statement 115 lists several {{changes in}} {{circumstances}} that may cause an entity {{to change its}} intent to hold a security to maturity without calling into question ("tainting") its future intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. The sale or transfer of a <b>held-to-maturity</b> security {{as a result of}} one of those changes in circumstances is not deemed to be inconsistent with a previously stated intent to hold a security to maturity. Sales of heldto-maturity securities with the intent to reacquire the same or substantially the same securities at some future date (for example, wash sales) or exchanges of substantially the same debt securities (for example, bond swaps) generally are not reported as sales for accounting purposes. However, those types of transactions are not specifically included Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 1 in the exceptions cited in Statement 115 that would not call into question the entity’s intent to hold other debt securities to maturity.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the Nigerian financial institutions. Nigeria have been using domestic accounting standard (NGAAP) for banks and non-banks financial institutions known as Statement of Accounting Standards (SAS 10 Part 1 and SAS 15 Part 2) issued in 1990 and 1997 respectively for financial reporting. These domestic standards were adopted from International Accounting Standards (IAS 30) but have not been updated like IAS 30 {{as reported by the}} Report on Observance of Standard Codes (ROSC) of Nigeria in 2004 and 2011. The change in accounting regulations is {{as a result of the}} weaknesses of NGAAP and low disclosure requirements. IFRS reporting has more disclosures than NGAAP especially for financial institutions. Under NGAAP financial instruments have not been classified as in IFRS. For instance, financial instruments have been classified into four under IAS 39 as; (i) recognised fair value on gain or loss in profit or loss, (ii) are measured at amortised cost for investments <b>held-to-maturity,</b> (iii) measured at amortised cost for loans and receivables, (iv) measured at fair value gain or loss for available-for-sale financial assets recognised in other comprehensive income. Additionally, financial liabilities have been categories into two namely; (i) measured at amortised fair value on financial liabilities through profit or loss and, (ii) measured at amortised other liabilities. Now with the mandatory adoptions of reporting under IFRS by all listed financial institutions, will the accounting disclosures be more valu...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors (IASB’s Conceptual Framework ED/ 2015 / 3). General purpose financial reports provide information about the financial position of a reporting entity, {{as well as information}} about the effects of transactions and other events that will change a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims (para 1. 12 ED/ 2015 / 3). Investor confidence and trust in the financial statements is a crucial component for financial markets to function smoothly. This report presents the attitudes and concerns of over 700 respondents toward fair value accounting. The survey shows there is a high level of trust toward financial statements, with higher levels of trust shown in financial statements prepared using a hybrid measurement model of historical cost and fair value accounting vis-à-vis a single measurement basis model (either historical cost or fair value accounting). More than 75 % of the survey respondents perceive fair value accounting to provide useful information for trading securities, available-for-sale securities and real estate; but less than 60 % of the respondents perceive fair value accounting to provide useful information for <b>held-to-maturity</b> securities, loans and receivables, property, plant and equipment, biological assets and intangible assets. However, there are lingering concerns toward the reliability of fair value measurements. Specifically, 26 % of respondents state that they distrust fair value estimates. The survey respondents have low/very low trust in Level 3 fair value estimates (39 %) as compared to Level 1 and Level 2 fair value estimates (13 % and 23 % respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} case studies on various areas of financial accounting. The areas of financial accounting discussed include inventory valuation, relevant income and assets, statement of cash flows, accounts receivable and estimations, inventory and revenue recognition, depreciation, international accounting standards, long-term debt, stockholders’ equity, securities, income and regulation, deferred taxes, and pension and retirement plans. In the financial accounting case on inventory valuation, two companies’ financial statement values were analyzed through evaluating the related balance sheets and income statements to determine which company would be a better investment. Through ratio analysis related to profitability and liquidity of the companies, it was determined that Glenwood Heating, Inc. is the better potential investment. For the second case on financial accounting, several different kinds of income and assets were evaluated to determine which income statement and balance sheet accounts are most relevant for investors and other users of the financial statements. The income accounts that were considered include persistent income, equity income, interest income, and other income from operations. The the asset accounts that were determined critical for decision making by investors and other users of the financial statements include total operating assets, assets from affiliates, and investments. The third case provides a thorough discussion and explanation on the purpose, format, and usage of the statement of cash flows. The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to report cash receipts or inflows and cash payments or outflows during the fiscal period. For the fourth case, Accounts Receivable and Estimations, several different contributors to the accounts receivable account are discussed and analyzed for a specific company, Pearson. Accounts that affect accounts receivable include current receivables, trade receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts, and allowance for sales returns. Additionally, journal entries are expressed to show how the specific account affects accounts receivable. The fifth case addresses the revenue recognition financial accounting principle to determine if a specific company, GAC, has accurately calculated financial statement accounts, such as revenue, accounts receivable, inventory, and unearned revenue. Through an evaluation of the revenue recognition principle and GAC’s financial statements, it was determined that the company was breaking the revenue recognition principle and must change the account values accordingly. The sixth case evaluates different depreciation methods considering both legal and illegal methods for decreasing depreciation expense in the fiscal period. Northwest, Delta, and United Airlines used legal methods to depreciate the same asset different over a certain period, but Waste Management used illegal depreciation methods to falsify earnings to investors, the public, and the SEC. The seventh case explains the differences between GAAP and IFRS when accounting for various liabilities. For the eight case, long-term debt was evaluated in Rite Aid to explore different kinds of debt, methods of issuance, interest expense, and discounts on bond payables through journal entries and calculations. The ninth case, Stockholders’ Equity, evaluates the common stock, treasury stock, dividends, and related ratios in two companies to consider different method for accounting for these values and transactions and to determine what the resulting values tell investors about the company. For the tenth case, State Street Corporation’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what securities the company current held. Through exploration of the unclassified balance sheet, it was established that State Street Corporation held trading securities, listed at fair value, available-for-sale securities, listed at fair value, and <b>held-to-maturity</b> securities, accounted for at amortized cost. The eleventh case considers several large corporations’ business models to establish what risks these companies face and which aspects of the financials are most important in determining risk. It was decided that revenue and revenue growth are more important than income and income growth. For the twelfth case, ZAGG, Inc. ’s financial statements were analyzed to determine what factors contribute to the total income tax calculation for a company with international operations. The factors included in the income tax calculation were tax at federal statutory rate, state tax, non-deductible expense, domestic production activities deduction, return to provision adjustment, and increase in valuation allowance. The thirteenth case, explores and explains defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans and considers related advantages and disadvantages...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission’s recent {{decision}} 1 {{to require the}} use of international accounting standards (IAS 2) for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of listed companies is motivated by the very understandable and justifiable desire to improve the comparability of financial statements and achieve a level playing field. However, it raises a number of issues of principle, and some major practical difficulties. Looking beyond technical implementation issues, central bankers are faced with two crucial questions in terms of the maintenance of financial stability. – Are the standards sufficiently prudent in today’s climate of economic uncertainty and mistrust of the markets, and will they address the shortcomings that have recently been revealed? – Is there not a risk of the standards introducing artificial volatility into financial statements, impairing a proper understanding of the true position of economic agents? This article looks at the main changes proposed by the IASB in the light of these two questions, and in particular at changes which have a very significant impact on financial intermediaries, which oil the wheels of every economy. The changes in accounting for credit risk by credit institutions introduced by the revised IAS 39 3 are undoubtedly an advance in conceptual terms: by requiring the earlier recognition of risk in the accounts, they should reduce the cyclical nature (and hence the volatility) of the financial reporting of credit risk. They are also an advance in terms of regulatory convergence, in that they are closer to the prudential rules included in the new solvency ratio. As regards the determination of corporate risk exposures and the criteria for derecognition – an issue at the heart of recent accounting scandals – the IASB proposes a middle way between two contrasting approaches. On the one hand there is the view that favours form over the economic substance of risks; this has led some standard-setters to allow derecognitions that look excessive given the actual risk exposure. Other standard-setters define the concept of risk in very broad terms, prohibiting any transfer of assets and liabilities off balance sheet or any use of derecognition where the “transferor” retains the risks or rewards (i. e. profits) of a transferred asset. These two extreme positions lead to very different definitions of what should be in a balance sheet. The approach recommended by the IASB is a compromise. Although it undoubtedly needs to be made more effective, it does offer an interesting perspective. However, the concept of fair value, a key element in the IASB framework, and the proposed arrangements regarding risk management and hedging by banks, pose serious problems in terms of financial stability. Fair value accounting involves valuing as many balance and off balance sheet items as possible at market value, or where there is no market value, at a valuation calculated using modelling techniques. This appears to run counter to the principle of prudence, and to create artificial volatility in earnings and equity. Valuing all except <b>held-to-maturity</b> securities at market value, irrespective of liquidity or negotiability or of the intention of the owner, contravenes the principle of prudence in that some of the potential capital gains thus calculated may prove to be wholly illusory. Moreover, this approach will inevitably lead to unjustifiably high volatility in earnings and equity, which might actually aggravate the current confusion in the markets. The IASB proposals on risk hedging have similar negative effects to those on fair value accounting. The IASB requires mark-to-market valuation for all hedging instruments. The logical implication of this approach – if the principle of symmetrical treatment is to be preserved – is that the same valuation method should be used for hedged items as well. This proposal risks extending fair value accounting to intermediation banking (where the hedged item is generally accounted for), with all the attendant consequences in terms of prudence and volatility. Two other IASB proposals could also have significant consequences for the financial statements of companies in general, and not just those of banks: firstly the proposals on business combinations and the treatment of goodwill, and secondly the rules on employee benefits (pension liabilities and stock options). The effect of these two types of proposal on financial stability is not clear. If, as the IASB suggests, a purchase accounting approach is used for business combinations and goodwill is no longer amortised but subject to regular impairment reviews, this would seem to promote greater transparency and in future might even prevent some of the abuses surrounding corporate acquisitions. Similarly, the systematic recognition in the income statement of pension liabilities and of stock option grants would make corporate policies in these areas more transparent. However, a “big bang” application of these new standards would probably put many companies into a difficult position, which in turn might impair financial stability. ...|$|E
