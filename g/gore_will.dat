40|$|In {{classical}} {{propositional logic}} (CPL) logical reasoning is formalised as logical entailment {{and can be}} computed by means of tableau and resolution proof procedures. Unfortunately CPL is not expressive enough and using first order logic (FOL) does {{not solve the problem}} either since proof procedures for these logics are not decidable. Modal propositional logics (MPL) on the other hand are both decidable and more expressive than CPL.

[Problem] Ideally, all elements of an enterprise architecture {{can be traced to}} business goals ad vice versa, but in practice, this is not the case. In this paper we explore the use of goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE) techniques to improve this bidirectional traceability. [Principal ideas/results] We collected GORE techniques from KAOS, i*, Tropos, BMM and TOGAF and integrated them in a language called ARMOR. This was used by enterprise architects in case study. It turned out that the language was too complex for the architects to understand as intended. Based on this we redefined ARMOR to contain only a minimum number of goal-oriented concepts, and this was tested in a second case study. This second case study suggests that the minimal version is still useful for traceability management in practice.

[...] Nathaniel Thompson, editor of the four volume DVD Delirium series, wrote: [...] "Sea of Dust ambitiously sets its sights on a complex, mindbending story about the extremities of moral conviction framed like a nasty fairy tale...sort of a clash between The Saragossa Manuscript and Kill, Baby, Kill with a hefty dose of gore." [...] Bloody-Disgusting also commented upon the film's surrealist touches: “It‟s like David Lynch and Hammer Horror got together, did a bunch of ecstasy and read the Bible.

40|$|The Automatic Gore Mapping System {{is being}} {{developed}} to reduce the time and labor costs associated with manufacturing the External Tank. The present chem-milling processes and procedures are discussed. The down loading of the simulation of the system has to be performed to verify that the simulation package will translate the simulation code into robot code. Also a simulation of this system has to be programmed for a gantry robot instead of the articulating robot that is presently in the system. It was discovered using the simulation package that the articulation robot cannot reach all the point {{on some of the}} panels, therefore when the system is ready for production, a gantry robot will be used. Also a hydrosensor system {{is being developed}} to replace the point-to-point contact probe. The hydrosensor will allow the robot to perform a non-contact continuous scan of the panel. It will also provide a faster scan of the panel because it will eliminate the in-and-out movement required for the present end effector. The system software is currently being modified so that the hydrosensor will work with the system. The hydrosensor consists of a Krautkramer-Branson transducer encased in a plexiglass nozzle. The water stream pumped through the nozzle is the couplant for the probe. Also, software is being written so that the robot will have the ability to draw the contour lines on the panel displaying the out-of-tolerance regions. Presently the contour lines can only be displayed on the computer screens. Research is also being performed on improving and automating the method of scribing the panels. Presently the panels are manually scribed with a sharp knife. The use of a low power laser or water jet is being studied as a method of scribing the panels. The contour drawing pen will be replaced with scribing tool and the robot will then move along the contour lines. With these developments the Automatic <b>Gore</b> Mapping Systems <b>will</b> provide a reduction in time and labor costs associated with manufacturing the External Task.

So long as Hammersmith is called Hammersmith, its people will live {{in the shadow of}} that primal hero, the Blacksmith, who led the {{democracy}} of the Broadway into battle till he drove the chivalry of Kensington before him and overthrew them at that place which in honour of the best blood of the defeated aristocracy is still called Kensington Gore. Men of Hammersmith will not fail to remember that the very name of Kensington originated from the lips of their hero. For at the great banquet of reconciliation held after the war, when the disdainful oligarchs declined to join in the songs of the men of the Broadway (which are to this day of a rude and popular character), the great Republican leader, with his rough humour, said the words which are written in gold upon his monument, 'Little birds that can sing and won't sing, must be made to sing.' So that the Eastern Knights were called Cansings or Kensings ever afterwards. But you also have great memories, O men of Kensington! You showed that you could sing, and sing great war-songs. Even after the dark day of Kensington <b>Gore,</b> history <b>will</b> not forget those three Knights who guarded your disordered retreat from Hyde Park (so called from your hiding there), those three Knights after whom Knightsbridge is named. Nor will it forget the day of your re-emergence, purged in the fire of calamity, cleansed of your oligarchic corruptions, when, sword in hand, you drove the Empire of Hammersmith back mile by mile, swept it past its own Broadway, and broke it at last in a battle so long and bloody that the birds of prey have left their name upon it. Men have called it, with austere irony, the Ravenscourt. I shall not, I trust, wound the patriotism of Bayswater, or the lonelier pride of Brompton, or that of any other historic township, by taking these two special examples. I select them, not because they are more glorious than the rest, but partly from personal association (I am myself descended from one of the three heroes of Knightsbridge), and partly from the consciousness that I am an amateur antiquarian, and cannot presume to deal with times and places more remote and more mysterious. It is not for me to settle the question between two such men as Professor Hugg and Sir William Whisky as to whether Notting Hill means Nutting Hill (in allusion to the rich woods which no longer cover it), or whether it is a corruption of Nothing-ill, referring to its reputation among the ancients as an Earthly Paradise. When a Podkins and a Jossy confess themselves doubtful about the boundaries of West Kensington (said to have been traced in the blood of Oxen), I need not be ashamed to confess a similar doubt. I will ask you to excuse me from further history, and to assist me with your encouragement in dealing with the problem which faces us to-day.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} two central {{criticisms of}} the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of {{the issues raised by}} the disputed Florida election and ultimately resolved in Bush v. Gore: that the Court violated principles of democratic process and dramatically overstepped the boundaries ofjudicial review. As will become apparent, the Article gives only modest attention to the text of the many opinions by the Florida and United States Supreme Courts in the Bush v. <b>Gore</b> drama. It <b>will</b> be an interesting question in the years ahead whether the formal legal grounds set forth as the basis of the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s per curiam decision or of any of the concurrences or dissents will survive as plausible foundations for election jurisprudence. This Article ignores that question and, instead, attempts to analyze the Court 2 ̆ 7 s various judgments during the period of the dispute in a broader sense. Just as the purely legal grounds of the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinions in cases such as Dred Scott or Brown v. Board of Education are of less interest than the substantive judgments made by the Court in its institutional role under the Constitution, so I believe the purely legal grounds of Bush v. Gore deserve less attention now. The most serious {{criticisms of the}} way that the United States Supreme Court resolved the Florida election are not that the majority opinion contains logical failures or ignores conflicting precedent, however accurate such complaints might be. The most serious criticisms are that the United States Supreme Court fundamentally breached its Constitutional role by disregarding basic principles of the process of democratic accountability and by committing what some commentators, including my colleague Bruce Ackerman, have called 2 ̆ 2 a Constitutional coup. 2 ̆ 2 This Article addresses those criticisms. Part I considers the claim that the United States Supreme Court, by overruling decisions of the Florida Supreme Court, abused the political process and removed all possibility of accountability to the citizenry. Part II examines the events in the Florida election drama in more depth to analyze whether the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s various rulings improperly usurped power allocated by the Constitution to the citizenry...|$|R
40|$|Climate Code Red: The Case for Emergency Action David Spratt and Philip Sutton Scribe, 2008 Reviewed by Peter W. Newton THIS {{is one of}} {{a growing}} number of books about climate change. Its title {{incorporates}} the key words “code red,” a medical term denoting a patient needing immediate and advanced life support. It is a powerful metaphor for our planet in relation to the symptoms beginning to materialise in relation to the “virus” of climate change (after Al <b>Gore)</b> which <b>will</b> rapidly accelerate as our planet progressively heats by one, two, three and possibly more degrees Celsius in the decades ahead. This would represent its most significant transition of the past 10, 000 years - from an era of “remarkably stable climate that has allowed the whole period of human development to take place” (as the authors put it) to a future world with temperatures where livability as we know it becomes highly uncertain. The book is organised in three parts. The first reviews the scientific evidence related to global warming and climate change, especially issues of magnitude and speed. The authors are of the view that change will be more rapid and pervasive than most other commentators are suggesting, based primarily on the implications of an accelerating rate of ice-sheet disintegration, sea level rise, and the extent to which current models underestimate the impacts of slower feedback loops in our ecosystems. The vulnerability of our cities and regions is likely to be significant. The authors unfortunately are light on in relation to painting a picture of what two, three or four degrees of increased temperature could mean for communities in different parts of Australia. If Spratt and Sutton had an objective of driving change in behaviour among the Australian population, then they needed to provide more detailed and regionally specific information that would be capable of engendering concern in the reader based on how climate change would affect them and their locality (stage two in behaviour change theory) as a necessary precursor to evoking some action on their part. Section 2 examines current debates related to climate targets. It restates the key facts that “Human activity has increased the level of carbon dioxide in the air by 38 % from the 1750 pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million: by 2008 it was at 387 parts per million. ” To stabilise global temperatures at present-day levels (0. 8 degrees above pre-industrial levels) will require emissions to be reduced to near zero within a decade. Hence the increase in the number of projects labelled as “zero carbon” or “carbon neutral” that are beginning to emerge in Australia and internationally. The key question is, can this be achieved within the window of opportunity available? Evidence suggests that the rate of CO 2 emissions generation is rapidly increasing rather than decreasing - that we are not de-carbonising our economy or life styles. Global warming is consequently now closer to one degree over pre-industrial levels. The remainder this of section explores what the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) now appears to be focusing more attention towards, namely, adaptation and mitigation strategies for scenarios relating to temperature increases of up to four degrees above pre-industrial levels. Under such scenarios, the viability and resilience of most ecosystems and settlement systems would be severely tested: “The vast, fixed physical infrastructure of cities that human civilization has built will make it very hard to adapt and move across continents if the climate were to become more changeable. ” For any assessment of the vulnerability of Australia’s current settlement system to a range of likely climate change impacts (for example, flooding, sea level rise, drought, bushfire, biodiversity loss), however, readers would need to look elsewhere. Section 3 of the book identifies the need for a rapid transition to a sustainable economy: one that is “climate safe,” involving industrial and domestic processes that have near zero greenhouse emissions. Various options for transitioning to a zero-emissions economy are outlined. The authors restate their case that this is an emergency (chapter 15), that there has been a systemic breakdown (16), that a pragmatic middle course is inadequate (17), that barriers to change need to be rapidly overcome (18), that there needs to be a “new business as usual” (20, 21) involving implementation of known climate “solutions” (e. g. energy efficiency, renewables, clean coal, clean development, carbon trading/taxing) - all requiring explicit steps towards a climate safe economy (25). In the forthcoming new edition of her book, Adapting Buildings and Cities for Climate Change (Architectural Press), Susan Roaf suggests that we are through one degree, that two degrees requires provision of primarily “techno solutions,” while three degrees will involve social resilience issues that we need to be designing and planning for now. The need for a profound and rapid rebuilding of the global economy around climate safe technologies is perhaps the key 21 st century challenge. The authors pose the question (chapter 22) : “Can ‘Politics as Usual’ Solve the Problem?” Reading the book while overseas during October 2008 provided me with some opportunity for reflection on this important issue of political leadership. In Australia, a point of differentiation between the two major political parties at the November 2007 federal election was clearly in relation to climate change policies. Post-election has witnessed a retreat in relation to size of national targets for CO 2 emission reduction, if the successive pronouncements from the Garnaut Climate Change Review are any guide. In Canada, the October elections coincided with the global economic meltdown of that month and enabled the Conservatives to use the Liberals’ policy of a greenhouse based shift in taxation as one of the key differentiators that led to a return of an enlarged Conservative minority government. In the United States, the presidential race also provided voters with a contrast in energy policies. Driven more by an electoral pitch for energy independence from the Middle East and South American suppliers (than reduction in global warming), the Democratic candidate proposed a major program of activity relating to renewable energy, akin in scale and scope to Kennedy’s “man on the moon” project. That program, if implemented, would make significant progress towards delivering what Spratt and Sutton term a climate safe economy as a result of “the most profound rebuilding of the world economy since the beginning of the industrial revolution” - centred on a new sector of industries related to renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency products and processes. The speed with which governments internationally have engaged with each other to tackle the 2008 global economic crisis provides some measure of encouragement as to what is possible when all nations are faced with a common tangible threat. We are not yet at that point in relation to climate change, however, despite credible evidence of its emergence and likely future trajectory and despite the fact that the program of activity required to create a climate safe economy will require a much longer period to implement than a (mere) restructuring of financial institutions. Hence “code red. ” • Peter W. Newton is a research professor in the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University of Technology.
