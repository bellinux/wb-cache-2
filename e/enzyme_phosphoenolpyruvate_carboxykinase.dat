This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia.

In the livers {{of humans}} and many other {{mammalian}} species, β 2 -adrenergic receptors (β 2 -ARs) {{play an important role}} in the modulation of glucose production by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In male mice and rats however, the expression and physiological role of hepatic β 2 -ARs are rapidly lost with development under normal physiological conditions. We previously described a line of transgenic mice, F 28, which carry the human β 2 -AR gene under the control of its own promoter. In these mice, hepatic β 2 -AR levels are shown to rapidly increase after birth, and, as in humans, be maintained at an elevated level in adulthood. F 28 mice display strongly enhanced adenylyl cyclase responses to β-AR agonists in their livers and, compared to normal mice, have increased basal hepatic adenylyl cyclase activity.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{describes}} the intracellular compartmentalization {{of three different}} mRNAs in the polarized rat fetal enterocyte.

These mRNAs are found in close proximity to their respective protein products, i. e. the apical membrane, mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively. The significance or these observations is twofold: (i) they indicate that mRNAs are sorted into specific domains of the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells: and (ii) they imply the presence or two distinct pathways of mRNA targeting one that allows transport of mRNAs that are translated on ribosomes associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (lactase mRNA), and the other that allows sorting of mRNAs that are translated on free polysames (CPS and PEPCK mRNA) ...|$|E

Since the liver governs systemic energy demands through regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, {{it is likely}} that the liver is a pathological target of cachexia progression in the ApcMin/+mouse. The purpose of this study was to determine if cancer and the progression of cachexia affected liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -stress, inflammation, metabolism, and protein synthesis signaling. The effect of cancer (without cachexia) was examined in wild-type and weight-stable ApcMin/+mice.

Embryos of A. limnaeus showed stage specific changes in concentrations of several metabolites. The most notable changes in metabolite concentration in response to anoxia were the increases of lactate, alanine, GABA and succinate as well as a pronounced decrease in aspartate concentrations. However, a complete understanding of the mechanisms by which anoxia tolerance is achieved remains elusive.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} the inability of insulin to suppress glucose production in the liver and kidney. Insulin inhibits glucose production by indirect and direct mechanisms. The latter result in transcriptional suppression of key gluconeogenetic and glycogenolytic <b>enzymes,</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (Pepck) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 p). The transcription factors required for this effect are incompletely characterized. We report that in glucogenetic kidney epithelial cells, Pepck and G 6 p expression are induced by dexamethasone (dex) and cAMP, but fail to be inhibited by insulin. The inability to respond to insulin is associated with reduced expression of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo 1, a substrate of the Akt kinase that is inhibited by insulin through phosphorylation. Transduction of kidney cells with recombinant adenovirus encoding Foxo 1 results in insulin inhibition of dex/cAMP–induced G 6 p expression. Moreover, expression of dominant negative Foxo 1 mutant results in partial inhibition of dex/cAMP–induced G 6 p and Pepck expression in primary cultures of mouse hepatocyes and kidney LLC-PK 1 -FBPase+ cells. These findings are consistent with the possibility that Foxo 1 is involved in insulin regulation of glucose production by mediating the ability of insulin to decrease the glucocorticoid/cAMP response of G 6 p...|$|R

To {{gain insight into}} the mechanism(s) of this hypoglycemic effect, purified recombinant Acrp 30 was infused in conscious mice during a pancreatic euglycemic clamp. In the presence of physiological hyperinsulinemia, this treatment increased circulating Acrp 30 levels by approximately twofold and stimulated glucose metabolism. The effect of Acrp 30 on in vivo insulin action was completely accounted for by a 65 % reduction {{in the rate of}} glucose production. Similarly, glucose flux through glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 Pase) decreased with Acrp 30, whereas the activity of the direct pathway of glucose- 6 -phosphate biosynthesis, an index of hepatic glucose phosphorylation, increased significantly. Acrp 30 did not affect the rates of glucose uptake, glycolysis, or glycogen synthesis. These results indicate that an acute increase in circulating Acrp 30 levels lowers hepatic glucose production without affecting peripheral glucose uptake. Hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic <b>enzymes</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> and G 6 Pase mRNAs was reduced by more than 50 % following Acrp 30 infusion compared with vehicle infusion.

Liver and/or kidney tissues from {{approximately half of the}} late-stage embryos were analyzed for the activities of various intermediary metabolic enzymes known to be regulated, at least in part, by corticosteroids. Basal plasma corticosterone concentrations were determined for the remaining embryos. Yolk sacs were collected from each embryo and a subset was analyzed for organochlorine contaminants. Regression analysis of individual yolk sac organochlorine residue concentrations, or 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs), with individual basal plasma corticosterone concentrations indicated statistically significant inverse relationships for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs), total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), non-ortho PCBs, and TEQs.

Concomitantly, amounts of mRNA were quantified after translation in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate and specific immunoprecipitation of the proteins. Glucagon stimulated the rate of synthesis of PEPCK by 4 - 6 -fold and that of TAT by 6 - 8 -fold in 2 h. In contrast, dexamethasone {{had little effect on}} PEPCK synthesis, whereas it increased TAT synthesis by 5 - 9 -fold. When used in combination, the two hormones displayed additive effects on TAT synthesis, whereas the glucocorticoid hormone strongly potentiated stimulation of PEPCK synthesis by glucagon.

40|$|Nematodes {{which have}} adapted to an {{anaerobic}} lifestyle in their adult stages oxidise phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate rather than pyruvate as the final product of glycolysis. This adaptation involves selective expression of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK), instead of pyruvate kinase (PK). However, such adaptation is not absolute in aerobic nematode species. We have examined the activity and kinetics of PEPCK and PK in larvae (L 3) and adults of Teladorsagia circumcincta, a parasite known to exhibit oxygen uptake. Results revealed that PK and PEPCK activity existed in both L 3 s and adults. The enzymes had differing affinity for nucleotide diphosphates: while both can utilise GDP, only PK utilised ADP and only PEPCK utilised IDP. In both life cycle stages, enzymes showed similar affinity for PEP. PK activity was predominant in both stages, although activity of this enzyme was lower in adults. When combined, both the activity levels and the enzyme kinetics showed that pyruvate production is probably favoured in both L 3 and adult stages of T. circumcincta and suggest that metabolism of PEP to oxaloacetate is a minor metabolic pathway in this species...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Gluconeogenesis in Rhizobium leguminosarum MNF 3841 {{takes place}} via the derepressible <b>enzymes</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK) and {{fructose}} bisphosphate aldolase. A Tn 5 -induced PEPCK deficient mutant (MNF 3085) fails to grow {{on a wide}} range of simple carbon sources. PEPCK and fructose bisphosphate aldolase are rapidly derepressed when cells are transferred from a sugar to an organic acid as the sole carbon source. The addition of 0 · 1 mM-sucrose causes an 80 % inhibition of PEPCK and fructose bisphosphate aldolase synthesis, and 0 · 4 mM-sucrose causes a complete inhibition of PEPCK synthesis. Pea bacteroids of MNF 3841 purified on a Percoll gradient contain low levels of PEPCK and fructose bisphosphate aldolase. This bacteroid-associated PEPCK activity is clearly of bacterial not plant origin because of its nucleotide requirement, and the fact that bacteroids of MNF 3085 contain no PEPCK activity at all. Although the mutant lacks PEPCK it is still able to nodulate and fix N 2 as effectively as the parent. The capacity to synthesize sugars via gluconeogenesis is not required for an effective symbiosis. Furthermore, these data suggest that pea bacteroids receive sufficient sugar to compensate for the gluconeogenic defect in strain MNF 3085, but insufficient to completely repress the synthesis of PEPCK in the wild-type...|$|R

However, the mechanisms behind these effects were not fully understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DPM on streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic symptoms and their potential mechanisms. Diabetic mice were treated with DPM (150 mg/kg body weight) for 90 days and continued to be fed without DPM for an additional 30 days. Strikingly, decrease of blood glucose levels was observed in all DPM treated diabetic mice, which persisted 30 days after cessation of DPM administration. Significant decrease of glycosylated hemoglobin and hepatic pyruvate concentrations, along with marked increase of serum insulin and hepatic glycogen levels were detected in DPM treated diabetic mice. Results of a labeled 13 C 6 -glucose uptake assay indicated that DPM can restrain glucose absorption. Additionally, DPM down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of jejunal Na+/glucose cotransporter, Na+/K+-ATPase and glucose transporter 2, and enhanced the activities as well as mRNA and protein levels of hepatic glycolysis enzymes (glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, private kinase and pyruvate decarboxylas E 1).

40|$|AbstractIn cultured rat hepatocytes the key gluconeogenic <b>enzyme</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PCK) {{is known}} to be induced by {{glucagon}} via an elevation of cAMP. Prostaglandin E 2 has been shown to antagonize the glucagon-activated cAMP formation, glycogen phosphorylase activity and glucose output in hepatocytes. It was the purpose of the current investigation to study the potential of PGE 2 to inhibit the glucagon-induced expression of PCK on the level of mRNA and enzyme activity. PCK mRNA and enzyme activity were increased by 0. 1 nM glucagon to a maximum after 2 h and 4 h, respectively. This increase was completely inhibited if 10 μM PGE 2 was added concomitantly with glucagon. This inhibition by PGE 2 of glucagon-induced PCK activity was abolished by pertussis toxin treatment. When added at the maximum of PCK mRNA at 2 h, PGE 2 accelerated the decay of mRNA and reduced enzyme activity. This effect was not reversed by pertussis toxin treatment. Since in liver PGE 2 is derived from Kupffer cells, which {{play a key role in}} the local inflammatory response, the present data imply that during inflammation PGE 2 may reduce the hepatic gluconeogenic capacity via a Gi-linked signal chain...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} characterized transcription factor LZIP to be a growth suppressor targeted by hepatitis C virus oncoprotein. In search of proteins {{closely related to}} LZIP, we have identified a liver-enriched transcription factor CREB-H. LZIP and CREB-H represent a new subfamily of bZIP factors. CREB-H activates transcription by binding to cAMP responsive element, box B, and ATF 6 -binding element. Interestingly, CREB-H has a putative transmembrane (TM) domain and it localizes ambiently to the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteolytic cleavage that removes the TM domain leads to nuclear translocation and activation of CREB-H. CREB-H activates the promoter of hepatic gluconeogenic <b>enzyme</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase.</b> This activation can be further stimulated by cAMP and protein kinase A. CREB-H transcript is exclusively abundant in adult liver. In contrast, the expression of CREB-H mRNA is aberrantly reduced in hepatoma tissues and cells.

40|$|The <b>enzyme</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK) plays a {{key role}} in gluconeogenesis in liver and in glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue. These processes, and PEPCK, are {{regulated}} by a number of hormones, some of which have different effects on the enzyme in liver and adipose tissue. To explore this phenomenon, PEPCK gene expression was studied in 3 T 3 -F 442 A adipocytes maintained in a serum-free medium. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and a cyclic AMP analogue (8 -CPT-cAMP) increased PEPCK mRNA. A maximal 3 -fold induction occurred in 2 h. Dexamethasone decreased PEPCK mRNA by 80 % in 4 h. Dexamethasone also counteracted the inductive effects of isoprenaline and 8 -CPT-cAMP. Run-on transcription experiments showed that the isoprenaline and dexamethasone actions were, at least in part, exerted at the level of PEPCK gene transcription. These effects were further analysed by using transient and stable transfection of adipocytes with a plasmid containing bp - 2100 to 69 of the PEPCK gene promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene.

Such a switch in body fuel uses, leading to changes in body reserves and gluconeogenic precursors, could modulate intestinal gluconeogenesis and glucose transport. The gene and protein levels, and the cellular localization of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT 1, and of GLUT 5 and GLUT 2, {{as well as that of}} the key gluconeogenic <b>enzymes</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (Glc 6 Pase) were measured.

PEPCK and Glc 6 Pase mRNA, protein levels and activities also increased in phase III. GLUT 5 and GLUT 2 were down-regulated throughout the fast, but increased after refeeding, with GLUT 2 recruited to the apical membrane. The increase in SGLT 1 expression during phase III may allow glucose absorption at low concentrations as soon as food is available. Furthermore, an increased epithelial permeability due to fasting may induce a paracellular movement of glucose. In the absence of intestinal GLUT 2 during fasting, Glc 6 Pase could be involved in glucose release to the bloodstream via membrane trafficking.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} fasting hyperglycemia, secondary to hepatic insulin resistance and increased glucose production. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 α (PGC- 1 α) is a transcriptional coactivator that is thought to control adaptive responses to physiological stimuli. In liver, PGC- 1 α expression is induced by fasting, and this effect promotes gluconeogenesis. To examine whether PGC- 1 α {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance, we generated transgenic (TG) mice with whole body overexpression of human PGC- 1 α and evaluated glucose homeostasis with a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. PGC- 1 α was moderately (∼ 2 -fold) overexpressed in liver, skeletal muscle, brain, and heart of TG mice. In liver, PGC- 1 α overexpression resulted in increased expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor- 4 α and the gluconeogenic <b>enzymes</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> and glucose- 6 -phosphatase. PGC- 1 α overexpression caused hepatic insulin resistance, manifested by higher glucose production and diminished insulin suppression of gluconeogenesis. Paradoxically, PGC- 1 α overexpression improved muscle insulin sensitivity, as evidenced by elevated insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and peripheral glucose disposal. Content of myoglobin and troponin I slow protein was increased in muscle of TG mice, indicating fiber-type switching. PGC- 1 α overexpression also led to lower reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and reduced IKK/IκB signaling in muscle. Feeding a high-fat diet to TG mice eliminated the increased muscle insulin sensitivity. The dichotomous effect of PGC- 1 α overexpression in liver and muscle suggests that PGC- 1 α is a fuel gauge that couples energy demands (muscle) with the corresponding fuel supply (liver). Thus, under conditions of physiological stress (i. e., prolonged fast and exercise training), increased hepatic glucose production may help sustain glucose utilization in peripheral tissues...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{alarming}} {{increase in}} sugar consumption world-wide has largely contributed towards the escalating symptoms of metabolic syndrome (MetS) such as obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Reduction in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity leads to dyslipidaemia, {{a hallmark of}} MetS. Increased activation of glu-cocorticoid receptors also results in symptoms of MetS. Glycyrrhi-zic acid (GA), a triterpenoid saponin, inhibits 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11 β-HSD 1), which leads to reduced hexose- 6 -phosphate (H 6 PDH) activity and decreased glucocorticoids (GCs) production. GCs induce the gene transcriptions of <b>enzymes</b> such as <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK) and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 Pase) in the gluconeogenic pathway. Studies have indicated that triterpenoids could act as PPAR agonists and GA is therefore postulated to restore LPL expression in the insulin resis...|$|R
40|$|The {{trace element}} {{vanadium}} {{is a potent}} insulinomimetic agent in vitro. Oral administration of vanadate to rats made diabetic by streptozotocin (45 mg/kg i. v.) caused a 65 % fall in plasma glucose levels without modifying low insulinemia. We studied whether the hypoglycemic effect of vanadate was associated with altered expression of genes involved in key steps of hepatic glucose metabolism. Glucokinase (GK) and L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) mRNA levels were decreased respectively by 90 % and 70 % in fed diabetic rats, in close correlation with changes in enzyme activities. Eighteen days of vanadate treatment partially restored GK mRNA and activity (40 % of control levels), and totally restored L-PK parameters. In contrast to the glycolytic enzymes, mRNA levels and activity of the gluconeogenic <b>enzyme,</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK) were increased (15 - and 2 -fold, respectively) in fed diabetic rats. Vanadate treatment normalized both PEPCK mRNA and activity in diabetic rat liver. The 2 -fold increase in liver glucose transporter (GLUT 2) mRNA and protein, produced by diabetes, was also corrected by this treatment. In conclusion, oral vanadate given to diabetic rats induces a shift of the predominating gluconeogenic flux, with subsequent high hepatic glucose production, into a glycolytic flux by pretranslational regulatory mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The <b>enzyme</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (Pck) catalyzes {{the first}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway in most organisms. We are {{examining}} the genetic regulation of the gene encoding Pck, pckA, in Rhizobium (now Sinorhizobium) meliloti. This bacterium forms N(2) -fixing root nodules on alfalfa, and the major energy sources supplied to the bacteria within these nodules are C(4) -dicarboxylic acids such as malate and succinate. R. meliloti cells growing in glucose minimal medium show very low pckA expression whereas addition of succinate to this medium results in a rapid induction of pckA transcription. We identified spontaneous mutations (rpk) that alter the regulation of pckA expression such that pckA is expressed in media containing the non-inducing carbon sources lactose and glucose. Genetic and phenotypic analysis allowed us to differentiate at least four rpk mutant classes that map to different locations on the R. meliloti chromosome. The wild-type locus corresponding to one of these rpk loci was cloned by complementation, and two Tn 5 insertions within the insert DNA that no longer complemented the rpk mutation were identified. The nucleotide sequence of this region revealed that both Tn 5 insertions lay within a gene encoding a protein homologous to the GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators that are involved in metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The pckA gene, {{encoding}} the gluconeogenic <b>enzyme</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEPCK), was cloned by PCR amplification {{from the}} purple nonsulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris No. 7. Sequenc-ing of a 2. 5 -kb chromosomal SmaI-PstI fragment containing the structural gene revealed an {{open reading frame}} encoding 537 amino acids, homologous to known pckA genes. Primer extension analysis identified a transcrip-tional start site 72 bp upstream of the pckA initiation codon and an upstream sequence similar to s 70 promoters. Studies of a pckA-lacZ gene fusion indicated that when cells were grown in minimal media with various carbon sources, such as succinate, malate, pyruvate, lactate, or ethanol, under both anaerobic light and aerobic dark conditions, the pckA gene was induced in log phase, irrespective of the carbon source. A R. palustris No. 7 PEPCK-deficient strain showed growth characteristics identical {{to those of the}} wild-type strain either anaerobically in the light or aerobically in the dark when a C 4 -dicarboxylic acid, such as succinate or malate, was used as a carbon source. These results indicate that in R. palustris No. 7, an alternative gluconeogenic pathway may exist in addition to PEPCK. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) catalyzes the decarboxylation and phosphorylation of oxaloacetate (OAA) to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in most organisms. Thi...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} part of the liver volume consists of regions in which hepatocytes are in close contact with large branches of the afferent (portal vein) or efferent (hepatic vein) vessels. As most studies have addressed zonation of gene expression around the parenchymal branches of the portal and hepatic vein only, the patterns of gene expression in hepatocytes surrounding larger vessels are largely unknown. For that reason, we studied the patterns of expression of the mRNAs and proteins of the pericentral marker enzymes glutamine synthase, ornithine aminotransferase, and glutamate dehydrogenase and the periportal marker <b>enzymes</b> <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> and carbamoylphosphate synthase in the rat liver, in relation to the branching pattern of the afferent and efferent hepatic veins with immuno and hybridocytochemical techniques. These patterns of expression were compared with those seen in mouse, monkey, and pig liver. The distribution patterns of the genes studied appear to reflect the "intensity" of the pericentral and periportal environment, glutamine synthase and phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase requiring the most pronounced environment, respectively. The patterns of gene expression around the large branches of the portal and hepatic vein were found {{to be related to the}} parenchymal branches in the neighbourhood of these large blood vessels. Only the cells of the limiting plate retain their periportal and pericentral phenotype for those marker enzymes that do not require a pronounced periportal or pericentral environment to be expressed. GS-negative areas in the pericentral limiting plate appear to correlate with a local absence of draining central veins, and become more frequent and extensive around the larger branches of the hepatic vein. The similarity of the observed patterns of gene expression of the genes studied in mouse, rat, monkey, pig, and man suggests that they reflect a general feature of gene expression in the mammalian liver. A comparison of mouse, rat, pig, and human liver suggests that the presence of glutamine synthase-negative areas reflects the branching order of the efferent hepatic blood vesse...|$|R
40|$|Leaf glandular trichomes (epidermal hairs) {{actively}} synthesize secondary metabolites, many {{of which}} are the frontline of plant defense. In Nicotiana tabacum, tall and short glandular trichomes have been identified. While the former have been extensively studied and match the classic picture of trichome function, the short trichomes have remained relatively uncharacterized. We have set up a procedure based on centrifugation on Percoll density gradients to obtain separate tall and short trichome fractions purified to > 85 %. We then investigated the proteome of both trichome types combining 2 D-LC fractionation of tryptic peptides and quantification of a set of 461 protein groups using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation. Almost the entire pathway leading to the synthesis of diterpenes was identified in the tall trichomes. Indications for their key roles in the synthesis of cuticular compounds were also found. Concerning the short glandular trichomes, ribosomal proteins and <b>enzymes</b> such <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> and polyphenol oxidase were more abundant than in the tall glandular trichomes. These results are discussed in the frame of several hypotheses regarding the respective roles of short and long glandular trichomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantum yield}} of {{photosynthetic}} O 2 exchange {{was measured in}} eight species of leaf succulents representative of both malic <b>enzyme</b> type and <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> type CAM plants. Measurements were made at 25 °C and CO 2 saturation using a leaf disc O 2 electrode system, either during or after deacidification. The mean quantum yield was 0. 095 ± 0. 012 (sd) moles O 2 per mole quanta, which compared with 0. 094 ± 0. 006 (sd) moles O 2 per mole quanta for spinach leaf discs measured under the same conditions. There were no consistent differences in quantum yield between decarboxylation types or during different phases of CAM metabolism. On the basis of current notions of compartmentation of CAM biochemistry, our observations are interpreted to indicate that CO 2 refixation is energetically independent of gluconeogenesis during deacidification...|$|R
