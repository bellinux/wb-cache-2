40|$|Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) data is used {{to compare}} three {{categories}} of crash involvements: truck single-vehicle (SV) <b>involvements,</b> multi-vehicle (MV) <b>involvements</b> in which the truck has been assigned the critical reason (CR), and MV <b>involvements</b> in which the other vehicle (OV) has been assigned the CR. These three categories represent distinctly different causal contributions by truck drivers to the crash, with SV <b>involvements</b> having the greatest truck driver impairment and misbehavior. Surprisingly, paired comparisons of the three categories indicate that truck SV and truck-CR MV crash <b>involvements</b> were the most dissimilar in their causal profiles. Factors associated with truck SV crash <b>involvements</b> include non-use of safety belts, driver unfamiliarity with roadways, vehicle failures, lack of prior sleep, 16 + hours awake, and early morning driving. Dense traffic situations (e. g., rush hours) make trucks {{more likely to be}} at-fault in MV crashes. Many other factors were not associated with differences among the categories, suggesting no differential effect on truck driver safety performance, even though they might affect risk generally. Among fatigue-related factors, those related to sleep and alertness physiology were linked to SV crashes, while those related only to Hours-of-Service (HOS) work rules were not...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the correlations between the}} skill demands of an ‘on-side’ small-sided game (SSG) and match-play in under- 16 junior rugby league players. Fifteen Harold Matthews players undertook a SSG (10 vs. 10 on a 68 [*]m by 40 [*]m playing surface for 3 [*]min) in the week leading up to round 6 of their competitive season. The frequency of skill <b>involvements</b> (i. e. offensive, defensive and total) was manually coded using a specific criterion. The defensive and total skill <b>involvements</b> were significantly higher per minute of play in the SSG when compared to match-play. A significant, very large, positive correlation was observed between offensive and total skill <b>involvements</b> during a SSG and offensive skill <b>involvements</b> during a match (r(s) [*]=[*] 0. 80, p[*]<[*] 0. 01; r(s) [*]=[*] 0. 71, p[*]<[*] 0. 01, respectively). No significant correlations were evident for defensive skill <b>involvements</b> during SSG and match-play. Overall, it appears that the selected SSG provided players with ample opportunity to practice match-specific skills. In addition, the transfer of these opportunities seems confined to offensive rather then defensive skills...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 26) Special report, Task DThis {{report is}} part of a series evaluating the data submitted to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was significantly incomplete. This report examines reporting from the state of New Jersey. New Jersey Police Accident Report (PAR) files were matched to the MCMIS Crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. In 2003, there were 10, 103 crash <b>involvements</b> in New Jersey that were reportable to the MCMIS Crash file. Of these crash <b>involvements,</b> 8, 333 were actually reported, resulting in a reporting rate of 82. 5 %. In addition, 5. 3 % of MCMIS cases that were reported do not qualify for reporting. Reporting rates vary by crash severity, crash month, and jurisdiction. Unlike many other states in which reporting rates were greater for more severe <b>involvements,</b> in New Jersey reporting rates were lower for more severe <b>involvements.</b> The reporting rates were 67. 4 % for fatal <b>involvements,</b> 81. 5 % for injury <b>involvements,</b> and 83. 2 % for towaway <b>involvements.</b> Underreporting is also related to the time of the year, indicating delays in providing the data. The month of December had the highest percent of unreported cases (21. 7 %). Data quality is also reviewed. The PAR case number contains inconsistent characters such as dashes, question marks, and asterisks. This appears to be a source of duplicate records. The ambulance run number and the hazardous materials placard variables also contain many inconsistent characters...|$|R

However, no conclusive evidence of Black's <b>involvement</b> was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously in a country, {{where there}} were no religious wars and the state had not cooperated with the Catholic Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant <b>involvement</b> among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of <b>involvement</b> of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal divisions within the Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed.|$|E

40|$|As {{users are}} {{interacting}} {{with a large}} of mobile apps under various usage contexts, user <b>involvements</b> in an app design process has become a critical issue. Despite this fact, existing apps or app store platforms only provide a limited form of user <b>involvements</b> such as posting app reviews and sending email reports. While building a unified platform for facilitating user <b>involvements</b> with various apps is our ultimate goal, we present our preliminary work on handling developers’ information overload attributed to {{a large number of}} app comments. To address this issue, we first perform a simple content analysis on app reviews from the developer’s standpoint. We then propose an algorithm that automatically identifies informative reviews reflecting user <b>involvements.</b> The preliminary evaluation results document the efficiency of our algorithm.

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a series {{evaluating}} the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was incomplete. This report examines the factors that are associated with reporting rates for the state of Vermont. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the Vermont crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. It was necessary to focus just on crashes involving a fatality, A-injury or B-injury, because of problems identifying MCMIS reportable crashes in the Vermont crash file. It appears that Vermont reported 64. 9 percent of these crash <b>involvements</b> in 2008. Reporting rates were found to be related to crash severity, the configuration of the vehicle, and the type of enforcement agency that covered the crash. Over 71 percent of fatal crash <b>involvements</b> were reported, 54. 5 percent of A-injury <b>involvements,</b> and 67. 1 percent of B-injury <b>involvements.</b> More than 66 percent of reportable <b>involvements</b> of truck <b>involvements</b> were reported, but the reporting rate was 50. 0 percent for buses. Missing data rates are low for most variables. Corresponding data elements in the MCMIS and Vermont crash files were reasonably consistent, though all cases reported as truck with trailer in the MCMIS file were recorded as tractor-semitrailers in the Vermont crash file...|$|R
30|$|PAN is a {{medium-sized}} vessel vasculitis disease, involving multiple organs {{such as the}} skin, heart, kidneys, and nervous system [1]. GI <b>involvements</b> are generally rare but are clinically important because of their serious complications of perforation and infarction [6]. Some previous reports showed {{a high rate of}} mortality in PAN, due to those acute abdominal complications. GI <b>involvements</b> of PAN patients commonly occur in the intestine from the small bowel to the colon [4, 7]. Rectal <b>involvements</b> are quite rare, and there is one case report of rectal hemorrhage [8], but no rectal perforation. To the best our knowledge, this is the first case of rectal perforation due to PAN.|$|R
