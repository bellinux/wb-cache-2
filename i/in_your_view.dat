2500|$|When Justice Stephen Breyer {{asked if}} [...] "Congress passes a law {{and it says}} it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by {{building}} a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where {{we will have the}} regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to have}} a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?" [...] Clement answered [...] "I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [...]" ...|$|E

40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} a student interview in a Writing Intensive course in Social Work at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2013, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'Were your relationships with classmates, the campus, Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi, or the Pacific changed in any way? Do you see your major or your educational experience any differently {{as a result of}} it?'Brief excerpt from interview: For each of these papers, we had to do a peer review, so we would get into groups of 3 or 4... You got to read their papers while they read yours. So I got to see how other people wrote and how they thought and got closer that way. I thought that was great. I think [the writing in the class] affects me a lot. [The instructor] says we cannot write in the first person in these kinds of papers. So you {{have to find a way}} to not really put <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>views</b> but to put <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>views</b> into this analysis. So it makes you think how are you going to influence these things and these people and these papers...|$|R

Anyhow, though you're by no means liberal <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view,</b> you're practical people. As soon as I landed at Montreal, a pleasant young man, wearing a silver monogram came up to me, and offered me introductions to people who might find me a job. Though I didn't want one, I was grateful; and when I told him I wasn't one of his flock, he said it didn't matter. That kind of thing makes a good impression." ...|$|E
60|$|FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:--I am {{notified}} {{that this}} is a compliment paid me by the loyal Marylanders resident in this District. I infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the State furnishes the occasion, and that <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution. Most heartily do I congratulate you, and Maryland, and the nation, and the world, upon this event. I regret that it did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure; but it has come at last, and I sincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it, and that its opponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed.|$|E
60|$|You seem to know, or {{at least}} very {{strongly}} to conjecture, who those persons are that give you so much weekly disquiet. Will you dare to assert {{that any of these}} are Jacobites, endeavour to alienate the hearts of the people, to defame the prince, and then dethrone him (for these are your expressions) and that I am their patron, their bulwark, their hope, and their refuge? Can you think I will descend to vindicate myself against an aspersion so absurd? God be thanked, we have had many a change of ministry without changing our prince: for if it had been otherwise, perhaps revolutions might have been more frequent. Heaven forbid that the welfare of a great kingdom, and of a brave people, should be trusted with the thread of a single subject's life; for I suppose it is not yet <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> to entail the ministryship in your family. Thus I hope we may live to see different ministers and different measures, without any danger to the succession in the royal Protestant line of Hanover.|$|E

I think you had better suspend a visit till we can take you in and till I can speak.

"I suppose, Mr. Ellison," [...] {{the senior}} {{magistrate}} said, [...] "you have not, {{at any time}} since the poisoning of the dog, obtained any actual evidence which would show that you were mistaken <b>in</b> <b>your</b> first <b>view,</b> and that <b>your</b> subsequent change of opinion was due solely to <b>your</b> general <b>view</b> of the boy's character, so far as you knew it." ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{bedroom was}} on the first floor, above an entresol, and looked into a back street, which you have sketched <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view.</b> I raised my hand to open the window, knowing that on that action hung, by the merest hair-breadth, my chance of safety. They keep {{vigilant}} watch in a House of Murder. If {{any part of the}} frame cracked, if the hinge creaked, I was a lost man! It must have occupied me at least five minutes, reckoning by time--five hours, reckoning by suspense--to open that window. I succeeded in doing it silently--in doing it with all the dexterity of a house-breaker--and then looked down into the street. To leap the distance beneath me would be almost certain destruction! Next, I looked round at the sides of the house. Down the left side ran a thick water-pipe which you have drawn--it passed close by {{the outer edge of the}} window. The moment I saw the pipe I knew I was saved. My breath came and went freely for the first time since I had seen the canopy of the bed moving down upon me! ...|$|E
6000|$|I am truly obliged by your {{friendly}} and frank communication. May I beg {{that you would}} add to the favour, by marking with a pencil some of the passages that are faulty, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> of the case? We seem pretty much of opinion upon the subject of rhyme. Pentameters, where the sense has a close of some sort at every two lines, may be rendered in regularly closed couplets; but hexameters (especially the Virgilian, that run the lines into {{each other for a}} great length) cannot. I have long been persuaded that Milton formed his blank verse upon the model of the Georgics and the Aeneid, and I am so much struck with this resemblance, that I should have attempted Virgil in blank verse, had I not been persuaded that no ancient author can be with advantage so rendered. Their religion, their warfare, their course of action and feeling, are too remote from modern interest to allow it. We require every possible help and attraction of sound, in our language, to smooth the way for the admission of things so remote from our present concerns. My own notion of translation is, that it cannot be too literal, provided three faults be avoided: baldness, in which I include all that takes from dignity; and strangeness or uncouthness, including harshness; and lastly, attempts to convey meanings which, as they cannot be given but by languid circumlocutions, cannot in fact be said to be given at all. I will trouble you with an instance in which I fear this fault exists. Virgil, describing Aeneas's voyage, third book, verse 551, says-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Those who <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> are [...] "Zukunftsmusiker", in my {{view are}} [...] "Gegenwartsmusiker"("musicians of the present"); and those who <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> are [...] "Vergangenheitsmusiker" [...] ("musicians of the past") (Bach, Handel, Beethoven), for me {{they seem to be}} the best [...] "Zukunftsmusiker" [...] ("musicians of (or for) the future"). I shall never be able to {{consider}} spiritual beauty in beautiful forms as an outmoded point of view. Does perhaps Wagner have them? And, after all, where are Liszts ingenious achievements - where are they on display? Perhaps in his desk? does he perhaps want to wait for the future, since he fears he cannot be understood? right now? ...|$|E
5000|$|In interviews, Euronymous {{claimed to}} be against individualism, compassion, peace, {{happiness}} and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1993 interview he said [...] "There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted". Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him to be his best friend) said that Euronymous [...] "was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts ... worshipping death and being extreme". Ihsahn, who frequented Helvete, said that [...] "if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>views,</b> you were accepted" [...] there, which was important {{to be a part}} of the Helvete scene.|$|R
6000|$|But Berkeley wasn't {{going to}} be drawn into a {{theological}} discussion--that was a field which he always sedulously and successfully avoided. 'The immortality of the soul,' he said quietly, 'is a Platonic dogma too frequently confounded, even by moderately instructed persons like yourself, Le Breton, with the Church's very different doctrine of the resurrection of the body. Upon this latter subject, my dear fellow, about which you don't seem to be quite clear or perfectly sound <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>views,</b> you'll find some excellent remarks in Bishop Pearson on the Creed--a valuable work which I had the pleasure of studying intimately for my ordination examination.' ...|$|R

50|$|To {{determine}} whether a particular development in adulthood is positive or not, a value-judgment must be made {{about what kind of}} change in adult life is optimal or beneficial, and correspondingly what changes in adulthood are negative or deleterious. There are a number of competing standards for what constitutes positive development in adulthood, which can be broadly grouped into five directions (Robinson, 2012); orthogenetic (becoming more hierarchically complex), selective/adaptive (becoming more likely to pass on your genes and for offspring to survive and thrive), veridical (becoming less biased <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> of the world), eudemonic (becoming happier and healthier) and virtuous (becoming a better person from a particular moral or ethical standpoint).|$|E
5000|$|Powell {{reflected}} on the speech {{in an interview in}} 1977 when the interviewer asked him [...] "nine years after the speech, are we still <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>view</b> on a kind of funeral pyre?: Yes, I’ve been guilty I suppose of, I've said this before, of under-estimating rather than over-estimating. And I was just looking back at the figures that I was then talking about in 1968 {{for the end of the}} century. Do you know my estimates which were regarded with such ridicule and denounced, behold the academics forgive me, they are less than the official estimate which the Franks reported at the beginning of this year are thought. So upon the whole I have leaned, perhaps it's a fault, towards the under-estimation of the magnitude and of the danger.|$|E
