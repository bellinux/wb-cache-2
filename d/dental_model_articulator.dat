40|$|The {{results of}} orthognathic surgery may differ {{significantly}} from the planned outcome using <b>dental</b> <b>models.</b> The orientation of <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> mounted on <b>articulators</b> using conventional face bows does not accurately replicate {{the orientation of the}} patients' teeth and jaws, but introduces a systematic error. A mathematical analysis showed that the misalignment of the maxillary model introduces errors in the perioperative wafers, which may lead to the incorrect surgical positioning of the maxilla reported in the literature. The results of the mathematical analysis were validated by image analysis of photographs of mounted maxillary models, used to simulate five orthognathic procedures. No significant difference between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions from the mathematical equations was noted. Planning for maxillary forward and upward movement produced more advancement and only 50 % of maxillary impaction. Planning for maxillary forward and downward movement produced less advancement and more inferior displacement in relation to horizontal and vertical reference planes. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This paper presents an automated approach to efficiently articulate digital <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> to maximum intercuspation (MI). There are two steps in our method. The {{first step is}} to position the models to an initial position based on dental curves and a point matching algorithm. The second step is to finally position the models to the MI position based on our novel approach of using iterative surface-based minimum distance mapping with collision constraints. Finally, our method was validated using 12 sets of digital <b>dental</b> <b>models.</b> The results showed that using our method the digital <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> can be accu-rately and effectively articulated to MI position...|$|R

40|$|Tooth {{segmentation}} on <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> is {{an essential}} step of computer-aided-design systems for orthodontic virtual treatment planning. However, fast and accurate identifying cutting boundary to separate teeth from <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> still remains a challenge, due to various geometrical shapes of teeth, complex tooth arrangements, different <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> qualities, and varying degrees of crowding problems. Most segmentation approaches presented before {{are not able to}} achieve a balance between fine segmentation results and simple operating procedures with less time consumption. In this article, we present a novel, effective and efficient framework that achieves tooth segmentation based on a segmentation field, which is solved by a linear system defined by a discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A set of contour lines are sampled from the smooth scalar field, and candidate cutting boundaries can be detected from concave regions with large variations of field data. The sensitivity to concave seams of the segmentation field facilitates effective tooth partition, as well as avoids obtaining appropriate curvature threshold value, which is unreliable in some case. Our tooth segmentation algorithm is robust to <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> with low quality, as well as is effective to <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> with different levels of crowding problems. The experiments, including segmentation tests of varying <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> with different complexity, experiments on dental meshes with different modeling resolutions and surface noises and comparison between our method and the morphologic skeleton segmentation method are conducted, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our method...|$|R
30|$|With the {{advances}} in computer technology, digital <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> {{are now being}} widely used for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. The use of digital models alleviates many of the challenges posed by plaster models made from conventional impressions, which include the burden of storage, the risk of damage or breakage, and the difficulties in sharing the data with other clinicians involved in the patients’ care [1, 2]. Digital <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> can be created through either indirect or direct techniques. Indirect methods involve laser scanning or computed tomographic imaging of the alginate impressions or plaster models, and direct methods involve intraoral scanners. With the introduction of chairside intraoral scanners, interest in obtaining digital <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> using the direct method has increased [3 – 5].|$|R

40|$|Forensic {{dentistry}} generally {{addresses the}} problem of identifying individuals based on the properties of teeth or identifying individuals based on bite mark impressions. It is legally relevant to accurately and reliably match a bite mark impression to place a criminal {{at the scene of}} a crime. Therefore, a system which minimizes human interaction to conduct the comparison would be beneficial to ensure accuracy and reduce human bias. This paper describes experiments with developing a semi-automated method to compare 3 D <b>dental</b> <b>models</b> taken from candidate humans and bite mark impression images left in the scene of the crime. Once the contours from the bite mark image and the 3 -dimensional <b>dental</b> <b>model</b> are captured, the ideal alignment is calculated by finding the transformation which minimizes a distance measure.

The final volumetric shrinkage values for the modeling resins were statistically similar (P> 0. 05) or significantly larger (P< 0. 05) than that of the control resin and were related to the polymerization kinetics (P< 0. 05) rather than the PMMA bead size (P= 0. 335).

Three types of dental gypsum (Sirius, Ultima, France, 0. 005 % w/w IPBC and non-IPBC Siam Moulding Plaster, Thailand) were tested according to modified ASTM G 21 - 96 method with Penicillium notatum MI- 311, Aspergillus flavus MI- 321, and Aspergillus spp. isolated from orthodontic models. 50 μL of spore suspension of each fungus (104 CFU/mL) was dropped on the prepared gypsum samples and incubated at room temperature, ≥ 85 % relative humidity for 28 days. Fungal growth was visually scored. No fungal growth was observed on IPBC gypsum while 2 strains of Aspergillus spp. could be found on sirius gypsum.
