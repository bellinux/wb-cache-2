5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on {{the other}} end, that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of {{primarily}} transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the Runway staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> them before, since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints he sent to the director.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E

25|$|Twisted-pair cabling {{was invented}} by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. By 1900, the entire American {{telephone}} line network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference.

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E
25|$|Spill (also {{known as}} bleed and leakage) is the {{occurrence}} in sound recording (particularly in close miking) and live sound mixing whereby sound {{is picked up}} by a microphone from a source other than that which is intended. Spill is usually seen as a problem, and various steps are taken to avoid it or reduce it. In some styles of music, such as orchestral music, jazz, and blues, it {{is more likely to be}} accepted or <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> as desirable.|$|E

25|$|Doctor Vollmer — {{a medical}} doctor who is Wolfe's {{neighbor}} and friend. Wolfe calls upon Vollmer whenever a dead body is discovered, or medical attention is required, at the brownstone. In The Silent Speaker, Vollmer contrives an illness severe enough that Wolfe cannot be questioned or <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> by anyone. Vollmer examines Louis Rony's corpse for Wolfe in The Second Confession and acts as a go-between for Cramer and Archie in The Doorbell Rang. Vollmer's motivation, aside from friendship, is that Wolfe helped him out with a would-be blackmailer years ago.|$|E

Helgi-Alice however was arrested again in 1950 and sentenced to 10 years in prison in Kazakh SSR and returned in 1955. Matti Päts has been director of the Estonian Patent Office since 1991; {{he has also been}} a member of the Riigikogu and Tallinn city council. He was <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> as a potential candidate for the 2001 Presidential election by the conservative wing of the Pro Patria Union.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, he met Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, {{and asked}} him to inform other Communist leaders, as well as Arab leaders about his ideas for a {{peaceful}} settlement. In early 1970, he was invited to talks by Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser, but was stopped by the Israeli government. Attempts to contact the Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, in 1974, were <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> as high treason. Goldmann thought this behavior to be foolish. In 1982, he called on the Israeli Prime Minister to not reanimate anti-Zionism and antisemitism with the campaign in the Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|An {{unexpected}} {{public outcry}} was invoked over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the threatened return of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on the Irish parliament at Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin. Some of the pensioners were <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> to cheer {{on the students}} as the protests passed {{each other on the}} streets of Dublin. Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops who were assured by O'Keeffe that religious instruction would be unaffected by the budget changes.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Mulroney's {{government}} {{opposed the}} apartheid regime in South Africa and {{he met with}} many of the regime's opposition leaders throughout his tenure. His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere. Also, external affairs minister Joe Clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated Ethiopia to lead the Western response to the 1984–1985 famine in that country; Clark landed in Addis Ababa so quickly he had not <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> the CBC report that had created the initial and strong public reaction. Canada's response was overwhelming and led the U.S.A. and Britain to follow suit almost immediately — an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time, since Ethiopia had a Marxist regime and had previously been isolated by Western governments.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 2009, the Bulls wore white {{shoes at}} {{home during the}} regular season, black shoes {{on the road and}} black shoes home and away all {{throughout}} the playoffs. The unofficial playoff tradition goes back to the Jordan era, recommended by Brad Sellers as a show of team unity. The Bulls also wore their red uniform on all playoff road games, until the team opted to wear their sleeved black uniforms in the 2017 NBA Playoffs. During the 2008–09 season and first three games of the playoffs, however, the Bulls wore black sneakers on away games only while wearing white sneakers on home games. Since the 2009–10 season, however, the NBA has relaxed its rules on specific sneaker colors on home and away games, and several Bulls players are seen wearing white sneakers on the road, or black at home during the regular season, <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> wearing red on occasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Prussia on 15 July 1870 led to a chaotic mobilization of the French Army. The mitrailleuse batteries faced particularly acute problems. Although on paper they had been organized into proper batteries, at the {{outbreak of}} war the guns were still in storage at Meudon and in the forts of Montrouge, Issy, and Mont-Valerien around Paris. The crews had been designated but {{had not yet been}} assembled. Many had little or no training {{in the use of the}} weapons and so were unaware of its sighting and ranging characteristics. Detailed instruction manuals had been printed in January 1870, but had only been distributed at the very beginning of the hostilities. Such was the secrecy surrounding the weapon that not only did few artillery commanders know how to deploy it effectively, many did not even know that it existed. Marshal MacMahon, commander of the Army of Châlons, claimed that he had never <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> a mitrailleuse until one was wheeled past him at the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, nearly two months after war had been declared.|$|E
