40|$|Neuropeptides are {{an ancient}} class of {{neuronal}} signaling molecules that regulate {{a variety of}} physiological and behavioral processes in animals. The life cycle of many animals includes a larval stage(s) that precedes metamorphic transition to a reproductively active adult stage but, {{with the exception of}} Drosophila melanogaster and other insects, research on neuropeptide signaling has hitherto largely focused on adult animals. However, recent advances in genome/transcriptome sequencing have facilitated investigation of neuropeptide expression/function in the larvae of protostomian (e. g. the annelid Platynereis dumerilii) and deuterostomian (e. g. the urochordate Ciona intestinalis) invertebrates. Accordingly, here we report the first multi-gene investigation of larval neuropeptide precursor expression in a species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata - the starfish Asterias rubens. Whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization was used to visualize in bipinnaria and brachiolaria stage larvae the expression of eight neuropeptide precursors: L-type SALMFamide (S 1), F-type SALMFamide (S 2), vasopressin/oxytocin-type, NGFFYamide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone-type, gonadotropin-releasing hormone-type, calcitonin-type and corticotropin-releasing hormone-type. Expression of only three of the precursors (S 1, S 2, NGFFYamide) was observed in bipinnaria larvae but by the brachiolaria stage expression of all eight precursors was detected. An evolutionarily conserved feature of larval nervous systems <b>is</b> <b>the</b> apical organ and in starfish larvae this comprises the bilaterally symmetrical lateral ganglia, but only the S 1 and S 2 precursors were found to be expressed in these ganglia. A prominent feature of brachiolaria larvae <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> complex, comprising <b>the</b> brachia and adhesive disk, which mediates larval attachment to a substratum prior to metamorphosis. Interestingly, all of the neuropeptide precursors examined <b>here</b> <b>are</b> expressed in <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> complex, with distinctive patterns of expression suggesting potential roles for neuropeptides in <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> process. Lastly, expression of several neuropeptide precursors is associated with ciliary bands, suggesting potential roles for the neuropeptides derived from these precursors in control of larval locomotion and/or feeding. In conclusion, our findings provide novel perspectives on the evolution and development of neuropeptide signaling systems and neuroanatomical insights into neuropeptide function in echinoderm larvae...|$|R
