40|$|Hemidactylus frenatus is an Asian gecko {{that has}} spread pantropically {{to become one}} the world's most {{widespread}} reptiles. It {{has been established in}} Australia for approximately 50 years, but the last two decades have seen massive range expansion across settled areas of northern and eastern Australia; and this spread continues at pace. Disturbingly, H. frenatus is increasingly being detected in natural habitats in Australia, in some cases at high densities. Despite rampant spread, there has been little concern regarding the potential impact of this species on native geckos or natural systems more broadly. This is surprising given that Australia is a centre of gecko origin and diversity, and that H. frenatus has had well documented detrimental impacts on geckos in other parts of its introduced range. Here I review the biology and global distribution of H. frenatus, plot its spread in Australia over the five decades since <b>establishment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> the research on invasive populations of this species overseas and in Australia to assess potential impacts. I argue that Australia should be more concerned about H. Frenatus because: (i) it is spreading rapidly across northern, eastern and central Australia; (ii) it can invade natural habitats; (iii) it is a very strong competitor and may out-compete Australian geckos in some situations; and (iv) it carries novel parasites that may impact native reptile species. Hemidactylus frenatus is here to stay and represents a potential threat to Australia's diversity and ecology. A key question {{is the degree to which}} it will invade natural habitats and what its impacts will be in these. Research is required to assess the current and potential impacts of H. frenatus in Australia so as to determine how these can be managed and the level of investment warranted...|$|E

40|$|Reviewing Establishment Clause {{jurisprudence}} of the Supreme Court, {{this article}} {{notes that the}} current state of this area of law is in hopeless disarray and argues that the Court should resolve this confusion by employing a few proposed solutions. The article begins by <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> analyzing the confusion surrounding modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence. The article then discusses what interpretation of the Establishment Clause should be controlling: strict-separationism, nonpreferentialism, enhanced federalism, or the incorporation doctrine. Next, the article details what is wrong with modern establishment clause jurisprudence, namely, the Court’s inconsistent application of different tests to assess government action under the <b>Establishment</b> Clause <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> the Lemon test, the endorsement test, the neutrality test, and the coercion test. Following this discussion, the article notes how the Supreme Court’s most recent Establishment Clause case, Town of Greece v. Galloway, failed to clarify any of the above doctrinal confusion. Finally, the article concludes by suggesting steps to improve clarity in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. It suggests 1) that the Court take steps to remedy its doctrinal jumble by clearly declaring a definitive test as well as overruling incorrect precedent and 2) that the Court adjust the level of scrutiny applied in these cases to rationale basis or intermediate scrutiny...|$|R
