5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy,</b> but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{stems from}} the end of a special program in Southern Italy (1993), viewing it as more than just an episode of {{institutional}} reform, but as the start of a process of changes in territorial development policy. How this process led to an overhaul of the tools at central and local level is described in this paper. This happened in a framework of scarce resources and of increasing <b>financial</b> <b>autonomies,</b> which did not invalidate it, but made the assimilation slower. The scarse use of funds earmarked for planning is also proof of this situation. The appropriate economical and financial evaluation of investments in infrastructures remains a central item. ...|$|R

25|$|In June 1990, after a {{favourable}} opinion from the Government's law officers, {{it was decided}} to use the power to issue a general limitation on local government budgets in all authorities which had been enacted in the Rates Act 1984 but had remained unused until then. This decision removed most local government <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> This 'universal capping' continued from the 1991–92 financial year until 1998–99; when it was ended the Secretary of State took reserve powers under the Local Government Act 1999 to regulate increases in the Council Tax (which had replaced the Community Charge).

The League of Nations accepted the fait accompli and the Klaipėda Region was transferred as an autonomous territory to the Republic of Lithuania on February 17, 1923. After prolonged negotiations a formal international agreement, the Klaipėda Convention, was signed in May 1924. The convention formally acknowledged Lithuania's sovereignty {{in the region and}} outlined its extensive legislative, judicial, administrative, and <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The region remained part of Lithuania until March 1939 when it was transferred to Nazi Germany after the German ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|The Tuvalu Trust Fund is an {{international}} sovereign wealth fund established to benefit Tuvalu, a small, central Pacific island nation, by providing income to cover shortfalls in the national budget, underpin economic development, and help the nation achieve greater <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

The International Monetary Fund 2014 Country Report noted the market value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund dropped during the global financial crisis, however the total value of the fund had recovered to more than $AUD140 million (3.5 times of GDP).

25|$|The National Water Law of 2007 was {{approved}} by the National Assembly and regulates water use by different sectors while prioritizing potable water supplies for domestic use. The Water Law aims to protect and preserve the country’s water resources. Furthermore, Nicaragua’s congressional environment and natural resources committee has also approved its 2010 work plan giving priority {{to the creation of the}} national water authority (ANA). Under the Water Law, ANA will be a decentralized organization, with administrative and <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy.</b> ANA will be responsible for drawing up a national water resources plan, keeping track of water levels in basins, maintaining a public registry of water rights, and promoting the use and development of water resources. The authority is also expected to monitor the construction of water infrastructure. The establishment of ANA has been delayed by 2 years. The delay is due in part for two reasons: 1) implementing the water law is expensive; and 2) there exists disagreements over who should lead that agency.|$|E

25|$|Initially the {{proposed}} Klaipėda Convention reserved extensive rights for Poland to access, use, and govern {{the port of}} Klaipėda. This was completely unacceptable to Lithuania, which had terminated all diplomatic ties with Poland over the Vilnius Region. The stalled negotiations were referred to the League of Nations. The three-member commission, chaired by American Norman Davis, prepared the final convention which was signed by Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Lithuania in May 1924. The Klaipėda Region became an autonomous region under unconditional sovereignty of Lithuania. The region had extensive legislative, judicial, administrative, and <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy</b> and elected its own local parliament. The port of Klaipėda was internationalized allowing freedom of transit. The convention was hailed as a major Lithuanian diplomatic victory as it contained none of the special rights initially reserved for Poland and placed no conditions on Lithuanian sovereignty in the region. However, the convention severely limited {{the powers of the}} Lithuanian government and caused frequent debates on the relationship between central and local authorities. In the 1920s, the relations between Lithuania and Germany under Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann were rather normal. However, tensions began to rise after Adolf Hitler came to power. Weaknesses of the convention were exploited by Nazi Germany when it supported anti-Lithuanian activities and campaigned for reincorporation of the region into Germany, culminating in the 1939 ultimatum.|$|E

500|$|Following the war, Serong {{returned}} to Melbourne but struggled {{to return to}} civilian life and lived apart from his family, who had begun to live their own lives in his long absence. He was considered a world authority on counter-insurgency operations, and wrote widely on the subject in the 1970s. Described by John Farquharson as a major Cold War figure, Serong was recognised internationally for developing new tactics for counter-insurgency and jungle warfare. In retirement he became involved in anti-communist organisations and citizens' militia groups such as Ausi Freedom Scouts (Australians United for Survival and Freedom), {{of which he was}} a patron. He also supported conspiracy theories about the Port Arthur shooting in 1996 and allegations of government corruption (later found to have been based on a hoax, albeit unbeknown to Serong) as well as speaking on Australian defence issues. He was at times associated with right-wing individuals or organisations, advocating nationalism and the need for increased defence spending as part of a [...] "forward defence" [...] strategy, as well as strengthening of the peace-time Army Reserve, the development of inland Australia, opposition to gun control, concerns about the loss of national sovereignty and <b>financial</b> <b>autonomy</b> to the United Nations and International Monetary Fund, and limitations on immigration. While at times a controversial figure, his public reputation remained high and his opinions were rarely the subject of criticism in the media.
