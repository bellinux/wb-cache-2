30|$|To {{address these}} climate hazards and {{struggle}} against drought, plants develop several defense strategies; mycorrhizal association with soil fungi {{is an example}} [14]. These associations improve plant nutrition, mainly nitrogen and phosphate by increasing water intake in plants by increasing the exchange surface root-soil [15]. Many experiments {{on the effects of}} mycorrhizae on plant growth showed that the rate of photosynthesis is higher in mycorrhizal plants compared to non-mycorrhizal <b>plants</b> <b>Auge</b> [16], Kucey and Paul [17], and Levy and Krikun [18]. Most studies suggest that AM fungi contribute to increased rate of photosynthesis in improving (P) nutrition in plants, [5, 19, 20].|$|R

40|$|Two {{levels of}} seed rates and three forward speeds were applied in a {{randomized}} complete block design experiment using a mechanical sugar cane planter. The effects of three speeds and two seed {{rates on the}} eye damage percent, stalk cutting percent and uniformity of set placement were studied. Manually cultivated plots were used as control plots. Results showed that increasing forward speed up to 6 km/h gave {{a significant increase in}} the eye damage percent and stalk cutting percent for both seed rates used. The various speeds used were found to influence the number of stalks dropped per row and consequently the cane yield. Mechanically planted cane was found to produce more tillers per stool than <b>hand</b> <b>planting</b> due to the higher application rates. No significant differences in yield were found between machine and <b>hand</b> <b>planting</b> when a seed rate of 2. 0 m cane/m land was used...|$|R

The CCC had several camps in Alabama including one at Geneva State Forest. The young men of the CCC worked to revitalize the forests of Geneva County and southern Alabama.

30|$|Although these {{restored}} {{areas were}} utilised for cropping and sheep grazing {{for the past}} 50 years, most of the species broadcast or <b>hand</b> <b>planted</b> {{as part of the}} restoration efforts survived during the subsequent years. Apparently, the area provided a receptive seedbed and there were suitable conditions for these species to recruit and survive in subsequent years. It is also anticipated that these seedlings may provide additional seed source and provide suitable conditions for further recruitments of native species at a later stage. The three EVCs under study may thus have potential to develop structure and complexity.|$|R
