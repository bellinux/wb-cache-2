40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to find a family of curves {{parametrized}} by arc length and that depend on an angular function and an intrinsic fraction function, which is defined as the quotient between torsion and curvature. We find for this family of curves explicit formulas of curvature, torsion and <b>geodetic</b> <b>curvature,</b> in terms of the angular function and the intrinsic fraction function. Applications are found for the case of the general helices and slant helices...|$|E

Abstract. – In the literature, different properties of propagating excitation waves on curved surfaces are published. Theoretical papers predicted critical properties of waves on curved surfaces. If an excitation wave propagates in a non-planar system, its <b>geodetic</b> <b>curvature</b> causes {{a transition from}} excitable to non-excitable dynamics. In this paper we present first experimental results of the transition in a weakly excitable BZ system which are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Introduction. – Excitation wave patterns occur in many physical, chemical, and biological systems [1 – 3]. Up to now, most investigations were done in planar geometries. But in nature there are many two-dimensional systems which must be considered as an excitable medium with a curved surface. An important example is the heart, where the excitation waves move along the muscle in a ring-like fashion. Although {{during the last decade}} some propertie...|$|E

This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers [...] ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic. In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.|$|R
