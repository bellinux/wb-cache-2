500|$|Beginning in 1967, the {{advertising}} focused exclusively on Wonderbra brand brassieres. In 1968, Nadler hired Goodis Advertising {{to develop the}} new campaign. The Wonderbra ads were based on fashion and emotional appeal. In various ads, the man would appear as fashion photographer (in a fashion shoot) or fashion buyer (at a fashion show). The storyline suggested an attraction or budding romance between {{the man and the}} women. The voice-over and jingle featured a man's voice and the commercial showed an actual woman's torso naked except for a bra. All other television ads before this era showed brassieres on a manikin or a <b>dressmaker's</b> <b>dummy</b> to promote the functional features of the product. Every Wonderbra advertisement contained versions of the musical theme, [...] "We care about the shape you're in. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderbra". The 1979 television campaign included a commercial directed by Richard Avedon which won a Silver award for television advertisements shown in Canada.|$|R
