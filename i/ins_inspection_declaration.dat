40|$|The Swedish Aviation Safety Authority {{has decided}} to {{standardise}} a classification system for reporting deviations found <b>in</b> <b>inspections.</b> The purpose of a classification system is that similar deviations always should be reported {{in the same way}} since this will enable better decisions regarding different risk areas. The inspectors are therefore constrained to use a standardised classification system and are not free to use their own words when reporting deviations. A hierarchal classification system with predefined phrases is in aviation referred to as taxonomy. Taxonomy is already in use when reporting accidents and incidents but not when reporting deviations found <b>in</b> <b>inspections.</b> If the taxonomy also could be implemented when reporting deviations found <b>in</b> <b>inspections</b> it would make it possible to find out what kind of accident or incident the deviation has been involved in. To make this connection possible and to enable further analyses the information has to be stored, preferably in a database. We have examined the already existing taxonomy and its usability <b>in</b> <b>inspection</b> reporting. Were the old taxonomy has been found insufficient we have examined how to build up a new suitable taxonomy. We have also begun the extension of the taxonomy in certain domains in aviation. To be able to test the extended taxonomy we have developed a system support that consists of a database and help functions consisting of checklists and linked regulation text. The system support also contains risk assessment matrixes. We have through this work seen that a great extension of the existing taxonomy is necessary. As the taxonomy is formed it is hard to make direct connections between accidents/incidents and deviations found <b>in</b> <b>inspections</b> without a mapping tool. However we think that a database management system should be implemented <b>in</b> <b>inspections.</b> A database management system would be a useful help for the inspectors and enable easier access to data for analyses...|$|R

40|$|Inspection has {{increasingly}} {{been regarded as}} a safeguard for promoting quality of social services. Little attention has, however, {{been given to the}} impact of standards used <b>in</b> <b>inspections,</b> i. e. the written norms, rules and principles used for identification and judgment. The aim {{of this study is to}} empirically contribute to an improved understanding of how standards <b>in</b> <b>inspection</b> of social service are designed, and to what extent the design is adjusted in relation to different kind of social services. We employ a systematic and comparative analysis of the content (in terms of input, process, output and outcome aspects) and precision (low, medium and high) of 186 paragraphs derived from legislation and referred to as standards <b>in</b> <b>inspection</b> decisions concerning two types of social work: Investigation, Assessment and Decision-Making (IAD); and Treatment Intervention (TI) in Sweden 2012. Contrary to expectations based on an inspection ideal, our findings show that paragraphs covering outcome aspects are not more commonly referred to as standards in TI than <b>in</b> IAD <b>inspection.</b> The analysis of the precision also indicates that the standards used <b>in</b> <b>inspection</b> of TI are not more adjusted to complex and subjectively experienced aspects than are the standards used in IAD. Our overall results indicate that the policy instrument is primarily adapted to IAD inspection rather than to TI inspection. Open Access APC beslut 3 / 2017 </p...|$|R
