In 1989, she participated in recording [...] "Do They Know It's Christmas?" [...] under the name Band Aid II to help raise money. In early 2010, Minogue along with many other artists (under the name Helping Haiti) recorded a cover version of [...] "Everybody Hurts". The single was a fundraiser to help after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. She also spent a week in Thailand after the 2005 tsunami. During her 2011 Aphrodite World Tour, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, which was on her itinerary. She declared she would continue to tour there, stating, [...] "I was <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> shows and I chose not to cancel, Why did I choose not to cancel?

500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E

According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson said Adolf {{previously}} made {{comments about}} killing any African American {{who ran for}} president: [...] "He made a comment in the past. I can't honestly tell you how long ago in the past, that he didn't believe a black should be {{the leader of this}} country." [...] According to Johnson, Adolf said he was already wanted for other crimes, so it [...] "wouldn't matter if he killed Obama". Johnson also claimed Adolf said he would never be taken alive and wanted to [...] "go down in a blaze of glory". Law enforcement sources told KCNC-TV that one of the suspects [...] "was directly asked if they had come to Denver to kill Obama. He responded in the affirmative." [...] Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver to help Adolf execute the plan, and Gartrell later admitted to police that in talking about Obama, they referred to [...] "shooting on a grassy knoll," [...] a reference to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. An arrest warrant read, [...] "Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama and additionally stated that he would specifically use a sniper rifle and high powered scope, and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama." [...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything like that ... When the feds came and laid out everything on the table and how it looked, I was in agreement that they could have been up <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something like that."

2500|$|The {{new head}} office was commended at the time. It {{featured}} in the 7 September 1967 edition of The Queensland Master Builder, which detailed the building's construction techniques and highlighted its modern technology. According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes [...] "that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [...] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to {{follow the example of}} the Main Roads Department". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as [...] "a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation", and stated [...] "why should a department like Main Roads be any different from private business ... e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will get the idea that we are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community". The Courier-Mail added that [...] "the building design, layout of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building [...] "would {{be one of the most}} effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future".|$|E

You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
