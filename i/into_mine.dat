5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface seepage <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed seepage in the area {{was estimated to be}} 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of seepage is much higher than a number of other streams in the area.|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was based}} in Tsingtao with {{unusable}} engines; she was scuttled in the harbor since {{she was no longer}} operational. Geier briefly operated against British shipping in the Pacific before having to put into Hawaii for internment by the then-neutral United States. After the United States entered the war in April 1917, she was seized and commissioned into the US Navy as USS Schurz; she served as an escort until she was accidentally sunk following a collision with a freighter in June 1918. Seeadler and Condor, meanwhile, had been converted <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> storage hulks after the start of the war. Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was {{the only member of the}} class to survive the war, and she was scrapped in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E

25|$|There is a dam {{known as}} the Bear Valley Dam located on Carbon Run. Spoil piles and {{abandoned}} mining land occupies much of the stream's watershed. In some reaches, the stream flows underground due to infiltration <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> pools, but returns to the surface {{in the form of}} a discharge. An anticlinal known as Anticlinal No. 8 or Red Ridge ends at the valley of Carbon Run.|$|E
25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when I took him <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> and never uttered a sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
25|$|The first federal safety {{legislation}} was enacted in the Progressive period. In 1893, Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act, {{the first federal}} statute to require safety equipment in the workplace (the law applied only to railroad equipment, however). In 1910, {{in response to a}} series of highly publicized and deadly mine explosions and collapses, Congress established the United States Bureau of Mines to conduct research <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> safety (although the Bureau had no authority to regulate mine safety). Backed by trade unions, many states also enacted workers' compensation laws which discouraged employers from permitting unsafe workplaces. These laws, as well as the growing power of labor unions and public anger toward poor workplace safety, led to significant reductions in worker accidents for a time.|$|E

25|$|Subsidence {{from coal}} mining was a {{significant}} problem {{for much of the}} life of the canal. The Lapal Tunnel was regularly affected, and a section near Blackbrook Junction fell <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> workings in 1894. The route was restored, but the short Two Locks Line nearby was abandoned in 1909, and the Lapal Tunnel, which has used a pump and stop-locks to create flows to assist the boats in their passage, suffered the same fate in 1917. Most of the canal was abandoned in the 1960s, but a committee was formed, which became the Dudley Canal Trust, and restoration took place, culminating in the reopening of Dudley Tunnel in 1973. Lapal Tunnel remains closed, and although the Lapal Tunnel Trust originally campaigned for it to be reopened, they have modified their plans to include a surface route, following the conclusion of an engineering study.|$|E
2500|$|Dudley Tunnel {{was closed}} in 1884, {{to allow the}} south end to be rebuilt. The work was {{completed}} and the tunnel was reopened on 23 April 1885. It saw considerable traffic, with coal and limestone passing southwards, and blast furnace slag making the return journey. Subsidence affected the canal in 1894, when a section near Blackbrook Junction, including part of the Two Lock Line, fell <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> workings. The canal remained closed for some time while repairs were made. Blowers Green Lock was built near the junction of Line No. 1 and Line No. 2 at this time, to replace two original locks.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a letter}} written 30 years later to Francis Darwin, when Huxley heard this he whispered to Brodie, [...] "The Lord hath {{delivered}} him <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> hands". This quotation first appears {{more than thirty years}} later, and is almost certainly a later insertion to the story. Huxley's own contemporary account, in a letter to Henry Dyster on September 9, 1860, makes no mention of this remark. Huxley rose to defend Darwin's theory, finishing his speech with the now-legendary assertion that he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth. Again, later retellings indicate that this had a tremendous effect on the audience, and Lady Brewster is said to have fainted.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{can also}} have the intention of winning the gods' favour in warfare. In Homeric legend, Iphigeneia was to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to appease Artemis so she would allow the Greeks to wage the Trojan War. According to the Bible, Jephthah vowed to devote to God the first creature {{to come out of}} his house to meet him if he won the battle against the Ammonites. Judges 11:30-31; [...] "And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon <b>into</b> <b>mine</b> hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will Him a burnt offering." [...] His daughter was the first to come out and meet him. Judges 11:34; [...] "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter." [...] Although there is some uncertainty as to whether this was human sacrifice or consecration, academia discusses this in the context of human sacrifice, drawing parallels to Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac.|$|E
