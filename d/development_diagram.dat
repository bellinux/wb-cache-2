25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the <b>development</b> <b>diagram</b> by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E

40|$|Research in {{education}} {{has brought to}} light {{the complexity of the}} learning process, demonstrating that students 2 ̆ 7 development is influenced by a myriad of cultural and social factors, as well as the environment in which learning takes place. Engineering curricula, however, are primarily focused on teaching content knowledge, often resulting in a gap between what is taught and what is learned. We propose that shifting some of the focus onto the process of learning that occurs within the student and leveraging multiple known connections from educational psychology can result in more effective engineering education. Here we define “effective” engineering education as that which leads to greater retention of knowledge, accelerated skills development, and enhanced motivation for life-long learning. We have developed a curriculum design tool to facilitate this shift. It is a diagram that makes explicit the connections between properties of the 2 ̆ 2 learning environment 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 cognitive activity 2 ̆ 2 and the development occurring within the student. The Four-Domain <b>Development</b> <b>Diagram,</b> a synthesis of known empirical relationships in the learning literature, enables a faculty member to take a systems approach while designing learning activities. For example, it is known that several factors increase the construct of intrinsic motivation (a key ingredient in self-directed learning) such as students 2 ̆ 7 valuation of the material being learned, autonomy in the learning process, a sense of relatedness in the learning environment and experiencing mastery. Unlike other models of learning which focus on the independent influence of one or two constructs, such as student interest or choice, our diagram enables one to design the learning experience to utilize the multiple natural known-relationships within the learner’s development to promote a greater internal drive for learning. Over the course of a three-year period, three cohorts (totaling 120 students) have participated in learning experiences which have been designed according to the relationships in the Four-Domain <b>Development</b> <b>Diagram.</b> Engineering students in 2 ̆ 2 learning experiences 2 ̆ 2 designed according to the diagram report significantly higher levels of interaction with peers as learning collaborators, greater use of integrative cognitive strategies during self-directed learning and a higher degree of moral reasoning than comparison groups (these results are being published elsewhere). While {{it is not possible to}} establish a definitive cause-effect relationship, the results provide encouraging signs that the diagram can be useful as a design guide for simultaneously leveraging natural causal relationships leading to students 2 ̆ 7 development along cognitive, affective, psychomotor and social domains. In this paper, we present the model and its key theoretical and empirical underpinnings. We also provide examples of how it can been used...|$|E
40|$|Škola je osnovana 1907. u atelierima što ih je na poticaj Društva umjetnosti 1895 / 96. izgradila zemaljska vlada. Na pozadini previranja političkih, kulturnih, strukovnoškolskih i tržišnih prilika prikazan je koncept naobrazbenog i prostornog programa, koji bi obuhvatio sve grane likovnih umjetnosti i umjetnog obrta uključujući i arhitekturu. Tendencija je stvaranje nacionalnog izraza, teme koju je historizam projicirao i u strukturu moderne umjetnosti na prijelomu stoljeća. Škola nije u cijelosti uspjela realizirati program sve dok nije stekla status Akademije likovnih umjetnosti, ne bez umjetno-obrtne komponente. The {{school was}} founded in 1907 to improve the {{education}} in crafts provided by the Craft School. It began with art studios which were designed by Herman Bolle and from 1895 to 1896 built by the government at the initiative of the Art Society and lso Kršnjavi, {{the head of the}} Religion and Education Department (18911896). The idea was carried out gradually, from the foundation of the Art Society in 1868 which, among other things, planned to open an elementary art school, to the Crafts Museum (today 2 ̆ 7 s Museum of Arts and Crafts) founded in 1880 and the Crafts School opened in 1882, initially as an institution of the Art Society. The initiative for the school must be credited to sculptor Robert Frangeš. In 1908 problems began to accumulate; on the one hand, {{there had to be a}} differentiation in methods from the Crafts School which required reorganization, and on the other, larger premises were needed to allow for the growing curriculum that was to encompass all forms of crafts, decorative or applied arts as well as architecture, with an emphasis on the national. Around 1908 a two-story building was designed, with an exhibition hall in the classicist Sezession style. The plans are neither dated nor signed, but as the architectural department was intended for Viktor Kovačić, he is considered to be the author, although certain elements seem to belong to Hugo Ehrlich with whom Kovačić went into partnership in 1910. With the change in government in 1910, the idea of the new building was abandoned, but not the idea to broaden the curriculum with the possibility of opening workshops like those in Vienna, Munich, Budapest, Krakow and Prague. Rudolf Lubynski made designs in 1912. for rebuilding and additions to the existing studios. Together with the Association of Croatian Craftsmen, the school attempted to protect the Croatian crafts as prior to that virtually all craft products were purchased abroad, particularly those for church use; therefore the Commission for the Conservation of Art and Historical Monuments in Kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia {{was founded in}} 1910. The School in fact remained incomplete, as it did not fully realize its program until turning into an Academy; but at that point much more space was given to art than to crafts.

This study focuses on the diagramming practices used {{in the design of}} Open Source Software (OSS), where the norm is highly distributed group work. In OSS, text-based communication (e. g., mailing lists) dominates, and sketching and drawing diagrams collaboratively remains difficult due to the barriers imposed by distance and technology. Previous studies have examined these practices and barriers in the context of individual projects. To understand how contributors across OSS projects use diagrams in design-related activities, we conducted a survey of 230 contributors from 40 different OSS projects, and interviewed eight participants. Our results show that although contributors understand the advantages of using diagrams for design-related activities, diagrams are infrequently used in OSS. This motivated us to examine how and why diagramming occurs, and the factors that prevent widespread use in OSS. Finally, we propose new ideas for supporting design activities in OSS projects. 1...|$|R
