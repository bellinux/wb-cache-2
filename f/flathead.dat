5|$|The park is {{bordered on}} the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, and the <b>Flathead</b> Provincial Forest and Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park in British Columbia. To the west, the north fork of the <b>Flathead</b> River forms the western boundary, while its middle fork {{is part of the}} {{southern}} boundary. The Blackfeet Indian Reservation provides most of the eastern boundary. The Lewis and Clark and the <b>Flathead</b> National Forests form the southern and western boundary. The remote Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located in the two forests immediately to the south.|$|E

5|$|The Pend Oreille River system (including {{its main}} tributaries, the Clark Fork and <b>Flathead</b> rivers) is also similar {{in size to}} the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is nearly as long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its {{discharge}} over a third (37%).|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, your Majesty, once--a {{long time}} ago--the <b>Flatheads</b> and the Skeezers were friendly. They visited our island and we visited their mountain, and {{everything}} was pleasant between the two peoples. At that time the <b>Flatheads</b> were ruled by three Adepts in Sorcery, beautiful girls who were not <b>Flatheads,</b> but had wandered to the Flat Mountain and made their home there. These three Adepts used their magic only for good, and the mountain people gladly made them their rulers. They taught the <b>Flatheads</b> how to use their canned brains and how to work metals into clothing that would never wear out, and many other things that added to their happiness and content.|$|R
50|$|The deep-water <b>flatheads</b> are a family, the Bembridae, of bottom-dwelling fish. They {{are thought}} to be more {{primitive}} than their close relatives, the true <b>flatheads.</b> Despite the common name, their heads are only slightly flattened and have spiny ridges.|$|R
5|$|Opened in 1987, Missoula's Bayern Brewing is {{the oldest}} active brewery in Montana. Big Sky Brewing opened in 1995 and with a {{production}} of over 38,000 barrels , it is by far Montana's largest brewery, and produces the best-selling beer brewed in Montana, Moose Drool Brown Ale. Missoula has also been home to Kettle House Brewing since 1995 and Draught Works opened in 2011. Big Sky, Bayern, and Kettlehouse represent the first, second, and third largest breweries respectively {{in the state of}} Montana. Also in 2011, Tamarack Brewing and <b>Flathead</b> Lake Brewing Company from nearby Lake County opened pub houses at downtown Missoula locations. The city also holds annual the Garden City Brewfest and Winterfest, and also periodically hosts the Montana Brewers Festival.|$|E
5|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down is the 2011 fourteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. Following his 2008 album I, <b>Flathead,</b> Cooder {{pursued a}} more {{political}} direction with his songwriting, {{inspired by the}} late-2000s economic crisis and protest songs of the past. Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down was written and produced by Cooder, who recorded its songs at Drive-By Studios, Ocean Studios, and Wireland Studios in California. He played various instruments and worked with musicians such as Flaco Jiménez, Juliette Commagere, Robert Francis, and Jim Keltner.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the <b>Flathead</b> tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flatheads</b> name first {{showed up}} on public record in 1927 when then <b>Flatheads</b> leader Paul Jaworski {{committed}} the nation's first armored car robbery.

6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] Glinda replied, [...] "but I can {{get little}} {{information}} concerning the <b>Flatheads,</b> either. They are people who inhabit a mountain {{just south of the}} Lake of the Skeezers. The mountain has steep sides and a broad, hollow top, like a basin, and in this basin the <b>Flatheads</b> have their dwellings. They also are magic-workers and usually keep to themselves and allow no one from outside to visit them. I have learned that the <b>Flatheads</b> number about one hundred people--men, women and children--while the Skeezers number just one hundred and one." ...|$|R

5|$|Marta {{continues}} {{running in}} the direction she believes will lead back to Pleasant Valley, swimming across Middle Fork River, crossing the nearby highway and railroad tracks, and running through various woodlands in between. Pausing only to drink water and tend her paws, she crosses Pyramid Peak and swims across the Hungry Horse Reservoir, before a week without food and exhaustion cause her to collapse on the shore. After resting, she continues her run, though hunger now spurs her to pause to hunt when she can but she eventually collapses by <b>Flathead</b> Lake, where she remains unconscious for days. Meanwhile, unskilled at hunting and without the adults {{to teach them how}} to survive, Annie and Sula slowly starve to death. Oldtooth reaches Middle Fork Valley, where illness and his lame foot drive him to hunt local livestock. He is shot and killed by a human.|$|E
5|$|Missoula {{began as}} a trading post in the 1860s {{situated}} along the Mullan Military Road {{to take advantage of}} the first route across the Bitterroot Mountains to the plains of Eastern Washington. Its designation as county seat in 1866 and location of the hastily built Fort Missoula in 1877 ensured Missoula's status as a regional commercial center; a status further consolidated in 1883 with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway. The railroad expanded Missoula's trade area to cover a 150-mile radius, and Missoula's location as the railway's division point and repair shops provided hundreds of jobs. When the railway began expanding again in 1898, increased freight shipments came through the city, and with the arrival of the Milwaukee Road and regional office for the U.S. Forest Service as well as the opening of the <b>Flathead</b> Indian Reservation to settlement all within a couple years of each other beginning in 1908, the economy began to rapidly expand.|$|E
5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's <b>Flathead</b> River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The {{region that}} became Glacier National Park was first {{inhabited}} by Native Americans. Upon {{the arrival of}} European explorers, it was dominated by the Blackfeet {{in the east and}} the <b>Flathead</b> in the western regions. Under pressure, the Blackfeet ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government; it later became part of the park. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway. These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, which provided greater accessibility for automobiles {{into the heart of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{timber and}} education, Missoula's {{economic}} mainstay {{has been of}} one as a regional trade center. Missoula has an immediate trade area of approximately 180,000 residents. The Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Area, which includes the Montana Counties of <b>Flathead,</b> Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government and social services, education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula's fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana's only LevelII Trauma center) and the Community Medical Center already the city's second and third largest employers behind the university. 55% of employment in Missoula {{is made up of}} the service and retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and <b>Flathead</b> people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E

5|$|Further {{regulation}} of the Columbia's flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible. Water storage and regulation projects in Canada would be needed, {{as well as a}} treaty resolving the many economic and political issues involved. The Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with Canada, such as raising the level of <b>Flathead</b> Lake or Pend Oreille Lake, but both proposals faced strong local opposition. The Columbia River Treaty, which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944, was seen as the answer. Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the Soviet Union, which had constructed power plants on the Volga River that were larger than Grand Coulee. On , 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the Duncan, Keenleyside, Mica Dams upstream and the U.S. would build the Libby Dam in Montana. Shortly afterward, Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson, who was influential in constructing the new power plant, announced that Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding. To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined that the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs. With the possibility of international companies bidding on the project, the Soviets who had just installed a 500MW hydroelectric generator on the Yenisei River indicated their interest. To avoid the potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant, the Department of the Interior declined international bidding. The Third Powerplant was approved and its appropriation bill was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on , 1966.|$|E
