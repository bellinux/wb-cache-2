5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's <b>diary</b> is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the <b>diary</b> of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's <b>diary.</b> However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} studies {{regarding}} {{the benefit of}} incorporating learning <b>diaries</b> into learning experiences in higher education, though very little research documenting what students record when those <b>diaries</b> are unstructured. There are several arguments and counter-arguments for providing students with structure in their completion of learning <b>diaries.</b> Structure is said to limit spontaneity, while unstructured learning <b>diaries</b> {{are considered to be}} logs or <b>diaries</b> rather than reflective journals. This study presents evidence that unstructured, private learning <b>diaries</b> can assist students to become more self-aware - and aware of others - while learning together online. This research provides useful pointers for managers and designers of online learning experiences regarding the role that online learning <b>diaries</b> can play in facilitating reflection...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} kana materials {{and one of the}} oldest extant works of Japanese prose fiction is the Tosa <b>Diary</b> written by Ki no Tsurayuki in 935. It is also the oldest Japanese travel <b>diary,</b> giving an account of a return journey to Kyoto after a four-year term as prefect of Tosa Province. The <b>diary</b> consists of close to 60 poems, connected by prose sections that detail the circumstances and the inspiration for the composition of the poems. The work has been valued as a model for composition in the Japanese style. The original manuscript by Ki no Tsurayuki had been stored at Rengeō-in palace library, and later was in the possession of Ashikaga Yoshimasa, after which its trace is lost. All surviving manuscripts of the Tosa <b>Diary</b> are copies of this Rengeō-in manuscript. The oldest extant of these, by Fujiwara no Teika, dates to 1235. One year later his son, Fujiwara no Tameie, produced another copy based on the original. Both transcriptions are complete facsimiles of the original, inclusive of the text, the layout, orthographical usages, and calligraphy. They have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E

Seven-day <b>diaries</b> (or eight-day <b>diaries</b> in homes with DVRs) are mailed to homes to keep a tally of what is watched on each television set and by whom. Over {{the course of a}} sweeps period, <b>diaries</b> are mailed to a new panel of homes each week. At the end of the month, all of the viewing data from the individual weeks is aggregated.|$|R
