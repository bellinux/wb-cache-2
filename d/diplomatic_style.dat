40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses {{diplomatic relations}} between the United States and Egypt from 1945 through 1960. During these years, the massive oil reserves in the Middle East became vitally important {{to the security of}} the United States. To protect the free flow of oil, American policymakers looked to Egypt to provide the progressive, pro-Western leadership that they believed would insure stability in the region. The approach to this story is unique and could he termed a post-Cold War revision. Most diplomatic histories concerning America and the Middle East have overemphasized the Cold War context. To understand America's relationship with Egypt one must set aside the Cold War albatross and view the story from a Middle Eastern perspective. As a framework for this study. the author relied on L. Carl Brown's work on Middle Eastern international relations. Brown's theory that the Eastern Question (the period that marked the slow disintegration of the Ottoman Empire) still drives relations in the region proved invaluable in understanding the diplomatic culture of the area. Using this approach, the diplomatic relations between Egypt and America take on a new perspective. Rather than seeing everything driven by the Cold War, one can identify the long-standing interests, the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>styles.</b> and the cultural differences of each country. In a classic example of realpolitik. each side sought to manipulate the other for its own gain. Thrown together amid the struggles of the Cold War, America and Egypt found themselves uneasy allies. America looked for help in their tight against the Soviet Union, and Egypt endeavored to achieve independence for itself and for the Arab Middle East. Franklin D. Roosevelt began with high hopes in grooming Egypt as a pro-American force in the region, but his death derailed the policy. With the beginning of the Cold War, America's traditional anti-imperialist policy had to be balanced with the support of Great Britain, the big power in the region. Throughout the period, Egypt sought to become the leader of the Arab world employing policies that often conflicted with American interests. Understanding that they were a small Third World nation, Egyptian leaders sought to playoff the superpowers for their own advantage. The Truman administration eventually understood some of the finer points of Middle Eastern diplomacy but failed to coordinate their policy with that knowledge. Under the flexible guidance of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, the Eisenhower administration proved more sophisticated than the previous one but had to deal with a mort! ambitious leader in Gamal Abdel Nasser. Although, the vital oil fields had been protected, America's attempts to enlist Egypt in the struggle against Russia, to bring peace to the region, and prevent Soviet penetration failed. By the end of the 1960 s, American leaders had learned the rules of the diplomatic game and altered their policies accordingly. In between, the story reveals the complexity and regularity of the Eastern Question system and how America came to grips with it...|$|R

40|$|Ting-Toomey's (1988) face-negotiation {{theory of}} {{conflict}} predicts that choice of conflict style is {{closely associated with}} face-negotiation needs, which vary across cultures. This study investigated this prediction in a workplace setting involving status and face-concern {{with a sample of}} 163 Anglo-Australian and 133 Chinese university students who were working full or part-time. The association of type of communication (direct or cautious) according to type of face-threat (self or other) and work status (subordinate, co-worker or superior) with preferences for three conflict management styles (control, solution-oriented, non-confrontational) was examined for the two cultural groups. The results showed that: (1) as predicted by the individualist-collectivist dimension, Anglo respondents rated assertive conflict styles higher and the nonconfrontational style lower than their Chinese counterparts; (2) overall, both Anglo and Chinese respondents preferred more direct communication strategies when self-face was threatened compared with other-face threat; (3) status moderated responses to self and other-face threat for both Anglos and Chinese; (4) face-threat was related to assertive and <b>diplomatic</b> conflict <b>styles</b> for Anglos and passive and solution-oriented styles for Chinese. Support was shown for Ting-Toomey's theory; however the results indicated that, in applied settings, simple predictions based on only cultural dichotomies might have reduced power due to workplace role perceptions having some influence. The findings were discussed in relation to areas of convergence and divergence between the two cultural groups; widening the definition of "face"; and providing a more flexible model of conflict management incorporating both Eastern and Western perspectives. 30 page(s...|$|R

Foreign policy strategy of Davutoglu represents set of the interconnected theoretical (the flexible approach; consistency and systematic approach; new <b>diplomatic</b> <b>style)</b> and practical principles directed on increase of a role of the Turkish state on international scene - balance between democracy and safety; “zero of problems with neighbours”; preventive and priority peace diplomacy; multidimensional foreign policy; rhythmical diplomacy. Each of principles possesses certain properties and characteristics which have always been presented as a certain purpose which is necessary for reaching Turkey in the difficult international environment. Undoubtedly, A. Davutoglu's ideology has brought the huge contribution to activization and expansion of foreign policy of Turkey last decade. The merit of Davutoglu consists that it has cardinally changed {{the approach of the}} Turkish state to the foreign policy which was based earlier on such postulate - “the best friend of a Turk is a Turk”.

40|$|The chief aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to develop a}} clearer {{understanding}} of the factors which affect a state leadership's tendencies to behave in particular ways towards other states. It seeks to compare and contrast the effect of different security policy choices upon the Swedish and Norwegian leaders' attitudes, approach and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>style</b> towards the Soviet Union. The aim is to observe important differences and similarities in the responses to largely equivalent stimuli across a cross-section of issue areas most relevant for the Scandinavians' respective bilateral relationships with the Soviet Union. More precisely, what difference does Sweden's choice to pursue neutrality and Norway's decision to become a member of NATO make in their respective relations to a superpower. Based upon the secondary literature on alliances and neutrality, several working hypotheses which are proposed to affect Sweden's and Norway's relationship with the Soviet Union were generated: most important to a neutral power is that it be seen to pursue a credible policy of indifference in relation to the East-West Cold War; actions which may be interpreted as being partial to either side of East-West conflict will be avoided; as a neutral Sweden must defend its territorial integrity. Finally, Sweden's neutrality can also be promoted through playing the role of impartial mediator in conflict situations, advocating disarmament in international fora, and resorting to international norms and organisations in its relationship with the Soviet Union. NATO member Norway must make sure that it pursues policies which are partial to its alliance members. Much of what Norway does with respect to the Soviet Union is motivated by a desire to demonstrate NATO's credibility as a cohesive, credible deterrent force to the Soviet threat. Here, demonstrations of loyalty to alliance ideals and solidarity with alliance partners are key to understanding why Norway acts as it does in relation to the Soviet Union. Policy co-ordination and consultation between NATO members are important parts of maintaining a cohesive viable deterrent against the Soviet Union. Finally, Norway has shunned arrangements which could result in isolation from fellow NATO members in order to further insure NATO credibility and its position within the NATO organisation. The body of the thesis examines crucial bilateral issues in two time periods: 1947 - 1949 and 1987 - 1991. In 1947 - 1949 the Swedish and Norwegian decisions to participate in the Marshall Plan and general trade questions are discussed. Also examined in this period are both leaderships' reactions to the Communist coups in Eastern Europe, and Norwegian and Swedish interpretations of Finland's destiny. In the period 1987 - 1991 the Norwegian and Swedish leaderships are contrasted over their handling of the Nordic Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Proposal, border security issues, legal-maritime disputes, the Baltic recognition question, trade, environmental and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union. Finally, Swedish and Norwegian interpretations of the changing Soviet military threat are also compared and contrasted. The thesis concludes that although commitments to neutrality and alignment provide powerful explanations for why Swedish and Norwegian leaders behave in observed ways, they can only provide one such explanation. The hypotheses provided at the outset are, in the main confirmed, and help to illuminate the junctures where neutrality and alignment actually do play important roles in determining Swedish and Norwegian attitudes, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>style</b> and approach toward the Soviet Union...|$|E

Also, the article describes the main political interests that had the European empires in America and the relationship that they had with Aboriginal peoples for more of 300 years. Thanks to these factors, the modern diplomatic services in Latin America have a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>style</b> that is different from any other region of the world. The diplomatic services of Latin America have a variety of ceremonies, protocols, tactics and strategies to establish political relations with other regions of the world. But, {{from the point of view}} of European, Asian and African diplomacy these activities are usually viewed as unconventional. However, the development of the foreign affairs agencies of Latin America have been the result of bloody stories that the invaders did it only to take the control. And thanks to these facts, the diplomatic institutions in Latin America are concerned, even today, to keep in memory these events because they are a good example of what a bad diplomacy can do. For other hand, the colonial era in Latin America is a good example of very poorly managed diplomatic decision thanks to the desire of conquest of the european empires. However, in the same time, the aboriginal peoples of South America achieved some diplomatic victories, at least with the crown of Spain. In the north of America, the aboriginal peoples don't achieved the same victories and they were virtually annihilated by their inabilities to negotiate.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the groundwater controversy in U. S. -Mexican {{relations and the}} role domestic political structures are likely to play in shaping a bilateral agreement apportioning transboundary groundwater. The study shows that waterpolicy making in the United States takes a distributive form while policy making in Mexico resembles a mobilization style of policy formation. It is argued that these dissimilar national water policy systems affect the way both nations engage the other in bilateral water disputes and are relvant to ascertaining the prospects for resolving the groundwater controversy. The study surveys the relevant hydrological, historical and economic context bearing on the groundwater dispute, then examines the moles of domestic policy making in each country. It follows with an analysis of how national differences in policy making are witnessed in previous bilateral water conflicts. Water policy patterns pertaining to the United States and Mexico respectively strongly influence the making of foreing policy in this sogere. Domestic policy making affects the manner of politization, objectives sought by each nation, and the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>style</b> seen in the adjustment of bilateral water agreements. Patterns seen in previous water conflicts, it is suggested, may obtain in the groundwater case. Nevertheless, the groundwater controversy is substantially different from earlier surface water disputs. Hydrological variation between problem situations is apt to fragment political interests in the United States. Nor is there a firm basis for approaching a settlement in international law. These conditions frustrate extrapolation of past political patterns to the groundwater situation. The study concludes analyzing various methods for resolving the groundwater conflict in light of political limitations. Of these alternatives, a case by case, ad hoc approach to settling the groundwater conflict is indicated as the most feasible approach. Attainment of a fully comprehensive groundwater treaty as now envisioned by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), {{is not likely to}} be achieved. However, formal comprehensiveness can be had by conferring on IBWC comprehensive authority to seek case by case solutions...|$|E
