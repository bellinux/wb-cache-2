5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is {{brought back to the}} parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
