50|$|A {{solution}} of ferric chloride etchant {{is applied to}} the surface of the cylinder, where it eats away the copper through the carbon tissue. In the highly exposed areas, where the carbon tissue photoresist is thickest and hardest, the etchant takes a long time to eat through the <b>hard</b> <b>emulsion,</b> while in the least exposed, thinnest regions the etchant eats through the resist into the copper very quickly. Thus, in a given period of etching, the cells etched into the copper will be deepest (and thus will print the darkest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the quickest, while the cells etched into the copper will be the shallowest (and thus print the lightest) in those regions where the etchant has eaten through the slowest.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a stable}} archival form when {{properly}} processed and stored. Preservation standard microfilms use the silver halide process, creating silver images in <b>hard</b> gelatin <b>emulsion</b> on a polyester base. With appropriate storage conditions, this film {{has a life}} expectancy of 500 years. [...] Unfortunately, in tropical climates with high humidity, fungus eats the gelatin used to bind the silver halide. Thus, diazo-based systems with lower archival lives (20 years) which have polyester or epoxy surfaces are used.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effect that final {{internal}} processing temperature (63, 70 and 78 째C) and chilling storage (2 째C) exerted on the characteristics (cooking loss, purge loss, colour, Instron texture profile analysis) of high-fat (242 g kg- 1) and low-fat (100 g kg- 1) bologna sausage. High-fat sausages were harder and chewier than low-fat sausages. Lower fat contents were accompanied by a significant reduction in the cooking loss and purge loss. Binding properties were not affected (P > 0. 05) by final internal cooking temperature. In general, Hunter colour parameter a values were higher in low-fat samples subjected to a high final internal cooking temperature than in those cooked up to only 63 째C. High internal temperatures produced <b>harder</b> meat <b>emulsions,</b> an effect which was more pronounced in high- fat than in low-fat sausages. Cohesivehess and springiness of sausages was not affected (P > 0. 05) by heat treatment. There were no major variations in textural parameters as a result of chilled storage. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Emulsions are {{composed}} of two immiscible liquid phases where one phase is dispersed in the other. The large interfacial area induces thermodynamic instability and droplets tend to coalesce. Stabilizers like surfactants decrease the surface tension and thus prevent phase separation. In Pickering <b>emulsions,</b> <b>hard</b> nano- or microparticles form a protective particle layer around the droplets, leading to high stability of the respective emulsions. Soft microgel particles {{can act as a}} new class of stimuli-sensitive stabilizers due to their high affinity to liquid interfaces. Microgels are hydrophilic, crosslinked, polymeric particles that are swollen by a good solvent. Microgels containing poly-(N-isopropyl acrylamide) as main monomer are sensitive to temperature changes and the microgel collapses above a temperature of 32 째C. Additional sensitivity towards pH can be induced by using weak acidic or basic comonomers. The sensitivity of the microgels can be transferred to the respective microgel-stabilized emulsions and selective phase separation can be achieved by changing external parameters. The mechanism behind phase separation is not known thoroughly. It is thus inevitable to investigate the microgel-covered interface between oil and water. In this thesis, the microgel-covered interface is investigated in different manners with regard to the properties of microgels at interfaces and the influence of charges. On the one hand, the droplet interface is investigated directly with microscopy and scattering methods; on the other hand, flat oil-water interfaces are created as model systems to investigate the structure at the interface in more detail. The influence of charges is examined and differences between Pickering emulsions and microgel-stabilized emulsions are illustrated. Emulsion droplets are investigated with cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) that reveals the arrangement of microgels on the droplet surface. Furthermore, transmission x-ray microscopy (TXM) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are used to shed light on the protrusion of microgels into the oil phase. Flat microgel covered interfaces are examined using a special cryo-SEM setup, namely freeze-fracture shadow-casting (FreSCa) cryo-SEM, that gives information about the arrangement and protrusion height of the microgels. Furthermore, pronounced differences compared to hard particles are observed when the microgel layer is compressed in a Langmuir trough. The interfacial microgel layer is then transferred to solid substrates using the Langmuir-Blodgett method and subsequent imaging with atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals a dependence of microgel structure and size on the compression. Additional experiments of interfacial shear rheology show that the viscoelastic properties of the interface depend on the microgel charge. Thus, the viscoelasticity of the interface may be a crucial parameter governing emulsion stability...|$|R
