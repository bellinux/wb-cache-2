25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} total current {{supplied}} is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>charge</b> consumers for the reactive power losses as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that causes the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacity.|$|E

25|$|Public {{universities}} in Germany are {{funded by the}} federal states and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>charge</b> tuition fees. However, all enrolled students do {{have to pay a}} semester fee (Semesterbeitrag). This fee consists of an administrative fee for the university (only in some of the states), a fee for Studentenwerk, which is a statutory student affairs organization, a fee for the university's AStA (Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, students' government) and Studentenschaft (students' union), at many universities a fee for public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university's students' parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students). Summed up, the semester fee usually ranges between €150 and €350.|$|E
25|$|Because ETFs {{trade on}} an exchange, each {{transaction}} is generally {{subject to a}} brokerage commission. Commissions depend on the brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer. For example, a typical flat fee schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from $10 to $20, {{but it can be}} as low as $0 with discount brokers. Due to this commission cost, the amount invested has a great bearing; someone who wishes to invest $100 per month may have a significant percentage of their investment destroyed immediately, while for someone making a $200,000 investment, the commission cost may be negligible. Generally, mutual funds obtained directly from the fund company itself <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>charge</b> a brokerage fee. Thus, when low or no-cost transactions are available, ETFs become very competitive.|$|E
500|$|John Baldwin {{was born}} in Branford, Connecticut on 13 October 1799 to Joseph Baldwin and Rosanna Malley. His mother was a well-educated woman, as well as {{intensely}} religious. She attempted to become a student at Yale University, but was not allowed {{because she was a}} woman. Due to this, John resolved to make no distinction between races or sexes should he ever found a school. His father enlisted in the Continental Army during the American Revolution as a private and left as a captain. When John turned eighteen, he joined the Methodist Church. As a student at a private school, he paid his way by chopping firewood, ringing the bell, and building fires. Afterwards, he became a teacher in Fishkill, New York, Maryland, and Litchfield, Connecticut. As a teacher in Maryland, his stance on slavery, as well as black people as a whole, was revealed. A mulatto boy was sent to his school daily as a servant for his master's son. Baldwin began to teach them in common. When the student's father found out about this, he demanded Baldwin not teach him any more, to which he replied, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>charge</b> anything for teaching him" [...] and continued to teach him.|$|E

It depends on the individual mobile plan as how these numbers are charged: many plans now <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>charge</b> for 1800 but 1300 may still be charged at a high rate, or outside included calls.|$|E

2500|$|While Kenny {{observes that}} the AOH was [...] "a {{peaceful}} fraternal society", he does {{note that in}} the 1870s the Pinkerton Agency identified a correlation between the areas of AOH membership in Pennsylvania, and the corresponding areas in Ireland from which those particular Irish immigrants emigrated. The violence-prone areas of Ireland corresponded to areas {{of violence in the}} Pennsylvania coalfields. In his book Big Trouble, which traces McParland's history, writer J. Anthony Lukas has written: [...] "The WBA was run by Lancashire men adamantly opposed to violence.
