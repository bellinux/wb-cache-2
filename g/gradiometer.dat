5|$|The {{interpretation}} of Tibbers {{has changed over}} time, and in the 18th century it {{was thought to be}} a Roman fort though it was later understood to be a medieval castle. The name of the castle led to the suggestion that it derived from Tiberius Caesar, however 'Tibbers' comes from the Gaelic word 'Toibar' meaning a well. The earliest recorded excavation at Tibbers Castle took place in 1864, which recovered two coins from the reign of Edward II of England (1307–1327) and a dagger from the early 15th century. The site was surveyed in 1912 with no further archaeological investigation until the 21st century. It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937. In 2013 and 2014 the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland carried out measured and geophysical (using resistivity and a <b>gradiometer)</b> surveys at Tibbers with funding from Historic Scotland and the Castle Studies Trust.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Multichannel MEG systems measure neuromagnetic fields {{simultaneously}} at many scalp locations.

In order to study cortical activities of the human brain with MEG systems, the localization accuracy is an important figure of merit of a system. In the following, we introduce the localization results of our 40 -channel SQUID system. The difference between our system and others is that it has integrated DROS (double relaxation oscillation SQUID) planar <b>gradiometers</b> instead of axial <b>gradiometers</b> with conventional dc SQUID. The planar <b>gradiometers</b> are oriented to measure tangential components to the body surface [2].
