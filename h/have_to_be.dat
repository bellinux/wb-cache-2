40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{system that}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved {{is of the}} form Ax=b, where A R nxn is symmetric, {{positive}} definite and diagonal dominant. In addition, A is very sparse. Less than 1 % of its elements are non-zero. For larger dimensions A becomes even more sparse. No assumptions can {{be made on the}} distribution of the non-zero elements. This special class of linear equation systems <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved in a subtask of an automatic placement program for VLSI design where total interconnection length between modules <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> minimized. See [4] for more details. There were two basic requirements that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> met. First, computation time <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reduced, i. e. computations <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed in parallel. Second, the available main memory <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used efficiently in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> store large matrices. Therefore, the matrix <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distributed among...|$|R

5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
50|$|It {{was quite}} a {{struggle}} in putting up a new educational system right after the Philippine-American War. New buildings <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed; supplies, books and other instructional materials <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> procured. Pampangan native teachers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn the English language and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trained in new methods of teaching. The cooperation of parents and local government officials <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solicited also.|$|R

The {{appearance}} was largely sacrificed; the regulations concerning fire precautions duly satisfied.|$|R
50|$|Churches, factories, homes, {{and schools}} within the valley <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> knocked down or moved. Roads and rail lines <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relocated; a {{railroad}} tunnel and trestle <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built {{in order to}} relocate the Central Massachusetts Railroad, and over four thousand bodies <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dug up and moved in the local Catholic cemetery. The project brought thousands of immigrants to the area for work.|$|R

5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents.

5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, and it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers {{would be required to}} circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E

In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water delivery and filtration systems would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in place by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drained by 2035.|$|E
