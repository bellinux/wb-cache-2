25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
25|$|My own “felicitous fall” {{took place}} when I {{was working on}} a new gym for Portland State College (now University). <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> stories up, walking along {{scaffolding}} with a bucket of clip-ties in my arms when I happened to step on a plank that went only halfway between two platforms. I woke up a few moments later, sixty feet below, lying on the concrete floor. I had landed on the bucket, which cracked three ribs, but that and the hard hat I was wearing saved my life.|$|E

25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. [...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 months or so. He then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more people, I know so much more about the world, and I'm so much more relaxed than <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E

500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Margarita's {{father wanted}} her to become a {{professional}} dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, [...] "From the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> and a half … as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons." [...] She noted [...] "I didn't like it very much … but I didn't {{have the courage to}} tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood".|$|E
2500|$|During {{training}} camp {{prior to the}} start of the 2013–14 season, Colborne was again traded. [...] The Maple leafs sent him to the Calgary Flames on September 29, 2013, in exchange for a fourth round selection at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. Colborne was excited to be dealt to his hometown team and described former players Al MacInnis, Joe Nieuwendyk and Jarome Iginla as his heroes; [...] "So to have the opportunity to come back and put on the C is pretty special. I've grown up since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> or four years old wanting to play for the Flames". In his first full NHL season, Colborne played 80 games, scored 10 goals and added 18 assists.|$|E

Haye admitted he was taking [...] "a crazy step up" [...] when he fought world-ranked heavyweight Bonin at Wembley Arena. Haye said in a post fight interview [...] "If you asked me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> years old, I'd say I'm going to be the heavyweight champion of world. I never said cruiserweight. It's what I wanted to do since I can remember. I always wanted to be the main man in boxing. I want everyone to recognise I can beat every other boxer in the world.
