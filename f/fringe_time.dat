25|$|In Germany, the 1992 remake Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt, {{broadcast}} {{in the prime}} time, reached double the audience than the original ({{broadcast in}} the early <b>fringe</b> <b>time).</b> This, however, {{was not enough to}} maintain the series, so it was cancelled after one season. The remake used the exact translated scripts of the original series (which already substituted localised humour and in-jokes for incomprehensible references to American TV shows not shown in Germany, as well as some totally different jokes) and just renamed place and person names according to the new setting.|$|E
25|$|The Match Game in its {{original}} version ran on NBC's daytime lineup from 1962 until 1969. The show returned with a significantly changed format in 1973 on CBS (also in daytime) and became a major success, with an expanded panel, larger cash payouts, and emphasis on humor. The CBS series, referred to on air as Match Game 73 to start and updated every new year, ran until 1979 on CBS, at which point it moved to first-run syndication (without the year attached to the title, as Match Game) and ran for three more seasons, ending in 1982. Concurrently with the weekday run, from 1975 to 1981, a once-a-week <b>fringe</b> <b>time</b> version, Match Game PM, was also offered in syndication for airing just before prime time hours.|$|E

40|$|We have {{explored}} schemes for applying a correction for un-balanced arm fluxes to Keck Interferometer (KI) V 2 data. Through simulations of atmospheric and instrumental flux fluctuations statistics, {{we find that}} measurements of the single arm fluxes interleaved with the <b>fringe</b> measurements (5 <b>times</b> 5 sec), averaging of the single arm fluxes for the entire <b>fringe</b> acquistion <b>time</b> (120 sec) and computation of a single correction factor derived from the average fluxes works best for KI data. This measurement scheme has been implemented in the KI acquisition sequencer. We also show that applying this correction factor improves the calibration of real KI V 2 sky data, and does not harm it when the fluxes are balanced and the correction is unnecessary. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{second type}} of syndications used to fill <b>fringe</b> <b>time</b> is first-run syndication, which is any program that is {{specifically}} produced for sale into syndication markets. Quiz programs such as Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune and daytime talk or advice shows like Ricki Lake and Dr. Phil are made for syndication. The producers of these programs sell them directly to local markets around the United States and the world. When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the Prime Time Access Rule in 1971 to turn more prime time over to local stations, it created an immediate market for non-network programs.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for {{formation of a}} short exposure holographic grating is presented. The model accounts for both monomer and polymer diffusion and distinguishes between short polymer chains capable of diffusing and long polymer chains that are immobile. It is shown that the experimentally observed decrease of diffraction efficiency at higher spatial frequency can be predicted by assuming diffusion of short-chain polymers away from the bright <b>fringes.</b> The <b>time</b> evolution of the refractive index modulation after short exposure is calculated and compared with experimental results. The effects of diffusion coefficients, polymerization rates, intensity and spatial frequency of recording on the properties of weak diffraction gratings are investigated by numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Time {{averaging}} interferometry is {{an experimental}} technique widely applied {{in different areas}} of optical engineering. Typical example is an application of time averaging techniques {{for the analysis of}} fringes produced by a moiré grating formed on the surface of oscillating elastic structure. Unfortunately, time averaged moiré produces blurred images. Therefore, special digital image filtering is to be used for highlighting the pattern of <b>time</b> averaged <b>fringes.</b> Such a procedure is essential for the investigation of dynamical systems with non-harmonic motion as the produced moiré pattern is particularly blurred. This paper proposes some techniques for the sharpening of <b>fringes</b> in <b>time</b> averaged moiré patterns...|$|R

The theatre company was very successful and won many awards including the Time Out theatre award, The Perrier Pick of the <b>Fringe</b> (three <b>times)</b> and The Independent Theatre Award. Their theatre mixed a cinematic style with total theatre and created physical, dynamic and naturalistic plays. The company was very influential but disbanded in 1996 though Debbie and Mark are both very successful in their chosen creative roles and still plan to do more work in the future.|$|R
