5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a sheltered workshop at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Pathlight School {{is run by}} the Autism Resource Centre, a {{non-profit}} organisation that also offers <b>early</b> <b>intervention,</b> therapy and training for persons with autism in Singapore. The school employs 81 staff, including teachers, therapists and autism consultants, and the school board is headed by founder, ARC president and Member of Parliament Denise Phua. Operating costs of the school are paid by the Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service, while other costs, estimated at S$5 million per year, are funded through fees, donations, merchandise sales and fundraising events. Under the partnership between Pathlight School and Eden School, the two schools have a centralised admission system and share various resources; together, they form the national provision of education for children across the autism spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five {{participants}} and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia. While {{there is some evidence}} that <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) {{was conducted to}} determine whether <b>early</b> <b>interventions</b> are effective in improving attachment security and parental sensitivity. Electronic databases were searched 2002 – 2015 onwards, All RCTs delivered to mothers, fathers or carers, before their child's mean age was 36 months, via 1 : 1 support, group work or guided self-help were included. The search was restricted to English Language publications. Study Selection, data extraction and quality appraisal were independently undertaken by two authors. With regard to analysis, where appropriate, dichotomous data were pooled using the Mantel- Haenszel odds ratio method and for continuous data descriptive statistics were collected in order to calculate standardized mean differences and effect sizes. Four studies met inclusion criteria and {{were divided into two}} groups: North American & Canadian and South African based studies. Combining data from both groups indicates that <b>early</b> <b>interventions</b> improve attachment security and improves rates of disorganized attachment.

40|$|Background: Single traumatising {{events are}} {{associated}} with an elevated rate of psychological disorders {{in children and adolescents}}. To date, it remains unclear whether <b>early</b> psychological <b>interventions</b> can reduce longer term psychological maladjustment. Objective: To systematically review the literature to determine the characteristics and efficacy of <b>early</b> psychological <b>interventions</b> in children and adolescents after a single, potentially-traumatising event. Design: Systematic searches were conducted of all relevant bibliographic databases. Studies on <b>early</b> psychological <b>interventions</b> were included if the first session was conducted within 1 month of the event. Two independent observers assessed each study for eligibility, using pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rated the study’s methodological quality. A meta-analysis was conducted on the group effects between individuals allocated to intervention versus control groups. Hence, effect sizes (ES) and confidence intervals were computed as well as heterogeneity and analogue-to-the ANOVA analyses. Results: Seven studies (including four randomised controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. Depending on the specific outcome variable (e. g., dissociation, anxiety and arousal), small to large beneficial ES were noted. Although the meta-analysis revealed unexplained heterogeneity between the ES of the included studies, and although studies varied greatly with regards to their methodological quality and the interventions tested, findings suggest that <b>early</b> <b>interventions</b> should involve psycho-education, provide individual coping-skills and probably involve some kind of trauma exposure. Also, a stepped procedure that includes an initial risk screen and the provision of multiple sessions to those children at risk may be a promising strategy. Conclusions: To date, research on the effectiveness of <b>early</b> <b>interventions</b> in children after a potentially traumatising event remains scarce. However, our review suggests that <b>early</b> <b>interventions</b> may be helpful...|$|R
