5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E

5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated <b>in</b> <b>their</b> language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> use.|$|R

5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language.

According to some research, however, children are active participants <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process.

25|$|In psychology, {{qualitative}} research {{has come to}} be defined as research whose findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Qualitative research is often said to be naturalistic. That is, its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting. Two other goals attributed to {{qualitative research}} are understanding a phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience. It attempts to do this by using so-called naturalistic methods—interviewing, observation, ethnography, participant observation and focus groups. Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life. This means that the researcher is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> These methods allow the researcher to try to qualify their understanding during the research process through further probing questions. In addition, a method such as observation allows the researcher to observe people within natural settings—particularly those in public places. This has resulted in greater understanding of people's behaviours in, for example, lifts, public transport, and queues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Baltimore, MD, {{communities}} are reducing "crime and grime" and developing comprehensive strategies for community revitalization and reclamation using principles grounded in "co-production " — the coordinated efforts of residents and government agencies, who share authority {{and responsibility for}} success. In the co-production model, community organizations take a very active role in deciding when to initiate legal action to abate a nuisance situation, defining the nature and source of the problems and developing a strategy to address the problems. Solutions typically require the extensive cooperation of local government {{as a partner in}} problem solving. In this chapter, the processes and theoretical underpinnings of the co-production model of health and safety code enforcement are compared and contrasted to other service delivery models. Coproduction strategies appear to be particularly appropriate in the areas of zoning, day care, local traffic regulation, park and recreation facility maintenance, and law enforcement and public safety. Like other forms of civil remedies, co-production strategies have the potential for both abusing Crime Prevention Studies, volume 9 (1998), pp. 261 - 290262 — Anne Blumenberg et al. the power the model provides and producing positive effects throughout the community. <b>In</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Word...</b>|$|R

5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is <b>in</b> <b>their</b> immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are <b>in</b> situations where <b>their</b> <b>own</b> attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to posit a {{functional}} category for Thai classifiers and demonstrate {{the analysis of}} Thai complex nominals adopting the antisymmetry framework (Kayne 1994).

Evidence supporting their functional status includes properties of classifiers <b>in</b> forming <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> class distinct from the category of nouns, their non-modificational property by adjectives, and multiple occurrences. The underlying structure of Thai nominals is constructed in terms of the DP analysis. To derive a Thai nominal word order, it is argued that classifiers features are strong and there exist a combination of raising operations regulated by asymmetrical c-command relation (Kayne 1994) as well as feature checking (Chomsky 1995). The analysis suggests that Thai nominals possess a commonly underlying head-initial structure in which movement plays a key role in deriving the surface word order. 1...|$|R
