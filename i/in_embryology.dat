5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor. He soon began improving biology courses, which at the time were only of high school grade, to collegiate standards, and introduced new courses in vertebrate histology and embryology. He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to teach a summer course <b>in</b> <b>embryology</b> at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a serious accident in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing an artery in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete. He resigned as dean in May, 1907, although remained a faculty member. The medical students strongly objected, crediting the school's gains {{over the past few years}} largely to his efforts.|$|E
25|$|Gurwitch {{was the son}} of a Jewish provincial lawyer: {{his family}} was artistic and {{intellectual}} and he decided to study medicine only after failing to gain a place studying painting. After research in the laboratory of Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer he began to specialise <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> publishing his first paper, on the biochemistry of gastrulation, in 1895. He graduated from Munich University in 1897, having studied under A.A. Boehm.|$|E
25|$|By {{proposing that}} the earth has a molten core, he {{anticipated}} modern geology. <b>In</b> <b>embryology,</b> he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are {{the outcome of a}} combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the life sciences and paleontology, he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, Protogaea, unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal organismic theory. In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.|$|E

25|$|Slack (2003) compares {{three groups}} that {{conducted}} biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved {{important as a}} site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G.Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, {{over a long period}} of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.|$|E
25|$|When Haeckel was {{a student}} in the 1850s he showed great {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> attending the rather unpopular lectures twice and in his notes sketched the visual aids: textbooks had few illustrations, and large format plates were used to show students how to see the tiny forms under a reflecting microscope, with the translucent tissues seen against a black background. Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages made it even more difficult to compare different species. It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all vertebrates looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic recapitulation theory that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a linear chain of being, and Karl Ernst von Baer's opposing view, stated in von Baer's laws of embryology, that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an archetype but no relation to other types or any transmutation of species. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher Albert von Kölliker, which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence. Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons.|$|E
500|$|In Great Britain, the {{philosophy}} of natural theology remained influential. William Paley's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written {{at least in part}} {{as a response to the}} transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck, Grant, and Vestiges. Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his Principles of Geology, he criticized Lamarck's theories of development. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of [...] "archetypes" [...] in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, and the controversy surrounding Vestiges, showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound.|$|E

500|$|The various {{alternatives}} to Darwinian evolution {{by natural selection}} were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope {{is a case in}} point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both <b>in</b> <b>embryology</b> and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, [...] "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop {{at the expense of the}} rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, after {{a summer}} in Germany, Huxley {{took his place}} in Oxford, where he {{developed}} a particular interest <b>in</b> <b>embryology</b> and protozoa. In the autumn term of his final year, 1908, his mother died from cancer at only 46: a terrible blow for her husband, three sons, and eight-year-old daughter Margaret. That same year he won the Newdigate Prize for his poem [...] "Holyrood". In 1909 he graduated with first class honours, and spent that July at the international gathering for the centenary of Darwin's birth, held at the University of Cambridge. Also, it was the fiftieth anniversary of {{the publication of the}} Origin of species.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "epigenetic" [...] {{has also}} been used in {{developmental}} psychology to describe psychological development {{as the result of}} an ongoing, bi-directional interchange between heredity and the environment. Interactivist ideas of development have been discussed in various forms and under various names throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. An early version was proposed, among the founding statements <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> by Karl Ernst von Baer and popularized by Ernst Haeckel. A radical epigenetic view (physiological epigenesis) was developed by Paul Wintrebert. Another variation, probabilistic epigenesis, was presented by Gilbert Gottlieb in 2003. This view encompasses all of the possible developing factors on an organism and how they not only influence the organism and each other, but how the organism also influences its own development.|$|E

2500|$|Bujor was {{eventually}} {{hired as a}} professor in the animal morphology department of the University of Iași in 1895 or 1896 (tenured 1899). In 1898–1899, together with Deodat Țăranu, he was also curator of the Medical and Naturalist Society, criticized by researcher N. A. Bogdan for their inconsistent, [...] "haphazard" [...] work at the numismatics collection. Nevertheless, in 1901 Bujor became the Society's secretary general, serving until 1905 or 1906. His research took him outside the country: with Voinov and Racoviță, he worked as a marine biologist at Banyuls-sur-Mer and at the Stazione Zoologica of Naples, returning with a rich collection of biological samples, which he donated to his faculty. In 1903, with Alexandru Popovici and Leon Cosmovici, he held a pioneering extracurricular course on parasitology. He then followed up with other such courses, <b>in</b> <b>embryology</b> and histology. From 1904, his articles promoting physical culture among the peasantry were hosted by Cultura Română, the popular pedagogy magazine, with Bujor serving as president of the Iași Society for Gymnastics, Sport and Music. His efforts in that field led to the establishment of multi-sport venues in Copou Park, and the first ever chalet on Ceahlău Massif.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{source of}} {{opposition}} to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with idealism, such as Goethe, Hegel and Lorenz Oken. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea {{in the mind of}} the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of [...] "archetypes" [...] in the divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and Gideon Mantell, Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding Vestiges, would be factors in his decision to ensure that his theory was fully supported by facts and arguments before publishing his ideas.|$|E
60|$|Thus, as {{it seems}} to me, the leading facts <b>in</b> <b>embryology,</b> which are second in {{importance}} to none in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period.

60|$|Section 42. In conclusion, {{we would}} earnestly {{recommend}} {{the student to}} see more of embryological fact than what is given him here. It is seeing and thinking, much more than reading, which will enable him to clothe the bare terms and phrases of embryology with coherent knowledge. In Howes' Atlas of Biology there is a much fuller series of figures of the frog's development than can be given here, and they are drawn by an abler hand than mine can pretend to be. There is also an Atlas d'Embryologie, by Mathias Duval, that makes the study of the fowl's development entertaining and altogether delightful. Such complete series as these are, from the nature of the case, impossible with the rabbit. Many students who take up the subject of biology do so only as an accessory to more extended work in other departments of science. To such, practical work <b>in</b> <b>embryology</b> is either altogether impossible, or only possibly to a very limited extent. The time it will consume is much greater, and the intellectual result is likely to be far less than the study of such plates as we have named.|$|E
60|$|These two principles, {{if their}} truth be admitted, will, I believe, explain all the above {{specified}} leading facts <b>in</b> <b>embryology.</b> But first {{let us look}} at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. Some authors who have written on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog, though appearing so different, are really varieties most closely allied, and have probably descended from the same wild stock; hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other: I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies, I found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference.|$|E

40|$|A {{limiting}} factor <b>in</b> every <b>embryology</b> laboratory is {{its capacity to}} grow ‘normal’ embryos. In human in vitro fertilisation (IVF), there is considerable awareness that {{the environment of the}} laboratory itself can alter the quality of the embryos produced and the industry as a whole has moved towards the implementation of auditable quality management systems. Furthermore, in some countries, such as Australia, an established quality management system is mandatory for clinical IVF practice, but such systems are less frequently found <b>in</b> other <b>embryology</b> laboratories.
