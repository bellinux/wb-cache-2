5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The <b>Eolian</b> Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised and seen full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping {{from the real world}} into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire. The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The <b>Eolian</b> Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began work}} on The <b>Eolian</b> Harp in August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. It details their future union and was inspired by {{his visit to the}} house in Clevedon that would serve as their home after their wedding. The poem is infused by the fact that Coleridge took an idealised view of his life with Fricker.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The <b>Eolian</b> Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The <b>Eolian</b> Harp was his favourite.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The <b>Eolian</b> Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The <b>Eolian</b> Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by <b>eolian</b> processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|M. mutabilis {{is known}} solely at the Ikh-Shunkht {{locality}} from the Barun Goyot Formation, {{dating from the}} Santonian to Campanian. M. rugustus is also known from the Barun Goyot Formation, which represents a sand-dune filled <b>eolian</b> environment. Compared to the Nemegt Formation, large dinosaurs are rare at Barun Goyot, where the fauna is dominated by protoceratopsids, oviraptorids, and ankylosaurids. Other types of fossil eggs from the Barun Goyot Formation include Protoceratopsidovum, Gobioolithus, Faveoloolithus, Dendroolithus, Spheroolithus, and Subtiliolithus.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} autumn 1795 {{marriage}} to Sara Fricker, Coleridge left {{their home in}} Clevedon, North Somerset. However, he felt guilt at his absence from his wife, and eventually {{went to live with}} her family at Redcliffe Hill, Bristol. As he completed The <b>Eolian</b> Harp—composed to commemorate his return to Clevedon—Coleridge composed Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement on his absence from Clevedon and later return to be with his wife at Bristol. The poem was published in the October 1796 Monthly Magazine, under the title Reflections on Entering into Active Life. A poem Which Affects Not to be Poetry. Reflections was included in Coleridge's 28 October 1797 collection of poems and the anthologies that followed.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The <b>Eolian</b> Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and <b>eolian</b> erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaur {{footprints}} {{that were}} later attributed to C. rhodesiensis {{were discovered in}} Rhodesia in 1915. These tracks were discovered at the Nyamandhlovu Sandstones Formation, in <b>eolian</b> red sandstone that was deposited in the Late Triassic, approximately 235 to 201 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Very fine glacial sediments or {{rock flour}} is often {{picked up by}} wind blowing over the bare surface and may be {{deposited}} great distances from the original fluvial deposition site. These <b>eolian</b> loess deposits may be very deep, even hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of America. Katabatic winds can be important in this process.|$|E
25|$|Aeolian or <b>eolian</b> (depending on the parsing of æ) is {{the term}} for {{sediment}} transport by wind. This process results {{in the formation of}} ripples and sand dunes. Typically, the size of the transported sediment is fine sand (<1nbsp&mm) and smaller, because air is a fluid with low density and viscosity, and can therefore not exert very much shear on its bed.|$|E
25|$|During the Tertiary orogenic uplift, around 60 – 40 {{millions}} years ago, {{the area}} of today's Swiss Plateau was a Karst plateau somewhat inclined to the south. Through processes of rising and lowering that were brought by the folding of the Alps, the area was twice flooded by a sea. The corresponding sediments are distinguished as sea molasse and freshwater molasse, even though the latter consists rather of fluvial and <b>eolian</b> sediments (a kind of mainland molasse).|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{sedimentation}} occurs slowly. In a desert, for example, {{the wind}} deposits siliciclastic material (sand or silt) in some spots, or catastrophic flooding of a wadi may cause sudden deposits of {{large quantities of}} detrital material, but in most places <b>eolian</b> erosion dominates. The amount of sedimentary rock that forms is not only dependent {{on the amount of}} supplied material, but also on how well the material consolidates. Erosion removes most deposited sediment shortly after deposition.|$|E
25|$|Layered {{sedimentary}} deposits are widespread on Mars. These deposits probably {{consist of}} both sedimentary rock and poorly indurated or unconsolidated sediments. Thick sedimentary deposits {{occur in the}} interior of several canyons in Valles Marineris, within large craters in Arabia and Meridiani Planum (see Henry Crater for example), and probably comprise much of the deposits in the northern lowlands (e.g., Vastitas Borealis Formation). The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed in an area containing cross-bedded (mainly <b>eolian)</b> sandstones (Burns formation). Fluvial-deltaic deposits are present in Eberswalde Crater and elsewhere, and photogeologic evidence suggests that many craters and low lying intercrater areas in the southern highlands contain Noachian-aged lake sediments.|$|E
25|$|Biotic factors here play a {{significant}} role in physical coastal evolution, and for wildlife a variety of habitats have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, tidal creeks, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays {{a significant}} role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop micromorphological features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the <b>eolian</b> dunes is controlled by an abundance of xerophytic and halophytic plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day. The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.|$|E
25|$|Further to the east, {{the canyon}} system runs into Coprates Chasma, {{which is very}} similar to Ius and Tithonium chasmata. Coprates differs from Ius in the eastern end which {{contains}} alluvial deposits and <b>eolian</b> material and like Ius, has layered deposits, although the deposits in the Coprates Chasma are much more well defined. These deposits pre-date the Valles Marineris system, suggesting erosion and sedimentary processes later cut by the Valles Marineris system. Newer data from Mars Global Surveyor suggest that the origin of this layering is either just a succession of landslides, one over another, volcanic in origin, or it may be the bottom of a basin of either liquid or solid water ice suggesting that the peripheral canyons of the Valles Marineris system could have been at one time isolated lakes formed from erosional collapse. Another possible source of the layered deposits could be wind-blown, but the diversity of the layers suggests that this material is not dominant. Note that only the upper layers are thin, while the bottom layers are very big, suggesting that the lower layers were composed of mass wasted rock and the upper layers come from another source. Some of this layering may have been transferred to the floor by landslides in which the layers are kept semi-intact, yet the layered section looks highly deformed with thickening and thinning beds that have multitudes of folds in them as seen in MOC image #8405. This complex terrain could also be just eroded sediment from an ancient Martian lake-bed and appear complex because all that we have is an aerial view like a geologic map and not enough elevation data to see if the beds are horizontal.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Eolian</b> Harp {{examines}} Coleridge's {{understanding of}} nature within {{the concept of}} his [...] "One Life", an idea that came from reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole {{are connected to the}} ideas within The <b>Eolian</b> Harp that deal with the nature and mans' understanding of the universe. In particular, The <b>Eolian</b> Harp express an unease with David Hartley's ideas about necessity. Within Reflections, the idea of [...] "One Life" [...] compels the narrator to abandon the sensual pleasures of the cottage and of nature in order to pursue a path of helping mankind. This Lime-Tree Bower continues the conversation poems theme of [...] "One Life" [...] by linking Coleridge's surroundings with the walk his friends went on. Although they are all separated, Coleridge connects to his distant friends by their mutual experience and appreciation of nature.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Eolian</b> Harp is a poem {{written by}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1795 and {{published}} in his 1796 poetry collection. It {{is one of the}} early conversation poems and discusses Coleridge's anticipation of a marriage with Sara Fricker along with the pleasure of conjugal love. However, The <b>Eolian</b> Harp is not a love poem and instead focuses on man's relationship with nature. The central images of the poem is an Aeolian harp, an item that represents both order and wildness in nature. Along with the harp is a series of oppositional ideas that are reconciled with each other. The <b>Eolian</b> Harp also contains a discussion on [...] "One Life", Coleridge's idea that humanity and nature are united along with his desire to try to find the divine within nature. The poem was well received for both its discussion of nature and its aesthetic qualities.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Harding {{believes}} [...] "it {{is important}} to recognize that it steps outside the idyllic but circumscribed scene of 'The <b>Eolian</b> Harp', and admits the impossibility, in a fallen world, of human self-sufficiency." [...] Oswald Doughty states that the [...] "most important additions" [...] to Coleridge's 1797 edition of poems included Reflections. Richard Holmes points out that both Reflections and The <b>Eolian</b> Harp [...] "mark a new stage in Coleridge's exploration of the sacred relations between man and nature, which gradually become more serious and impassioned as they carry increasingly theological implications behind his Romanticism." ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>Eolian</b> Harp was {{published}} in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Coleridge did not stop working on the poem after it {{was published}}. He expanded and reworked up until 1817. It deals with themes of love, sex and marriage, but is not formed in the usual manner of a love poem. In contrast to the second poem in the series, Reflections, which hints at problems with the relationship, The <b>Eolian</b> Harp [...] focuses on innocence and the poet's anticipation of his conjugal union.|$|E
500|$|Later, Oswald Doughty {{argues that}} the poem is [...] "one of his happiest poems" [...] and [...] "For once Coleridge and his {{environment}} blended into a single, harmonious idyllic mood, and the 'blank verse' poem is permeated with a rare fusion of reflective thought and sensitivity to peaceful, nature beauty". Richard Holmes simply describes The <b>Eolian</b> Harp as Coleridge's [...] "beautiful Conversation Poem". Rosemary Ashton believes that the poem [...] "shows an exact eye for natural detail combined with a sharp ear for rhythms both conversational and yet heightened into poetic form". She later declared that [...] "Only a few sonnets and 'The <b>Eolian</b> Harp' [...] display Coleridge's gift for simplicity rising, as if effortlessly, to sublimity." ...|$|E
500|$|... 20th-century {{literary}} critics often categorise eight of Coleridge's poems (The <b>Eolian</b> Harp, Reflections on having left a Place of Retirement, This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison, Frost at Midnight, Fears in Solitude, The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem, Dejection: An Ode, To William Wordsworth) as a group, usually as his [...] "conversation poems". The term was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper, {{who used the}} subtitle of The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798) to describe all eight. Harper considered these poems {{as a form of}} blank verse that is [...] "...more fluent and easy than Milton's, or any that had been written since Milton". In 2006, Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent [...] "easiness", noting that [...] "The <b>Eolian</b> Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech, employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un-symbolic and un-musical: language that lets itself be taken as 'merely talk' rather than rapturous 'song'." ...|$|E
500|$|In Coleridge's copy of Kant's Critik der reinen Vernunft, he wrote: [...] "The mind {{does not}} {{resemble}} an <b>Eolian</b> Harp, nor even a barrel-organ turned by {{a stream of}} water, conceive as many tunes mechanized in it as you like—but rather, as far as Objects are concerned, a violin, or other instrument of few strings yet vast compass, played on by a musician of Genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{many of the}} {{conversation}} poems, Frost at Midnight touches on Coleridge's idea of [...] "One Life", which connects mankind to nature and to God. Touching on themes that come up in The <b>Eolian</b> Harp, Religious Musings, and other poems, the poem produces {{the image of a}} life that the narrator's child will experience in the countryside. The boy would become a [...] "child of nature" [...] and raised free of the constraints found in philosophical systems produced by those like William Godwin.|$|E
500|$|In 1966, George Watson {{devoted a}} chapter to the poems in his {{literary}} analysis Coleridge the Poet. Although stressing that the form {{was the only}} type of poetry Coleridge created, he admitted that [...] "the name is both convenient and misleading. A conversation is an exchange; and these poems, a dozen or fewer, stretching from 'The <b>Eolian</b> Harp' [...] to 'To William Wordsworth] [...] and perhaps further, are plainly monologues. Those who met Coleridge in his later life, it is true, were inclined to find his conversation arrestingly one-sided, but this will hardly serve as an explanation {{of what is happening}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. <b>Eolian</b> {{processes}} are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as [...] "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98% thick {{continental ice sheet}} and 2% barren rock). Some of the barren rock {{is to be found}} in the so-called Dry Valleys of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong katabatic winds that even evaporate ice.|$|E
500|$|Both The <b>Eolian</b> Harp and Reflections {{deal with}} similar {{understandings}} of nature but differ in approach. By Reflections, Coleridge questions {{his right to}} simply enjoy nature. The image of nature and other themes reappears in Fear in Solitude, and the later poem even recreates the [...] "Valley of Seclusion" [...] image. Similarly, the compulsion {{to enter into the}} world and help mankind is included, but it is altered from being motivated by guilt to a warning message against a possible invasion from outside forces. As such, Fear in Solitude does not seek to leave the location to help mankind, but to stay as a protector over his family.|$|E
500|$|Reflections further {{differs from}} The <b>Eolian</b> Harp {{by looking at}} {{problems}} within Coleridge's marriage, especially when the union distracts him from the world outside of his home. The poem expresses desire for solitude and confinement and emphasises {{the difference between the}} worlds within and outside of the cottage. Overall, there is focus on the relationship of the private to the public spheres. When engaged with the outside world the narrator is separate from mankind, yet his focus is devoted to helping mankind, which contains religious and political components. The image of [...] "One Life" [...] compels him to abandon the sensual pleasures of the cottage, to pursue a path of altruism.|$|E
500|$|During the mid 20th-century, Virginia Radley states, [...] "the 'Eolian Harp' {{itself can}} be read with {{pleasure}} without a redaction of the poem for meaning. It is a poem which comes full circle from Eden to Eden" [...] and that [...] "Perhaps a poem should indeed not mean but be, and, to this point, the 'Eolian Harp' is a true poem. The images and the personalities are striking enough to deserve approval from a purely belletristic standpoint. But the poem has meaning also." [...] Following this, M. H. Abrams declared {{that the idea of}} the [...] "One Life" [...] within The <b>Eolian</b> Harp, [...] "best epitomize the Romantic constellation of joy, love, and the shared life".|$|E
500|$|After the letter, Coleridge {{returned}} to his wife who was now living with her family at Redcliffe Hill, Bristol. As he wrote The <b>Eolian</b> Harp to commemorate coming to his home at Clevedon, Coleridge composed Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement on leaving it. The poem {{was not included in}} Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems as it was probably still incomplete, but it was published in the October 1796 Monthly Magazine under the title Reflections on Entering into Active Life. A poem Which Affects Not to be Poetry. [...] Reflections was included in Coleridge's 28 October 1797 collection of poems and the collections that followed. Of his early poems, Coleridge believed that Reflections was his best.|$|E
500|$|Coconino Sandstone formed about 275million {{years ago}} as the area dried out and sand dunes made of quartz sand invaded a growing desert (see 6b in figure 1). Some Coconino fills deep mudcracks in the {{underlying}} Hermit Shale and the desert that created the Coconino lasted for 5 to 10million years. Today, the Coconino is a [...] thick golden white to cream-colored cliff-former near the canyon's rim. [...] Cross bedding patterns of the frosted, fine-grained, well-sorted and rounded quartz grains seen in its cliffs is compatible with an <b>eolian</b> environment. [...] Also fossilized are tracks from lizard-like creatures and what look like tracks from millipedes and scorpions. An unconformity marks {{the top of this}} formation.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{creates a}} series of oppositional themes with aspects of nature {{representing}} each: seduction and innocence, order and chaos. These oppositions establish tension before the poem asks {{as to how they}} can be reconciled. These images and their being reconciled are described as analogous to the effects of an Aeolian harp and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings towards nature. In terms of religion, The <b>Eolian</b> Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. His approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe. [...] However, Coleridge's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker, and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature.|$|E
500|$|Others {{agree on}} the {{strength}} of Frost at Midnight. Richard Holmes wrote in 1989 that the poem [...] "is one of the most intricately structured of all the Conversation Poems". Rosemary Ashton argued in 1997 that the poem is [...] "one of [...] most delightful conversation poems". Agreeing with this view in 2006, Adam Sisman believes that Frost at Midnight is [...] "perhaps the most beautiful of Coleridge's 'conversation poems'". Other poems in the series received praise, with George Watson, in 1966, claiming that To William Wordsworth [...] "is the last pure example that Coleridge's poetry affords of the conversation poem [...] the poem is extravagant in its very being." [...] Also, Holmes describes The <b>Eolian</b> Harp as a [...] "beautiful Conversation Poem".|$|E
