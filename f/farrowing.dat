5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive <b>farrowing</b> crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E

25|$|There were 5.36 million {{breeding}} sows in the United States as of 2016, {{out of a}} total of 50.1 million pigs. Most pregnant sows in the US are kept in gestation crates. The crates are banned in Canada, and in nine states in the US (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Rhode Island). However, <b>farrowing</b> crates, in which female breeding pigs can be kept for up to five weeks, are not banned.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} {{period in}} most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts {{a month and a}} half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour, in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals, A single male can mate with 5–10 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older sows. <b>Farrowing</b> occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 piglets, with the maximum being 10–12. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the sounder.|$|E

Darbo uždaviniai: 1. įvertinti tiriamųjų paršavedžių reprodukcinių savybių rodiklių kitimą nuo pirmo iki paskutinio apsiparšiavimo; 2. paskaičiuoti reprodukcinių savybių indeksus (R) kiekvienai paršavedei, atskirai kiekvienam apsiparšiavimui; 3. įvertinti reprodukcinių savybių indekso (R) kitimą didėjant apsiparšiavimų skaičiui. Work goal: the {{analysis}} of change of an index of reproductive characteristics of a sow depending on age. For achievement of this goal, raise the following objektives: 1) to estimate change of reproductive characteristics of investigated sows from the first to the last farrows; 2) to calculate indexes (R) reproductive characteristics for each sow, separately on everyone farrow; 3) to estimate index change (R) reproductive characteristics at number increase <b>farrow.</b> The work has been executed in 2008 in the enterprise of pigs of the Kaunas area. It was made 14 groups of sows of breed landrace. Test sows were from first to seventh <b>farrows.</b> The analysis of a reproduction and calculations of an index of a reproduction are executed on everyone <b>farrow</b> (from 1 to 7). For an estimation of efficiency and a reproduction index were analyzed the following indicators: 1. Fertility of sows, in units; 2. Quantity of piglets 21 days old, in units; 3. Weight of nest of piglets 21 days old, in kilo; 4. Quantity of piglets at weaning, in units; 5. Weight of nest of piglets at weaning, in kilo. The analysis of the sow's fertility changes, depending on the quantity of <b>farrows,</b> found that the fertility increased from the first <b>farrow.</b> The lowest fertility was at first pigs sow – 9. 93 piglets, the highest fertility was found during the fourth <b>farrow</b> – 10. 63 units or 0. 70 piglets more that the first <b>farrow.</b> From the fourth <b>farrow</b> was found the tendency of reduction of fertility, i. e. fertility of the fifth <b>farrow</b> was 0. 06 units, sixth – 0. 13 units and seventh – 0. 30 inits lower than the fourth <b>farrow.</b> Quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning, the fourth <b>farrows</b> were also the largest - accordingly on 9. 25 piglets. These indicators {{had a tendency to}} increase from the first <b>farrow,</b> and from the fourth - to decrease. Worst results were during at the seventh <b>farrows</b> time, i. e. quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning was on 7. 33 piglets, or 1. 92 piglets less that the fourth <b>farrow.</b> The analysis of the sow's milkiness (weight of nest of piglets 21 days old) changes, depending on <b>farrows,</b> found that more milkiness was a first pig sows – 54. 71 kilo. By the third <b>farrow,</b> sow milkiness was similar level, while the fourth <b>farrows</b> found a marked reduction tendency. The lowest milkiness was the seventh <b>farrow</b> sows – 39. 33 kilo, or 14. 21 kilo (p< 0, 05) less that the third <b>farrow</b> and 15. 38 kilo (p< 0, 05) less that the first. The largest weight of weaning nest was found of the third <b>farrow</b> sows – 82. 00 kilo, or 4. 14 kilo more that the first pig sow. From the third <b>farrow</b> the weight of weaning nest also had a tendency to reduction. The lowest weight of weaning nest was found of the seventh <b>farrow</b> sows – 66. 33 kilo or 15. 67 kilo less that the third <b>farrow.</b> On the basis of the average data of each <b>farrow,</b> it was calculated the index (R) of reproductive characteristics. From the first to the fourth <b>farrow</b> (except the second) the reproduction index increased. The index of reproduction of the fourth <b>farrow</b> was the highest 36. 99, or 1. 36 units more that the first <b>farrow.</b> From the fourth <b>farrow</b> the reproduction index decreased. By the seventh <b>farrow,</b> it was lowest – 31. 17, or 5. 82 units less that the fourth <b>farrow</b> and 4. 46 units less that the first <b>farrow.</b> On the basis on the received results it is possible to do following conclusions: 1. Fertility of sows of the fourth <b>farrow,</b> quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning was the highest: accordingly 0. 70; 0. 39 and 0. 46 piglets more that the first <b>farrow.</b> 2. The largest weight of weaning nest was found of the third <b>farrow</b> sows – 82. 00 kilo, or 4. 14 kilo more that the first pig sow. 3. Value of an index of reproductive in regular intervals reflected changes of indicators of each farrow: more the best signs of value having <b>farrows</b> have been estimated by the best index of a reproduction – 36. 99 of the fourth <b>farrow</b> sows. 4. The index of reproductive, as the main of reproductive characteristics rates, increased until the fourth <b>farrow,</b> and then began to steady decreased. Also it is possible to present such offers: 1. Based on the regularity of change of indications of reproductive characteristics, in a prominent decrease in the level of the fifth <b>farrow,</b> advisable in the pig enterprises, in the reproductive sector sows kept up to the fifth <b>farrow.</b> 2.
