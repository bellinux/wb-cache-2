25|$|Each logical system {{comes with}} both a {{syntactic}} component, which among other things determines the notion of provability, and a semantic component, which determines the notion of logical validity. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the theorems of the system, especially {{in the context of}} first-order logic where Gödel's completeness theorem establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>settings,</b> such as linear logic, the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.|$|E
25|$|In August 2002, the Cherokee Nation {{conducted}} a survey of 115,026 Cherokee citizens who live within the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Their aim was to evaluate {{the status of the}} language. Of those surveyed, 91% reported that they at least heard the language being used in the public domain; 18% heard the language used in hospitals, 14% reported hearing it at church, 12% used/heard the language at home, 9% heard it in stores, 8% heard it at work, 7% heard it at school, 7% heard it on grounds, 6% heard it in courts, and 8% heard it <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>settings.</b> In the home, Cherokee was only used by 17% of survey respondents; the overwhelming majority spoke only English in the home setting. 18% of the surveyed persons spoke Cherokee as a first language, and 5% had learned Cherokee and English jointly as primary languages. At the beginning of the 20th century, 75% of Cherokee citizens are believed to have been raised bilingually in Cherokee and English. Today, only about 5% or less are raised in Cherokee-speaking homes. Many speakers, perhaps the majority, are over fifty years of age. Another 2002 survey indicated that the Cherokee language was very close to extinction, as few people younger than the grandparental generation were found who were fluent in the language. Usually, older adults are the final speakers of a language. If they do not pass it along to their descendants, the language will be lost. Thus, the 2002 estimate for the lifespan of the language was only about 30–40 years. The Cherokee language in North Carolina was found to be particularly imperiled, with perhaps fewer than 1,000 remaining speakers and elderly speakers dying off far more quickly than new speakers were emerging. From such surveys the Cherokee Nation also learned that most of its members believed preservation of Cherokee culture and language for future generations is essential.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{from the}} moment Casablanca became a hit, talk began of {{producing}} a sequel. One titled Brazzaville (in the final scene, Renault recommends fleeing to that Free French-held city) was planned, but never produced.

500|$|As the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi {{moved closer}} towards {{the form that}} he would {{identify}} in due course as the seconda pratica. Claude V. Palisca quotes the madrigal Ohimè, se tanto amate, published in the fourth book but written before 1600 – it is among the works attacked by Artusi – as a typical example of the composer's developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice {{in the use of}} dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as échappé. Monteverdi's daring use of this device is, says Palisca, [...] "like a forbidden pleasure". In this and <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>settings</b> the poet's images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.|$|E

500|$|Other psychoanalytic {{researchers}} {{describe a}} more nuanced, and less universally positive, view of delayed gratification. David C. Funder and Jack Block theorized that a person's tendency to delay, or not delay, gratification {{is just one}} element of a broader construct called ego control, defined as a person's ability to modulate or control impulses. Ego control [...] "ranges from ego undercontrol at one end to ego overcontrol at the other", according to Funder. These tendencies {{are thought to be}} relatively stable in each individual, such that someone who tends toward undercontrol will [...] "grab whatever rewards are immediately available even at the cost of long-term gain" [...] and someone who tends toward overcontrol will [...] "delay or even forgo pleasures even when they can be had without cost". By this view, delay of gratification may be adaptive in certain settings, but inappropriate or even costly <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>settings.</b>|$|E

The misappropriation of coastal Pacific Northwest culture by the art and tourist trinket market has resulted in production of cheap imitations of totem poles executed {{with little or no}} knowledge of their complex stylistic conventions or cultural significance.

2500|$|Starting {{in early}} 2003, the United States {{government}} quietly started vaccinating 500,000 volunteer health care professionals, throughout the country.

2500|$|CPOE {{presents}} {{several possible}} dangers by introducing {{new types of}} errors. Automation causes {{a false sense of}} security, a misconception that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided. These factors contributed to an increased mortality rate in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh's Pediatric ICU when a CPOE systems was introduced. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>settings,</b> shortcut or default selections can override non-standard medication regimens for elderly or underweight patients, resulting in toxic doses. Frequent alerts and warnings can interrupt work flow, causing these messages [...] to be ignored or overridden due to alert fatigue. CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the United States Pharmacopoeia. Introducing CPOE to a complex medical environment requires ongoing changes in design to cope with unique patients and care settings, close supervision of overrides caused by automatic systems, and training, testing and re-training all users.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} disorders are: decompression illness (which covers {{decompression sickness}} and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although {{some of these}} may occur <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>settings,</b> they are of particular concern during diving activities. Long term diving disorders include dysbaric osteonecrosis, which is associated with decompression sickness. These disorders are caused by breathing gas at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers may breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. Nitrox, which contains more oxygen and less nitrogen, is commonly used as a breathing gas {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness at depths to about [...] Helium may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about , because a helium–oxygen mixture (heliox) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome. More exotic mixtures such as hydreliox, a hydrogen–helium–oxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this.|$|E
