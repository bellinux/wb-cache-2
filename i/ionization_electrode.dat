The CDMS collaboration has implemented this interleaved approach for the charge and phonon readout for our germanium detectors. During a recent engineering run with negligible ambient radiation, the detectors were found to lose ionization stability more quickly than expected. This paper summarizes studies done {{in order to determine}} the underlying cause of the instability, as well as possible running modes that maintain stability without unacceptable loss of livetime. Additionally, first results are shown for the new version IZIP mask which attempts to improve the overall stability of the detectors. United States.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to design an ionization system for maximum collection efficiency. The laboratory studies were conducted to test the system and evaluate the performance of the prototypes. Two ionization systems were designed and tested in an air quality laboratory chamber. In the first system a high voltage negative <b>ionization</b> <b>electrode</b> and a neutral collector were used to charge and collect the dust from the air. Samples were obtained with the systems on and off. Samples were also obtained to compare the effectiveness of the second ionization system and an ionization system manufactured by Alpine. Two methods were used to analyze the dust concentration to evaluate the effectiveness of the systems in reducing the dust concentration. A graphical method (slope) and a mathematical method were used to evaluate the effectiveness in dust removal;The second system resulted in a significantly higher reduction of airborne dust concentration than the first. Also the study showed that the removal rate of dust particles by the ionization systems increased as the particle size increased. Also the study showed that the Alpine ionization system was much less effective in removing dust from the air than the second prototype ionization system;The study also evaluated the effect of wire sizes on electron generation of the ionization systems. The study showed that the static voltage increases as (1) the applied voltage increased, (2) the distance between the collector and discharge electrode decrease, and (3) the wire radius decreased. The study reviewed the theoretical aspects of the voltage-current relationship for corona discharge;The last part of the study reviewed the safety consideration of the high DC voltage part of the ionization system...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) is {{an important}} analytical technique with high sensitivity and selectivity. However, all known MS ionization methods are significantly hindered by ion suppression that {{is caused by the}} competition for charge between analytes of interest and other species present in the sample matrix. To approach this key problem without using chromatography and/or sample preparation which can be tedious and time consuming, a portable ionization source was developed by (i) integrating solid phase microextraction with low temperature plasma MS, (ii) characterizing the extent of internal energy deposition during the ionization using novel thermometer ions, and (c) miniaturizing the plasma power source. Solid phase microextraction is directly integrated with plasma. The SPME fiber serves: (i) to extract molecules (e. g., toxins) from their native environment (e. g., urine) and (ii) as the <b>ionization</b> <b>electrode</b> that is used to desorb and ionize molecules. The SPME fiber consists of stainless steel coated with zeolitic material. Using this method, chemical warfare agent analogues can be detected at less than 100 ppb directly in water and urine in ≤ 2 min. Due to surface polarity differences, Linde Type A coating significantly outperformed the high alumina ZSM- 5 coating of comparable thickness. Conversely, by conditioning the Linde Type A coated probe with aqueous CuSO 4, the ion abundances can be significantly increased and sample recoveries of near 100 % were obtained. The internal energy deposition upon ion formation using three different ionization, techniques, low temperature plasma (LTP), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and direct analysis in real time (DART), was investigated by use of benzylammonium thermometer ions. Varying the DART ion source parameters, such as the distance between the plasma ionization region and the capillary entrance to the mass spectrometer and the DART temperature, had a minimal impact on the “softness” of the DART ion source under these conditions. Overall, LTP can be a significantly “softer” ion source than two of the most widely used plasma based ion sources that are commercially available. The key advantage of this innovation is that analyte of interest can be directly and rapidly sampled from complex mixtures, including urine, without sample preparation or chromatography for detection by MS. This ion source should prove beneficial for portable MS applications because relatively low detection limits can be obtained without the use of additional gadgets and importantly, has softer ionization. Besides, this ion source, when square-wave alternating current is utilised, generates homogeneous microdischarge, consumes 100 × less power, and offers high ionization efficiency. Importantly, it was miniaturized using an H-bridge circuit, and when coupled with optimized transformer, it can be continuously powered for ~ 50 h by 9 V-battery (PP 3) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} an impulsive microelectrostatic precipitation technology, which uses superposition of submicrosecond high-field pulses and dc electric field. Short impulses allow the application of higher voltages to the <b>ionization</b> <b>electrodes</b> of a precipitation system without the initiation of breakdown. These higher levels of electric field generate higher ionic concentrations, resulting in more efficient charging of the airborne particles, and can potentially improve precipitation efficiency.

40|$|Observations of {{coherent}} electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves {{associated with}} a strong, magnetized double layer are presented. The double layers are produced in a weakly ionized argon plasma by applying a positive potential to an electrode plate located in the diverging magnetic field region of a cylindrical plasma column. <b>Ionization</b> within the <b>electrode</b> sheath {{is essential to the}} formation of these double layers. The resulting V-shaped potential structures have extended parallel, oblique and perpendicular (to B) electric field components.

50|$|The {{effect is}} {{generally}} believed {{to rely on}} corona discharge, which allows air molecules to become ionized near sharp points and edges. Usually, two electrodes are used with a high voltage between them, ranging from a few kilovolts and up to megavolt levels, where one electrode is small or sharp, and the other larger and smoother. The most effective distance between electrodes occurs at an electric potential gradient of about 10 kV/cm, which is just below the nominal breakdown voltage of air between two sharp points, at a current density level usually {{referred to as the}} saturated corona current condition. This creates a high field gradient around the smaller, positively charged electrode. Around this <b>electrode,</b> <b>ionization</b> occurs, that is, electrons are stripped from the atoms in the surrounding medium; they are literally pulled right off by the electrode's charge.|$|R
40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{investigating}} the pattern of breakdown in an airgap for non-uniform field. In most technical literature it has been stated in gas breakdown that in the surrounding gas, photoelectrons are produced which initiates auxiliary avalanches directed towards the stem of the main avalanche, and that the greatest multiplication in these avalanches occur along the axis of the main where the space charge field supplements the external field. Before the complete streamer formation (plasma) several breakdowns could occur before {{the breakdown of the}} main avalanche. This breakdown occurs in a definite manner due to presence of the applied field. In order to investigate the pattern of breakdown four point-plane electrodes were used. For every test a kraft paper was placed on the plate electrode and each breakdown shot from the test punches a hole on the paper. After each complete experiment with punches on the paper, circles with intervals of 5 mm where drawn until all the punches have been enclosed. From the analyses it was seen that for all point-plane electrodes the shot takes the Gaussian form of distribution within the <b>ionization</b> zone of <b>electrode</b> gap. This form of breakdown is mostly influenced by the resultant field between the external field and the space charge field {{at the head of the}} avalanche...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to use {{electrochemically}} driven pH control to develop a second generation, enzyme-based contained liquid membrane (CLM) permeator to extract CO{sub 2 } {{from a variety of}} coal-based flue gas streams more efficiently than does the CLM current design, while achieving performance coincident with DOE targets of less than 45 % Cost of electricity (COE) in 2007 and less than 20 % COE in 2012. Central to this goal the CLM would be alkaline (>pH 8) at the feed gas side and acid (<pH 6) at the permeate side. Argonne demonstrated the technical feasibility for CO{sub 2 } capture and release using Argonne's resin-wafer <b>electrode</b> <b>ionization</b> (RW-EDI) system integrated with Carbozyme's carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme. Argonne developed RW-EDI for pH controlled desalination of process streams (e. g. Patents 7, 452, 920 & 7, 306, 934). In the current work, Argonne captured CO{sub 2 } as HCO{sub 3 }{sup -} and released it as CO{sub 2 }. The goal is to both capture CO{sub 2 } from a simulated flue gas stream and release it within the DOE targets for increase in COE. Initial performance results indicate that the 2012 COE targets are achievable with the developed technology. The design is subject to patent-hold. This task was funded in an exploratory phase, so no process optimization was attempted. Argonne believes that with optimization this performance could be significantly improved...|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, Igor Kurchatov asked Petrzhak and Georgy Flyorov {{to study}} uranium fission induced by {{neutrons}} of different energy levels, following Yakov Frenkel's theory of fission. Georgy Flyorov and [...] {{had already made}} an ionization chamber to detect heavy particles. Kurchatov asked Flyorov, Nikitinskaya and Petrzhak to increase {{the sensitivity of the}} ionization chamber. The team created a multilayer ionization chamber to detect decay products originating from the fission of uranium. The <b>ionization</b> chamber utilized <b>electrodes</b> with a total surface area of about 1000 cm2. [...] The chamber's 15 plates were covered with uranium oxide with approximate surface density of 10-20 mg/cm2. The detector compared particle activity to a background level control. When the source of neutrons was taken away, the detector still found particles. The team made three ionization chambers to prove that the effect was not an error, including a more sensitive chamber with a surface area of 6000 cm2. Despite the instrument's high sensitivity, cosmic rays were still a possible source of particle activity. The team moved to an underground lab in the Dinamo station of Moscow Metro (about 50 m below the earth surface) in an attempt to rule out the effects of cosmic rays. In May 1940, they were confident that they had discovered spontaneous fission. The certificate of discovery stated, [...] "the new type of radioactivity with mother nucleus decays into two nuclei, that have kinetic energy of about 160 MeV". Later, the discovery of spontaneous fission was confirmed by Otto Robert Frisch.|$|R
40|$|The {{ionization}} of xenon Rydberg atoms at metallic surfaces is examined. The {{data show}} that, when {{the effects of}} stray electric "patch" fields present on the surface are taken into account, ionization is well described by a simple over-the-barrier model. The patch fields are determined from direct measurements of the potential variations across the target surfaces using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Monte Carlo techniques are used to model the atom-surface interaction. The results confirm the important role that patch fields can play during Rydberg atom-surface interactions and suggest that such interactions can provide a sensitive probe of stray fields at surfaces. To demonstrate this, measurements of the threshold conditions required to observe ions resulting from surface ionization are used to estimate how large such stray fields can be. The data show that the stray fields can be sizable, as large as ∼ 10 3 V · cm - 1 100 nm from the surface and ∼ 10 V · cm - 1 500 nm from the surface, and illustrate the potential of Rydberg atoms for detecting and characterizing surface electric fields. Methods to enhance the surface <b>ionization</b> signal using <b>electrode</b> arrays patterned on a surface are investigated. Simulations show that bias voltages applied {{to a series of}} parallel wires comprised of two interleaved comb-shaped electrodes can have a dramatic impact on ion collection efficiency.
