40|$|The {{molecular}} pathogenesis of pituitary disorders {{is complex}} and has been explored in animal models and human subject studies. The endocrine (and pituitary) tumorigenesis process has particular aspects related to the dependency of the endocrine tissue on neurohormonal factors, that raise the probability of oncogene mechanisms activation and induction of DNA repairing systems that may be predisposed to errors. Thus the two theories expressing the pituitary tumorigenesis take shape: the extrapituitary hormonal stimulation and the intrinsic lesion. Both theories are important; the pituitary tumorigenesis is a multistep process, in which the initial genomic alteration modifies the cell sensitivity to various external factors. Hereditary predisposition, endocrine and hypothalamic factors and genomic mutations all {{seem to have a}} pathophysiologic role in the initiation and progression of pituitary adenomas. Before considering the relative contribution of each of these theories {{in the development of the}} pituitary tumor, it is important to note that the tumor development in the pituitary is a monoclonal process. This observation has considerable conceptual relevance and ensures the background on which all other pathophysiologic events must be integrated. Genes identified for familial pituitary tumor syndromes affect transcription (MEN 1) and <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormone</b> signaling (CNC 1, gsp). Murine gene-disruption studies (Rb, p 27, p 18) implicate cell-cycle regulatory genes, some of which have altered expression in most human pituitary tumors (p 16, p 27). Aberrant expression of PTTG, a mammalian securin homolog, can lead to chromosome missegregation, an early step in multistep pituitary tumor progression. Excess hypothalamic trophic hormones lead to pituitary hyperplasia and hormone excess, whereas alterations in <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor genes are uncommon. Symptomatic anterior pituitary tumors represent aproximately 10 % of intracranial neoplasms, and clinically inapparent “incidentalomas ” are quite common, discovered in as many as 10 to 20 % of unselected autopsies. 1 Despite pituitary tumors are usually benign adenomas, they can cause significant morbidity because of their size and/or inappropriat...|$|E

40|$|Injections of ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (oCRF) {{are known}} to {{increase}} circulating thyroid hormone levels in the chicken embryo (MEEUWIS et al., 1989). This can in part be explained by a direct effect of the <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormone</b> on the thyroid gland and/or the stimulation of the thyrotropin (TSH) release from the pituitary. We tested these two assumptions in two separate perifusion experiments. Our results clearly indicate that oCRF does not influence the in vitro thyroxine (T- 4) secretion from the thyroid. The pituitaries of the newly hatched chickens, however, released significant amounts of TSH after in vitro treatment with oCRF. Growth hormone and luteinizing hormone secretions were also elevated after the oCRF stimulation period, but this release was less pronounced compared to the TSH release. As a conclusion we postulate that oCRF mediates {{its effect on the}} thyroidal status of the chicken through stimulation of TSH release and not through a direct effect on the thyroid. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is a <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormone</b> that, like CRH, {{stimulates the}} {{pituitary}} release of ACTH, thereby activating adrenal glucocorticoid secretion. Evidence indicates that rat adrenal medulla contains a CRH-ACTH system duplicating that existing at the hypothalamo-pituitary level {{and involved in}} the paracrine stimulation of the cortex secretion. Therefore, we investigated by RIA the effect of AVP on the release of CRH and ACTH immunoreactivities (IR) by rat adrenal medulla in vitro. AVP concentration-dependently enhanced the release of both CRH-IR and ACTH-IR, and the effect was blocked by a selective antagonist of the V 1 subtype of AVP receptors. The CRH receptor antagonist alpha-helical-CRH partially reversed AVP-evoked rise in ACTH-IR release, without altering either CRH response or basal secretions of CRH and ACTH. The specific inhibitors of protein kinase C Ro 31 - 8220 and calphostin C abolished both CRH and ACTH responses to AVP. In conclusion, our present findings suggest that AVP stimulates intramedullary the CRH-ACTH system, acting via V 1 receptors and activating protein kinase C...|$|E
40|$|Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a brain <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormone</b> {{that regulates}} {{thyrotropin}} (TSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary and is ubiquitously {{distributed throughout the}} brain and other tissues including pancreas.

However, they showed obvious hypothyroidism with characteristic elevation of serum TSH level and diminished TSH biological activity. Their anterior pituitaries exhibited an apparent decrease in TSH immunopositive cells that was not due to hypothyroidism. Furthermore, this decrease could be reversed by TRH, but not thyroid hormone replacement, suggesting a direct involvement of TRH in the regulation of thyrotrophs. The TRH−/− mice also exhibited hyperglycemia, which was accompanied by impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose. These findings indicate that TRH−/− mice provide a model of exploiting tertiary hypothyroidism, and that TRH gene abnormalities cause disturbance of insulin secretion resulting in marked hyperglycemia...|$|E

40|$|Thyrotropin or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{secretion}} in {{the chicken}} is controlled by several <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormones.</b> It is stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), whereas somatostatin (SRIH) exerts an inhibitory effect. In {{order to determine the}} mechanism by which these <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormones</b> modulate chicken TSH release, we examined the cellular localization of TRH receptors (TRH-R), CRH receptors type I (CRH-R 1) and somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (SSTR 2) in the chicken pars distalis by in situ hybridization (ISH), combined with immunological staining of thyrotropes. We show that thyrotropes express TRH-Rs and SSTR 2 s, allowing a direct action of TRH and SRIH {{at the level of the}} thyrotropes. CRH-R 1 expression is virtually confined to corticotropes, suggesting that CRH-induced adrenocorticotropin release is the result of a direct stimulation of corticotropes, whereas CRH-stimulated TSH release is not directly mediated by the known chicken CRH-R 1. Possibly CRH-induced TSH secretion is mediated by a yet unknown type of CRH-R in the chicken. Alternatively, a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) -derived peptide, secreted by the corticotropes following CRH stimulation, could act as an activator of TSH secretion in a paracrine way.

40|$|A {{plethora of}} hormones {{regulate}} {{many of the}} body’s functions, including growth and development, metabolism, electrolyte balances, and reproduction. Numerous glands throughout the body produce hormones. The hypothalamus produces several releasing and inhibiting hormones that act on the pituitary gland, stimulating the release of pituitary hormones. Of the pituitary hormones, several act on other glands located in various regions of the body, whereas other pituitary hormones directly affect their target organs. Other hormone-producing glands throughout the body include the adrenal glands, which primarily produce cortisol; the gonads (i. e., ovaries and testes), which produce sex hormones; the thyroid, which produces thyroid hormone; the parathyroid, which produces parathyroid hormone; and the pancreas, which produces insulin and glucagon.

40|$|Glucocorticoid {{secretion}} {{occurs in}} a circadian pattern {{and in response to}} stress. Among the broad array of glucocorticoid actions are multiple effects in the brain, including negative feedback regulation of <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion. The negative feedback of glucocorticoids occurs on both rapid and delayed time scales, reflecting different regulatory mechanisms. While the slow glucocorticoid effects are widely held to involve regulation of gene transcription, the rapid effects are too fast to invoke genomic mechanisms. We provide a brief overview of multiple lines of evidence for membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors in the brain, with an emphasis on our recent findings of a rapid, G protein-dependent glucocorticoid action in the rat hypothalamus. We have observed a novel mechanism of rapid glucocorticoid inhibition of parvocellular neuroendocrine cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediated by the retrograde release of endocannabinoids and suppression of synaptic glutamate release. This acute glucocorticoid action may underlie the rapid inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on hypothalamic neuroendocrine function, and provides a potential model for the rapid glucocorticoid effects that occur in several areas of the brain...|$|E
