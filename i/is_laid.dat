25|$|Between 2001 and 2015 {{the company}} was {{reported}} as having multiple rounds of layoffs. In 2001, 350 employees, or 24% of total workforce, <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. Then in January 2003, 176 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off and in June 2005, 89 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. In August 2006, 30 to 40 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. In 2007 two rounds of layoffs happened, first in March 2007, 175 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off and then in December 2007, 18 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off. In July 2015, roughly 200 employees <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off {{as part of a}} restructuring measure.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of mines in Sri Lanka <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> on the Jaffna peninsula during the 1990s. Most of these <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> in dense well-structured belts by government forces, {{in the course of}} successive advances. However, mines <b>were</b> also <b>laid</b> on the peninsula by the LTTE; generally in 'nuisance minefields', where the mines <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> at random, and scattered over wide areas.|$|R
50|$|The second boat, Unseen, <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> {{down at the}} Cammell Laird {{shipyard}} at Birkenhead on 12 August 1987 {{and launched}} on 14 November 1989. Ursula <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> down on 25 August 1987 and launched on 22 February 1991 and Unicorn <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> down on 13 March 1989 and launched on 16 April 1992.|$|R
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> on the fire.|$|E
5|$|Brighton Forum {{is built}} on a high, {{prominent}} corner position, giving it good visibility from the west and south and long southward views. Knapped flint is the main building material, augmented by stone dressings and some yellow brickwork to the quoins. The roof <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> with tiles.|$|E
5|$|No nesting {{material}} {{is used in}} the breeding cavity. One white egg <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg <b>is</b> <b>laid,</b> with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.|$|E
50|$|Tonnerre <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> down in two parts. On 26 August 2003, the aft part <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> down by Arsenal de Brest at Brest and the bow part <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> down 5 May 2004 by Chantiers de Saint-Nazaire at Saint-Nazaire. The {{vessel was}} {{launched}} on 26 July 2005 and began active service in December 2006.|$|R
50|$|Eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> in {{a single}} mass over the cocoon of the female, and covered in a froth. Up to 300 eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> at a time.|$|R
25|$|The railway line <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> {{through the}} Square in 1875. The {{foundation}} stone {{for the original}} All Saints Church <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> by Louisa Snelson on 29 September 1875.|$|R
5|$|Several {{participants}} in the ceremony wear special costumes, uniforms or robes. For those in attendance (other than {{members of the royal}} family) what to wear <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> down in detail by the Earl Marshal prior to each Coronation and published in the London Gazette.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca <b>is</b> <b>laid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The palace is a two-storey {{building}} of seven bays, with three gables over alternating bays, {{two of which}} are supported by buttresses. There is an attic beneath the coped gables and surmounted by octagonal chimney stacks. The interior <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> out with a hall, solar and gallery with an undercroft. It has flagstone floors and a 16th-century stone fireplace.|$|E
50|$|The 59th Battalion Colours <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> {{up in the}} Officers' Mess and the 154th Battalion Colours <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> up in the Trinity Anglican Church, Second Street, Cornwall, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|Streets <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> out {{east and}} west, avenues <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> out running north and south. Streets {{increment}} in number as travel heads northward. Avenues increment alphabetically as travel proceeds west. The {{whole of the}} Caswell Hill community <b>is</b> also <b>laid</b> out in a grid pattern.|$|R
50|$|Adults pair up {{when they}} are breeding. The eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> in the substrate. Once the eggs <b>are</b> <b>laid,</b> the male guards and aerates the eggs until they hatch.|$|R
5|$|The site core <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> {{out around}} eight plazas. Some of the {{structures}} were restored by the United Fruit Company; most of these border Plazas 1 and 2. Structures 1 and 2 are pyramid temples. Structures 4, 6 and 10 are palace structures, long buildings with internal chambers and benches used as residences and for administrative purposes.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld <b>is</b> <b>laid,</b> the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> out {{similar to}} other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
50|$|Typically 50-100 <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> over 3 days, {{the adult}} not {{surviving}} {{to see them}} hatch. They <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> in fairly moist places, e.g. stem of grass or under moss.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{public school}} {{teachers}} in New York who <b>are</b> <b>laid</b> off <b>are</b> placed on a Preferred Eligible List for employment in the school district where they <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> off for seven years from the date of layoff. If a teacher who <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> off applies to fill a job opening, {{he or she is}} given priority over other applicants.|$|R
50|$|The town <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> out by Maxwell Woodhull on September 30, 1857. An {{addition}} <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> out in 1867, {{and another}} in 1870. That same year, the town was incorporated.|$|R
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, <b>is</b> <b>laid.</b> The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Like other U.S. states, the {{structure}} of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers as the federal government, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The structure of the state government <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> out in the Constitution of South Dakota, the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape <b>is</b> <b>laid</b> across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
