40|$|This study {{examined}} the unique contributions of masculinity and men's perceptions of the normativeness of men's and women's <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> in predicting men's self-reported <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> One hundred and forty men aged 18 - 78 were recruited from 27 unmoderated and moderated Internet listservs of potential interest to men. They completed measures on-line assessing masculinity, their perceptions of normative <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> for men and women, and 8 <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (i. e., alcohol abuse, seatbelt use, tobacco use, physical fighting, use of social support, exercise, dietary habits, and receipt of annual medical check-ups).

40|$|PurposeTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} cardiac knowledge and cardiac self-efficacy on <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> after controlling for influences from associating factors of <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> in patients with coronary artery diseases (CADs). MethodsA descriptive correlational and cross-sectional design was used. Subjects with CADs were recruited from outpatient clinics of three academic medical centers. The cardiac knowledge, cardiac self-efficacy, and <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> were measured by Coronary Heart Disease Awareness and Knowledge Questionnaire, Cardiac Self-Efficacy Scale, and Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II respectively. The data collected were statistically analyzed by descriptive statistics, t test, Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation analysis, and the hierarchical multiple regression analysis. ResultsA total of 157 subjects were recruited for this study. The mean age of subjects was 59. 38 ± 10. 04 years, and three-fourths (75. 2 %) were male. Subjects showed relatively low cardiac knowledge, moderately high cardiac self-efficacy, and moderate level of <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The overall model significantly explained 48 % of variance in <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (F = 14. 52, p <. 001).

25|$|The goal of Sher's NIH {{grant was}} to {{determine}} if improvement in a couple's interpersonal relationship would result in sustained changes in <b>health</b> <b>behavior,</b> improvement in the couple's quality of life, and health benefits specific to the cardiac patient. Working out of labs at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and Rush University Hospital, Sher's team recruited 160 participants (approximately 35% minorities, 30% women) in which one member suffered from a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, bypass graft surgery, angioplasty). Using a short term couples intervention strategy designed to optimize relationships and reduce interpersonal stress, the team focused on three areas of change: exercise, weight management, and compliance with lipid-lowering medication. These areas were targeted because of the difficulty many cardiac patients face in maintaining long-term commitments to change.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES This study {{examined}} the associations between physical activity and other <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> in {{a representative sample of}} US adolescents. METHODS In the 1990 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 11631 high school students provided information on physical activity; diet; substance use; and other negative <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Logistic regression analyses examined associations between physical activity and other <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> in a subset of 2652 high-active and 1641 low-active students. RESULTS Low activity was associated with cigarette smoking, marijuana use, lower fruit and vegetable consumption, greater television watching, failure to wear a seat belt, and low perception of academic performance. For consumption of fruit, television watching, and alcohol consumption, significant interactions were found with race/ethnicity or sex, suggesting that sociocultural factors may affect the relationships between physical activity and some <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> CONCLUSIONS Low physical activity was associated with several other negative <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> in teenagers.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of stress on irrational health beliefs and <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> among individuals 18 - 45 years old. Previous {{research has shown that}} this age group reported higher stress levels, more physical symptoms of stress, and the highest level of negative <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The theoretical frameworks were health belief model, the transactional model of stress and coping theory, and Ellis 2 ̆ 7 s concept of irrational beliefs. A survey using 3 published instruments measured the perceived stress level, irrational health beliefs, and <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> of a sample of 97 individuals aged 18 - 45. The data were quantitatively assessed using a mediation model to test a significant relationship between the predictor variable, perceived stress, and the criterion variable, <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> using the mediating variable of irrational health beliefs. Findings suggest that higher stress levels are related to <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (p ˂. 001), while stress did not make a significant contribution to irrational health beliefs (p =. 092). Moreover, findings indicated that greater irrational health beliefs are related to more negative <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (p =. 010).

40|$|Introduction: <b>Health</b> <b>behaviors</b> are {{necessary}} for preventing possible cardiac events and maintaining health for MI patients. In addition to <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> measuring clinical outcomes is a critical element for optimizing treatment and monitoring the risk factors of a cardiac event. The aims {{of this study were}} to (1) describe <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> and clinical outcomes among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in Indonesia; and (2) investigate the relationship between their <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> clinical outcomes, and other selected variables. Method: Sixty hospitalized MI patients participated in this descriptive correlational study. Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational statistics. Results: The majority of MI patients in this study had a moderate level of total <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> exercise behaviors, dietary behaviors, and stress management. Interestingly, most of the patients had a high level of medication adherence, and smoking cessation. Also, their blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI) of MI patients were at the normal level. In contrast, more than half the patients had a high level of fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol, and a low level of HDL. Moreover, nearly half of the patients presented a high level of LDL, and triglyceride. Exercise behaviors have a negative relationship with total cholesterol, and LDL. Interestingly, gender showed a positive relationship with total <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and smoking cessation. In addition, monthly incomes show a positive relationship with exercise behavior, and dietary behaviors. The number of times hospitalized appeared to have a positive relationship with systolic BP. Surprisingly, MI treatments showed a positive relationship with total <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> smoking cessation, and BP. Discussion: In conclusion, cardiac rehabilitation should involve <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> and clinical outcomes to prevent recurrent cardiac events and maintain health for MI patients.

Specifically, the effect of friends’ <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> is identified by comparing similar individuals who have the same friendship opportunities because they attend the same school and make similar friendship choices, under the assumption that the friendship choice reveals information about an individual’s unobservables. We combine this identification strategy with a cross-cohort, within school design so that the model is identified based on across grade differences in the clustering of <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> within specific friendship patterns. Finally, we use the estimated information on correlated unobservables to examine longitudinal data on the on-set of <b>health</b> <b>behaviors,</b> where the opportunity for reverse causality should be minimal. Our estimates for both behavior and on-set are very robust to bias from correlated unobservables. Peer Effects, Friendship Networks, Adolescent Health, Smoking, Drinking, Cohort Study...|$|R

This study examines the prevalence of <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> in cervical cancer survivors who have completed treatment, and associations between <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{and quality of life}} (QOL). We recruited 204 women who had completed treatment for cervical cancer to participate in a randomized counseling intervention. Participants provided information on <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption); QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervical questionnaire); and depression (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), and distress (Brief Symptom Inventory) at baseline (9 - 30 months after diagnosis) and subsequent to the intervention. Data were analyzed using multivariate general linear models. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 72 years at diagnosis (mean = 43 years), 41 % were Hispanic, and 52 % were non-Hispanic white. Three-fourths were stage 1 at diagnosis and 51 % were treated with radiation with or without chemotherapy. At baseline, 15 % of patients were current smokers, 4 % reported alcohol consumption of > 10 drinks per week, and 63 % reported exercising < 3 hours per week. Overall, 67. 4 % of cervical cancer survivors did not meet recommended national guidelines for at least 1 of these <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> QOL scores were significantly higher for patients with greater physical activity (128 vs 118; P = 0. 002) and increased with the number of recommended guidelines met (P for trend = 0. 030). Associations between patient-reported outcomes and smoking and alcohol consumption did not reach statistical significance. Participants who met guidelines for all <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> also had less depression (P = 0. 008), anxiety (P = 0. 051), and distress (P = 0. 142). Participants who improved their aggregate <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> during the 4 -month follow-up experienced a greater improvement in QOL {{than those who did not}} improve their <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (10. 8 vs 4. 5; P = 0. 026). Results indicate that two-thirds of cervical cancer survivors are not meeting national guidelines for smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption following completion of definitive treatment. These adverse <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> were associated with impaired QOL and higher levels of depression and distress.

Material & Methods A total of 2, 111 students (1, 197 males, 914 females) aged 18 and 19 years were examined. The degree of gingivitis was expressed as the percentage of bleeding on probing (%BOP). Additional information was collected via a questionnaire regarding oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> (daily frequency of tooth-brushing, use of dental floss and regular check-up). Self-efficacy was assessed using the Self-Efficacy Scale for Self-care (SESS). Path analysis was used to test pathways from self-efficacy to oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> and %BOP. Results In the final structural model, self-efficacies were related to each other, and they affected oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Good oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviors</b> reduced dental plaque and calculus, and lower levels of dental plaque and calculus resulted in lower %BOP.
