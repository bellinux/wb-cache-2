5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps.

This irregular and <b>extraordinary</b> recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E

Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as <b>extraordinary</b> as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
