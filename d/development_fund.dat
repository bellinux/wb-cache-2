This paper examines the economic effect of these regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> using {{for the first time a}} unique and recent data provided by Brazil's government. The study uses spatial panel models and different spatial scales of municipalities and micro-regions to analyse the effect of <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> on regional GDP per capita growth during 2004 - 10. The results suggest that <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> have positive impact on GDP per capita growth mainly at municipality level. Furthermore, the results indicate that different modalities of FCO, FNO, and FNE affect regional growth differently...|$|R

5|$|The first {{plans to}} {{undertake}} a major restoration of Mdina's walls were made in 2006, {{as part of a}} project that also included restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu and the Cittadella.

The multimillion-euro restoration was partially financed by the European Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Fund.</b> Works began in early 2008 by the Restoration Unit.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, many North Dakota trade centers took a {{proactive}} role in economic development by adopting local option sales taxes to generate funds to provide gap and incentive financing for primary sector businesses. The goals of these regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> are generally to create jobs, expand the tax base, and increase local economic activity. Information was gathered from {{seven of the}} regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> in North Dakota to evaluate their job creation and <b>funding</b> activities. Regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> in Dickinson, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Minot, Valley City, Wahpeton, and Williston collectively used $ 21. 9 million in support of 4, 485 jobs from 1988 through 1995. The average investment by the regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> per job supported during that period was $ 4, 900. The average employment created per business assisted was over 18 full-time jobs. The success rate for businesses assisted was about 90 percent. Factors important to cooperative economic development projects between the regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> and neighboring communities include local community support for the business project, financial participation from local bank and community, and business and civic involvement in the project. The success of the regional <b>development</b> <b>funds</b> was largely the result of strong support in the trade centers for economic development initiatives, risk minimization on business ventures, and access to and involvement with other local and state economic development resources. ...|$|R

5|$|Following summer floods of 1997 and the {{prolonged}} flooding of 1999-2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly {{funded by the}} European Union Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Fund,</b> by 30 organisations, including British Waterways, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Countryside Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board (now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, National Farmers Union, Sedgemoor, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council, Taunton Deane and Wessex Water. They aim to tackle twelve areas, which, when combined, will make {{a significant contribution to}} reducing the adverse effects of flooding. These include the conversion of arable land, adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach to controlling rainwater runoff from developed areas, dredging, raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities. Further studies of the possible beneficial effects of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken.|$|E
5|$|To get {{satisfactory}} {{conditions for}} the loan, the company was recommended by banks to increase the ownership equity to 10% of the loan. The share capital was insufficient, so the company started issuing preferred shares to individuals and the companies, and managed to secure NOK1.7 million. An exception to the rules was made, and the company was allowed to start detailed planning before the loans had been finalized. An estimate from 1966 showed that the bridge itself would cost NOK27 million, while the auxiliary roads would cost NOK4 million, excluding inflation and interest during construction. On 23 November 1966, the county council supported a proposal that {{one third of the}} construction costs be covered by national road funds. On 10 August 1967, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Norway gave permission that the company could borrow up to NOK25 million. The loan was a bond sold by Bergens Privatbank and Samvirke Forsikring, consisting of one series valued at NOK15 million issued in 1968, and one valued at NOK10 million issued in 1970, with an interest of 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. There was a five years interest-only period, followed by ten years of repayment. The mortgage deed was secured in the right to collect tolls, supported by guarantees from the municipalities of Bergen, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, and the county municipality. In addition, the company was granted loans from Bergens Privatbank, Bergens Sparebank and Vestlandsbanken for NOK3 million, although these were never used.
