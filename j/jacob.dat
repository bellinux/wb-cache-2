5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of <b>Jacob</b> from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament.

Due to the resemblance to the animal described in Genesis, the <b>Jacob</b> sheep was named for the Biblical figure of <b>Jacob</b> sometime in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1263, the {{situation}} in Bulgaria was far from stable, as Constantine was facing both the threat of his predecessor Mitso Asen's throne ambitions and a large-scale Byzantine invasion. Because Constantine was unable to assist <b>Jacob</b> against the advancing Byzantines, <b>Jacob</b> sought aid from his northern neighbour, Hungarian king Stephen V. The Hungarians drove the Byzantines out of Jacob's domain and themselves invaded Byzantine-controlled territories. Rescued from the Byzantine threat, <b>Jacob</b> Svetoslav submitted to Hungarian suzerainty. Stephen V placed him as the ruler of the Vidin province on the Danube River, previously governed for Hungary by the then-deceased Rostislav Mikhailovich, and allowed him to retain his lands to the south.
