5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was <b>Fuck,</b> he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as <b>Fuck,</b> including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep <b>Fuck</b> as its title.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fuck</b> {{opened in}} Los Angeles on August 23, 2006 and in New York on November 10. It made its Canadian debut at the 2006 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, and began regular showings at the Bloor Cinema on December 1.

5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film <b>Fuck</b> instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it <b>Fuck,</b> because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. Anderson said he intended to select interviewees {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone {{was among the first to}} confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on <b>Fuck.</b> After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on <b>Fuck,</b> it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fuck</b> It, We'll Do It Live {{received}} a generally positive reception from music critics.

The release received favorable reviews from Metal.de and MusicWaves; the latter compared the album's style to that of Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson. The Swedish-language review site Hallowed.se found the recording to be unexciting.|$|E

5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton.

The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear {{to be talking to}} each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the communication change {{potential of the}} Danish facebook site <b>Fucking</b> Flink (<b>Fucking</b> Friendly) from a social constructionist point of view. The facebook site {{is an extension of}} the campaign, <b>Fucking</b> Flink, whose aim is to inspire all Danes to become friendlier. Of all its means of communication <b>Fucking</b> Flink is primarily represented on facebook where most of its on- and offline initiatives are gathered. One of the central elements of the site is the posting of small stories centering on experiences of received and practiced friendliness submitted to <b>Fucking</b> Flink by users of the site. Our research is based on two focus group interviews consisting of respectively facebook users who have liked <b>Fucking</b> Flink’s facebook site and facebook users who haven’t, all of whom we have introduced to specifically selected material from the facebook site. By usage of Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis, we analyze our participants’ usage of intertextuality, modality and choice of words in their articulations of how they construe <b>Fucking</b> Flink’s campaign. By the same approach we analyze <b>Fucking</b> Flink’s definition of its campaign including {{what it means to be}} fucking friendly as opposed to being friendly. By comparing our analytical findings from our focus groups and selected material from the facebook site a certain degree of ambivalence seems to be predominating. Although the two focus groups differ considerably in their estimates of the necessity of a campaign preaching on the values of being friendly, they agree that the facebook site appears unclear in its overall message and poorly organized. Furthermore we apply different kinds of communication change theories in order to analyze the implication of <b>Fucking</b> Flink’s usage of facebook. In our conclusion we find that <b>Fucking</b> Flink alienates potential likers of its campaign both because of the usage of fucking in the title and because of a of lack of clarity on the facebook site, including how to construe the meaning potential of fucking friendly, which seems to be rather confusing for the potential user. More often than not the word, fucking, seems to be construed as an abuse, which are why we question <b>Fucking</b> Flink’s communication change potential in terms of attracting a whole country representing all ages instead of focusing on a more specifically defined audience...|$|R

5|$|Hopsin, {{with the}} rest of the Funk Volume artists, went on a two-month {{worldwide}} tour in late 2012, which included 58 shows in 60 days throughout the United States, Europe and Australia. From November 14 to November 23, 2013, Hopsin toured with Shady Records artist Yelawolf in promotion of Knock Madness on The <b>Fuck</b> It Tour. They toured the West Coast of the United States and Hopsin performed material from the album for the first time. The Knock Madness World Tour began on December 12, 2013 in Australia. On January 18, 2014, the tour moved to North America, starting in Santa Cruz, California. The leg of the tour ran through March 22, 2014. Dizzy Wright and DJ Hoppa joined Hopsin on select dates during the North American run of the tour.|$|E
5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E
