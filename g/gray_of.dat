In July, the numbers were dropped to a total of 7named storms, 4hurricanes, 10hurricane days, and 25days with a named tropical storm, which almost perfectly verified.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> hair as a risk marker {{among young}} smokers has a {{potential}} of identifying {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) {{at a very early}} stage. There is absence of literature that assesses premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> hair as an independent marker of CAD in smokers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present single-centre case control study enrolled a total of 62 consecutive chronic smokers (≤ 45 years) (Group I) and 60 consecutive young CAD patients (≤ 45 years) who were chronic smokers (Group II). Another group comprising of 114 patients (≤ 45 years) having no smoking history and no cardiac ailments either (Group III) was enrolled as control population. All subjects were males. A detailed history and clinical examination regarding conventional coronary risk factors and carotid intima media thickness was done in both groups. RESULTS: The carotid intima media thickness, dyslipidemia and blood pressure were significantly higher in group I and II as compared to group III. When the groups were compared for <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> hair, {{it was found that the}} group II (i. e., smokers and CAD) had maximum prevalence <b>of</b> <b>graying</b> which was significantly higher than the control as well as smoker groups. The presence <b>of</b> premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> hair was associated with 3. 24 times the risk of CAD on multiple logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The presence <b>of</b> premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> hair was associated with an increased risk of CAD in young smokers. Premature <b>graying</b> <b>of</b> hair can be used as preliminary evidence by clinicians for classifying patients at risk for premature CAD especially in smokers...|$|R

5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the gold and dust of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and <b>gray</b> <b>of</b> bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George <b>Gray</b> <b>of</b> the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's {{enduring}} {{reputation as}} chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York. Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party—silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago. For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. <b>Gray</b> <b>of</b> Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.|$|E
