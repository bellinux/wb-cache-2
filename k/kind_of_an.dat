5|$|Wanting to {{understand}} the strange light pattern, Tabetha S. Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet transiting (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 to 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orbit for one celestial object.|$|E
5|$|Most {{conventions}} {{will feature}} some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> art show, in which artists' work is displayed, often for direct purchase or auction during the convention.

Artists may also trade art between each other using sketchbooks. Erotic art is typically allowed if kept separate from other pieces, and only shown to adult attendees; a few conventions are rated strictly PG-13. Individual transactions are relatively small (usually around US$10–$50 for sketches or badges, $10–$200 for auction pieces), but the total can approach US$100,000 at the largest events (excluding professional dealers).|$|E

In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E
