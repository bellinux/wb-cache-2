Gunn {{played a}} match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his {{daughter}} died; he said of it, [...] "When I ran out, I thought, wow, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> whole stadium was with me. I never thought about packing it in." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Gunn won Norwich's Player of the Year award, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} itself {{received}} mostly unfavorable reviews, most critics praised the actingincluding Renoir's, {{and only the}} far right-wing press criticized Marcel Dalio's performance. In July 1939 a right-wing French newspaper criticized the film for portraying the Jewish Marquis married to the Austrian Christine. The Union Sacr√©e, a French clerical fascist group, organized demonstrations wherever the film was screened. Renoir was a known pacifist and supporter of the Communist Party, which made him unpopular in the tense weeks before World War II began. Years later Renoir said [...] "there was no question of contrivance; my enemies {{had nothing to do}} with its failure. At every session I attended <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> unanimous disapproval of the audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to {{the back of my head}} out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
60|$|His hat was gone, {{his eyes}} dilated with terror, {{and his face}} as bloodless {{as that of a}} corpse. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>the</b> hands which clasped my arms were quivering and shaking with emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "That has eased her, a bit," [...] Fairclough said, when Hardy rejoined him. [...] "They {{helped to}} pin her down, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> difference, as each gun went overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, {{sick with}} horror, for though I {{was in the}} mind and not in <b>the</b> body, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> as <b>the</b> mind does. Had I been in the body also, I should have fainted.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{conflict}} also {{exposed the}} division within the Labour Party between its middle-class internationalist intelligentsia (who opposed the conflict) and its patriotic working-class voters (who supported it). One Conservative MP wrote: [...] "I have lost my middle-class followers, {{but this has}} been at least balanced by backing from working-class electors who normally vote Socialist and who favour a strong line on Suez". Richard Crossman, a Labour MP, claimed that [...] "when the Labour Party leadership tried to organise demonstrations in the Provinces of the kind they'd held in Trafalgar Square, there was great reluctance among the working classes, because we were at war. It was Munich in reverse. And it was very, very acute". Another Labour MP, James Callaghan, agreed: [...] "The [...] sons of toil rallied to {{the call of the}} bugle. They reacted against us {{in the same way as}} they did against Chamberlain a few months after Munich". He also recalled that up until the fighting started [...] "we had public opinion on our side; but as soon as we actually went to war, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> change". Fellow Labour MP Barbara Castle also recalled that Labour's protest against the conflict was [...] "drowned in a wave of public jingoism". Callaghan believed that the Conservatives increased their majority at the 1959 election in part because working-class Labour voters were still angry at the party for opposing the conflict. The Labour MP Stanley Evans resigned from his seat and his membership of the party due to his support for British action in Suez.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a safety}} car {{situation}} on Lap 160 of the 2012 Daytona 500, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya's car had a suspension part failure, and it lost control on turn 3, sharply veering {{right into a}} safety truck and jet dryer trailer, causing a massive diesel/jet fuel fire. As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was [...] "I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in and checked the rear end {{and said it was}} okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going fourth gear but wasn't going that fast. Every time I got on the gas <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right." [...] The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed.|$|E
6000|$|... "That white-headed old jackal, Macumazahn, {{has given}} us the slip again. He doubled on his tracks and drove the horses down the {{hillside}} to the lower path in <b>the</b> valley. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> where <b>the</b> wheels went over the edge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It really {{happened}} because my fingers were so cold <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> bottle. Of course the cellar is not cold, but I had been outside, taking in a waggon load of bottles {{that had just}} arrived, and counting them, and my fingers got regularly numbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{stopped and}} felt the animal. He still hung by {{part of his body}} and by his forelegs {{to the floor of the}} dungeon, and by {{reaching}} out <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>the</b> rest of him extended downward. I therefore seized his body in my arms, threw myself out of the aperture, and began to slide down.|$|R

60|$|When we {{had reached}} a point some ten feet from the secret doorway I halted my companion, and cautioning him to remain {{absolutely}} motionless until I gave the prearranged signal I quickly turned {{my back to the}} door through which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> burning and baleful eyes of our would be executioner.|$|R
60|$|Oh, my childhood! I had feelings: passive as I lived, {{little as}} I spoke, cold as I looked, when I thought of past days, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel.</b> About <b>the</b> present, {{it was better}} to be stoical; about the future--such a future as mine--to be dead. And in {{catalepsy}} and a dead trance, I studiously held the quick of my nature.|$|R
60|$|When we {{had gone}} about a hundred miles and {{were just going to}} turn in at a dark doorway, a {{policeman}} suddenly stopped <b>the</b> man. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> by <b>the</b> way the man pulled at my rope and tried to hurry on that he didn't want to speak to the policeman. The more I saw of the man the more I saw how shy he was.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> heat of {{his hand}} through the sleeve of my coat. His {{condition}} was plain. A raging fever was burning out his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a relief; it's quite a {{while since}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> bridle," [...] said Curtis, turning to Prescott. [...] "How did you scare Wandle off? Be as quick as you can!" ...|$|E
60|$|My eyes fluttered, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> blood warm in my face. It was {{not that}} he had caught me in my solicitude, but that I had caught myself, and in his presence.|$|E
60|$|I did so, and {{he rubbed}} his paste on to my eyelids. At first it burnt me, then my head swam strangely. Presently this effect passed off, and my brain was {{perfectly}} clear again, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> ground with my feet. Indaba-zimbi {{led me to the}} side of the stream. Beneath us was a pool of beautifully clear water.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its launch in October 2016, Michael wrote for Taykobon that [...] "I have already sampled the iOS app, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{definitely}} <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> appeal of a service that offers weekly updates to licensed translations...There's a palpable excitement in the fandom already at the prospect of a light novel streaming service, and hopefully J-Novel Club will be able to capitalize on it." ...|$|R

60|$|Being {{bound for}} the Continent, I {{determined}} (though the chances were a hundred to one against me) {{to do all that}} <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> in my painful position, to discover the place of Oscar's retreat. The weary hours of suspense at my father's bedside would be lightened to me, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>the</b> search for the lost man was being carried on at my instigation, and that from day to day there was a bare possibility of my hearing of him, if there was no more.|$|R
60|$|Arriving at this conclusion, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> compassionately and generously towards Lucilla.

Full as my mind was of my own troubles, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still think of the danger that threatened Lucilla, and of the wrong that Oscar had suffered. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> old glow of my resolution to bring them together again, and still remember (and determine to pay) the debt I owed to Nugent Dubourg.|$|R
5000|$|Architect Charles Deaton has {{described}} his {{inspiration for the}} house: [...] "On Genesee Mountain I found a high point of land where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand and <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> great reaches of the Earth. I wanted the shape of it to sing an unencumbered song." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas! my poor friend, {{you feed}} on delusion.

6000|$|... "I wish," [...] she said, with {{something}} like a sob in her voice, [...] "it were possible that you shouldn't do this." [...] She stopped abruptly, and I {{did not look at}} her, because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> effort she was making to control herself.|$|E
6000|$|That the savages {{were keeping}} a keen watch we knew {{instantly}} Simon Kenton stepped outside the dense thicket, for {{then came the}} report of a rifle, and a bullet whistled past my head so near that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> [...] "wind" [...] of its flight.|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me....

I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help being a little different," [...] Jeanne said shyly.
