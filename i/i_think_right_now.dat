In an interview with National Review, Robert Costa wrote the following, quoting Bolton:He wants {{to be president of}} the United States, or, at the very least, a provocative contender for the Republican nomination in 2016. 'My hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe; <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> especially after two terms of President Obama, they want a president who has the know-how to lead during a crisis, a president who can defend our national interests,' he says.|$|E

And yes, she’s got what I think you could call anger issues. I wouldn’t say she’s gotten away from it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> she’s gotten {{in touch with a}} lot of pain. I think she’s been sort of quote-unquote [...] "betrayed", or at least she thinks she’s been betrayed, by {{something}} that’s very close to her, which is her family, particularly her father. And it’s a big deal to her. Which would explain her love and relationship with somebody like Leroy Jethro Gibbs...The fact that she becomes a part of this team and the fact that she’s officially an NCIS agent—as opposed to a Mossad liaison officer—is a big deal to her. But nothing really changes as far as the work. Hopefully things can begin to settle as far as her emotional stuff. Hopefully she can start to enjoy things a little bit more and maybe take a breather. But for a person like Ziva who’s been through so much, I feel like it’ll just take a little bit to adjust. In real life, a person that has gone through all that stuff, I don’t think it’s just from night to day. It’s just not gonna change that easily.|$|E

5000|$|After {{being thrown}} out by Sharon, Mariah disappears {{and it is}} soon {{revealed}} {{that she has been}} kidnapped by Ian. Ian drugs Mariah and forces her to marry him. After being rescued by Nick and Sharon, Mariah learns that Sharon, [...] "the woman she despises", is actually her biological mother, and does not handle the news well. Prior to the kidnapping, Nick tracked down the doctor (Dr. Hill) that delivered Cassie and learns that Sharon (a poor teenager at the time) was drugged after giving birth to her, and had in fact delivered twins. Helen Copeland (Karina Logue), a [...] "bitter" [...] woman who claimed to be Mariah's mother for her entire life, was the nurse present who bought the baby for Ian from Dr. Hill, who needed the money for gambling debts. Grimes explained that Mariah has had the [...] "rug pulled from out under her" [...] with this news, stating that [...] "This has been a stressful time for her. I think any change or new information at this point, or anybody's perceived happiness, will be very upsetting, because she has been through so much." [...] The actress also noted that Mariah finds herself in a state of limbo, [...] "She is wandering about, and she is not really sure what she wants. She is trying to determine if she is going to flee, because that is what she is so used to doing, or what is keeping her here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> she {{is trying to figure out}} where she belongs, and how she is going to take this next step." [...] Mariah maintains that she wants nothing to do with Sharon, but they later forge a relationship. Grimes opined: [...] "Mariah is smart and independent, but she has a lot of growing up to do. She needs to find her place in the world and reaching out to those around her—including her new family—will only help that process. I don't think Sharon and Mariah will ever stay mad at each other for too long." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Everyone {{around her}} thinks she is making bad choices and {{is making the}} wrong {{decision}} but her ideology right now is, {{even if it is}} a bad decision, let me make it. Let me deal with the consequences." [...] —Morgan's take on Kristina's decisions Along with the reality show storyline comes a new love interest for Kristina in Erik Valdez's Trey Mitchell, a grad student from Yale who convinces her to launch the Mob Princess series. According to Morgan, Kristina is very much blindsided by Trey as she is going through a time in her life where she is trying to find some stability. Coming from such an unconventional family where her parents never actually tried to be together leaves Kristina yearning for that family unit she never had with her parents. Even though Trey appears to be manipulating her, Kristina hopes the relationship will turn into something more when they marry on August 28, 2012. Kristina's need for a stable family is reflected in her concern for her sister, Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) when her marriage begins falling apart. Though Kristina has always dreamed of having that [...] "perfect family," [...] she does not see her marriage to Trey being a major deal because she expects the marriage will be over just as quickly as it began. Kristina goes through with the marriage to help Trey realize how much she really does care for him, and hopes he will reciprocate those feelings. Morgan admitted to being confused as to why she trusts Trey so much, as opposed to her family, {{especially when it comes to}} her older brother, Michael (Chad Duell). Morgan revealed in an interview Kristina still sees Michael as the overprotective big brother and since leaving college, she's been trying to assert her independence. In a November 2012 interview, Morgan gave her take on Kristina's reason for falling for Trey; besides his looks, Trey is very different from the guys she's date previously or has been interested in. When Kristina is humiliated at school thanks to everyone finding out about Sonny pulling strings to get her in, Trey is the only person who likes her for who she is. [...] "Even when he was playing her, and he obviously did play her - he was probably the person that showered her with the most attention. She took that as 'he's so together, he's interested in my life and I'm his muse, I'm in his star. That meant a lot her, especially after being with guys who never treated her that way or never really seemed to care about her." [...] When asked if Kristina could forgive Trey, Morgan explained that it is definitely a possibility and describes Trey as being the most real love interest for her character. [...] "I mean, he shot his own father to protect her in the end. So he did make the right decision in the end, but it took him a while. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> she's just so hurt by it and just so in shock. I could see if like it was 'never again, we'll be perfect together' and whatnot. But I could see her forgiving him, but knowing her it would take a while. And take lots of flowers and candy." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Harkness, {{the novel}} began as [...] "a thought experiment" [...] after {{she noticed the}} plethora of novels {{surrounding}} vampires and magic at an airport bookshop.

[...] "In some ways <b>I</b> <b>think</b> their popularity <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is about our feeling that we still want there to be magic and enchantment in the world," [...] theorises Harkness. [...] "Magic provides a way of still having room for possibilities, an unlimited sense of what the world offers. Magic is always there when science is found wanting." [...] Harkness has studied magic and the occult since 1983, which provided much of the inspiration for the novel.|$|R

5000|$|Five {{concerts in}} Asia were {{originally}} planned for March 2011. Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the shows were postponed on March 15, 2011.

In the meantime I am going to do everything I can to help relief efforts and I encourage everyone in the world to do the same." [...] After a successful run in North America, the singer extended her tour into the summer including dates in the United Kingdom and additional dates in the United States. Kesha described the extension saying, [...] "My spring tour sold out so fast, which is amazing, but I want to get to party with errryone. If you are part of my family, my cult of rowdy misfits, come join us! I’m pulling out an ass-ton more glitter with blue lipstick to spare and I’m ready to party with all y’all all summer long. Sh-'s gonna be hot as a mofo ... Miss this and you be missing the biggest dance party of the year!"The set list is mainly derived from Kesha's first album Animal, and follow-up extended play (EP) Cannibal. Besides tracks from those albums, Kesha incorporated covers of the Beastie Boys song, [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" [...] to [...] "give the show a more rock'n'roll edge." [...] She told Kevin O'Donnell of Spin, [...] "I've been on this Iggy Pop kick — he's just so inspiring to watch as a performer, ... I'm trying to do something like that, minus the heroin and the stabbing myself part." [...] The theme of the tour is [...] "to bring the planet an epic dance party ... That's my mentality with this tour — party as hard as we can and make it as infectious as possible. It's unlike anything anyone else in pop music is doing." [...] Visually, the theaters and auditoriums hosting the show will be transformed and presented as [...] "basement rave-ups". The inspiration came from her earlier life when she was growing up in Tennessee where she would attend parties. To achieve this look, the singer worked with the creative team responsible for Daft Punk's concerts. The look is described as Mad Max and [...] "intergalactic spaceship" [...] combination.|$|R
