It is very necessary to set proper <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> which has excellent filtering characteristic and wide input/output range. The inner resistance of a cell pack is very small but the system is indefinite. If the <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> is designed {{by the type of}} traditional matched filter, the flat-fading would inevitably occur. This would reduce the power transmission efficiency. This paper discussed the design philosophy of the non-matched filter and proposed a non-matched Chebyshev <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> design method aimed at the special resistive-capacitive property of the cell pack.

The theory elsewhere has been used to explain data about boundary detection and completion. textural segmentation. depth perception. color and brightness perception. and striate-prestriate cortical interactions. Neural netv{ork interactions within a multiple scale boundary contour (BC) system and feature comour (FC) system are used to explain these phenomena. Each spatial scale of the BC system comains a hierarchy of orientationally tuned interactions. which can be divided into two successive subsystems called the <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> and the CC loop. The <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> contains two successive stages of oriented receptive fields which are sensitive to different properties of image contrasts. The <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> generates inputs to the CC loop. which contains successive stages of spatially short-range competitive interactions and 'patially long-range cooperative interactions. Feedback between the competitive and cooperative stages synthesizes a coherent. multiple Scall ~ structural representation of a smoothly shaded image. called a boundary web. Such a bOUlldary web regulates multiple-scale filling-in reactions within the FC system which generate a pe:rcept of form-and-color-in-depth. Computer simulations establish key properties of a boundary web representation: nesting of boundary web reactions across spatial scales. coherent completion and regularization of boundary webs across incomplete image data. and relative insensitivity of boundary webs to illumination level and highlights. The theory clarifies data about interactions between brightness and depth percepts. transparency. influences of highlights on perceived surface glossiness. and shape-from-texture gradients.

To match {{power electronic}} systems with the mains supply, DC link converters are used. The {{first stage of}} the DC link converter is the AC/DC conversion (rectifier). The rectifier type utility interface has substantial harmonics result in poor power quality due to low power factor and high harmonic distortion. Power Factor Correction (PFC) schemes are effective methods to mitigate harmonics and address this issue. In this thesis, analyses of three approaches for high power density rectifiers are developed. In the first study, modular three phase boost rectifiers operating in DCM are coupled {{in order to increase}} the power density. Major drawback of this rectifier is the high currents ripple in both the source and the DC link sides which require large EMI filter size -could be larger than the rectifier component size- and large <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> capacitor size. This thesis proposes coupling modular three phase boost DCM rectifiers, the currents in both source and DC link sides are interleaved and consequently the currents ripple dramatically decreased results in small component size of the EMI filter and the <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> capacitor leading to high power density rectification. Also, optimization of the number of the rectifier modules to achieve maximum power density is presented. Moreover, the switching function of each rectifier employs harmonic injection technique to reduce the low order harmonics. And, the DC output voltage is varied with the load power such that the operation is at the boundary between CCM and DCM to achieve maximum power density tracking. In the Second study, a resonant three phase single switch PFC is presented to overcome the high 5 th and 7 th order current harmonics drawback in the conventional single switch three phase PFC circuits.

To attain this target, aircrafts manufactures work on the replacement of the hydraulic and bleed systems for electrical systems leading to a “More Electrical Aircraft”. However, the expected mass gain is a challenge, as previous technologies have been developed and optimized for decades. The new electrical solutions need to be look into detail to be competitive with previous technologies. All degrees of freedom must be considered, that is, new technologies and architectures. In particular, an HVDC network that reduces the number of rectifier stages seems a promising solution. From the HVDC network, the different three phase AC loads will be supplied by a series of power generic inverters. As the power consumption of the different loads change during the flight mission, the same inverter is used to supply different loads. The connection between the inverters and the loads is managed by a matrix of contactors. The proposed solution also considers redundant configurations, thus increasing system robustness. The design of the innovative system is presented in this document. That is, determining the optimal trade-off between the number of power inverters and the nominal power of each generic inverter that will also impact the size of the matrix of contactors. However, to assess the combinatory problem, the mass of the different components {{as a function of the}} nominal power needs to be calculated.

40|$|Optimization of Capacitor for Sub Sea Motor Drive ApplicationStudent: Umesh ThapaSupervisor: Prof. Lars NorumContact: Espen HauganProblem DescriptionSubsea drives {{are very}} large and {{expensive}} equipments. Normally subsea drives are encapsulated in thick walled tanks holding 1 atmosphere. As new gas fields are being discovered continually at deeper waters, this type of solution is becoming more costly. So interest in investigating the possibility of minimizing the size of electric motor drives and exposing the power electronics equipment to a high ambient pressure {{at the bottom of}} the sea had been dramatically increased. The whole power electronics will be merged in dielectric oil which has same pressure as surrounding sea water. One of the important components of an electric motor drive is capacitor. It is used to maintain good quality DC voltage and lesser ripples in DC link of the drive. It means DC link Capacitor must withstand very high pressure of 200 - 300 bar. Often it is DC link capacitors that account for a major fraction of the volume of an electric drive, weight and also cost of an inverter. Electrolytic Capacitor has been dominant in power drives in the Market because of its high capacitance. But the Capacitor is often bulky, low current handling capacity, moderate life hrs (around 10, 000 hrs) and high ESR. Electrolytic capacitors are weak and less rigid in construction to tolerate such a high pressure. An alternate could be film capacitors which normally are big in size but long life hrs (> 100000 hrs), low ESR, high current handling capacity and most important thing is it has shown tendency to tolerate a very high pressure. Now a million dollar question is, Is it really possible to find a capacitor calculation method which will reduce the capacitor size drastically compare to aluminum electrolytic capacitor? SummaryThis master thesis works mostly deal with capacitor theory and different methods to calculate the capacitance of DC link capacitor of an electric motor drive application. What are the factors those need to be considered before selecting a capacitor has been greatly highlighted. How and which factors will affect in sizing capacitors has also been discussed. Why analysis of the harmonics or ripple components of the input current and voltage of PWM inverters is very important for the <b>DC</b> <b>filter</b> specification is also discussed. Simple methods of calculating capacitor ripple current and voltage ripple to optimize capacitor is clearly shown. A simulation has been done in Mathlab to support analyzed results. This master thesis has tried to investigate a suitable capacitor which satisfies both electrical properties and mechanical properties for subsea motor drives. The Thesis also compares important electric and mechanical properties of electrolytic and film capacitors with an example. If current pulses are no more limiting factor for selecting capacitors, then voltage ripple factors will be the only parameter to be taken into consideration while selecting the capacitors. Calculation in example shows that size of film capacitors chosen is 10 times smaller than aluminum electrolytic capacitor. Pressure test of such film capacitors done by SINTEF ENERGY RESEARCH [Enabling pressure tolerant power electronic converters for subsea applications by Magnar Hernes and Riccardo Pittini] shows that film capacitors tolerate a very high pressure. Some capacitors have been subjected to a 100 bar nitrogen atmosphere pressure and others up to 300 bar pressure (passive test) in Midel® 7131. The capacitors were tested in long time stressed with full DC voltage rating and full capacitor current ripple limited by temperature. The test did not show any observerable damage. Film capacitors do cost more per uF/volume than electrolytic capacitors. But because of its high current handling capacity, long life hours, low ESR & ESL, rigid in construction; it is getting more attention in inverter application. Thesis works has shown with an example that the amount of capacitance needed for an inverter bus link capacitor design is much less for a film capacitor than an electrolytic capacitor because the film capacitor is not limited by ripple current rating like the electrolytic capacitor is. Hence the size of DC link capacitor can be drastically minimized by using film capacitors. Finally film capacitors can be considered as strong candidates in subsea electric motor drives and direct uF replacement in an electric drives...|$|E

However, the reliability of APS does have relevant impact on the reliability of the HVDC link. In this project, the {{reliability assessment}} of APS and its impact on HVDC link is performed by using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). FTA has been proved to be an efficient method for reliability assessment on a redundant and complex system. In order to show the advantage of a redundant system, a non-redundant APS system is analyzed and compared with the redundant one. This thesis work presents the construction of fault tree models for APS systems based on Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA). The models are implemented in a professional software, RiskSpectrum, which has been validated to be an appropriate tool for Fault Tree Analysis. Once the model is built...|$|R
40|$|A DC-ripple {{reinjection}} concept, {{described in}} the literature {{with reference to the}} line-commutated current source converter, is applied in this paper to the self-commutated current source converter. This is achieved by means of a reinjection converter fed, via a single-phase transformer, from the triple frequency ripple signal. It is shown that the three-phase bridge can be made to operate effectively at any multiple of the six-pulse number and, thus, presents an effective alternative to the use of AC and <b>DC</b> side <b>filter...</b>|$|R
