25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} (IUPAC name: sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate)</b> is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is a salt composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions. Sodium bicarbonate {{is a white}} solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite. It is {{a component of the}} mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs.|$|E
25|$|In a solid, {{only those}} {{particles}} {{that are at}} the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak organic acid) and sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate.</b> On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control {{the rate at which the}} fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, food enters {{the mouth and}} mechanical digestion of the food starts {{by the action of}} mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate,</b> which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be {{in the form of a}} small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.|$|E

It has a relatively high decomposition temperature of 800 °C and serves as a catalyst to the dehydration reaction of wood to increase the production of char, water and CO 2. However, the material is unable to prevent the depolymerisation reaction of wood effectively, particularly at high concentrations, and also causes the evolution of CO (Dobele et al. 2007). As such, potassium carbonate is only used in low concentrations.|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{based on}} the inversion of adsorption isotherms obtained using infrared spectroscopy has been developed. It provides a description of coexisting surface species {{in terms of their}} individual IR spectra and surface affinities in a new two dimensional, 2 D IR spectroscopic technique. When implemented with simultaneous gravimetric analysis, it further provides the quantification of adsorbed species. The adsorption of CO 2 on monoclinic ZrO 2 was investigated using this technique with temperature and pressure ranges of 353 – 673 K and 10 4 – 0. 4 bar, respectively. The sets of spectra obtained at constant temperature and variable pressures (spectroscopic isotherms) were inverted assuming they obey a generalized Langmuir isotherm. This procedure yields a 2 D map in which the IR spectra of the prominent surface species formed upon CO 2 adsorption are resolved in one dimension – <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonates,</b> bidentate carbonates and polydentate carbonates – while these species are resolved according to their surface adsorption affinities (logarithm of adsorption equilibrium constants, ln K) on the other dimension. This technique also allows for the unambiguous determination of the thermodynamic stabilities of the various adsorbed species. The inversion of the gravimetric isotherms recorded simultaneously with the infrared spectra leads to a quantitative distribution function of CO 2 adsorption sites whose components match those of the 2 D infrared map and allows for a straightforward quantification of the corresponding sites, namely (i) weakly basic sites leading to bridged <b>carbonates,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonates</b> and bidentate carbonates (B 0. 7 m mol m 2, D ads H = 70 to 90 kJ mol 1), (ii) mild basic sites leading to a second type of bidentate carbonates (B 0. 8 m mol m 2, D ads H = 110 to 120 kJ mol 1) and (iii) strong basic sites leading to polydentate carbonate species (B 0. 1 m mol m 2, D ads H o 120 kJ mol 1). Finally, the advantages and limitations of the present methodology are discussed. Because this technique is not limited to a particular spectroscopy or physical process, it should find other applications in the field of spectroscopic characterization of surfaces...|$|R

40|$|A {{sufficiently}} accurate {{understanding of}} groundwater chemistry and interactions between minerals and groundwater is of fundamental importance for performance assessment {{in connection with}} a repository for nuclear waste. Here, a model is described, which has been able to give agreement between observed and modelled values for more than ten element concentrations (including pH and pE values). The model makes use of a number of steady state waters that are mixed naturally, after which the mixtures react with minerals in the fractures. A fracture surface is represented by a distribution of minerals across the surfaces of a fracture through which water is moving. The chemistry of the groundwater appears to be mostly a consequence of chemical reactions between water and minerals at the fracture walls. This has been studied in simulations where rain has been allowed to enter a fracture. The results found in this modelling are similar to the observed values although there are significant differences. This means that the fracture filling minerals alone are not enough to explain the observed groundwater chemistry. This should not be expected, since the old waters found hundreds of meters below the surface have been able to react with other mineral sets as well.

In the geothermal water, eight radionuclides were recognized and quantified with the activity of 87 ± 5 Bq / dm 3. For the processing of this water to produce lithium carbonate and other components we propose a technological scheme, which provides a step of water purification from radio-nuclides. As a result of aeration and alkalinization, we can observe deactivation and purification of the geothermal water from mechanical impurities, iron ions, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonates</b> and organic substances. Water treatment allows recovering lithium carbonate, magnesite caustic powder and salt from geothermal water.
