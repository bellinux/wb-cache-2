2500|$|The {{southern}} gastric-brooding frog was a dull grey to slate coloured frog {{that had}} small patches, both darker and {{lighter than the}} background colouration, scattered over dorsal surface (back). The ventral surface was white or cream, occasionally with yellow blotches. The arms and legs had darker brown barring above and were yellow underneath. There was a dark stripe that ran from the eye {{to the base of}} the forelimb. The ventral surface (belly) was white with large patches of cream or pale yellow. The toes and fingers were light brown with pale brown flecking. The end of each digit had a small disc and the iris was dark brown. The skin was finely granular and the tympanum was hidden.

25|$|The Eungella National Park, {{where the}} {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog was once found, was under threat from bushfires and weed invasion. Continual fires may have destroyed or fragmented {{sections of the}} forest. The outskirts of the park are still subject to weed invasion and chytrid fungus has been located within several rainforest creeks within the park. It was thought that the declines of the northern gastric-brooding frog during 1984 and 1985 were possibly normal population fluctuations. Eight months after the initial discovery of the northern gastric-brooding frog, sick and dead Eungella torrent frogs, which cohabitat the streams with <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frogs,</b> were observed in streams in Pelion State Forest. Given the more recent {{understanding of the role}} of the amphibian disease in the decline and disappearance of amphibians, combined with the temporal and spatial pattern of the spread of the pathogen in Australia, it appears most likely that the disease was responsible for the decline and disappearance of the gastric-brooding frogs. Despite continued efforts to locate the northern gastric-brooding frog it has not been found. The last reported wild specimen was seen in the 1980s. In August 2010 a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the gastric-brooding frog.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to the Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) from which it can be {{distinguished}} by having more red on the back, pointed snout and blue-grey flanks. It is also similar to the magnificent <b>brood</b> <b>frog</b> (Pseudophryne covacevichae) from which it can be distinguished from by distribution. copper-backed <b>brood</b> <b>frog</b> (Pseudophryne raveni) the red-backed toadlet (Pseudophryne coriacea) are also similar to this species, however they can be distinguished by a larger amount of red or copper on the back and a white, not yellow arm patch.|$|R
40|$|Tesis (Doctor en Medicina de la Conservación) Darwin's frogs (Rhinoderma darwinii and R. rufum) are {{two species}} of mouth <b>brooding</b> <b>frogs</b> from Chile and Argentina, which have {{experienced}} marked population declines including in undisturbed ecosystems. Rhinoderma rufum has not been recorded since 1980. In this context amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by infection with the non-hyphal, zoosporic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been hypothesized {{to be involved in}} these enigmatic declines. Current evidence indicates the recent global spread of a panzootic strain (BdGPL) of this often-fatal pathogen via the amphibian trade. The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) in particular, has been implicated as a vector of BdGPL. Here, I present evidence on the extent of declines, current distribution, abundance and conservation status of Rhinoderma spp. and investigate whether X. laevis can act as a vector of Bd to two native amphibians of central Chile. Also, 1 describe historical and current evidence for Bd infection in Rhinoderma spp. to investigate whether chytridiomycosis is implicated in the population decline of R. darwinii and the presumed extinction of R. rufu...|$|R
2500|$|During the 1980s, {{population}} declines {{were reported}} in Australian frog species and are severe in some areas. Many of the frogs that were reported as declining were high altitude, creek dwelling species that were remote from a changing ecology. This indicated that habitat loss and degradation were not responsible for all the declines; the cause is unknown but a diseases known as chytrid fungus may be a factor. In some cases entire genera were found declining. Both species of <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> are now classified as extinct and all but two species of Taudactylus are critically endangered (Taudactylus diurnus is classified as extinct and Taudactylus liemi is classified as near threatened). Every species in the Philoria genus are currently declining [...] and some species in the [...] "Torrent Frog" [...] complex (Litoria nannotis, Litoria lorica, Litoria nyakalensis and Litoria rheocola) have not been located {{for a number of}} years. [...] three Australian species of frog are classified as extinct, 14 listed as critically endangered and 18 as endangered. Of the 14 critically endangered species 4 have not been recorded for over 15 years and may now be extinct.|$|E

40|$|Darwin’s frogs (Rhinoderma darwinii and R. rufum) are {{two species}} of mouth <b>brooding</b> <b>frogs</b> from Chile and Argentina that have {{experienced}} marked population declines. Rhinoderma rufum has not {{been found in the}} wild since 1980. We investigated historical and current evidence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection in Rhinoderma spp. to determine whether chytridiomycosis is implicated in the population declines of these species. Archived and live specimens of Rhinoderma spp., sympatric amphibians and amphibians at sites where Rhinoderma sp. had recently gone extinct were examined for Bd infection using quantitative real-time PCR. Six (0. 9 %) of 662 archived anurans tested positive for Bd (4 / 289 R. darwinii; 1 / 266 R. rufum and 1 / 107 other anurans), all of which had been collected between 1970 and 1978. An overall Bd-infection prevalence of 12. 5 % was obtained from 797 swabs taken from 369 extant individuals of R. darwinii and 428 individuals representing 18 other species of anurans found at sites with current and recent presence of the two Rhinoderma species. In extant R. darwinii, Bd-infection prevalence (1. 9 %) was significantly lower than that found in other anurans (7. 3 %). The prevalence of infection (30 %) in other amphibian species was significantly higher in sites where either Rhinoderma spp. had become extinct or was experiencing severe population declines than in sites where there had been no apparent decline (3. 0 %; x 2 = 106. 407, P, 0. 001). This is the first report of widespread Bd presence in Chile and our results are consistent with Rhinoderma spp. declines being due to Bd infection, although additional field and laboratory investigations are required t...|$|R
50|$|Both Martial and Horace {{are among}} the Latin satiric poets who made use of the fable of the frog and the ox, {{although}} they refer to different versions of it. The story related by Phaedrus has a frog motivated by envy of the ox, illustrating the moral that 'the needy man, while affecting to imitate the powerful, comes to ruin'. It is to this that Martial alludes in a short epigram (X.79) about two citizens trying to outdo each other by building in the suburbs. Horace places a different {{version of the story}} towards {{the end of a long}} conversation on the demented behaviour of mankind (Satires II.3) where Damasippus accuses the poet of trying to keep up with his rich patron Maecenas. His telling follows the Babrius version in which an ox has stepped on a <b>brood</b> of young <b>frogs</b> and the father tries equaling the beast in size when told of it.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} theories {{as to why}} frog species have declined and disappeared, a possible cause is the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis which {{has been attributed to}} the decline of 14 montane specialist frogs in undisturbed rainforest habitat. Epidemics of the chytrid fungus have also occurred in Eungella National Park in North Queensland around 1985-1986 causing the decline of the Eungella <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> Rheobatrachus vitellinus. The fungus is highly pathogenic and rapidly causes the decline and death of the host. In the case of the Eungella <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> the population was able to persist and recover however the chytrid fungus still persists in the frog population. The federal government has identified the chytrid fungus as a key threatening process for stream frogs in Australia and has subsequently developed a threat abatement plan for the disease.|$|E
50|$|Eungella National Park is {{recognised}} as one {{of eleven}} areas {{with high levels of}} frog endemism. Of the three endemic frog species endemic, two are still believed to exist today, the Eungella dayfrog and the Eungella tinker frog, while one species, the northern <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> is believed extinct. All three species are ground dwelling and their distribution is restricted to streams or areas close to streams in mid to high elevation rainforests.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> (Rheobatrachus vitellinus) {{was discovered}} in January 1984, but {{has not been seen}} since March 1985 and is believed to be extinct. It is one of only two species in the world known to brood its young in its stomach, with the mother swallowing fertilised eggs or early larval stages, before ‘giving birth’ through the mouth. Its distribution was exclusively undisturbed rainforest within Eungella National Park at altitudes of 400-1000m, before it underwent a sudden range contraction and disappeared.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1860s the Conondale {{region has}} been {{impacted}} by land clearing for agriculture, mining and logging, today {{the park is}} a refuge for many species now rare and threatened. Threatened species such as the plumed frogmouth, giant barred frog, Conondale crayfish, spotted-tailed quoll, Gympie nut and richmond birdwing butterfly have been recorded {{in the park and}} are currently targeted for conservation management to mitigate threats to their survival. Species of interest include the southern <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> which mysteriously disappeared in 1981 and is presumed extinct.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} gastric brooding {{was discovered}} in 1973 in the Conondale ranges, it displayed a unique reproductive mode in which the female would ingest the eggs which then complete their development in the mothers stomach. To survive the tadpoles secreted hormones to inhibit the digestive secretions of the stomach until they are given birth to via the mother’s mouth. The species occurred in good numbers in high altitude rocky streams but in 1979 the species declined rapidly and disappeared with no sightings since 1981 despite continued efforts to relocate the species. This coincided with the rapid disappearance of the southern dayfrog which occurred at the same location as the southern <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog,</b> {{there have also been}} no sightings of the southern dayfrog since 1979 and both species are presumed extinct.|$|E

50|$|Thirty {{one species}} of frogs {{are known to}} occur in the Conondale ranges {{including}} species of scientific interest, the endangered giant barred frog Mixophyes iteratus occurs at its northern limit. The endangered fleays barred frog Mixophyes fleayi and the vulnerable tusked frog Adelotus brevis and cascade treefrog Litoria pearsoniana have also been recorded in the park, the threatened stream frog recovery plan is currently being implemented along with monitoring of these threatened species in the park.The Conondale region has experienced recent rapid declines in frog populations; the southern <b>gastric</b> <b>brooding</b> <b>frog</b> Rheobatrachus silus which only became known to science in 1973 and the southern dayfrog Taudactylus diurnus declined rapidly between 1979 and 1981 with both presumed extinct. Four other species found in the park have also declined. There have been similar declines and disappearances of frogs in north Queensland and Central America under similar circumstances, the causes of these declines in still unknown but several hypothesis have been developed including the possible impact of chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis which has been reported in the region.|$|E

40|$|The frog species {{described}} herein {{live and}} breed in wet forest {{north of the}} Queensland-New South Wales border to Gladstone, and as far west as the Great Dividing Range. The primary habitat of these species is rain and/or wet sclerophyll forest (wet forest). Most occur only in wet forest; a handful also occur in dry forest. Dry forest /woodland species not normally found in wet forest are not included, except in the key (pages 5 - 12) and similar species sections of some species accounts. Eleven of the seventeen frog species in this booklet are rare or threatened (Queensland Nature Conservation [Wildlife] Regulation 1994). Most have suffered local declines due to loss or degradation of habitat. Five stream-breeding species however have declined for unknown reasons.
