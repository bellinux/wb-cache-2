5000|$|When an area is to {{be filled}} or backfilled the soil is placed in layers called lifts. The ability of the first fill layers to be {{properly}} compacted {{will depend on the}} condition of the natural material being covered. If unsuitable material is left in place and backfilled, it may compress over a long period {{under the weight of the}} earth fill, causing settlement cracks in the fill or in any structure supported by the fill. [...] In order to determine if the natural soil will support the first fill layers, an area can be proofrolled. Proofrolling consists of utilizing a piece heavy construction equipment (typically, heavy compaction equipment or hauling equipment) to roll across the fill site and watching for deflections to be revealed.

40|$|Velvet is {{a luxury}} cloth. Fashioned into garments, it dresses the elite. In interiors, it covers walls and upholsters furniture. Its sumptuous display denotes status, power, {{privilege}} and wealth. For the past twenty-eight years, my research and art has focused on learning its traditions and handweaving practice. Besides studying textile archives, I have more importantly visited the few remaining ateliers and have interviewed the artisans to learned about their training, methods and activities.

My research has taken me to seven countries (Italy, France, England, Japan, China, Turkey and Uzbekistan) where I have found 16 ateliers that still weave velvet. About thirty-five silk velvet weavers remain. My quest started at the Foundation Lisio in Florence, Italy where I worked with Vittorio Rettori on manual Jacquard handlooms. Other Italian ateliers are Gaggioli and Cordani in Zoagli, and Rubelli and Bevilacqua in Venice. In Lyon, France are Agnes Alauzet of the Maison des Canuts, Prelle and Tassanari et Chatel; in England, only Richard John Humphries; in Japan Kunikazu Ito and Eikichi Higuchi; in China, the Suzhou Silk Museum; in Turkey the Dokuma Fabrikasi; and in Uzbekistan, Rasuljon Mirzaahmedov and Fazlitdin Dadajonov make ikat velvet...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{differences}} in both pattern and technical features between two similar woven silk textiles {{from the collection of}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The two textiles are seventeenth century Italian woven silks. They have in common an identical brocaded pattern consisting of four floral motifs, two are large and two are small. It is {{the differences between the two}} textiles that provoke comparison, more than do their similarities. First, the ground colors are different, as are the <b>ground</b> <b>weaves.</b> Second, the individual brocaded motifs, while identical in detail, are a mirror reflection from one textile to the other. Third, the binding systems employed for the brocaded areas are different. These two textiles raise questions concerning the roles of designers and weavers, and methods for textile design in the seventeenth century. A combination of technical analysis and a discussion of the particular use of pattern and symmetry may lead to the possibility of dating the textiles more precisely, in addition to identifying more specifically the origin of production and the market for which these textiles were produced. The objects came to my attention on two separate occasions; upon seeing the second example I realized that I had seen this pattern before, in a different color. Until I studied the two objects again, the differences, other than ground color weren 2 ̆ 7 t apparent. After seeing them again, it became clear that this wasn 2 ̆ 7 t simply an example of the same textile in two different colors. This was perhaps an unusual early example of design copying...|$|R

60|$|There {{is not a}} meaner {{occupation}} for {{the human}} mind than the imitation of the stains and striæ of marble and wood. When engaged in any easy and simple mechanical occupation, {{there is still some}} liberty for the mind to leave the literal work; and the clash of the loom or the activity of the fingers will not always prevent the thoughts from some happy expatiation in their own domains. But the grainer must think of what he is doing; and veritable attention and care, and occasionally considerable skill, are consumed in the doing of a more absolute nothing than I can name in any other department of painful idleness. I know not anything so humiliating as to see a human being, with arms and limbs complete, and apparently a head, and assuredly a soul, yet into the hands of which when you have put a brush and pallet, it cannot do anything with them but imitate a piece of wood. It cannot color, it has no ideas of color; it cannot draw, it has no ideas of form; it cannot caricature, it has no ideas of humor. It is incapable of anything beyond knots.

60|$|The {{reasons for}} this are many. By day he rests {{on the ground in}} some dark bit of cover, by a brown stump that exactly matches his feathers, or in a tangle of dead leaves and brakes where it is almost {{impossible}} to see him. At such times his strange fearlessness of man helps to hide him, for he will let you pass within a few feet of him without stirring. That is partly because he sees poorly by day and perhaps does not realize how near you are, and partly because he knows that his soft colors hide him so well amidst his surroundings that you cannot see him, however near you come. This confidence of his is well placed, for once I saw a man step over a brooding woodcock on her nest in the roots of an old stump without seeing her, and she never moved so much as the tip of her long bill as he passed. In the late twilight when woodcock first stir abroad you see only a shadow passing swiftly across a bit of clear sky as Whitooweek goes off to the meadow brook to feed, or hear a rustle in the alders as he turns the dead leaves over, and a faint peeunk, like the voice of a distant night-hawk, and then you catch a glimpse of a shadow that flits along the <b>ground,</b> or a <b>weaving,</b> batlike flutter of wings as you draw near to investigate. No wonder, under such circumstances, that Whitooweek passes all his summers and raises brood upon brood of downy invisible chicks in a farmer's wood lot without ever being found out or recognized.|$|R
40|$|A mulch is any {{material}} {{applied to the}} soil surface for protection or improvement of the area covered. Mulches are frequently applied around plants to modify the soil environment and enhance plant growth. The mulch material may be organic such as bark, wood chips, leaves, pine needles, grass clippings or similar material; or inorganic such as gravel, pebbles, polyethylene film or <b>woven</b> <b>ground</b> cloth. BENEFITS OF MULCHING Mulching has the following beneficial effects upon the soil and plants. Mulches can prevent loss {{of water from the}} soil by evaporation. Moisture moves by capillary action to the surface and evaporates if the soil is not covered by a mulch. Mulches suppress weeds when the mulch material itself is weed-free and applied deeply enough to prevent weed germination or to smother existing small weeds. A more uniform soil temperature can be maintained by mulching. The mulch acts as an insulator that keeps the soil cool under intense sunlight and warm during cold weather. Mulching will prevent crusting of the soil surface, thus improving absorption and percolation of water into the soil and, at the same time, reducing erosion. Organic materials used as a mulch can improve soil structure and tilth. As mulch decays, the material becomes topsoil. Decaying mulch may also add nutrients to the soil. Mulches also add to the beauty of the landscape by providing a cover of uniform color and interesting texture to the surface. Mulched plants will produce roots in the mulch that surrounds them. These roots are produced in addition to the roots that a plant produces in the soil. As a result, mulched plants have more roots than unmulched plants...|$|R
5000|$|May Day {{takes place}} in the spring and is meant to {{celebrate}} the end of winter and the new season. The event {{is open to the public}} and involves a number of events and activities. These include a pottery sale, musical performances, cake walks, games and other entertainment for children, a grease pole with a twenty dollar bill at the top, a cow plop competition (in which the winner is the one onto whose pre-purchased field space an ushered-in cow first excretes fecal matter), and the Maypole Dance. The Maypole is a tall wooden pole buried in the ground on the center green-space and is a metaphor for the fertility of spring. Students hold colored bands originating at the top of the pole and dance around each other on the <b>ground,</b> creating a <b>weave</b> pattern of the fabric on the pole. Another tradition, the May Day Play, is a skit put on by students and faculty. Initially Queen and King Winter (played by faculty members) attempt to proclaim the predominance of winter over spring, backing up their assertions by tossing ice and icicles into the crowd. Eventually the Spring Fairy enters and proclaims that spring is nigh and that the representatives of Winter should be gone. At one point the audience is asked which they would prefer, Winter or Spring, at which point (most) everyone cheers for [...] "Spring". The Spring Fairy typically sprinkles flower petals and other plant materials on audience members as well as Queen and King Winter. They are eventually [...] "driven off" [...] and the Queen and King of Spring (played by students) are crowned to commemorate the season.|$|R
5000|$|The landscape, {{the common}} {{denominator}} of all the Gat's works, also provides the background for his nudes and still lifes. The principle informing Gat's nudes and still lifes is pantheism - the unification of all natural elements - flora, mountains, hills, people, - into a single vibrating whole. His vase with flowers, for example, painted in the 1960s, disappears into the <b>ground</b> as though <b>woven</b> into it. In the same period he painted a green nude in which one type of brushwork was used over the entire surface so that the body's contours dissolved into their surroundings. The same principle was applied to figurative paintings. Gat's nudes are characterized by a foreshortened reclining position which creates a perspective illusion of depth. The foreshortening precludes the classical aesthetic spread of the feminine curves. The figure is always recumbent, never engaged in any daily activity, and generally devoid of eroticism. The conquest of the woman is achieved, as with the landscape, through the act of painting. The flesh of the figure is treated similarly to the features of landscape which always, as noted, constitutes a background to the picture, and the same color principles are applied to both. There are instances where the nude is depicted as {{a continuation of the}} landscape, for example when a path seen through a window seems to travel into the room up to the body of reclining woman. Topographical features of the landscape echo in the lines of the female groin, a parallelism which reinforces the idea of the identity of woman and landscape. On the other hand, the geometric shape of the window frame emphasizes the rounded contours of the recumbent female figure. In some instances the window is represented as a mirror facing the figure and reflecting it. The landscape in Gat's painting becomes the true portrait of the woman. The nude and still life represent the artist's inner world, his [...] "interior." [...] They are staged as artistic subjects rather than as part to a daily authentic environment. This [...] "interior" [...] is very like an exterior. Gat's paintings do not contain actual exteriors. The indoor scenes are always represented close to the window-sill, tending to slide outwards, or even to form {{an integral part of the}} outside. Therein lies the message: the artist's inner world and nature are one and the same. His workshop, his life, his art and his desires, are all woven into nature. The landscape is not simply a visual subject but an essential component of his existence. In Gat's case, nudity constitutes a complement and interpretation of the landscape, its sensuality and its repose, and of the artist's erotic relationship to it.|$|R
