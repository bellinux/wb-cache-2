5000|$|Director Kim Kyu-tae {{utilized}} {{a lot of}} ultra close-up shots, {{to highlight}} the characters emotions and accentuate the smallest movement in the actors faces or expression in their eyes. Cinematographer and visual director Kim Cheon-seok said such visual techniques differentiated the show from the standard set by existing Korean dramas, which usually resort to medium shots or bust shots. To produce such <b>detailed</b> <b>shots,</b> the crew used expensive high-definition ALEXA Plus cameras, known for their rich color and high-speed cinematography. Lighting director Park Hwan also employed twice as much lighting equipment as do other dramas. Another technique the crew used was post-production correction, which was possible because when the first episode aired, eight were already taped. Park said, [...] "Its both my and Kims philosophy that the actress should look beautiful even when she is wailing." ...|$|R

Using the method of juxtaposition, I pose questions on the nature and relationship of an individual and collective. Depending on current perspective,, the individual might seem as independent on the collective, or it might easily seem to be firmly linked together. In the Documentation of Diploma Thesis I suggest several ideas on the individual/collective relationship: the role of cultural and other dependance, the nature of time, or the role and relevance of glance and observation...|$|R

40|$|In {{competitive}} sports it {{is often}} very hard to quantify the performance. A player to score or overtake may depend on only millesimal of seconds or millimeters. In racquet sports like tennis, table tennis and squash many events will occur {{in a short time}} duration, whose recording and analysis can help reveal the differences in performance. In this paper we show {{that it is possible to}} architect a framework that utilizes the characteristic sound patterns to precisely classify the types of and localize the positions of these events. From these basic information the shot types and the ball speed along the trajectories can be estimated. Comparing these estimates with the optimal speed and target the precision of the shot can be defined. The <b>detailed</b> <b>shot</b> statistics and precision information significantly enriches and improves data available today. Feeding them back to the players and the coaches facilitates to describe playing performance objectively and to improve strategy skills.

50|$|Oulala differs {{largely from}} other fantasy {{football}} games available. Most other games operate around one national league whereas Oulala {{is open to}} four major European leagues, the English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga, the French Ligue 1 and the Italian Serie A so the player can pick a team {{with a mix of}} the finest players Europe has to offer. Other games limit themselves to 5 or 10 points scoring criteria, usually goals, assists, clean sheets, yellow and red cards, penalty saves and sometimes man of the matches. Oulala’s system includes 70 different criteria dependent on a player’s position resulting in a total of 275 ways to gain or lose points, ranging from the usual goals and assists to the more <b>detailed</b> <b>shots</b> on target and successful tackles, amongst many others, making it as close to football reality as possible.

50|$|The {{primary reason}} that the pattern is altered is because cutting {{off the end of}} the barrel removes the choke, which {{generally}} only extends about two inches (about 5 cm) inward from the muzzle.

40|$|X-ray {{shots of}} Cyg X- 1 in {{different}} energy bands and spectral {{states have been}} studied with PCA/RXTE observations. The <b>detailed</b> <b>shot</b> structure is obtained by superposing many shots with one millisecond time bin through aligning their peaks with an improved algorithm. In general, the shots are composed of a slow rise and fast decay. The shot structures in the different states are different. The duration of shot in the high state is shorter than that in the low and transition states. The shot profile in the high energy band is more asymmetric and narrower than that in the low energy band. The average hardness of shot is {{lower than that of}} steady emission in the transition and low states but higher than that in the high state. The time lags between the shots in higher and lower energy bands have been found in the different states. In transition states, the time lag is the largest among the different states of Cyg X- 1, and it is the smallest in the low state. The implications of the observed shot features for shot models are discussed. Comment: Latex, 20 pages, 12 figures(included), to be published in Ap...|$|R
