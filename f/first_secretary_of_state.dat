5|$|As {{provisional}} {{president in}} 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of Georgia was the <b>first</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> and Christopher Memminger of South Carolina became Secretary of the Treasury.

5|$|The Lord President of the Court of Session, often known {{simply as}} the Lord President, acted as {{a link between the}} Privy Council and the Court. The king's {{advocate}} acted as the legal council. The post emerged in the 1490s to deal with the king's patrimonial land rights and from 1555 there were usually two king's councillors, indicating the increase in the level of work. From 1579 they increasingly became a public prosecutor. After the union most of the offices remained, but political power was increasingly centred in London. John Ker, 1st Duke of Roxburghe, became the <b>first</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for Scotland until the post was abolished in 1746 after the Jacobite Rising of 1745.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and <b>First</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of an embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E
