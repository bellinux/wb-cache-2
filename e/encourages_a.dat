5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, Bowline, Sheet bend, Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E
5|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the white-letter hairstreak (Strymonidia walbum) and {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis edippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer.|$|E

5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
5|$|The story follows Madoc's journey as {{they travel}} West again, contending with {{problems}} such as storms and dissent among the crew. Eventually, they reach America and are received by the natives. Madoc takes {{on one of the}} natives, Lincoya, as his guide when they begin to explore the area of the Mississippi River. As they continue to travel, they soon come to Aztlan, the original homeland of the Aztec nation, and Madoc discovers that the Aztecs require human sacrifices for their gods. Madoc decides to interfere with tribal affairs and stop two children from being taken by the Aztecs to be sacrificed. Following this, he <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> peaceful tribe, the Hoamen, to take up arms against the Aztecs. To further protect the Hoamen, Madoc goes to the Aztec capital to deal with their king. While there, he is shown by the king how great the Aztecs are and how no one could stand against them. Madoc witnesses among the buildings and monuments piles of skulls and corpses along with other horrific scenes.|$|E

25|$|The Jacoby rule, {{named after}} Oswald Jacoby, allows gammons and backgammons to count for their {{respective}} double and triple values {{only if the}} cube has already been offered and accepted. This <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} HIV also <b>{{encourages}}</b> <b>a</b> cycle of blame and violence, which marginalises and encourages violence against a gay lifestyle. This cycle takes on further meaning under Jamaican law, which criminalises all anal sex and often turns {{a blind eye}} to violence against homosexuals. Few are willing to take up the language of human rights against what is happening to homosexuals and HIV positive individuals because they are considered responsible for the spread of HIV.|$|E
25|$|Walden Two, like Thoreau's Walden, champions a {{lifestyle}} that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure. In 1967, Kat Kinkade and others founded the Twin Oaks Community, using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system {{and other aspects of}} the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} money or {{materials}} in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under supply and demand. Market manipulation is possible on a large scale, particular examples being ramping and bear raids. CCP does not issue refunds on in-game purchases. Hence, {{there is always the}} risk of certain types of confidence tricks or other scams. The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas. This <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> more even spread of players.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Cylons {{also share}} a religion. It differs greatly from the humans' religion; it is monotheistic and shares many beliefs of Abrahamic monotheistic {{religions}} (God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, {{that he will}} one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the world). Much like Evangelical Christianity, the Cylon religion <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> personal relationship with God. Despite being man-made, Cylons believe that they were created by God. The different Cylon models have varying degrees of faith; at least one, Cavil, does not subscribe to any religion. Some humans have come to follow the Cylon religion, mostly by way of Gaius Baltar, who himself grew {{to believe in the}} Cylon religion through the efforts of Caprica Six.|$|E
25|$|Politicizing Science: The Alchemy of Policymaking {{is a book}} by the George C. Marshall Institute, {{edited by}} Michael Gough. The book, {{published}} in 2003, <b>encourages</b> <b>a</b> disinterested objectivity {{on the part of}} scientists and policymakers: Ideally, the scientists or analysts who generate estimates of harm that may result from a risk would consider all the relevant facts and alternative interpretations of the data, and remain skeptical about tentative conclusions. Ideally, too, the agency officials and politicians, who have to enact a regulatory program, would consider its costs and benefits, ensure that it will do more good than harm, and remain open to options to stop or change the regulation in situations where the underlying science is tentative.|$|E
