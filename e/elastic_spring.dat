2500|$|Catfish {{can produce}} {{different}} types of sounds and also have well-developed auditory reception used to discriminate between sounds with different pitches and velocities. They are also able to determine {{the distance of the}} sound's origin and from what direction it originated. This is a very important fish communication mechanism, especially during agonistic and distress behaviors. Catfish are able to produce a variety of sounds for communication that can be classified into two groups: drumming sounds and stridulation sounds. [...] The variability in catfish sound signals differs due to a few factors: the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resulting sound, and physiological differences such as size, sex, and age. [...] To create a drumming sound, catfish use an indirect vibration mechanism using a swimbladder. In these fishes, sonic muscles insert on the ramus Mulleri, also known as the <b>elastic</b> <b>spring.</b> The sonic muscles pull the <b>elastic</b> <b>spring</b> forward and extend the swimbladder. When the muscles relax, the tension in the spring quickly returns the swimbladder to its original position, which produces the sound.|$|E

2500|$|In 1660, Hooke {{discovered}} {{the law of}} elasticity which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an <b>elastic</b> <b>spring.</b> [...] He first described this discovery in the anagram [...] "ceiiinosssttuv", whose solution he published in 1678 as [...] "Ut tensio, sic vis" [...] meaning [...] "As the extension, so the force." [...] Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the balance spring or hairspring, which {{for the first time}} enabled a portable timepiece– a watch– to keep time with reasonable accuracy. [...] A bitter dispute between Hooke and Christiaan Huygens on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see External links below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{although}} it is thus impossible that any force should be destroyed, or in any way cease to exist in one form without setting in action a precisely equal amount in some other form, it may, as it were, pass into a condition of restraint, and remain thus suspended and latent for an indefinite period--ready, however, to break into action again the moment that the restraint is removed. Thus a perfectly <b>elastic</b> <b>spring</b> may be bent by a certain force, and retained in the bent position a long time. But the moment that it is released it will unbend itself, exercising in so doing precisely the degree of force expended in bending it. In the same manner air may be compressed in an air-gun, and held thus, with the force, as it were, imprisoned, {{for any length of}} time, until at last, when the detent is released by the trigger, the elastic force comes into action, exercising in its action a power precisely the same as that with which it was compressed.|$|E
6000|$|The hares (Lepus Americanus) {{were very}} familiar. One had her form under my house all winter, {{separated}} from me {{only by the}} flooring, and she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to stir--thump, thump, thump, striking {{her head against the}} floor timbers in her hurry. They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still. Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window. When I opened my door in the evening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce. Near at hand they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and lo, away it scud with an <b>elastic</b> <b>spring</b> over the snow-crust, straightening its body and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me and itself--the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity of Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then was its nature. (Lepus, levipes, light-foot, some think.) ...|$|E
6000|$|He rode {{among his}} gentlemen, and the {{brilliant}} cavalcade passed through poplar-shaded roads, clattered through villages, and threaded {{their way through}} bits of forest still left for the royal chase. The people thronged out of their houses, and shouted not only 'Vive le Roy,' but 'Vive l'Amiral,' and more than once the cry was added, 'Spanish war, or civil war!' The heart of France was, if not with the Reformed, at least against Spain and the Lorrainers, and Sidney perceived, from the conversation of the gentlemen round him, that the present expedition had been devised less {{for the sake of}} the sport, than to enable the King to take measures for emancipating himself from the thraldom of his mother, and engaging the country in a war against Philip II. Sidney listened, but Berenger chafed, feeling only that he was being further carried out of reach of his explanation with his kindred. And thus they arrived at Montpipeau, a tower, tall and narrow, like all French designs, but expanded on the ground floor by wooden buildings capable of containing the numerous train of a royal hunter, and surrounded by an extent of waste land, without fine trees, though with covert for deer, boars, and wolves sufficient for sport to royalty and death to peasantry. Charles seemed to sit more erect in his saddle, and to drink in joy with every breath of the thyme-scented breeze, from the moment his horse bounded on the hollow-sounding turf; and when he leapt to the ground, with the <b>elastic</b> <b>spring</b> of youth, he held out his hands to Sidney and to Teligny, crying 'Welcome, my friends.

If she could teach herself to think that of all men walking the earth Lord Alfred was {{the best and the}} most divine, the nearest of all men to a god, how excellent a thing would it be! Her great responsibility as to the family burden would in that case already be acquitted with credit. The wishes of her father, which on such a subject were all but paramount, would be gratified; and she herself would then be placed almost beyond the hand of misfortune to hurt her. At any rate, the great and almost crushing difficulty of her life would so be solved. But the man must have enough in her eyes of that godlike glory to satisfy her that she had found in him one who would be almost a divinity, at any rate to her. Could he speak as that other man spoke? Could he look as that other one looked? Would there be in his eye such a depth of colour, in his voice such a sound of music, in his gait so divine a grace?

No; she was sure of that. Of her one own great treasure, she was much too chary to give it away unasked, and too independent, as she told herself, to give it away unauthorized. The field was open to Lord Alfred; and, as her father wished it, Lord Alfred should be received with every favour. If she could find divinity, then she would bow before it readily.|$|E

40|$|A {{discussion}} is presented on analyses of piled foundations with the pile caps simulated as beam or slab structures supported on piles simulated as <b>elastic</b> <b>springs</b> carrying support stiffnesses with {{various degrees of}} freedom. In this paper, the shortcoming of applying only settlement, translational and rotational stiffnesses to the <b>elastic</b> <b>springs</b> for piles rigidly jointed to the pile cap in an integrated analysis of the lateral shears and out-of-plane loads for a piled foundation are explained. These shortcomings lie in the failure of this approach {{to account for the}} effects on the out-of-plane actions in the pile cap and the subsequent axial loads on the piles due to lateral translations, which can create moments at the pile heads. However, with the insertion of “coupled support stiffnesses” which relates the pile head translations to moments into the stiffness matrix of the pile cap, accurate analytical results can be obtained. As most commercial software does not allow for the input of such stiffnesses, the paper also discusses an approach that can arrive at the close analytical results and yet remain on the conservative side of estimation.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Animals {{can lower}} the {{metabolic}} cost of swimming by using appropriately tuned, <b>elastic</b> <b>springs.</b> Jet-powered invertebrates use springs that lie in functional parallel to their swimming muscles to power half the locomotor cycle. The parallel geometry constrains the spring to be non-linearly elastic; muscle power is diverted {{to load the}} spring only when swimming muscles are not capable of producing maximal hydro-dynamic thrust. The springs of jellyfish and scallops are forced at or near their resonant frequency, producing large energy savings. Measuring the contribution of elastic energy storage to jet-powered locomotion has been facilitated by the relatively simple geometries of invertebrate locomotor systems. In contrast, complex musculoskeletal systems and kinematics have complicated the study of springs in swimming vertebrates. Skins, tendons and axial skeletons of some vertebrate swimmers have appropri-ate mechanical properties to act as springs. To date, though, there exist {{just a handful of}} studies that have investigated the mechanical behaviors of these locomotor structures in swimming vertebrates, and these data have yet to be integrated with measures of swimming power. Integrating mechanical, kinematic, hydrodynamic and metabolic data are required to understand more fully the role of <b>elastic</b> <b>springs</b> in vertebrate swimming energetics...|$|R
