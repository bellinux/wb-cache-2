5|$|Enforcement of <b>federal</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> {{law in the}} South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled {{up through}} the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt v. United States (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.|$|E
5|$|The Commission on Constitutional Revision {{presented}} {{its report}} and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, {{and continued to}} work with them to draft a final consensus version. The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included African-American men and women, following passage of <b>federal</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states {{in exchange for a}} pledge to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce <b>federal</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent <b>federal</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It {{was signed into law}} by President Lyndon B. Johnson {{during the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of <b>federal</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> legislation ever enacted in the country.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures {{in a process}} in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new <b>federal</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E
