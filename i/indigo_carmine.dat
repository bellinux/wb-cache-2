25|$|The {{first step}} is usually a digital rectal examination, to examine {{the tone of the}} {{sphincter}} and to determine if preparation has been adequate. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as <b>Indigo</b> <b>carmine)</b> may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E

30|$|Different {{groups of}} dyes are {{considered}} in this evaluation. Although Alizarin Violet 3 R is an anthraquinonic dye, azo dyes {{are represented by}} six of these compounds: Direct Red 28, Palatine Fast Black WAN, New Coccine, Chicago Sky Blue 6 B, Tartrazine and Amaranth. <b>Carmine</b> <b>Indigo</b> is the only sample for indigoid ones, and Erioglaucine, Patent Blue V and Eriochromecyanine R belong to triphenylmethane group. The performance of the coagulants differs mainly due to the tannin nature and the dye chemical structure and corresponding type.|$|R
60|$|And if {{this were}} not {{sufficient}} evidence of the animality of Colpoda, there comes {{the fact that it}} is even more similar to another well-known animalcule, Paramoecium, than it is to a monad. But Paramoecium is so huge a creature compared with those hitherto discussed--it reaches 1/120 of an inch or more in length--that there is no difficulty in making out its organisation in detail; and in proving that it is not only an animal, but that it is an animal which possesses a somewhat complicated organisation. For example, the surface layer of its body is different in structure from the deeper parts. There are two contractile vacuoles, from each of which radiates a system of vessel-like canals; and not only is there a conical depression continuous with a tube, which serve as mouth and gullet, but the food ingested takes a definite course, and refuse is rejected from a definite region. Nothing is easier than to feed these animals, and to watch the particles of <b>indigo</b> or <b>carmine</b> accumulate at the lower end of the gullet. From this they gradually project, surrounded by a ball of water, which at length passes with a jerk, oddly simulating a gulp, into the pulpy central substance of the body, there to circulate up one side and down the other, until its contents are digested and assimilated. Nevertheless, this complex animal multiplies by division, as the monad does, and, like the monad, undergoes conjugation. It stands in the same relation to Heteromita on the animal side, as Coleochaete does on the plant side. Start from either, and such an insensible series of gradations leads to the monad that it is impossible to say at any stage of the progress where the line between the animal and the plant must be drawn.|$|R
50|$|Contrast stains are not absorbed {{but rather}} provide {{contrast}} by permeating between irregularities in the mucosa to highlight irregularities. The primary contrast stain is <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine,</b> administered at varying concentrations between 0.1% and 0.8%.

This reaction is also known as chemical clock experiment because concentrations of the products and reactants changed over the specific period. When the solution is shaken, oxygen dissolves in the solution and oxidizes <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine.</b> Solution becomes red if a small amount of oxygen is dissolved, and green if all of <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> is oxidized. The solution will turn back to original yellow color when the concentration of oxygen level drops.|$|E
50|$|Double {{dye test}} {{is useful for}} {{diagnosing}} vesicovaginal or ureterovaginal fistulae. For this test, the patient takes oral phenazopyridine (Pyridium) 200 mg three times a day, and <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> or methylene blue is filled into the empty urinary bladder via a urethral catheter. Pyridium turns urine orange in the kidneys, and methylene blue (or <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine)</b> turns urine blue in the bladder.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of our {{experience}} approximately 300 stones of different composition have been treated in vitro with three different laser sources: Nd-YAG laser (1, 064 nm), dye laser (504 nm) and alexandrite laser (755 nm). Calcium oxalate monohydrate and brushite stones appeared to be the most resistant to lithotripsy. Highest fragmentation rates were obtained for calcium oxalate dihydrate stones followed by struvite, uric acid and hydroxyapatite stones. The Nd-YAG laser {{did not appear to be}} ideal for lithotripsy since early damage to the fiber tip was observed when this source was used. Both the dye and the alexandrite lasers were almost always effective in fragmenting the various types of stones. We subsequently treated some cystine stones while immersed in water or in solutions of <b>carmine</b> <b>indigo</b> (2 %), methylene blue (5 %), rifamycin (0. 6 and 6 %) and rifampicin (0. 8 and 0. 3 %) with the dye or the alexandrite laser. The spectra of these solutions, previously analyzed with the spectrophotometer, showed that rifamycin and rifampicin absorbed large amounts of light radiation at the wave length of the dye laser (504 nm). Successful fragmentation occurred only when the dye laser was used to treat stones immersed in the more concentrated solutions of these two substances. The quantity of fragmented material after treating a 10 -cm 3 cystine stone previously immersed in the more concentrated solutions of rifamycin and rifampicin (30 and 10 mm 3, respectively) confirmed previous results...|$|R

50|$|In obstetric surgery, <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> {{solutions}} are sometimes employed to detect amniotic fluid leaks. In urologic surgery, intravenous injection of <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> {{is often used}} to highlight portions of the urinary tract. The dye is filtered rapidly by the kidneys from the blood, and colors the urine blue. This enables structures of the urinary tract to be seen in the surgical field, and demonstrate if there is a leak. However, the dye can cause a potentially dangerous increase in blood pressure in some cases.|$|E

50|$|Many {{synthesized}} dyes were {{easier and}} less costly {{to produce and}} were superior in coloring properties when compared to naturally derived alternatives. Some synthetic food colorants are diazo dyes. Diazo dyes are prepared by coupling of a diazonium compound with a second aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting compounds contain conjugated systems that efficiently absorb light in the visible parts of the spectrum, i.e. they are deeply colored. The attractiveness of the synthetic dyes is that their color, lipophilicity, and other attributes can be engineered by {{the design of the}} specific dyestuff. The color of the dyes can be controlled by selecting the number of azo-groups and various substituents. Yellow shades are often achieved by using acetoacetanilide. Red colors are often azo compounds. The pair indigo and <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> exhibit the same blue color, but the former is soluble in lipids, and the latter is water-soluble because it has been fitted with sulfonate functional groups.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{intravenous}} administration of <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> {{has been reported}} to produce transiently increased blood pressure in patients. The goal of this in	vitro {{study was to examine the}} effect of <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> on phenylephrine-induced contractions in an isolated rat aorta and to determine the associated cellular mechanism with particular focus on the endothelium-derived vasodilators. Methods: The concentration-response curves for phenylephrine were generated in the presence or absence of <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine.</b> Phenylephrine concentration-response curves were generated for the endothelium-intact rings pretreated independently with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and a low-molecular-weight superoxide anion scavenger, tiron, in the presence or absence of <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine.</b> The fluorescence of oxidized dichlorofluorescein was measured in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells cultured in the control, <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> alone and tiron plus <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine.</b> Results: <b>Indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> (10 - 5 M) increased the phenylephrine-induced maximum contraction in the endothelium-intact rings with or without indomethacin, whereas <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> produced a slight leftward shift in the phenylephrine concentration-response curves in the endothelium-denuded rings and L-NAME-pretreated endothelium-intact rings. In the endothelium-intact rings pretreated with tiron (10 - 2 M), <b>indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> did not alter phenylephrine concentration-response curves significantly. <b>Indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> (10 - 5 M) increased the fluorescence of oxidized dichlorofluorescein in the vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas tiron abolished the indigo carmine-induced increase in oxidized dichlorofluorescein fluorescence. Conclusions: <b>Indigo</b> <b>carmine</b> increases the phenylephrine-induced contraction mainly through an endothelium-dependent mechanism involving the inactivation of nitric oxide caused by the increased production of reactive oxygen species.
