5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by <b>decorator</b> crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including <b>decorator</b> crabs, which attach materials from their environment, {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another hermit crab, Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E
50|$|Seventy-seven set <b>decorators</b> {{broke away}} from IATSE to form the Society of Motion Picture Interior <b>Decorators</b> (SMPID) and {{negotiated}} an independent contract with the producers in 1937. The SMPID joined the CSU in 1943 and the CSU represented the SMPID in their contract negotiations. After the producers stalled the negotiations for nine months, IATSE questioned CSU jurisdiction over the Set <b>Decorators</b> {{which led to a}} further five-month delay as the CSU and IATSE fought over jurisdiction. When the Producers refused to acknowledge an independent arbitrator appointed by the War Labor Board's assessment that the CSU had jurisdiction over the Set <b>Decorators</b> in February 1945, it {{set the stage for the}} strike.|$|R

He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as straw buyers to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E
5|$|In {{between some}} odd jobs, Vandersteen became an avid sporter, from {{gymnastics}} over cycling to wrestling. His chances improved in 1936 {{when he was}} hired as a <b>decorator</b> for the shop and the display windows of L'Innovation, a Belgian chain of supermarkets. In the same year, he met Paula Van Den Branden, whom he married on 9 October 1937. After living in Antwerp for two years and having a daughter, Helena, in 1938, the first of their four children, the couple moved to the more rural Schilde in 1939.|$|E
40|$|Attribute grammars are a {{powerful}} specification formalism for tree-based computation, particularly for software language processing. Various extensions {{have been proposed}} to abstract over common patterns in attribute grammar specifications. These include various forms of copy rules to support non-local dependencies, collection attributes, and expressing dependencies that are evaluated to a fixed point. Rather than implementing extensions natively in an attribute evaluator, we propose attribute <b>decorators</b> that describe an abstract evaluation mechanism for attributes, {{making it possible to}} provide such extensions as part of a library of <b>decorators.</b> Inspired by strategic programming, <b>decorators</b> are specified using generic traversal operators. To demonstrate their effectiveness, we describe how to employ <b>decorators</b> in name, type, and flow analysis. 16 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a <b>decorator,</b> while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set <b>decorator)</b> went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E

She wrote numerous articles for magazines, including: Collier's, Country Life, House Beautiful, and House and Garden. McClelland belonged to the <b>Decorator's</b> Club {{and was one of}} the first woman <b>decorators</b> to join the Architectural League once it opened its membership to women in 1934. She was also a founding member of the American Institute of Interior <b>Decorators</b> (A.I.I.D.), which changed to American Institute of <b>Decorators</b> (A.I.D.) in 1936.|$|R

5|$|To {{create the}} bank {{needed for the}} episode, Ilt Jones and the {{location}} department staff found a former bank and current animation school and film production house on Fourth and Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. The building was completely renovated, complete with fake ATMs, columns, desks, and double-glazed windows. All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set <b>decorator</b> Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some of the cameras made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior <b>decorator,</b> who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set <b>decorator</b> Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} <b>decorator,</b> decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E
