40|$|<b>Derailments</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> {{often occur}} {{due to the}} wheel-rail contact failure caused by {{the impact of the}} trains with road {{vehicles}} at road-rail crossings. Frontal collisions of passenger trains onto stuck road vehicles occur frequently at such road-rail crossings even where active warning systems are installed. Such collisions are often fatal and cause significant damages to vehicles and the infrastructure especially when they incur derailments. Innovations in passive railway infrastructure designs for mitigating the severity of collision induced derailments are rare. This paper presents a formulation for a passive road-rail crossing involving stiffened edges of the raised road pavement to minimise the risk of failure of wheel–rail contact using a nonlinear three-dimensional multibody dynamics model. Severe derailment scenarios of trains passing through the passive and normal road-rail crossings have been analysed and presented. The innovative design of the road-rail crossing with passive track structure presented in the paper is shown to reduce the failure of the wheel-rail contact and hence the train-truck frontal collision derailment potential...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands Railways NS {{intends to}} {{increase}} the maximum speed of trains on certain railway sections from 140 to 160 km/h. Higher speeds mean a greater chance on accidents, in particular of collisions with traffic on level crossings, but also a greater chance on <b>derailments</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains.</b> It is intended to avoid this risk by taking compensating measures, especially regarding the safety of level crossings. In this context, {{the policy of the}} NS is that unprotected level crossings or crossings with automatic flashing light installations (AKI's) will not occur on future 160 km/h railway sections anymore. They will be replaced by automatic half-sized barriers (AHOB's) or by multi-level intersections. AHOB's are considered to be safer than unprotected level crossings and AKI's. Compared with AHOB's, multi-level intersections are safer, but more expensive. The Dutch Council for Traffic Safety has ordered SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research to investigate how much these additional costs can be justified by higher savings on damage caused by accidents and favourable side-effects...|$|E
50|$|On Atlantic City Railroad's Camden to Atlantic City Line, in Winslow, New Jersey: at Winslow Junction {{near the}} WA Tower, On July 2, 1922, shortly before 11:30pm, a <b>derailment</b> <b>of</b> <b>train</b> № 33 the Owl, with Philadelphia and Reading Railway Eng № 349.

40|$|Lateral {{collisions}} between heavy {{road vehicles}} and passenger trains at level crossings {{and the associated}} derailments are serious safety issues. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the dynamic responses and <b>derailment</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> under lateral impact using a multi-body dynamics simulation method. Formulation of a three-dimensional dynamic model <b>of</b> a passenger <b>train</b> running on a ballasted track subject to lateral impact caused by a road truck is presented. This model is shown to predict derailment due to wheel climb and car body overturning mechanisms through numerical examples. Sensitivities of the truck speed and mass, wheel/rail friction and the train suspension to the lateral stability and <b>derailment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> are reported. It is shown that improvements to the design <b>of</b> <b>train</b> suspensions, including secondary and inter-vehicle lateral dampers have higher potential to mitigate the severity <b>of</b> the collision-induced <b>derailments...</b>|$|R
