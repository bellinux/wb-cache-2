5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies <b>from</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country.</b> For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} differs <b>from</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country,</b> {{and suggests}} that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, {{and suggests that}} most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely <b>from</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> <b>country.</b> Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E

There {{has not been}} a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships.

However, it is not identifiable whether changes in the emigration rate over time arise from changes in the migration flows, changes in the population size aside from emigration, or both. Therefore, the logarithm of the migration flows is used as the dependent variable while controlling for general population dynamics by including the logarithm of the emigration country’s population.|$|R
