40|$|AbstractFluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase activity, {{which can}} cause DNA damage and result in bacterial cell death. In response to DNA damage, bacteria induce an SOS response to stimulate DNA repair. However, the SOS response may also induce prophage with production of infectious virions. Salmonella strains typically contain multiple prophages, and certain strains including phage types DT 120 and DT 104 contain prophage that upon induction are capable of <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction.</b> In this study, strains of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 120 and DT 104 were exposed to fluoroquinolones important for use in human and veterinary disease therapy to determine whether prophage(s) are induced that could facilitate phage-mediated gene transfer. Cultures of MDR S. Typhimurium DT 120 and DT 104 containing a kanamycin resistance plasmid were lysed after exposure to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and danofloxacin). Bacterial cell lysates were able to transfer the plasmid to a recipient kanamycin-susceptible Salmonella strain by <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction.</b> In addition, exposure of DT 120 to ciprofloxacin induced the recA gene of the bacterial SOS response and genes encoded in a P 22 -like generalised transducing prophage. This research indicates that fluoroquinolone exposure of MDR Salmonella can facilitate horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that fluoroquinolone usage in human and veterinary medicine may have unintended consequences, including the induction of phage-mediated gene transfer from MDR Salmonella. Stimulation of gene transfer following bacterial exposure to fluoroquinolones should be considered an adverse effect, and clinical decisions regarding antibiotic selection for infectious disease therapy should include this potential risk...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen in UK {{hospitals and}} MRSA {{is a major}} concern due to burgeoning multi-drug resistance. However these resistance genotypes have not accumulated into one fully-resistant MRSA clone. MRSA from St. George's Healthcare NHS trust (SGHT) over a period of ten years were investigated. Antibiotic resistance phenotypes, genotypes and lineage types of infective MRSA isolates, incidence of MRSA, records of antibiotic prescribing both before and after a change in antibiotic stewardship and implementation dates of infection control interventions were combined. These data established that a decline in MRSA incidence correlated with a decrease in prescription of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins at SGHT and no other recorded infection control intervention. CC 22 MRSA became the dominant lineage of MRSA at SGHT from 2006 onwards, this coincided with the sudden acquisition of new antibiotic resistances by this lineage and the ability to gain and lose these resistances in subsequent years. These changes did not correlate with a change in antibiotic stewardship and could not be associated with any other infection control intervention. No MRSA were fully drug resistant, the majority were multi-drug resistant. However resistance did not accumulate within any lineage over time. Antibiotic resistance genes in MRSA are often carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Resistance genotypes of infective MRSA suggested that carriage of resistance genes differs between lineages. Barriers to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between lineages such as restriction-modification systems have been previously characterised using laboratory isolates of S. aureus and restriction-deficient mutants. The effect of these barriers on the spread of naturally occurring MGEs between clinical MRSA has 3 • not been measured. The efficiency of barriers to HGT between clinical MRSA lineages was assessed by developing an in vitro model conjugation. A conjugative gentamicin resistance plasmid was transferred at high frequency within a lineage, but at low frequency between lineages. Barriers to HGT were also assessed by attempting to develop an in vitro model of transduction. Phage from isolated from local water sources were used to transfer antibiotic resistance genes within and between lineages of clinical MRSA by <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction.</b> Transduction was detected between clinical MRSA of different lineages at low frequency, however transductions were broadly unsuccessful. Further investigation is warranted as <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction</b> appears to be an important mechanism by which antibiotic resistance genes are exchanged among MRSA. The presence of efficient barriers to HGT in clinical MRSA contributes to our understanding of why antibiotic resistance {{has not been able to}} accumulate in MRSA and why we have not seen a fully drug resistant S. aureus.

40|$|Prokaryotic cells such as Escherichia coli use glucose {{as their}} {{preferred}} carbon source. In {{the absence of}} glucose, these cells resort to other sources to generate glucose and this process of de novo synthesis of glucose is termed gluconeogenesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) {{is one of the}} three enzymes important in regulating gluconeogenesis. It converts oxaloacetic acid (OAA) from the Krebs cycle to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a glycolytic intermediate. The Pck structural gene (pckA) is regulated by catabolite repression. There is a 100 -fold induction of pckA-lacZ fusions at the onset of stationary phase concurrent with induction of glycogen synthesis. Mutants affecting the expression of pckA were analysed to shed some light on the mechanism of its genetic regulation. Spontaneous mutants isolated with Pck- (lack of PEP carboxykinase activity) and Suc- (inability to utilise succinate as carbon source) phenotypes were previously characterised as atpG mutants defective in the ã subunit of ATP synthase. In this work we find by reverse transcriptase and real time quantitative PCR that levels of pckA mRNA are normal in the atpG mutants and that the defects in expression of pckA are therefore likely at the level of translation, protein assembly and/or protein degradation. As expected, ATP synthase activity and proton pumping in inside-out membrane vesicles were defective in these atpG mutants. It is likely that one of these defects is affecting regulation or expression of the pckA gene. It was observed that atpG mutants were defective in calcium-dependent transformation although they could be made competent for electroporation. The atpG mutants were also defective for growth of P 1 bacteriophage although they could serve as recipients for P 1 -dependent <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction.</b> These latter phenotypes are also likely due to defects in energy metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Erwinia carotovora {{subspecies}} carotovora (Ecc) is a phytopathogenic {{member of}} the Enterobacteriaceae and causes soft rot in potato tubers. Ecc strain ATTn 10 also produces the β-lactam antibiotic, 1 -carbapen- 2 -em- 3 -carboxylic acid (Car). In order to select for mutants with increased production of Car, a β-lactamase translational fusion was engineered into carH, the last gene in the Car biosynthetic and auto-resistance operon. The carH::blaM reporter was shown to encode for a functional β-lactamase and by selecting {{in the presence of}} ampicillin (Ap), spontaneous Ecc mutants with increased Ap R were isolated. The mechanism of increased Ap R in the spontaneous mutants was shown to be due to IS 10 and Tn 10 mobile genetic elements that had been introduced during the previous construction of ATTn 10 from its parent strain, ATCC 39048. Subsequently, carH::blaM was introduced via a series of <b>generalised</b> <b>transductions</b> into ATCC 39048 in order to employ the positive selection system in a strain that did not possess IS 10 or Tn 10 elements. By using a combined mini-transposon approach, the carH::blaM positive selection system enabled the isolation of a mutant disrupted in a porin gene with high homology to ompF from Escherichia coli. An alternative approach to isolate mutants that were affected in Car production relied on the observation that many ATTn 10 spontaneous caseinase mutants were also influenced in Car production. A mini-transposon mutagenesis screen of mutants with altered caseinase activity identified five mutants that were also reduced in Car production.

40|$|From Summary: A {{survey of}} collagenolytic aerobic {{bacteria}} from cured hides yielded three strains of Bacillus and eight of Achromobacter which degraded collagen at 0. 4 M NaCl. Achromobacter sp. 2 {{was chosen for}} genetic studies due to its high collagenolytic activity {{and the lack of}} genetic information on Achromobacter. Four temperate bacteriophages specific for Achromobacter sp. 2 were isolated and their relationships studied. The phages caused lysogenic conversion resulting in the inability of lysogens to adsorb phage. Achromobacter sp. 2 was shown to be a cryptic lysogen as it was not immune to superinfection but had a very low rate of spontaneous induction which could be increased with mutagens. It is proposed that the cryptic lysogeny of this strain is maintained by a defective excision mechanism and the mode of prophage integration in the host chromosome. DNA extracted from phage α 3 a was used to transfect spheroplasts. The optimal conditions for the development of competence for transfection were determined. The presence of nuclease-attack on phage DNA under conditions of prolonged incubation of DNA and spheroplasts was proposed. A method for extracting Achromobacter DNA was devised which yielded purified, undegraded DNA, but {{it was not possible to}} transform Achromobacter sp. 2 with this DNA. The a phages were used to transduce a number of genetic markers into Achromobacter auxotrophs. The transduct ants had the ability to release the cryptic α 3 prophage at a high rate while maintaining their sensitivity to homologous phage infection. It is proposed that this is due to complementation between the cryptic prophage and the residual phage functions in the transducing particles. The transductants segregated auxotrophs with a probability of 10 ⁻³ per cell per generation. It appears that an unusual system of <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction</b> is operating whereby the transducing particles contain both phage and bacterial DNA which is incorporated into the recipient genome by a single recombination event yielding unstable transductants. In a study on induction of Escherichia coli (λ), carcinogenic nitrosamines were shown to be inducers of phage development. This provides a screening system for potentially harmful nitrosamines...|$|E
40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} {{caused by}} non-typhoidal Salmonella represent an important {{public health problem}} worldwide (Zhao et al., 2003). The transmission of Salmonella between animals and humans has been well established in epidemiological studies. In the case of complicated illness caused by Salmonella where antibiotics need to be administered, treatment can be compromised if the infecting organism is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial agent. This study and earlier {{studies have shown that}} many Salmonella carry temperate bacteriophages as lysogens. Many of these bacteriophages are capable of mediating <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction</b> (Schicklmaier and Schmieger, 1995; Schicklmaier et al., 1998; Mmolawa et al., 2002). Schmieger and Schicklmaier (1999) demonstrated that bacteriophages ES 18 and PDT 17 are capable of transduction of antibiotic resistance genes from DT 104. Phage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance genes has been largely neglected in the study of genetic transfer of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This study investigates whether bacteriophages exist in antibiotic resistant Salmonella isolates. Such temperate phages in antibiotic resistant isolates could {{play a significant role in}} the transfer of resistance to other species of enteric bacteria, such as E. coli. Molecular epidemiology studies of antibiotic resistance genes were undertaken with Salmonella isolates from chicken, pig and human sources that were subjected to PCR for ampicillin (blaTEM- 1), tetracycline (tetA, tetB) and streptomycin (aadA 1, aadA 2, strA, strB) resistance genes as well as Class 1 integrons. The blaTEM- 1 gene was widely detected in isolates from pigs and chickens but rarely detected in human isolates. The tetB gene was more commonly found in pig isolates, while the tetA gene was associated with tetracycline resistance in chicken isolates. The strA and strB genes were responsible for streptomycin resistance in the S. Typhimurium isolates while the aadA 1 gene was commonly detected in S. Kiambu and S. Virchow isolates. The aadA 2 gene was associated with streptomycin resistance in the S. Ohio isolates from pigs. Class 1 integrons were widely distributed across serovars tested from chicken, pig and human sources. Temperate bacteriophages were induced using mitomycin C from antibiotic resistant Salmonella. These phages were able to infect antibiotic-sensitive Salmonella isolates from humans. Bacteriophages induced from one S. Sofia isolate also plaqued on Shigella flexneri. Bacteriophages induced from one S. Kiambu isolate and S. Typhimurium DB 21 with an inserted Tn 10 transposon (S. Typhimurium DB 21 Tn 10) were capable of transducing ampicillin and tetracycline resistance, respectively into S. Enteritidis PT 1 isolates by in vitro methods. The molecular basis for resistance was established in subsequent PCR for antibiotic resistance genes in donor and recipient strains. This finding, in particular in the wild-type S. Kiambu strain, indicates that Salmonella from a natural source are able to infect and transfer antibiotic resistance by <b>generalised</b> <b>transduction</b> in controlled laboratory experiments. This current study has investigated the transfer of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance from a wild-type Salmonella strain and a laboratory strain of Salmonella to wild-type Salmonella bacteria as it occurs within the normal flora of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. It was demonstrated that the genetic transfer of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance genes as well as Class 1 integrons can occur within the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Transfer of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance could be demonstrated both in vitro and by using bacteriophage lysates obtained from in vivo studies in transduction experiments. It was clearly shown that bacteriophage isolated from chicken faeces and caeca could infect antibiotic sensitive recipient Salmonella. Interaction between phages of the administered Salmonella strains may be occuring with phages of bacteria in the normal flora allowing previously inactive phage in the indigenous flora to plaque on indicator strains. Additionally, strong evidence was presented to suggest that the environment of the chicken gastrointestinal tract could mediate phage type conversion in recipient and transductant strains. Phage typing of these recipient and transductant strains demonstrated a trend for recipient strains to become more resistant to phages in the S. Enteritidis typing panel. This led to weakened phage reactions such RDNC (reaction does not conform) and untypable. The acquisition of phages may be a way for Salmonella to enhance competitive fitness and generate new strains in order to evolve and diversify. Or the acquisition of plasmids either by transduction or conjugation may also mediate phage type conversion. MLVA typing was performed on selected recipient, donor and transductant strains. The changes to tandem repeat loci in Salmonella isolates that have passed through a chicken gastrointestinal tract have not been described before. The changes to fragment length suggest that the bacterial chromosome is undergoing rearrangement; this may be attributed to a number of factors including acquisition of phages, prophage integration into tRNA sites, slipped-strand mispairing or the adaption to changing environment, in this case the chicken gastrointestinal tract. This study has provided molecular epidemiological data on the antibiotic resistance genes and integrons present in Australian Salmonella isolates from human and animal sources. Information on the role of bacteriophages in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in vitro and in a chicken gastrointestinal tract has also been established. Thesis (Ph. D.)
