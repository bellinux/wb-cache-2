The objectives of this study were to compare genomic breeding values (GEBV) of the continuous with the routine <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems and to investigate the effect of genotype imputation on genomic predictions of embryos. A total of 2440 animals genotyped with Illumina 50 K, LD and EuroG 10 K chips were available between March and April 2014 for comparing genomic evaluations between the two systems. Average differences for all 44 evaluated traits ranged from- 4 % to 1 % genetic standard deviations for direct genomic values (DGV) and from- 10 % to 5 % genetic standard deviations for GEBV. Depending on the traits, correlations of DGV between the two systems were above 0. 995, 0. 992, and 0. 988 for animals genotyped with 50 K, EuroG 10 K and LD chips, respectively. GEBV correlations exceeded 0. 98 for all the traits across all the chip types. Due to the genotype imputing step, DGV variances of embryos increased, on average, by 2 % to 7 % of total additive genetic variance and about half of the variance increase was attributed to Mendelian sampling. For embryos with lower call rates in original genotypes, the increase in DGV variances reached 12 % of total genetic variance.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{are rapidly}} {{replacing}} traditional evaluation systems used for dairy cattle selection. Higher reliabilities from larger genotype files promote cooperation across country borders. Genomic {{information can be}} exchanged across countries using simple conversion equations, by modifying multi-trait across-country evaluation (MACE) to account for correlated residuals originating {{from the use of}} foreign evaluations, or by multi-trait analysis of genotypes for countries that use the same reference animals. Methods Traditional MACE assumes independent residuals because each daughter is measured in only one country. Genomic MACE could account for residual correlations using daughter equivalents from genomic data as a fraction of the total in each country and proportions of bulls shared. MACE methods developed to combine separate within-country <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> were compared to direct, multi-country analysis of combined genotypes using simulated genomic and phenotypic data for 8, 193 bulls in nine countries. Results Reliabilities for young bulls were much higher for across-country than within-country <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> as measured by squared correlations of estimated with true breeding values. Gains in reliability from genomic MACE were similar to those of multi-trait evaluation of genotypes but required less computation. Sharing of reference genotypes among countries created large residual correlations, especially for young bulls, that are accounted for in genomic MACE. Conclusions International <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> can be computed either by modifying MACE to account for residual correlations across countries or by multi-trait evaluation of combined genotype files.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} routine <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> {{a database}} was constructed to store genotypes for 50, 972 {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNP) from the Illumina BovineSNP 50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Multiple samples per animal are allowed. All SNP genotypes for a sample are stored in a single row. An indicator specifies whether the genotype for a sample was selected for use in <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Samples with low call rates or pedigree conflicts are designated as unusable. Among multiple samples that qualify for use in <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> {{the one with the}} highest call rate is designated as usable. When multiple samples are stored for an animal, a composite is formed during extraction by using SNP genotypes from other samples to replace missing genotypes. To increase the number of SNP available, scanner output for approximately 19, 000 samples was reprocessed. Any SNP with a minor allele frequency of ≥ 1 % for Holsteins, Jerseys, or Brown Swiss was selected, which was the primary reason that the number of SNP used for USDA genomic evaluations increased. Few parent–progeny conflicts (≤ 1 %) and a high call rate (≥ 90 %) were additional requirements that eliminated 2, 378 SNP. Because monomorphic SNP did not degrade convergence during estimation of SNP effects, a single set of 43, 385 SNP was adopted for all breeds.

40|$|Background: Replacing pedigree-based BLUP <b>evaluations</b> by <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> in pig {{breeding}} schemes {{can result}} in greater selection accuracy and genetic gains, especially for traits with limited phenotypes. However, this methodological change would generate additional costs. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether additional expenditures would be more profitably devoted to implementing <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> or to increasing phenotyping capacity while retaining traditional evaluations. Methods: Stochastic simulation was used to simulate a population with 1050 breeding females and 50 boars that was selected for 10 years for a breeding goal with two uncorrelated traits with heritabilities of 0. 4. The reference breeding scheme was based on phenotyping 13 770 candidates per year for trait 1 and 270 sibs of candidates per year for trait 2, with selection based on pedigree-based BLUP estimated breeding values. Increased expenditures were allocated to either increasing the phenotyping capacity for trait 2 while maintaining traditional evaluations, or to implementing genomic selection. The genomic scheme was based on two training populations: one for trait 2, consisting of phenotyped sibs of the candidates whose number increased from 1000 to 3430 over time, and one for trait 1, consisting of the selection candidates. Several genomic scenarios were tested, where the size of the training population for trait 1, and the number of genotyped candidates pre-selected based on their parental estimated breeding value, varied. Results: Both approaches resulted in higher genetic trends for the population breeding goal and lower rates of inbreeding compared to the reference scheme. However, even a very marked increase in phenotyping capacity for trait 2 could not match improvements achieved with genomic selection when the number of genotyped candidates was large. Genotyping just a limited number of pre-selected candidates significantly reduced the extra costs, while preserving most of the benefits in terms of genetic trends and inbreeding. Implementing <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> was the most efficient approach when major expenditure was possible, whereas increasing phenotypes was preferable when limited resources were available.

40|$|The {{construction}} {{and use of}} haploblocks [adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in strong linkage disequilibrium] for <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> is advantageous, {{because the number of}} effects to be estimated can be reduced without discarding relevant genomic information. Furthermore, haplotypes (the combination of 2 or more SNP) can increase the probability of capturing the quantitative trait loci effect compared with individual SNP markers. With regards to haplotypes, the allele frequency parameter is also of interest, because as a selection criterion, it allows the number of rare alleles to be reduced, and the effects of those alleles are usually difficult to estimate. We have proposed a simple pipeline that simultaneously incorporates linkage disequilibrium and allele frequency information in <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and here we present the first results obtained with this procedure. We used a population of 2, 235 progeny-tested bulls from the Montbéliarde breed for the tests. Phenotype data were available in the form of daughter yield deviations on 5 production traits, and genotype data were available from the 50 K SNP chip. We conducted a classical validation study by splitting the population into training (80 % oldest animals) and validation (20 % youngest animals) sets to emulate a real-life scenario in which the selection candidates had no available phenotype data. We measured all reported parameters for the validation set. Our results proved that the proposed method was indeed advantageous, and that the accuracy of <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> could be improved.

40|$|Background: <b>Genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> in Holstein {{dairy cattle}} have quickly become more {{reliable}} {{over the last}} two years in many countries as more animals have been genotyped for 50, 000 markers. Evaluations can also include animals genotyped with more or fewer markers using new tools such as the 777, 000 or 2, 900 marker chips recently introduced for cattle. Gains from more markers can be predicted using simulation, whereas strategies to use fewer markers have been compared using subsets of actual genotypes. The overall cost of selection is reduced by genotyping most animals at less than the highest density and imputing their missing genotypes using haplotypes. Algorithms to combine different densities need to be efficient because numbers of genotyped animals and markers may continue to grow quickly. Methods: Genotypes for 500, 000 markers were simulated for the 33, 414 Holsteins that had 50, 000 marker genotypes in the North American database.

The model provides breeding values for both purebred and crossbred performances. <b>Genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> incorporates marker genotypes into a genetic evaluation system. Among popular methods are the so-called single-step methods, in which marker genotypes are incorporated into a traditional animal model by using a combined relationship matrix that extends the marker-based relationship matrix to non-genotyped animals. However, a single-step method for <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of both purebred and crossbred performances has not been developed yet. ResultsAn extension of the Wei and van der Werf model that incorporates genomic information is presented. The extension consists of four steps: (1) the Wei van der Werf model is reformulated using two partial relationship matrices for the two breeds; (2) marker-based partial relationship matrices are constructed; (3) marker-based partial relationship matrices are adjusted to be compatible to pedigree-based partial relationship matrices and (4) combined partial relationship matrices are constructed using information from both pedigree and marker genotypes. The extension of the Wei van der Werf model can be implemented using software that allows inverse covariance matrices in sparse format as input.

Now we are in a period of massive global implementation of <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> which combines traditional BLUP with huge quantity of genetic SNP markers.

40|$|<b>Genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods today use single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) as genomic markers to trace quantitative trait loci (QTL). Today most genomic prediction procedures use biallelic SNP markers. However, SNP can be combined into short, multiallelic haplotypes that can improve genomic prediction due to higher linkage disequilibrium between the haplotypes and the linked QTL. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a method to identify the haplotypes, which can be expected to be superior in <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> as compared with either SNP or other haplotypes of the same size. We first identified the SNP (termed as QTL-SNP) from the bovine 50 K SNP chip that had the largest effect on the analyzed trait. It was assumed that these SNP were not the causative mutations and they merely indicated the approximate location of the QTL. Haplotypes of 3, 4, or 5 SNP were selected from short genomic windows surrounding these markers to capture the effect of the QTL. Two methods described in this paper aim at selecting the most optimal haplotype for <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> They assumed that if an allele has a high frequency, its allele effect can be accurately predicted. These methods were tested in a classical validation study using a dairy cattle population of 2, 235 bulls with genotypes from the bovine 50 K SNP chip and daughter yield deviations (DYD) on 5 dairy cattle production traits. Combining the SNP into haplotypes was beneficial with all tested haplotypes, leading to an average increase of 2 % in terms of correlations between DYD and genomic breeding value estimates compared with the analysis when the same SNP were used individually. Compared with haplotypes built by merging the QTL-SNP with its flanking SNP, the haplotypes selected with the proposed criteria carried less under- and over-represented alleles: the proportion of alleles with frequencies 40 % decreased, on average, by 17. 4 and 43. 4 %, respectively. The correlations between DYD and genomic breeding value estimates increased by 0. 7 to 0. 9 percentage points when the haplotypes were selected using any of the proposed methods compared with using the haplotypes built from the QTL-SNP and its flanking markers.

40|$|Two new genetic {{evaluations}} on carcass data, {{extracted from}} the Normabev database, have been developed by the UMT 3 G (Gestion Génétique et Génomique des populations bovines). The first (VB) is a multibreed evaluation of sires {{on their ability to}} produce veal calves. It evaluates sires of dual-purpose breeds Montbeliarde (MON) or Normande (NOR) and sires of beef breeds mated with dairy cows. The second (JB) evaluates sires of the MON, NOR and Simmental (SIM) breeds on their ability to produce young bulls for slaughter. The JB evaluation considers three traits simultaneously (carcass weight, age at slaughter and carcass conformation), the VB four (the same three, plus meat color). Heritability estimates are moderate to quite high for carcass weight and conformation (0. 12 to 0. 37, depending on the breed and the evaluation), lower for age at slaughter and meat color (0. 05 to 0. 27). Genetic correlations between carcass weight and conformation and between carcass weight and age at slaughter are favorable. Genetic correlations between JB traits on one hand and VB, milk production and female type traits on the other hand were also estimated. These correlations are low to moderate (favorable) between JB and milk production. Hence, meat production traits can be improved without compromising genetic trends on milk production traits too much.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundAs {{more and}} more genotypes become available, {{accuracy}} of <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> can potentially increase. However, the impact of genotype data on accuracy depends {{on the structure of}} the genotyped cohort. For populations such as dairy cattle, the greatest benefit has come from genotyping sires with high accuracy, whereas the benefit due to adding genotypes from cows was smaller. In broiler chicken breeding programs, males have less progeny than dairy bulls, females have more progeny than dairy cows, and most production traits are recorded for both sexes. Consequently, genotyping both sexes in broiler chickens may be more advantageous than in dairy cattle. MethodsWe studied the contribution of genotypes from males and females using a real dataset with genotypes on 15 723 broiler chickens. <b>Genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> used three training sets that included only males (4648), only females (8100), and both sexes (12 748). Realized accuracies of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) were used to evaluate the benefit of including genotypes for different training populations on genomic predictions of young genotyped chickens. ResultsUsing genotypes on males, the average increase in accuracy of GEBV over pedigree-based EBV for males and females was 12 and 1 percentage points, respectively. Using female genotypes, this increase was 1 and 18 percentage points, respectively. Using genotypes of both sexes increased accuracies by 19 points for males and 20 points for females. For two traits with similar heritabilities and amounts of information, realized accuracies from cross-validation were lower for the trait that was under strong selection. ConclusionsOverall, genotyping males and females improves predictions of all young genotyped chickens, regardless of sex.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to introduce a single-step genomic model, allowing a direct estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects, and to develop efficient computing algorithms for solving equations of the single-step SNP model. We proposed an alternative to the current single-step genomic model based on the genomic relationship matrix by including an additional step for estimating the effects of SNP markers. Our single-step SNP model allowed flexible modeling of SNP effects {{in terms of the number}} and variance of SNP markers. Moreover, our single-step SNP model included a residual polygenic effect with trait-specific variance for reducing inflation in genomic prediction. A kernel calculation of the SNP model involved repeated multiplications of the inverse of the pedigree relationship matrix of genotyped animals with a vector, for which numerical methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients can be used. For estimating SNP effects, a special updating algorithm was proposed to separate residual polygenic effects from the SNP effects. We extended our single-step SNP model to general multiple-trait cases. By taking advantage of a block-diagonal (co) variance matrix of SNP effects, we showed how to estimate multivariate SNP effects in an efficient way.

Beginning with August <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> carrier status is reported for all 127, 588 genotyped animals in the North American database but is slightly less accurate for those with 2, 900 markers or for imputed dams. Breeders should continue to use mating programs and index selection instead of direct selection against these haplotypes because their additive economic effects are small and are included in evaluated fertility traits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Genomic {{selection}} {{has been}} a valuable tool for increasing the rate of genetic improvement in purebred dairy cattle populations. However, there also are many large populations of crossbred dairy cattle in the world, and multi-breed <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> may be a valuable tool for improving rates of genetic gain in those populations. Multi-breed models are an extension of single-breed genomic models in which a genomic relationship matrix is used {{to account for the}} breed origin of alleles in the population, as well as allele frequency differences between breeds. Most studies have found little benefit from multi-breed evaluations for pure breeds that have large reference populations. However, breeds with small reference populations may benefit from inclusion in a multi-breed evaluation without adversely affecting evaluations for purebred performance. Most research has been conducted in taurine breeds, so additional {{research is needed to determine}} the value of multi-breed reference populations for composite and synthetic breeds that include both indicine and taurine cattle adapted to tropical climates. 201...|$|R
40|$|Three breeds (Fleckvieh, Holstein, and Jersey) were {{included}} in a reference population, separately and together, to assess the accuracy of prediction of genomic breeding values in single-breed validation populations. The accuracy of genomic selection {{was defined as the}} correlation between estimated breeding values, calculated using phenotypic data, and genomic breeding values. The Holstein and Jersey populations were from Australia, whereas the Fleckvieh population (dual-purpose Simmental) was from Austria and Germany. Both a BLUP with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and a Bayesian method (BayesA) were used to derive the prediction equations. The hypothesis tested was that having a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of genomic selection. Minimal advantage existed of either GBLUP or BayesA multi-breed <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> over single-breed evaluations. However, when the goal was to predict genomic breeding values for a breed with no individuals in the reference population, using 2 other breeds in the reference was generally better than only 1 breed...|$|R
40|$|For {{over ten}} years now, due to the {{regionalization}} of agriculture in Belgium, the Walloon Region has fully developed and still develops its own genetic and <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems. The aim is to allow breeders of this region {{to be able to}} use tools adapted to their specific needs. Since 2002, genetic evaluation systems for production and conformation traits have been routinely used. Likewise, genetic evaluation system for udder health (using somatic cell scores) has been routinely used since 2003, as well as for longevity since 2005, for female fertility since 2007, and for body condition score since 2010. Finally, calving ease has been evaluated by genetic evaluation system in routine since 2013. Therefore, these genetic evaluation systems allow the Walloon Region of Belgium to participate to the international MACE evaluations performed by INTERBULL for all traits nationally evaluated. Moreover, since July 2013, <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems have been used in routine for most of these traits, thus enabling the Walloon Region of Belgium to participate to the international genomic evaluations (GMACE) performed by INTERBULL. The purpose of this document is to give a synthesis of the systems developed and used to evaluate the Walloon dairy cattle. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGenomic best linear {{unbiased}} prediction methods {{assume that}} all markers explain the same fraction of the genetic variance and do not account effectively for genes with major effects such as the αs 1 casein polymorphism in dairy goats. In this study, we investigated methods to include the available αs 1 casein genotype effect in genomic evaluations of French dairy goats. MethodsFirst, the αs 1 casein genotype was included as a fixed effect in <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> models based only on bucks that were genotyped at the αs 1 casein locus. Less than 1  % of the females with phenotypes were genotyped at the αs 1 casein gene. Thus, to incorporate these female phenotypes in the <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> two methods that allowed for this large number of missing αs 1 casein genotypes were investigated. Probabilities for each possible αs 1 casein genotype were first estimated for each female of unknown genotype based on iterative peeling equations. The second method {{is based on a}} multiallelic gene content approach. For each model tested, we used three datasets each divided into a training and a validation set: (1) two-breed population (Alpine + Saanen), (2) Alpine population, and (3) Saanen population. ResultsThe αs 1 casein genotype had a significant effect on milk yield, fat content and protein content. Including an αs 1 casein effect in genetic and genomic evaluations based only on male known αs 1 casein genotypes improved accuracies (from 6 to 27  %). In genomic evaluations based on all female phenotypes, the gene content approach performed better than the other tested methods but the improvement in accuracy was only slightly better (from 1 to 14  %) than that of a genomic model without the αs 1 casein effect. ConclusionsIncluding the αs 1 casein effect in a <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> model for French dairy goats is possible and useful to improve accuracy. Difficulties in predicting the genotypes for ungenotyped animals limited the improvement in accuracy of the obtained estimated breeding values...|$|E
40|$|Some <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> models require {{creation}} and inversion of a genomic relationship matrix (G). As {{the number of}} genotyped animals increases, G becomes larger and thus requires more time for inversion. A single-step <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> also requires inversion of {{the part of the}} pedigree relationship matrix for genotyped animals (A 22). A strategy was developed to provide an approximation of the inverse of G (G− 1) that may also be applied to the inverse of A 22 (A 22 − 1). The algorithm proceeds by creation of an incomplete Cholesky factorization (T− 1) of G− 1. For this purpose, a genomic relationship threshold determines whether 2 animals are closely related. For any animal, the sparsity pattern of the corresponding line in T− 1 will thus gather elements corresponding to all close relatives of that animal. Any line of T− 1 is filled in with resulting estimators of the least-squares regression of genomic relationships between close relatives on genomic relationship between the animal considered and those close relatives. The G− 1 was computed as the matrix product (T- 1) ' D- 1 T- 1 where D− 1 is a diagonal matrix. Then, T- 1 G(T- 1) ' resulted in a new matrix that is close to diagonal and also needs to be inverted. The inverse of that matrix was approximated with the same decomposition as for approximation of the inverse of G (G− 1), and the procedure was repeated in successive rounds of recursion until a matrix was obtained that was close enough to diagonal to be inverted element by element. Two applications of the approximation algorithm were tested in a single-step <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of US Holstein final score, and correlation coefficients between estimated breeding values based on either real or approximated G− 1 were compared. Approximations came closer to G− 1 as the number of recursion rounds increased. Approximations were even more accurate and expected to be faster for A 22. Timesaving strategies are needed to reduce the computing time required for the algorithm. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Most <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> are {{currently}} based on multi step-approach that requires 1) traditional evaluation with an animal model, 2) extraction of pseudo-observations, and 3) the genomic model to predict direct genomic values (DGV) of candidate animals without own records. In the single step analysis the phenotypic records are combined directly with genomic information, {{and the resulting}} genomic enhanced breeding value (GEBV) already combine both sources of information optimally. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the feasibility of the TD single step model using phenotypic records of Nordic RDC cows, and to quantify the accuracy when using single step TD model. The results show that the use of phenotypic test-day records in single step analysis is realistic and easy to implement. Moreover, single step TD models give comparable results to original TD models and considerably higher GEBV validation reliabilities and validation regression coefficients. This indicates that inflation is smaller than with DGVs from sire model validations although it still exists. Thus, it provides a good alternative to the current multi step-approach...|$|R
40|$|French Breeding {{companies}} are {{very pleased with}} the work of breeding value comparisons carried out by Interbull. However they regret that the proof distribution phase in each country obeys rules that are so unlike each other that they are not comparable and often work to the disadvantage of foreign sires. On the beef side (Interbeef project) they hope for an international assessment service per breed. With the development of genomic selection, the Breeding companies reassert that Interbull must continue to produce unbiased breeding values from phenotypic data in order to maintain populations of international benchmark animals and must invest in <b>evaluations</b> combining <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Very recently Interbull provided validation procedures for genomic indexing of the different countries which had been impatiently awaited. Now we must see that they are implemented at grass roots level. The French Breeding companies think that support to some international breeds to construct their genomic selection tool or the implementation of a genotyping platform are the concern of special service provisions which must not slow down the implementation of priority actions...|$|R
40|$|Accurate <b>genomic</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{are less}} costly if many animals are genotyped {{at less than}} the highest density and their missing genotypes filled using haplotypes. Mixed density files for 45, 870 animals were {{examined}} by reducing half of young animal or all animal genotypes from the observed 43, 385 markers to a subset of 3, 209 markers. For young Holsteins genotyped with 3, 209 markers, the gain in net merit reliability was 79 % of the gain from genotyping 43, 385 markers. When half of the reference population had 3, 209 markers, gain was 90 % for young animals with 43, 385 markers and 73 % for young animals with 3, 209 markers. Gain was 66 % when all animals had only 3, 209 markers. Simulated gain in reliability from {{increasing the number of}} markers to 500, 000 was only 1. 4 %, but more than half of that gain could result from genotyping just 1, 586 bulls at higher density. Reliability improved when more reference animals were genotyped at higher density. Individual reliabilities can be adjusted to account for number of markers and success of imputation...|$|R
