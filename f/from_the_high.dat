5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E

5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident in the mountains of southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Hi-5 {{were formed}} in 1998 in Sydney, Australia as a children's musical group. Television {{producer}} Helena Harris, {{who had worked}} on Bananas in Pyjamas, co-created Hi-5 as a concept for a new television show. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans (The Miraculous Mellops, Mirror, Mirror) developed the series as preschool entertainment, incorporating educational trends with a pop music appeal, using music and movement to capture the attention of children. Featuring five performers, the cast are intended to act as older siblings of viewers, rather than adults teaching children. The name of the group was derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> five gesture.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, Sir George Makgill, Secretary of the Anti-German Union, {{applied for}} {{permission}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel, a German-born Privy Counsellor, {{requiring them to}} prove their right to hold that position. Makgill's claim was that the Act of Settlement 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application {{on the grounds that}} the relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E

5|$|In the south, the 3rd Parachute Brigade started {{crossing}} the River Dives on 18August, delayed {{by the need}} to build a crossing to replace the bridge destroyed by the division during Operation Tonga. By nightfall the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was engaging the German rearguard and the 8th Parachute Battalion reached the outskirts of Goustranville. The next morning the brigade advance continued into Goustranville, where they came under heavy artillery fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> ground at Putot. Their attack faltered and Gale decided to restart the advance that night. He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the start point along the Dives canal and railway line, while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} Preussen, Lothringen missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, though for {{different}} reasons. Preussen had been temporarily transferred to guard duties in the Baltic, while Lothringen {{was in such}} poor condition that Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the fleet commander, removed her from the squadron. Jutland proved to Scheer that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable {{to take part in}} a major fleet action, and so detached the II Squadron <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet. Lothringen became a guard ship in the Baltic after she left the battle fleet. The following year she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where she was used as an exercise ship, as well as to train engineers. She served in this capacity until the end of the war in 1918.|$|E

Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E

The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary {{near the town of}} Idabel, Oklahoma, which dips to 289 feet (88m) above sea level.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1915, Prinz Adalbert, {{in company}} with Augsburg and several torpedo boats, {{conducted}} another reconnaissance sweep toward the Åland Islands. While {{on the return}} voyage, she bombarded Russian positions at Libau. She ran aground off Steinort during the operation, and Augsburg struck a mine off Bornholm. After being freed from her grounding, the ship was repaired; Michelsen temporarily served as the detachment commander in place of Behring from 13 February to 9 March, when the ship was ready to return to service. Behring returned to Prinz Adalbert on 20 March. In the meantime, the Russians had briefly captured Memel. The Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) detached the II Battle Squadron, II Scouting Group, and two flotillas of torpedo boats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet to reinforce the forces in the Baltic. The ships began to make diversionary attacks to support the German Army's campaign to retake Memel; Prinz Adalbert supported one such operation, a raid of the II Scouting Group into the Bothnian Sea to attack Russian merchant shipping on 23 March. The following day, the ships <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Seas Fleet were recalled to the North Sea, leaving Behring's cruisers alone once again.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 1904, severe {{thunderstorms}} and tornadoes damaged {{hundreds of}} downtown buildings, causing USD $1.78 million ($ million present-day) in damages {{to the city}} and ripping spans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Bridge. In the 1960s, during urban renewal, Saint Paul razed western neighborhoods close to downtown. The city also contended with the creation of the interstate freeway system in a fully built landscape. From 1959 to 1961, the western Rondo neighborhood was demolished by the construction of Interstate 94, which brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.|$|E
