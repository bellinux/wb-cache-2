40|$|AbstractVoxel-based {{analysis}} of diffusion MRI data is increasingly popular. However, most white matter voxels contain contributions from multiple fibre populations (often {{referred to as}} crossing fibres), and therefore voxel-averaged quantitative measures (e. g. fractional anisotropy) are not fibre-specific and have poor interpretability. Using higher-order diffusion models, parameters related to <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> can be extracted for individual fibre populations within each voxel (‘fixels’), and recent advances in statistics enable the multi-subject {{analysis of}} such data. However, investigating within-voxel microscopic <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> alone {{does not account for}} macroscopic differences in the white matter morphology (e. g. the calibre of a fibre bundle). In this work, we introduce a novel method to investigate the latter, which we call fixel-based morphometry (FBM). To obtain a more complete measure related to the total number of white matter axons, information from both within-voxel microscopic <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> and macroscopic morphology must be combined. We therefore present the FBM method as an integral piece within a comprehensive fixel-based analysis framework to investigate measures of <b>fibre</b> <b>density,</b> fibre-bundle morphology (cross-section), and a combined measure of <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> and cross-section. We performed simulations to demonstrate the proposed measures using various transformations of a numerical fibre bundle phantom. Finally, we provide an example of such an analysis by comparing a clinical patient group to a healthy control group, which demonstrates that all three measures provide distinct and complementary information. By capturing information from both sources, the combined <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> and cross-section measure is likely to be more sensitive to certain pathologies and more directly interpretable...|$|E

The {{cross section of the}} motor unit has normal length. There are no signs of abnormal volume conduction characteristics.

The mean <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> in the normal subjects was 1. 5 +/- 0. 16, and in the incontinent subjects it was 2. 17 +/- 0. 28 (p less than 0. 001).

30|$|An {{unexpected}} {{finding in}} our research was {{a substantial increase}} in nerve <b>fibre</b> numerical <b>densities</b> at some time-points of experiment due to remodelling of Remak bundles. The first peak was at 14  days of fixation and the second at the end of consolidation phase. An increase in nerve <b>fibre</b> numerical <b>densities</b> and myelination of unmyelinated axons in Remak bundles was observed in the sciatic nerve of the rat after intraperitoneal injections of GDNF [22]. While the inductive effect of GDNF on osteoblasts proliferation is well known [23], expression of various neurotrophins and their receptors by osteogenic cells has also been shown [24]. It is possible that the fluctuations of numerical nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>densities</b> in the sciatic, peroneal and tibial nerves after tibial fractures reflect a regulatory role of the nervous system in fracture healing.|$|R
30|$|An {{increase}} in polyester <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> from 1.1 dtex to 3.3 dtex resulted in corresponding {{increase in}} air permeability of carded (RC 1.1  < RC 1.3  < RC 1.5  < RC 2.2  < RC 3.3) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 1.1  < RM 1.3  < RM 1.5  < RM 2.2  < RM 3.3) (Fig.  3). The increase in air permeability with <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> {{can be attributed}} to increasing yarn diameter with increase in <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density.</b> This in turn results in reduced specific surface area. Lower the specific surface area, lesser the drag resistance to passage of air through fabric and hence the observed increase in air permeability with the increase in <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density.</b> High porosity of plated fabrics knitted with fibres of higher linear density may also account for the increased air permeability. Other researchers (Raj and Sreenivasan 2009; Varshney et al. 2010) have also reported similar results in their studies.|$|R
30|$|Figures  5 b, c and 6 {{shows the}} effect of {{polyester}} <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> on trans planar wicking of carded (RC 1.1 –RC 3.3) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 1.1 –RM 3.3). It was observed that trans planar wicking decreased with the decrease in polyester <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density.</b> As the <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> decreases, number of fibres in the yarn cross-section increases resulting in large number of capillaries of small diameter (Das et al.  2008). Creation of smaller capillaries may create sufficient drag slowing the liquid movement (Varshney et al. 2010) and hence lower trans planar wicking of fabrics (RM 1.1 and RC 1.1) knitted with finer fibres.|$|R

We investigated large myelinated nerve fibres with nerve conduction study and small-nerve fibres with Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) (assessing thermal-pain perceptive thresholds) and skin biopsy (assessing intraepidermal nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>density)</b> in 24 consecutive patients with ALS, 11 with bulbar-onset and 13 with spinal-onset. In 23 of the 24 patients, regardless of ALS onset, nerve conduction study invariably showed large myelinated fibre sparing. In patients with bulbar-onset ALS, QST found normal thermal-pain perceptive thresholds and skin biopsy disclosed normal intraepidermal nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>density.</b> Conversely, in patients with spinal-onset, thermal-pain thresholds were abnormal and distal intraepidermal nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> was reduced.

40|$|Kisspeptins are potent secretagogues of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, {{playing a}} key role in puberty onset. These {{peptides}} are produced by distinct neuronal populations of the hypothalamus located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP 3 V) and arcuate nucleus (ARC). The present immunohistochemical study aimed to determine the spatiotemporal onset of kisspeptin-immunoreactivity (-IR) in the neonatal hypothalamus of male and female rats and to evaluate changes in kisspeptin-IR around puberty. Kisspeptin-IR cells and fibres could be detected from the day of birth in the ARC of both males and females. At this stage, only females displayed some kisspeptin-IR fibres in the RP 3 V. From postnatal day 7 to adulthood, males displayed lower levels of kisspeptin-IR than females in both regions. During infancy, kisspeptin-IR <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> in the female decreased in the ARC, whereas it increased in the RP 3 V. A sex-independent decline in RP 3 V kisspeptin-IR <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> was observed in the juvenile, followed by a peripubertal increase in RP 3 V and ARC kisspeptin-IR. These peripubertal increases in kisspeptin-IR occurred at different timings dependent on sex and region. In females specifically, the increase in kisspeptin-IR <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> occurred first in the ARC and later in the RP 3 V under constant levels of circulating oestradiol. In conclusion, the present study highlights the expression of hypothalamic kisspeptins soon after birth, as well as the neonatal establishment of a strong and persisting sex difference in ARC kisspeptin-IR in rats. Moreover, a female-specific desynchronisation of the ARC and RP 3 V was observed with respect to the increase in kisspeptin-IR <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> around puberty, which was not related to peripubertal variations in circulating oestradiol.

30|$|The {{effect of}} <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same yarn fineness, as the fibre fineness decreases, the number of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher decitex and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|R
40|$|The {{micronaire}} value for cotton {{is related to}} both <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> (fineness) and maturity however it is desirable to have independent measures of both of these parameters as they are both important quality measures of cotton. The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the technical potential of the Cottonscan instrument under development at CSIRO for measuring the average <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> of cotton lint samples. A newly developed snippet preparation module for sampling lint is described and an inter-laboratory round trial (three laboratories) was used to assess the precision of the instrument. Results confirm that the new snippet preparation device is both effective and easy to use. The inter-laboratory trial of the complete Cottonscan system (incorporating the new snippet preparation device) found no significant difference between laboratories/instruments for samples with average <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> values in the calibration region (within 50 mtex of the calibration cotton) and small statistically differences (typically 2 - 4 mtex) occurring only outside of this range. Overall the 95 % confidence limits for a single measurement was estimated to be ± 10. 4 mtex for average <b>fibre</b> linear <b>density</b> (fineness) and ± 0. 047 units for average fibre maturity values.

It is the site of neural-immune interaction with local dendritic cells reacting in response to environmental stimuli. Objective This study aims to investigate the effect of MS on corneal nerve fibres and dendritic cells in the subbasal nerve plexus using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Methods We measured the corneal nerve fibre and dendritic cell density in 26 MS patients and age and gender matched healthy controls using a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph® with cornea module.

In this investigation we have quantitatively described regional variations in elastic <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> in the anulus fibrosus of the human L 3 -L 4 intervertebral disc using histochemistry and light microscopy.

Thirty eight multiple sclerosis patients (20 incontinent, 18 incontinent) 73 normal controls, and 91 FI patients were studied. The FI group showed the characteristic combined sensorimotor deficit previously described in these patients of low resting and voluntary contraction and pressures, increased sensory threshold to mucosal stimulation, and increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies and <b>fibre</b> <b>densities.</b> MSI patients had significantly lower anal resting pressures (80 (30 - 140) cm H 2 O, median (range) v 98 (30 - 200), normal controls, p = 0. 002) and both MSC and MSI patients had significantly lower anal maximum voluntary contraction pressures (65 (0 - 260) cm H 2 O, MSC and 25 (0 - 100), MSI v 120 (30 - 300), normal controls, p = < 0. 0004) and higher external anal sphincter <b>fibre</b> <b>densities</b> (1. 7 (1. 1 - 2. 6), MSC and 1. 7 (1. 1 - 2. 4), MSI v 1. 5 (1. 1 - 1. 75), normal controls, p < 0. 006) compared with normal controls but pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies were similar and no sensory deficit was found. This contrasted with the idiopathic faecal incontinent patients who, in addition to significantly higher <b>fibre</b> <b>densities</b> (1. 8 (1. 1 - 3), p = 0. 001) had increased pudendal latencies (2. 5 (1. 1 - 5. 5) mS v 2. 08 (1. 4 - 2. 6), p = 0. 001) compared with normal controls. The idiopathic faecal incontinent group had significantly lower resting anal pressures (50 (10 - 160) cm H 2 O, p= 0. 02) than the MSI group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{study the}} process of denervation-reinnervation in {{multifocal}} motor neuropathy with persistent conduction blocks in clinically affected and unaffected muscles.  METHOD—Volitional single fibre electromyography (SFEMG) was performed in the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) of seven patients. The jitter, the <b>fibre</b> <b>density,</b> and the mean interpotential interval were determined. The results before and after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) between the unaffected EDC and affected EDC examined during the same SFEMG session were also compared. In addition the values of jitter, <b>fibre</b> <b>density,</b> and mean interpotential interval were analysed for correlation with the strength score on the MRC scale, {{the duration of the}} neuropathy, the number of IVIg treatment periods, and the radial nerve conduction block values.  RESULTS—Mean jitter, percentage of jitters> 60 µs, and impulse blocking percentage, were higher than normal in both the affected EDCs and to a lesser degree in unaffected EDCs. Jitter decreased significantly after IVIg and correlated only with the MRC score. <b>Fibre</b> <b>density</b> and mean interpotential interval were higher than normal equally in the affected EDC and unaffected EDCs, but no correlation was found with strength, duration of the neuropathy, number of treatment periods, and conduction block values.  CONCLUSION—The major finding is the presence of SFEMG abnormalities in clinically unaffected EDCs. This shows a process of denervation-reinnervation {{even in the absence of}} clinical symptoms, probably more frequent than commonly supposed in this neuropathy. The rapid clinical improvement after IVIg infusions could be due to remyelination after demyelination and to an interference of IVIg with the blocking effect of antibodies on the Na+ channels at the motor nerve endings. ...|$|E

40|$|The neuropeptide {{oxytocin}} attenuates {{reward and}} abuse for the psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH). Recent findings have implicated the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and subthalamic nucleus (STh) in oxytocin modulation of acute METH reward and relapse to METH-seeking behaviour. Surprisingly, the oxytocin receptor (OTR) is only modestly involved in both regions in oxytocin attenuation of METH-primed reinstatement. Coupled with the limited {{investigation of the}} role of the OTR in psychostimulant-induced behaviours, we primarily investigated whether there are cellular changes to the OTR in the NAc core and STh, as well as changes to oxytocin plasma levels, after chronic METH i. v. self-administration (IVSA) and after extinction of drug-taking. An additional aim was to examine whether changes to central corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and plasma corticosterone levels were also apparent because of the interaction of oxytocin with stress-regulatory mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to lever press for i. v. METH (0. 1 mg/kg/infusion) under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule or received yoked saline infusions during 2 -h sessions for 20 days. An additional cohort of rats underwent behavioural extinction for 15 days after METH IVSA. Subsequent to the last day of IVSA or extinction, blood plasma was collected for enzyme immunoassay, and immunofluorescence was conducted on NAc core and STh coronal sections. Rats that self-administered METH had higher oxytocin plasma levels, and decreased OTR-immunoreactive (-IR) fibres in the NAc core than yoked controls. In animals that self-administered METH and underwent extinction, oxytocin plasma levels remained elevated, OTR-IR <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> increased in the STh, and a trend towards normalisation of OTR-IR <b>fibre</b> <b>density</b> was evident in the NAc core.

The <b>density</b> of passing <b>fibres</b> and axonal terminals in distinct cortical columns in specific prefrontal projection areas was assessed by digital image analysis. Following layer III injections, <b>fibre</b> <b>densities</b> reached adult values between adolescence (PD 60) and adulthood (PD 90). However, layer V/VI-fibre densities decreased after eye-opening (PD 15), followed by an increase to adult values after weaning (PD 30). These findings are the first to describe dynamic structural changes even beyond adolescence of functionally diverse prefrontal output systems. External interventions might exert adverse influences on the establishment of integrated prefrontal networks especially during the early phase of re-arranging...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: This {{study is}} related to the design of {{advanced}} dermal scaffolds (non-woven fibrous mats) to provide multifunctional properties. Materials and Methods: The nanofibre fabric from poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) solutions in acetone were produced by electrospinning. Based on SEM and its stochastic fibre characterization, equivalent fabric was generated by computer. Fibres network was created by random deposition of elastic straight segments within a representative volume element (RVE). Elastic and permeability properties determined experimentally and numerically. Results: The fibres diameter produced fibrous structure depends on solution concentration and electric field, what have been identified by surface response methodology. Effective Young’s modules for fibrous network measured and predicted by numerical model depend on <b>fibres</b> <b>density</b> and <b>fibres</b> diameter. Calculated data for permeability and pore distributionwere compared with models for fibrous media with acceptable error level. Conclusions: Effective elastic and permeability properties are determined by separate computational models. The scaffold multiscale behaviour is commented with multiphysic design procedure...|$|R
40|$|Control of the {{solids content}} after vacuum {{dewatering}} {{is vital for}} efficient control and energy use of the paper machine. Dewatering is a complex function of many parameters such as fibre and pulp properties as well as settings on the paper machine and a predictive model for dewatering will require extensive and detailed studies of the occurring physical phenomena. The hypothesis investigated {{in the present study}} is that fibre width and <b>fibre</b> length <b>density</b> measured for <b>fibres</b> suspended in water can be used for estimating the achievable dryness in vacuum dewatering. The hypothesis was tested by comparing model predictions to experimental data for 11 different pulps. The results show that the dryness after vacuum dewatering can be estimated from the <b>fibre</b> length <b>density</b> and the <b>fibre</b> width for the fresh pulps using an elliptical fibre cross-section model with a ratio of 0. 48 between the short and long axes. For the dried pulps a lower value was needed to reach a good agreement...|$|R
