5000|$|Pursuant to the {{procedures}} {{set forth in}} Part 4 of Division 4, California workers' compensation disputes are heard before the Workers Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), which inherited the adjudicatory functions of the Industrial Accidents Commission. The IAC as originally created was far too small to hear all disputes directly, so it appointed referees who actually conducted hearings in its name, and then the IAC limited itself to hearing appeals from the decisions of those referees. Similarly, the WCAB today appoints workers' compensation judges who conduct hearings in its name in the hearing offices operated by the Division of Workers Compensation of the Department of Industrial Relations. The final orders of the workers' compensation <b>judges</b> <b>by</b> <b>default</b> become acts of the WCAB itself, unless a worker files a [...] "petition for reconsideration" [...] (in other words, appealing to the Board to reconsider {{the decision of the}} judge who acted on its behalf).|$|R
5000|$|Henri Guilbeaux (1885-1938) was a French socialist politician. Active in the Zimmerwald Anti-War Movement during World War I. He was a {{prominent}} figure {{of a group of}} intellectuals who fought in Geneva against the war; friend of Stefan Zweig, whose poems he translated in French. Zweig nonetheless criticizes him in [...] "Die Welt von Gestern," [...] saying that he [...] "was not a gifted person" [...] and that [...] "I must frankly denominate his literary ability as inconsiderable. His command of language was not more than average; his education was not profound. His entire power lay in controversy." [...] He published a magazine, [...] "Demain", that became a point of reference for all who were against the war. Among the other, on those pages wrote Lenin, Trotsky and Lunacharsky. Because of his political credo and his strong personality, he was <b>judged</b> <b>by</b> <b>default</b> in France and sentenced to death. He could escape in Russia, with the help of Lenin. Became a Communist and was active in the Comintern. Supporter of Trotsky. Pardoned by the French justice, he died, almost forgotten, in Paris.|$|R
50|$|So ended Silver's life, {{but not his}} undeath. When Dredd {{returned}} to rescue his city, Silver again fled and hid, fearing that in his undead state he would be summarily destroyed by {{the survivors of the}} disaster. Only when several months had passed did he dare to return to the city. On arriving once more in his Grand Hall of Justice in 2113, he discovered that in his absence his predecessor, McGruder, had reclaimed her office. He challenged her right to be chief judge, pointing out that she had resigned as chief judge whereas he had not. McGruder retorted that Silver was medically dead. However, since McGruder had dissolved the Council of Five there was no recognised authority with the power to decide the issue. The constitutional crisis was finally resolved when both litigants agreed to abide <b>by</b> <b>Judge</b> Dredd's verdict. Dredd actually ruled in Silver's favour, but then convicted him of gross dereliction of duty for deserting his command in time of war. Dredd executed Silver and McGruder became chief <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>default.</b> Silver's incinerated remains were unceremoniously swept away by a cleaner, a truly ignoble end for a head of state.|$|R
5000|$|In most versus {{fighting}} games, {{the objective}} is to deplete the opponent's health gauge. Fighters Destiny follows the same concept but also relies on a customizable point scoring system to determine the winner. These points, which are displayed as yellow stars under the character's health gauge, can be earned in a variety of ways. <b>By</b> <b>default,</b> knocking the character off the fighting platform (a [...] "Ring Out") is worth one point, taking down an opponent with a throw nets the player two points, while a typical K.O. is worth three points, as well as taking the opponent down with a counterattack, and executing a [...] "special" [...] is worth four points. Finally, if the adjustable time counter runs out, then the winner is awarded one point <b>by</b> virtue of <b>judge's</b> decision. <b>By</b> <b>default</b> setting, the first fighter to score seven points wins the match.|$|R
