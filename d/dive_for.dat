Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all {{have the capacity to}} hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|Strupper {{scored the}} second {{touchdown}} {{on a short}} drive set up by his 40-yard punt return. Early in the second quarter, Strupper shot through the line for 70 yards and the third touchdown. Tech's fourth touchdown required considerable effort and a methodical drive, ending in a 15-yard <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown by Strupper. End runs by Guyon and Simpson's line plunging set up the fifth (and final) touchdown with Guyon's 6-yard run. Strupper ran for 198 {{yards and three touchdowns}} on nine carries. Tech's starting lineup was Bell (left end), Fincher (left tackle), Thweatt (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Rogers (right tackle), Carpenter (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Armsley (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, Michigan {{relied on}} man-to-man defense from cornerbacks Woodson and Andre Weathers, blitzes and {{pressure}} from the four-man defensive line. Colorado only threw against Woodson five times, {{and one of those}} passes was intercepted by Woodson at Michigan's 45-yard-line. Griese and Tuman connected for 53 yards on the very next play. Two plays later Chris Floyd executed a one-yard <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> the first points of the day. Late in the second quarter, Griese completed a 29-yard pass to Woodson, and Kraig Baker kicked a field goal on the final play of the first half to give Michigan a 10–0 lead at halftime.|$|E

5|$|The Duke pursues {{the group}} onto the bridge, setting off mines {{as he tries}} to catch up. With Brain {{navigating}} through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and {{stands in the middle of}} the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E

2500|$|Recreational diving or sport <b>diving</b> is <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> {{the purpose}} of leisure and enjoyment, usually when using scuba equipment. [...] The term [...] "recreational diving" [...] may also be used in contradistinction to [...] "technical diving", a more {{demanding}} aspect of recreational diving which requires greater levels of training, experience and equipment {{to compensate for the}} more hazardous conditions associated with the disciplines. Breath-hold <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> recreation also fits into the broader scope of the term, but this article covers the commonly used meaning of scuba <b>diving</b> <b>for</b> recreational purposes, where the diver is not constrained from making a direct near-vertical ascent to the surface at any point during the dive.|$|R
25|$|The {{control point}} {{is the place where}} the {{supervisor}} can best monitor the status of the diver and progress of the <b>dive.</b> <b>For</b> scuba dives this is commonly on deck of the dive boat where there is {{a good view of the}} surface above the operational area, or on the shore at a nearby point where the divers can be seen when surfaced. For surface supplied diving, the view of the water is usually still necessary, and a view of the line tenders handling the umbilicals is also required, unless there is live video feed from the divers and two-way audio communications with the tenders. The control position also includes the gas panel and communications panel, so the supervisor can remain as fully informed as practicable of the status of the divers and their life support systems during the <b>dive.</b> <b>For</b> bell diving and saturation diving the situation is more complex and the control position may well be inside a compartment where the communications, control and monitoring equipment for the bell and life-support systems are set up.|$|E
25|$|In March 1995, Kaikō {{became the}} second vessel ever {{to reach the}} bottom of the Challenger Deep, and the first craft to visit this {{location}} since the Trieste mission.

On 31 May 2009, Nereus became the third vessel to visit {{the bottom of the}} Challenger Deep, reaching a maximum recorded depth of 10,902 meters.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the vessel provide a {{haunting}} and fascinating <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> anybody who ventures onto the site, the large boilers and {{remains of the}} bow and stern also create a unique and interesting dive. The remains are such that one only has to have little knowledge of the vessel to understand what features are present. On top of this, the site is significant simply as a dive site, the abundance of marine life that are present and the features provide a wonderful and popular dive.|$|E

25|$|Sea turtles spend {{almost all}} their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen needed {{to meet the demands}} of {{vigorous}} activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the brown}} pelican (P. occidentalis), the American white pelican does not <b>dive</b> <b>for</b> its food. Instead it catches its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than 4 pounds of food a day, mostly fish such as Cypriniformes like Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Lahontan Tui chub (Gila bicolor obesa) and shiners, Perciformes like Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) or Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), Salmoniformes like Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Siluriformes (catfish), and jackfish. Other animals eaten by these birds are {{crayfish}} and amphibians, and sometimes larval salamanders. Birds nesting on saline lakes, where food is scarce, will travel great distances to better feeding grounds.|$|E
