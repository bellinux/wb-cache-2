Flowering seemed to be related with a higher demand for nitrogen, Perennial versus annual populations did not show genetic variation in any of the response variables investigated. Comparisons with in situ data revealed that presumably the perennial populations in their habitats not fully exploited their potential for (above-ground) growth.

40|$|The {{production}} of adequate agricultural outputs {{to support the}} growing human population places great demands on agriculture, {{especially in light of}} ever-greater restrictions on input resources. Sorghum is a drought-adapted cereal capable of reliable production where other cereals fail, and thus represents a good candidate to address food security as agricultural inputs of water and arable land grow scarce. A long-standing issue with sorghum grain is that it has an inherently lower digestibility. Here we show that a low-frequency allele type in the starch metabolic gene, pullulanase, is associated with increased digestibility, regardless of <b>genotypic</b> <b>background.</b> We also provide evidence that the beneficial allele type is not associated with deleterious pleiotropic effects in the modern field environment.

40|$|Abstract. Unexpected drug {{efficacy}} or {{resistance is}} poorly understood in cancers {{because of the}} lack of systematic analyses of drug response profiles in cancer tissues of various <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> The recent development of high‑throughput technologies has allowed massive screening of chemicals and drugs against panels of heterogeneous cancer cell lines. In parallel, multi‑level omics datasets, including genome‑wide genetic alterations, gene expression and protein regulation, have been generated from diverse sets of cancer cell lines, thus providing a surrogate system, known as cancer cell line modeling, that can represent cancer diversity. Taken together, recent efforts with cancer cell line modeling have enabled a systematic understanding of the causal factors of varied drug responses in cancers. These large‑scale association studies could potentially predict and optimize target windows for drug treatment in cancer patients. The present review provides an overview of the major types of cell line‑based large datasets and their applications in cancer studies. Moreover, this review discusses recent integrated approaches that use multi‑level datasets to discover synergistic drug combination or reposi-tioning for cancer treatment. Contents 1...|$|R

Foi utilizado o delineamento em blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições e dez plantas por parcela. Os genótipos nor+/nor e rin+/rin não afetaram as características de produção. O genótipo nor+/norª atuou diminuindo a massa média por fruto. Os genótipos nor+/norª, nor+/nor e rin+/rin, isoladamente, atrasaram a perda de firmeza e a chegada da coloração vermelha nos frutos. O tamanho relativo da cicatriz peduncular não foi afetado significativamente por esses genótipos. A combinação og c+/og c hp+/hp proporcionou maior produção total e maior massa média por fruto no híbrido nor+/norª. A firmeza e a coloração dos frutos nor+/norª não foram afetadas pela combinação og c+/og c hp+/hp. O genótipo nor+/norª reduziu a produção precoce de frutos og c+/og c hp+/hp e aumentou a meia-vida da firmeza desses frutos.

40|$|Protein {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} crucial factor that affects physical growth and development and that increases morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. Efforts {{have been made to}} improve protein quality and quantity in crop plants but with limited success. Here, we report the development of transgenic potatoes with enhanced nutritive value by tuber-specific expression of a seed protein, AmA 1 (Amaranth Albumin 1), in seven <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> suitable for cultivation in different agro-climatic regions. Analyses of the transgenic tubers revealed up to 60 % increase in total protein content. In addition, the concentrations of several essential amino acids were increased significantly in transgenic tubers, which are otherwise limited in potato. Moreover, the transgenics also exhibited enhanced photosynthetic activity with a concomitant increase in total biomass. These results are striking because this genetic manipulation also resulted in a moderate increase in tuber yield. The comparative protein profiling suggests that the proteome rebalancing might cause increased protein content in transgenic tubers. Furthermore, the data on field performance and safety evaluation indicate that the transgenic potatoes are suitable for commercial cultivation. In vitro and in vivo studies on experimental animals demonstrate that the transgenic tubers are also safe for human consumption. Altogether, these results emphasize that the expression of AmA 1 is a potential strategy for the nutritional improvement of food crops...|$|R

Here, we purified iPSC-derived human dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) using the intracellular marker, tyrosine hydroxylase. Once purified, the transcriptomic profiles of iPSC-derived DaNs appear remarkably similar to profiles obtained from mature post-mortem DaNs. Comparison of the profiles of purified iPSC-derived DaNs derived from Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients carrying LRRK 2 G 2019 S variants to controls identified significant functional convergence amongst differentially-expressed (DE) genes. The PD LRRK 2 -G 2019 S associated profile was positively matched with expression changes induced by the Parkinsonian neurotoxin rotenone and opposed by those induced by clioquinol, a compound with demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in multiple PD models.

40|$|The {{genetic control}} of common traits is rarely deterministic, with many genes {{contributing}} {{only to the}} chance of developing a given phenotype. This incomplete penetrance is poorly understood and is usually attributed to interactions between genes or interactions between genes and environmental conditions. Because many traits such as cancer can emerge from rare events happening in one or very few cells, we speculate an alternative and complementary possibility where some genotypes could facilitate these events by increasing stochastic cell-to-cell variations (or ‘noise'). As a very first step towards investigating this possibility, we studied how natural genetic variation influences the level of noise in {{the expression of a}} single gene using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. Reproducible differences in noise were observed between divergent genetic backgrounds. We found that noise was highly heritable and placed under a complex genetic control. Scanning the genome, we mapped three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) of noise, one locus being explained by an increase in noise when transcriptional elongation was impaired. Our results suggest that the level of stochasticity in particular molecular regulations may differ between multicellular individuals depending on their <b>genotypic</b> <b>background.</b> The complex genetic architecture of noise buffering couples genetic to non-genetic robustness and provides a molecular basis to the probabilistic nature of complex traits...|$|E

To determine the genetic relatedness of O 157 :H 7 isolates to animal O 157 strains, we examined 194 O 157 isolates, representing 12 distinct flagellar antigens (H serotypes), obtained from a variety of animal and human infections. To characterize isolates, we assayed allelic variation at 19 enzyme loci by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Genotypic comparisons of isolates revealed extensive variation among 33 distinct clonal genotypes that differed, on average, at 44 % of the enzyme loci. K 88 fimbriae were expressed in 72 % of the isolates and occurred in a diversity of chromosomal <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Five major clonal groups were recognized; one group was clearly associated with porcine colibacillosis, and another was associated with human urinary tract infections.

Our objective for this study was to evaluate potential relationships between age and variation in gene expression across different regions of the brain. We analyzed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data from 54 and 101 tissue samples across 13 brain regions in post-mortem donors of European descent aged between 20 and 70 years at death. After accounting for the effects of covariates and hidden confounding factors, we identified 1, 446 protein-coding genes whose expression in one or more brain regions is correlated with chronological age at a false discovery rate of 5 %. These genes are involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, mRNA splicing, amino acid biosynthesis, and neurotransmitter transport. The distribution of these genes among brain regions is uneven, suggesting variable regional responses to aging. We also found that the aging response of many genes, e. g., TP 37 and C 1 QA, depends on individuals’ <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Finally, using dispersion-specific analysis, we identified genes such as IL 7 R, MS 4 A 4 E, and TERF 1 /TERF 2 whose expressions are differentially dispersed by aging, i. e., variances differ between age groups. Our results demonstrate that age-related gene expression is brain region-specific, genotype-dependent, and associated with both mean and dispersion changes.

However, {{little is known about the}} oocyst’s protein repertoires that contribute to differential virulence among T. gondii strains. Here, we used isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomic analysis of oocysts of two T. gondii strains exhibiting the virulent PYS (ToxoDB# 9) phenotype versus the less virulent PRU (Type II, ToxoDB # 1) phenotype. Our aim was to determine protein expression patterns that contribute to the virulence of a particular phenotype. A total of 2, 551 proteins were identified, of which 374 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (|log 2 fold change| ≥ 0. 58 and P < 0. 05). DEPs included 192 increased and 182 decreased proteins. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses revealed a large number of DEPs enriched in various metabolic processes. Protein interaction network analysis using STRING identified inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), Bifunctional GMP synthase/glutamine amidotransferase protein, Glucose- 6 -phosphate 1 -dehydrogenase, and Citrate synthase as the top four hubs. Of the 22 virulence proteins commonly expressed in the oocysts of the two strains, 13 and 2 proteins were increased in PYS strain and PRU strain, respectively. Also, 10 and 3 of the 22 identified oocyst wall proteins showed higher expression in oocysts of PRU strain and PYS strain, respectively.

The aim of this manuscript was to review main in vivo and in vitro knowledge about two particular integrase resistance-associated mutations: R 263 K and E 157 Q. The R 263 K mutation was the first mutation rarely found selected at time of virological failure in patients failing a first-line dolutegravir-based treatment. Further in vitro studies on R 263 K mutants showed a moderate increase in phenotypic resistance level and a drastic reduction in viral replicative capacity. No compensatory mutations were evidenced. The E 157 Q mutation is polymorphic, found between 1. 7 % and 5. 6 % of viral sequences issued from ART-naïve patients depending on the viral subtype; as well as acquired resistance emerging at failure of a raltegravir-based regimen in two case reports. We reported data on phenotypic resistance level of E 157 Q mutants and virological response of patients harboring a E 157 Q virus initiating an INI-based regimen, showing that dolutegravir {{might be the most}} recommended INI in such patients.

The effects of heterozygosity in the alcobaça locus (alc+/alc) on yield and fruit quality traits of tomato hybrids with three genotypic backgrounds. We evaluated three pairs of hybrids obtained from crosses between the near-isogenic pollen source lines Flora-Dade (alc+/alc+) and TOM- 559 (alc/alc), and three maternal lines (Stevens, NC- 8276 and Piedmont). The six treatments were factorial combinations of two different status in the alc locus (alc+/alc and alc+/alc+) versus three different genotypic backgrounds (maternal lines). Fruits were harvested at the breaker stage of maturation and stored in shelves at 21 ºC for 14 days. Yield and fruit quality traits were then evaluated. Regardless of the background, the alc allele in heterozygosis (alc+/alc) did not interfere with the total yield, commercial yield, average mass per fruit, average mass per commercial fruit, fruit shape, or with fruit peduncular scar diameter. The alc+/alc genotype reduced the rate of firmness loss and delayed evolution of the red color of the fruit, thus contributing to an increase of the post-harvest shelf life for all three genotypic backgrounds...|$|E

The HCV 5 ′ untranslated region mainly comprises an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) responsible for cap-independent synthesis of the viral polyprotein and is conserved among all HCV genotypes. Description: Considering the possible high impact of variations in HCV IRES on viral protein production and thus virus replication, we decided to collect the available data on known nucleotide variants in the HCV IRES and their impact on IRES function in translation initiation. The HCV IRES variation database (HCVIVdb) is a collection of naturally occurring and engineered mutation entries for the HCV IRES. Each entry contains contextual information pertaining to the entry such as the HCV <b>genotypic</b> <b>background</b> and links to the original publication. Where available, quantitative data on the IRES efficiency in translation have been collated along with details on the reporter system used to generate the data. Data are displayed both in a tabular and graphical formats and allow direct comparison of results from different experiments. Together the data provide a central resource for researchers in the IRES and hepatitis C-oriented fields. Conclusion: The collation of over 1900 mutations enables systematic analysis of the HCV IRES. The database is mainly dedicated to detailed comparative and functional analysis of all the HCV IRES domains, which can further lead to the development of site-specific drug designs and provide a guide for future experiments.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} differential expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) by AMPA and NMDA receptors, are unknown, but could involve G-protein-linked metabotropic glutamate receptors. To investigate this hypothesis we created mutant mice that expressed no metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5), but showed normal development. In {{an earlier study}} of these mice we analyzed field-excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPs) in CA 1 region of the hippocampus and found a small decrease; possibly arising from changes in the NMDAR-mediated component of synaptic transmission. In the present study we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CA 1 pyramidal neurons to identify the AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated components of LTP. Recordings from control mice following tetanus, or agonist application (IS, 3 R- 1 -amino-cyclopentane 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid) (ACPD), revealed equal enhancement of the AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated components. In contrast, CA 1 neurons from mGluR 5 -deficient mice showed a complete loss of the NMDA-receptor-mediated component of LTP (LTPNMDA), but normal LTP of the AMPA-receptor-mediated component (LTPAMPA). This selective loss of LTPNMDA was seen in three different <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and was apparent at all holding potentials (− 70 mV to + 20 mV). Furthermore, the LTPNMDA deficit in mGluR 5 mutant mice could be rescued by stimulating protein kinase C (PKC) with 4 β-phorbol- 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu). These results suggest that PKC may couple the postsynaptic mGluR 5 to the NMDA-receptor potentiation during LTP, and that this signaling mechanism is distinct from LTPAMPA. Differential enhancement of AMPAR and NMDA receptors by mGluR 5 also supports a postsynaptic locus for LTP...|$|R

In 2014, over 300 tons of copper oxide nanoparticles were manufactured in the United States. The increased production of nanoparticles raises concerns regarding the potential introduction into the environment or human exposure. Copper oxide nanoparticles commonly release copper ions into solutions, which contribute to their toxicity. We quantified the inhibitory effects of both copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on C. elegans toxicological endpoints to elucidate their biological effects. Several toxicological endpoints were analyzed in C. elegans, including nematode reproduction, feeding behavior, and average body length. We examined three wild C. elegans isolates together with the Bristol N 2 laboratory strain to {{explore the influence of}} different <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> on the physiological response to copper challenge. All strains exhibited greater sensitivity to copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate, as indicated by reduction of average body length and feeding behavior. Reproduction was significantly reduced only at the highest copper dose, though still more pronounced with copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on neurons, cells with known vulnerability to heavy metal toxicity. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was observed in up to 10 % of the population after copper oxide nanoparticle exposure. Additionally, mutants in the divalent-metal transporters, smf- 1 or smf- 2, showed increased tolerance to copper exposure, implicating both transporters in copper-induced neurodegeneration. These results highlight the complex nature of CuO nanoparticle toxicity, in which a nanoparticle-specific effect was observed in some traits (average body length, feeding behavior) and a copper ion specific effect was observed for other traits (neurodegeneration, response to stress) ...|$|R

The high-affinity cation transporter (HKT 1; 5) is located in the plasma membrane of the xylem, excluding Na⁺ from the parenchyma cells to reduce Na⁺ concentration. The regulatory mechanism and exact functions of HKT genes from different <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are relatively obscure. In this study, the expression patterns of HKT 1; 5 in A and D genomes of wheat were investigated in root and leaf tissues of wild and domesticated genotypes using real-time PCR. In parallel, the K+/Na⁺ ratio was measured in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivars. Promoter analysis were applied to shed light on underlying regulatory mechanism of the HKT 1; 5 expression. Gene isolation and qPCR confirmed the expression of HKT 1; 5 in the A and D genomes of wheat ancestors (Triticum boeoticum, AbAb and Aegilops crassa, MMDD, respectively). Interestingly, earlier expression of HKT 1; 5 was detected in leaves compared with roots in response to salt stress. In addition, the salt-tolerant genotypes expressed HKT 1; 5 before salt-sensitive genotypes. Our results suggest that HKT 1; 5 expression follows a tissue- and genotype-specific pattern. The highest level of HKT 1; 5 expression was observed in the leaves of Aegilops, 6 h after being subjected to high salt stress (200 mM). Overall, the D genome allele (HKT 1; 5 -D) showed higher expression than the A genome (HKT 1; 5 -A) allele when subjected to a high NaCl level. We suggest that the D genome is more effective regarding Na⁺ exclusion. Furthermore, in silico promoter analysis showed that TaHKT 1; 5 genes harbor jasmonic acid response elements.

The fitness and genetic effects of maize mutant su 1 were monitored through five successive selfing generations in two separated mean-generation designs. The first involved two inbreds with similar genetic backgrounds, while unrelated inbreds {{were used for the}} second design. Parents, F 1 s, F 2 s, and backcrosses were crossed to P 39 as the donor of su 1 and the 12 crosses were successively self-pollinated for 5 years. The su 1 frequency decreased linearly across selfing generations in both designs. Additive effects were significant for su 1 seed viability. However, dominance effects were of higher magnitude than additive effects, even though the dominance effects were not significant. Genetic effects depended on genotypes and environments. Therefore, the fitness of su 1 is under genetic control, with significant additive effects due to minor contributions of multiple genes.

METHODS: Frequency of the L 76 V mutation between 1998 and 2010 was surveyed in the laboratory database of 3 clinical centers. Major PI-RAMs were identified according to the IAS-USA list. Fisher's and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare variables. RESULTS: Among the overall 29, 643 sequences analyzed, the prevalence of L 76 V was 1. 50 %, while was 5. 42 % in PI-resistant viruses. Since 2008 the prevalence of L 76 V was higher in "non-B"-infected than in B-infected patients each year. Median time since diagnosis of HIV- 1 infection and median time under antiretroviral-based regimen were both shorter in "non-B"- than in B-infected patients (8 vs 11 years, P< 0. 0001; and 7 vs 8 years, P = 0. 004). In addition, "non-B"-infected patients had been pre-exposed to a lower number of PI (2 vs 3, P = 0. 016). The L 76 V was also associated with a lower number of major PI-RAMs in "non-B" vs B samples (3 vs 4, P = 0. 0001), and thus it was more frequent found as single major PI-RAM in "non-B" vs B subtype (10 % vs 2 %, P = 0. 014). CONCLUSIONS: We showed an impact of viral subtype on {{the selection of the}} L 76 V major PI-RAM with a higher prevalence in "non-B" subtypes observed since 2008.

Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) causes inflammation, and diabetes is known to exacerbate this inflammatory response in the kidney, whereas alarmin IL- 33 could act as an innate immune mediator during kidney IRI. Thus, the present study examined the impact of genetic IL- 33 receptor ST 2 deficiency (ST 2 -/-) on renal IRI in euglycaemic and hyperglycaemic mice. METHODS:Hyperglycaemia was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) in adult male C 57 BL/ 6 JRj wild-type (WT) mice and ST 2 -/- mice. Unilateral renal IRI was achieved 3 months after STZ treatment by left kidney nephrectomy (non-ischaemic control kidney) and clamping of the right renal artery for 32 min in STZ- and vehicle-treated animals. At 24 h after reperfusion, renal function and injury were determined by levels of plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and histological tubule scores. Also, in a complementary pilot clinical study, soluble ST 2 concentrations were compared in diabetics and non-diabetics. RESULTS:Urinary albumin was significantly increased in STZ-induced hyperglycaemic mice, regardless of <b>genotypic</b> <b>background.</b> At 24 h post-ischaemia, plasma creatinine, BUN and tubular injury were significantly reduced in ST 2 -/- mice compared with vehicle-treated WT mice, but this protective effect was lost in the STZ-induced hyperglycaemic ST 2 -/- animals. Plasma concentrations of soluble ST 2 were significantly greater in type 2 diabetes patients vs non-diabetics. CONCLUSION:Our data suggest that the IL- 33 /ST 2 pathway exerts differential effects depending on the glucose environment, opening-up new avenues for future research on alarmins and diabetes in ischaemia-related diseases...|$|E
40|$|Sunflower rust {{caused by}} Puccinia helianthi {{is the most}} {{important}} disease of sunflower in Australia with the potential to cause significant yield losses in susceptible hybrids. Rapid and frequent virulence changes in the rust fungus population limit the effective lifespan of commercial cultivars and impose constant pressure on breeding programs to identify and deploy new sources of resistance. This paper contains a synopsis of virulence data accumulated over 25 years, and more recent studies of genotypic diversity and sexual recombination. We have used this synopsis, generated from both published and unpublished data, to propose the origin, evolution and distribution of new pathotypes of P. helianthi. Virulence surveys revealed that diverse pathotypes of P. helianthi evolve in wild sunflower populations, most likely because sexual recombination and subsequent selection of recombinant pathotypes occurs there. Wild sunflower populations provide a continuum of genetically heterogeneous hosts on which P. helianthi can potentially complete its sexual cycle under suitable environmental conditions. Population genetics analysis of a worldwide collection of P. helianthi indicated that Australian isolates of the pathogen are more diverse than non-Australian isolates. Additionally, the presence of the same pathotype in different <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> supported evidence from virulence data that sexual recombination has occurred in the Australian population of P. helianthi at some time. A primary aim of the work described was to apply our knowledge of pathotype evolution to improve resistance in sunflower to sunflower rust. Molecular markers were identified for a number of previously uncharacterised sunflower rust R-genes. These markers have been used to detect resistance genes in breeding lines and wild sunflower germplasm. A number of virulence loci that do not recombine were identified in P. helianthi.

Results We evaluated the binding of epitopes in the vaccine to different alleles of the human DRB 1 Class II MHC protein using freely available epitope prediction programs and compared protein sequences from clinical isolates to the sequences included in the Mtb 72 f vaccine. This analysis predicted that the Mtb 72 f vaccine would be less effective for several DRB 1 genotypes, due either to limited vaccine epitope binding to the DRB 1 proteins or to binding primarily by unconserved PPE 18 epitopes. Furthermore, we found that these less-protective DRB 1 alleles are found at a very high frequency in several populations with a high burden of tuberculosis. Conclusion Although the Mtb 72 f vaccine candidate has shown promise in animal and clinical trials thus far, it may not be optimally effective in some <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Due to variation in both M. tuberculosis protein sequences and epitope-binding capabilities of different HLA alleles, certain human populations with a high burden of tuberculosis may not be optimally protected by the Mtb 72 f vaccine. The efficacy of the Mtb 72 f vaccine should be further examined in these particular populations to determine whether additional protective measures might be necessary for these regions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{our study}} was to trace the dynamic changes of hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) {{lineages}} in Italy, comparing the <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of contemporary isolates {{over a period of}} 17 years, with those of a sample of early MRSA strains from 1980. In total, 301 non-repetitive MRSA clinical isolates, recovered from 19 Italian hospitals between 1990 and 2007 were selected and analyzed for their antibiotic resistance, typed by PFGE and SCC mec, grouped into clonal-types and further characterized using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). A sample of fifteen early MRSA strains from 1980 was also used for comparison. The most interesting feature was the recent increase of ST 228 -MRSA-I (formerly the Italian clone; PFGE E) over the period 2000 – 2007 (57 %), when compared to the period 1990 – 1999 (29 %), and its stability to date, associated with a decrease of the highly epidemic ST 247 -MRSA-IA (formerly the Iberian clone; PFGE A), (23 % from 1990 to 1999, 6 % from 2000 to 2007). ST 1 -MRSA-I (1 out of 2 strains carrying ccr A 2 B 2), ST 8 -MRSA-I (4 strains), ST 15 -MRSA-I (1 out of 4 carrying ccr A 2 B 2) and ST 30 -MRSA-I (2 out of 5 carrying no ccr AB-types and ccr C) were the predominant earliest STs among the MRSA strains in 1980. A temporal shift in the susceptibility levels to glycopeptides was observed: strains with vancomycin MIC of ≥ 2 mg/L increased from 19. 4 % to 35. 5 %. In conclusion, we describe the alternation of MRSA clones that occurred in hospitals from 1990 to 2007 and the increase of the glycopeptide MIC levels, reflecting a worldwide trend. We document the detection of ST 1, ST 8, ST 15 and ST 30 in the 1980 isolates; we hypothesize their possible latency and their appearance as the current CA-MRSA clones. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} the L 76 V protease inhibitors resistance-associated mutation (PI-RAM) in relation with patients’ characteristics and protease <b>genotypic</b> <b>background</b> in HIV- 1 B- and “non-B”-infected patients. Methods: Frequency of the L 76 V mutation between 1998 and 2010 was surveyed in the laboratory database of 3 clinical centers. Major PI-RAMs were identified according to the IAS-USA list. Fisher’s and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare variables. Results: Among the overall 29, 643 sequences analyzed, the prevalence of L 76 V was 1. 50 %, while was 5. 42 % in PI-resistant viruses. Since 2008 the prevalence of L 76 V was higher in “non-B”-infected than in B-infected patients each year. Median time since diagnosis of HIV- 1 infection and median time under antiretroviral-based regimen were both shorter in “non-B”- than in B-infected patients (8 vs 11 years, P< 0. 0001; and 7 vs 8 years, P =  0. 004). In addition, “non-B”-infected patients had been pre-exposed to a lower number of PI (2 vs 3, P =  0. 016). The L 76 V was also associated with a lower number of major PI-RAMs in “non-B” vs B samples (3 vs 4, P =  0. 0001), and thus it was more frequent found as single major PI-RAM in “non-B” vs B subtype (10 % vs 2 %, P =  0. 014). Conclusions: We showed an impact of viral subtype on {{the selection of the}} L 76 V major PI-RAM with a higher prevalence in “non-B” subtypes observed since 2008. In addition, in “non-B”-infected patients this mutation appeared more rapidly and was associated with less PI-RAM...|$|E

To establish the utility of such cell lines as indicators of change relevant to urothelial cancer, we have characterised the expression of five genes (p 53, MDM 2, Rb, E-cadherin, APC) within a panel of human bladder carcinoma cell lines. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing, p 53 mutations were identified in 7 / 15 (47 %) cell lines reflecting events reported in bladder tumours. Immunohistochemical analysis of p 53 in cultured cells and in paraffin-embedded sections of xenografts from the cell line panel revealed discordant results. An absence of p 53 nuclear staining was associated with an exon 5 mutation in EJ and with multiple p 53 mutations found in J 82. Two cell lines positive for p 53 staining in the absence of detectable mutation displayed overexpression of MDM 2 (PSI, HT 1197) in Western blot analysis. Loss or aberrant Rb expression was recorded in 5 / 15 (TCCSUP, SCaBER, 5637, HT 1376, J 82) cell lines. Absence of E-cadherin was recorded in 5 / 15 cell lines (TCCSUP, EJ, KK 47, UM-UC- 3, J 82) with loss of alpha-catenin in immunoprecipitated E-cadherin complexes of CUBIII. Western blot analysis of APC revealed a truncated protein in 1 / 15 (CUBIII) cell lines. The characterisation of oncogenic events within this panel of human bladder carcinoma cell lines establishes a representation of change observed in bladder tumours and better defines the <b>genotypic</b> <b>background</b> in these experimental human cell models of neoplastic progression...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{environmental}} stressors, toxicants, and nutrient deficiencies can affect DNA in several ways. Some exposures cause damage and alter {{the structure of}} DNA, but there is increasing evidence that the same or other environmental exposures, including those that occur during fetal development in utero, can cause epigenetic effects that modulate DNA function and gene expression. Some epigenetic changes to DNA that affect gene transcription are at least partially reversible (i. e., they can be enzymatically reversed after cessation of exposure {{to environmental}} agents), but some epigenetic modifications seem to persist, even for decades. To explain the effects of early life experiences (such as famine and exposures to other stressors) on the long-term persistence of specific patterns of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, we propose an analogy with immune memory. We propose that an epigenetic memory can be established and maintained in self-renewing stem cell compartments. We suggest that the observations on early life effects on adult diseases and the persistence of methylation changes in smokers support our hypothesis, for which a mechanistic basis, however, needs to be further clarified. We outline a new model based on methylation changes. Although these changes seem to be mainly adaptive, they are also implicated in the pathogenesis and onset of diseases, depending on individual <b>genotypic</b> <b>background</b> and types of subsequent exposures. Elucidating {{the relationships between the}} adaptive and maladaptive consequences of the epigenetic modifications that result from complex environmental exposures is a major challenge for current and future research in epigenetics. -Vineis, P., Chatziioannou, A., Cunliffe, V.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a viabilidade do emprego isolado e simultâneo dos mutantes rin, norA, og c e hp em heterozigose, em genótipos de tomateiro, visando à melhoria da qualidade pós-colheita dos frutos. Foram avaliados 18 genótipos que diferem quanto às combinações entre estes locos em dois diferentes {{backgrounds}} (FloraDade e background experimental). Contrastes não ortogonais foram estabelecidos para quantificar os efeitos dos alelos mutantes, isoladamente ou combinados em um mesmo genótipo, em dois backgrounds, sobre a produção total e produção precoce de frutos, massa média, firmeza, coloração externa, teores de licopeno e betacaroteno dos frutos. Os alelos norA e rin em heterozigose, no background FloraDade, desaceleraram a taxa de perda de firmeza e reduziram os teores de licopeno e betacaroteno nos frutos maduros. As combinações heterozigotas entre o mutante rin e os mutantes norA, og c e hp aumentaram a firmeza dos frutos. O efeito do genótipo rin+/rin nor+/norA sobre a firmeza dos frutos foi o somatório dos efeitos individuais dos locos. O alelo rin mostrou-se, individualmente, mais eficiente do que norA, em prolongar a firmeza dos frutos. Os genótipos og c+/og c e hp+/hp, juntos ou isolados, aumentaram a coloração dos frutos rin+/rin. Recomenda-se a utilização dos genótipos rin+/rin nor+/norA no desenvolvimento de híbridos longa vida, buscando-se, contudo, backgrounds que sofram prejuízo menor sobre a coloração dos frutos e adicionando-se mutantes og c+/og c e hp+/hp. The {{objective of}} this work {{was to assess the}} viability of single and simultaneous use of rin, norA, og c and hp as heterozygotes in tomato genotypes in order to improve post-harvest fruit quality. Eighteen genotypes differing in combinations among these loci in two backgrounds (Floradade and experimental background) were evaluated. Contrasts were used to quantify the effects of single and simultaneous application of mutant loci, in two different backgrounds, on the total and early fruit yield, fruit mean mass, fruit firmness, development of external fruit color, lycopene and beta-carotene fruit contents. The norA and the rin alleles, used as heterozygotes in the FloraDade background, delayed the fruit softening and reduced lycopene and beta-carotene contents of mature fruit. All heterozygous combinations between rin and the mutants norA, og c and hp increased fruit firmness. The effect of the rin+/rin nor+ /norA genotypes on fruit firmness was roughly the sum of the individual effects of each locus. The rin allele was more efficient than norA to keep fruit firmness. The og c+/og c and hp+/hp genotypes, singly or in combination, improved colour of rin fruits. The combination rin+/rin and nor+/norA can be used in breeding for long shelf life tomatoes; however, <b>genotypic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> where fruit colour is less adversely affected should be sought or, alternatively, the colour mutant heterozygotes og c+/og c and hp+/hp should be used...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) represents {{the leading cause}} of central blindness in developed countries. The majority of severe vision loss occurs in the neovascular form of AMD, generally characterized by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) beneath the fovea. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) and drugs acting against vascular endothelial growth factor are the most commonly employed treatments for AMD-related subfoveal CNV. The combined use of both these strategies is the most promising therapeutic approach towards this harmful disease. The therapeutic action of PDT-V depends to a photochemical perturbation of thrombo-coagulative processes within CNV. Predictive correlations between peculiar coagulation-balance gene polymorphisms and different levels of post-PDT-V benefit have been recently documented in Caucasian patients with neovascular AMD. Particularly, heterozygous A-allele carriers of factor V Leiden 1691 or prothrombin 20210 gene are characterized by a greater possibility to exhibit clinical benefit after PDT-V. Both mutations induce thrombophilia increasing the thrombin generation in plasma and, thus, they can consistently intensify the photothrombotic phase of the therapeutic CNV occlusion. In prospect, considering the different individual susceptibility to PDT-V, a preoperative assessment of the <b>genotypic</b> thrombophilic <b>background</b> could optimize the eligibility criteria of this intriguing treatment. This review summarizes some of the recent published patents on treatment of neovascular AMD, with a particular attention to PDT-V application in combined therapeutic modalities...|$|R
40|$|The power {{provided}} by several sampling designs to detect segregation {{at a major}} locus was investigated in a simulation study using phenotypes constructed from a major-locus <b>genotypic</b> mean, a <b>background</b> polygenic effect, and an individual-specific environmental effect. Questions of which relatives, how many relatives, and how many independent pedigrees to collect were considered, using configurations ranging from nuclear families of size 5 to 4 -generation pedigrees of size 45. Each configuration contained a single proband whose phenotype exceeded the 95 th percentile in a population where 2. 5 % carry the disease susceptibility allele. Results suggest that, under the conditions simulated, when total sample size is fixed, samples composed of 3 -generation pedigrees of intermediate size provide a greater magnitude {{of support for the}} presence of a major locus than do samples composed of nuclear families or 4 -generation pedigrees.

40|$|A reduced {{response}} of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to its allosteric activator S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) {{has been reported}} to be a cause of CBS dysfunction in homocystinuria patients. In this work we performed a retrospective analysis of fibroblast data from 62 homocystinuria patients and found that 13 of them presented a disturbed SAM activation. Their <b>genotypic</b> <b>background</b> was identified and the corresponding CBS mutant proteins were produced in E. coli. Nine distinct mutations were detected in 22 independent alleles: the novel mutations p. K 269 del, p. P 427 L, p. S 500 L and p. L 540 Q; and the previously described mutations p. P 49 L, p. C 165 Rfs 2, p. I 278 T, p. R 336 H and p. D 444 N. Expression levels and residual enzyme activities, determined in the soluble fraction of E. coli lysates, strongly correlated with the localization of the affected amino acid residue. C-terminal mutations lead to activities in the range of the wild-type CBS and to oligomeric forms migrating faster than tetramers, suggesting an abnormal conformation that might be responsible for the lack of SAM activation. Mutations in the catalytic core were associated with low protein expression levels, decreased enzyme activities and a higher content of high molecular mass forms. Furthermore, the absence of SAM activation found in the patients' fibroblasts was confirmed for {{all but one of the}} characterized recombinant proteins (p. P 49 L). Our study experimentally supports a deficient regulation of CBS by SAM as a frequently found mechanism in CBS deficiency, which should be considered not only as a valuable diagnostic tool but also as a potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches in classical homocystinuria. © 2013 SSIEM and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{cholesterol}} synthesis are reported for several {{young children with}} homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFH) and are considered to contribute directly to their hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, increased cholesterol production has not previously been found in adult patients with HFH. Using the fecal steroid balance technique, we studied rates of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis in a 24 -yr-old man who had severe hypercholesterolemia typical of HFH and who lacked skin fibroblast low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity. On an average diet (45 % carbohydrate, 40 % fat, 15 % protein) mean +/- SEM cholesterol (24. 8 +/- 1. 4 mg/kg per d) and bile acid (11. 1 +/- 1. 6 mg/kg per d) excretion were approximately threefold higher than normal. When an isocaloric high carbohydrate, low fat diet (90. 5 % glucose oligosaccharides, 1. 3 % safflower oil, 8. 2 % crystalline amino acids was substituted, mean cholesterol (13. 0 +/- 0. 5 mg/kg per d) and bile acid (8. 6 +/- 0. 4 mg/kg per d) fell markedly. The decline in fecal steroid excretion was accompanied by modest reductions in plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations and by a softening of cutaneous xanthomata. Although the patient phenotypically and biochemically resembled the HFH state, his family pedigree was not noteable for hypercholesterolemia. While the patient's father had premature cardiovascular disease, his mother had no evidence of heart disease, had normal plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels, and had normal fibroblast LDL receptor activity. Likewise, the plasma cholesterol levels of three {{other members of the}} patient's family were normal.

40|$|Taste and aroma related {{compounds}} have been analyzed {{in a collection}} of four traditional varieties and two tomato hybrids, representing a wide variability in fruit shape and color, grown in different environments: screenhouse and open field. Protected cultivation tended to show lower sugar concentration (fructose and glucose) but similar acid contents (citric, malic, and glutamic acids). The decreased levels of sucrose equivalents and the similar ratios of sucrose equivalents to citric or glutamic acid contents indicated that protected cultivation, despite being useful to reduce the incidence of pests and viral diseases, reduces the organoleptic quality. Additionally, it doubles the interaccession variability and increased the level of intra-accession variability. In the case of aroma, the genotypic effect was considerably higher than the environmental component on the 12 main volatiles analyzed. Only hexanal and methyl salicylate were significantly affected by environment, while 10 out of 12 volatiles were affected by the genotype. Biplot analysis showed that, even in considerably different environments, it is possible to identify genotype-dependent main aroma profiles. In the case of 13 background volatiles, the environment showed no significant effects and the genotypic effect was lower, though it is possible to identify <b>genotypic</b> trends in <b>background</b> notes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: As {{the oral}} cavity is {{regarded}} as a relevant site for Staphylococcus aureus colonization and interhu- man transmission, this study aimed to investigate whether different oral conditions influence the rates of S. aureus oral carriage and genetic characters of S. aureus isolates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus was searched in samples collected from cheek, gingival mar- gin, and anterior nares of 45 healthy subjects, 27 peri- odontitis affected subjects, and 29 subjects with fixed prosthetic restorations. Isolates were screened for 17 genetic determinants, and Partial Least Square Discri- minant Analysis was performed to evaluate whether specific characters correlated with oral condition or site of isolation. RESULTS: The three subject groups showed comparable nasal carriage rates but, both the periodontitis and prosthetic restoration groups showed significantly higher oral carriage rates, as compared to healthy subjects (P = 0. 01 and 0. 02, respectively). Moreover, periodontitis affected subjects hosted strains possessing a distinct <b>genotypic</b> and phenotypic <b>background,</b> characterized by the presence of a larger number of exotoxins encoding genes. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that the oral cavity is an important site of S. aureus colonization and dem- onstrate that conditions modifying the oral environment, as the presence of periodontitis and of fixed prosthetic restorations, promote S. aureus carriage and may favor the spread of more pathogenic strains...|$|R

We estimated the clinical effect, cost and costeffectiveness of using GRT as compared to expert opinion in patients with antiretroviral treatment failure. Methods. We developed a mathematical model of HIV disease to describe disease progression in HIV-infected patients with treatment failure and compared the incremental impact of GRT versus expert opinion to guide antiretroviral therapy. The analysis was conducted from the health care (discount rate 4 %) and societal (discount rate 2 %) perspective. Outcome measures included life-expectancy, quality-adjusted life-expectancy, health care costs, productivity costs and cost-effectiveness in US Dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Clinical and economic data were extracted from the large Swiss HIV Cohort Study and clinical trials. Results. Patients whose treatment was optimized with GRT versus expert opinion had an increase in discounted life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy of three and two weeks, respectively. Health care costs with and without GRT were $US 421, 000 and $US 419, 000, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US 35, 000 per QALY gained.
