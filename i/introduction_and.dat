5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E

Earlier USMARC studies are reported to have evaluated high content pure French Limousins.|$|E
