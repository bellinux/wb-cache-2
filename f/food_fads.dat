40|$|The humble rural cuisine has {{now been}} thrust at the {{forefront}} of economic development strategies. This conceptual paper is a contribution to a growing critical awareness of the operations of the food industry and helps to foster a critical understanding of how, if at all, local food and its associated culture can help sustain rural tourism particularly and rural communities generally. It is inspired by literature about the international political economy of food and the many experiences of local food development, and is aware of the contrast between the structure of the industry and the hopes associated with its practice on the ground. The paper thus argues that, beyond the glamour and hype, there are those who gain, {{as well as those who}} lose, from the current <b>food</b> <b>fad.</b> While it explains the causes of the contemporary craze with food, the paper also interrogates the naı¨ve expectations often placed in food as a motor of rural development, and as the panacea for struggling rural communities.

40|$|Background : Behavioural {{disturbances}} are notable {{child health}} problem, {{the importance of}} which is increasingly recognized in most countries. A behaviour problem {{is nothing but a}} deviation from the accepted pattern of behavior {{on the part of the}} child when he is exposed to an inconsistent social and cultural environment. Aims & Objectives: To assess the prevalence of behavioural disorders in children of a rural community. Material & Methods: This was a village based cross-sectional study done among the children for the assessing the behavioural disorders. Results : Of the total 1157 children studied, 195 (16. 9 %) showed one or the other behavioural disorders. Various disorders elicited were bed wetting (11. 6 %), thumb sucking (3. 1 %), nail biting (1. 6 %) and <b>food</b> <b>fad</b> (0. 5 %). The disorders were more common in preschool children (34. 2 %) compared to school going age children (11. 0 %). Behavioural disorders were more frequent in children at extremes of birth orders (birth orders I & V) compared to others. The prevalence of disorders did not differ much in boys (16. 2 %) and girls (17. 6 %). Conclusions : The present study has reported a relatively higher prevalence of behavior disorders (16. 9 %) in children in a rural setting.

The present study investigated eating behaviour in normative samples of children aged 2 - 4 years (n = 304) and 7 - 9 years (n = 319). Mothers completed a questionnaire about their child’s eating behaviour (e. g., amount and range of foods eaten, enjoyment of eating, pickiness, <b>food</b> <b>fads)</b> and described their own approach to various issues such as dealing with food refusal and using food as rewards. The results demonstrated developmental trends in many aspects of children’s eating behaviour.

5000|$|Food {{shortages}} {{in a population}} are caused either {{by a lack of}} food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the <b>Food</b> availability decline (<b>FAD)</b> hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in <b>food</b> availability. However, <b>FAD</b> could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines. Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and {{it has been suggested that}} the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements, the theory being proposed is called the [...] "failure of exchange entitlements" [...] or FEE. A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements. An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that addictive behaviors related to consumption of specific foods could contribute to overeating and obesity. Although energy-dense, hyper-palatable foods are hypothesized to be associated with addictive-like eating behaviors, few studies have assessed this in humans. Objective: To evaluate in young adults whether intakes of specific foods are associated with ‘food addiction’, as assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), and to describe the associated nutrient intake profiles. Design: Australian adults aged 18 – 35  years were invited to complete an online cross-sectional survey including demographics, the YFAS and usual dietary intake. Participants were classified as <b>food</b> addicted (<b>FAD)</b> or non-addicted (NFA) according to the YFAS predefined scoring criteria. Results: A total 462 participants (86 % female, 73 % normal weight) completed the survey, with 14. 7 % (n =  68) classified as FAD. The FAD group had a higher proportion of females (p = . 01) and higher body mass index (p < . 001) compared to NFA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To test {{predictions}} that frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia {{give rise to}} distinct patterns of behavioural change.  METHODS—An informant based semistructured behavioural interview, covering the domains of basic and social emotions, social and personal behaviour, sensory behaviour, eating and oral behaviour, repetitive behaviours, rituals, and compulsions, was administered to carers of 41 patients with semantic dementia and with apathetic (FTD-A) and disinhibited (FTD-D) forms of frontotemporal dementia.  RESULTS—Consistent with prediction, emotional changes differentiated FTD from semantic dementia. Whereas lack of emotional response was pervasive in FTD, it was more selective in semantic dementia, affecting particularly the capacity to show fear. Social avoidance occurred more often in FTD and social seeking in semantic dementia. Patients with FTD showed reduced response to pain, whereas patients with semantic dementia more often showed exaggerated reactions to sensory stimuli. Gluttony and indiscriminate eating were characteristic of FTD, whereas patients with semantic dementia {{were more likely to}} exhibit <b>food</b> <b>fads.</b> Hyperorality, involving inedible objects, was unrelated to gluttony, indicating different underlying mechanisms. Repetitive behaviours were common in both FTD and semantic dementia, but had a more compulsive quality in semantic dementia. Behavioural differences were greater between semantic dementia and FTD-A than FTD-D. A logistic regression analysis indicated that emotional and repetitive, compulsive behaviours discriminated FTD from semantic dementia with 97 % accuracy.  CONCLUSION—The findings confirm predictions regarding behavioural differences in frontotemporal and semantic dementia and point to differential roles of the frontal and temporal lobes in affect, social functioning, eating, and compulsive behaviour. ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{issue of}} the degree of crop {{shortfall}} in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has come to dominate the historiography of the Bengal famine. The issue {{lies at the heart of}} a larger debate over the relative importance of <b>food</b> availability decline (<b>FAD)</b> versus the failure of exchange entitlements (FEE) as causes of famine. Both the FAD and FEE lines of thought would agree that Bengal experienced at least some level of grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown spot infestation. Crucially, however, FEE analyses do not consider it the main factor, while FAD-oriented analyses of scholars such as , , [...] and [...] hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor. [...] and [...] in particular argue that the impact of brown spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses. The signs of crop fungal infestation by Cochliobolus miyabeanus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.|$|R
40|$|Food {{entitlement}} decline (FED) and <b>food</b> availability decline (<b>FAD)</b> are {{two approaches}} to explaining famines that have different policy implications. One {{focuses on the}} systemic level, whereas the other {{is concerned with the}} individual level. They therefore analyse relatively distinct causal mechanisms. Thus, an important question is whether these approaches can be reconciled. Another related question is how FAD- and FED-based explanations relate to classical Malthusian views about rapid food requirement increase (FRI). This paper analyses these questions and argues that these three approaches can indeed be reconciled within a single framework by outlining the causal sources of FAD, FED and FRI. This task requires, among other things, the separation of ontological categories and empirical measures. As a consequence of this argument, the paper suggests that there are only seven possible ontological combinations of how a famine situation can arise as a direct cause. Simultaneously, it maintains that there are virtually an infinite number of ways in which these combinations may act as indirect causes (rooted in economic, political and social conditions). The analysis is exemplified by the Bengal famine of 1943 because that famine is a well-known case. The wider research and policy applicability of this general account are discussed but have yet to be tested in relation to other scarcity cases (water, land, fish). This synthesis is made possible by the incorporation of critical realist interventions into economic theory...|$|R
