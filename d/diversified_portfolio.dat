Aguiar began his career as a clerk on the floor of the NYMEX in 1999 where he focused on the energy markets, with particular emphasis on natural gas. Transitioning from daily trading activity to the long-term physical markets, Aguiar joined with his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, in 2001 to manage a portfolio of family investments ranging from venture capital to private equity and debt. During this time, he served as a director of several public and private companies and was given responsibility for creating a U.S.-based energy company focused on aggressive early-stage oil and gas exploration. After assembling a <b>diversified</b> <b>portfolio</b> of energy properties in Louisiana and Texas, ranging from unconventional natural gas to shallow oil, Aguiar identified and executed Leor's acquisition of its flagship property in the Deep Bossier of East Texas in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Kosmos {{collapsed}} in 1988 {{and was taken}} over by I. M. Skaugen. They aimed at divesting the <b>diversified</b> <b>portfolio</b> in the company in the aim of restructuring Kosmos as a pure shipping company, and placed Saugbrugsforeningen and other assets up for sale. Noegotiations for a sale to Norske Skog commenced on 12 January 1989. The company was valuated at NOK1.8 billion, although a purchaser also had to carry out the plans for a new paper machine, estimated to cost NOK3 billion. An important strategic consideration for Norske Skog was that it did not have any production of magazine paper, something the inclusion of Saugbrugsforeningen's production line would allow for. The take-over was approved by the purchaser on 9 November 1989 and effectuated on 1 December. The decision included approval of a new paper machine. Saugbrugsforeningen changed its name to Norske Skog Saugbrugs. Norske Skog paid NOK460 million in cash and took over NOK980 million in debt. The remaining NOK360 million was financed through issuing new shares. Kosmos thus received NOK820 million from their NOK100 million investment six years earlier.|$|E

500|$|The {{seeds for}} the risk parity {{approach}} were sown when economist and Nobel Prize winner, Harry Markowitz introduced {{the concept of}} the efficient frontier into modern portfolio theory in 1952. [...] Then in 1958, Nobel laureate James Tobin concluded that the efficient frontier model could be improved by adding risk-free investments and he advocated leveraging a <b>diversified</b> <b>portfolio</b> to improve its risk/return ratio. The theoretical analysis of combining leverage and minimizing risk amongst multiple assets in a portfolio was also examined by Jack Treynor in 1961, William F. Sharpe in 1964, John Lintner in 1965 and Jan Mossin in 1966. [...] However, the concept was not put into practice due to the difficulties of implementing leverage in the portfolio of a large institution.|$|E

These ideas have been started with Markowitz and then reinforced by other economists and mathematicians such as Andrew Brennan who have expressed ideas in the limitation of variance through portfolio theory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Combining survey {{responses}} and trading records of clients of a German retail broker, this paper examines {{some of the}} causes for the apparent failure to buy and hold a well-diversified portfolio. The subjective investor attributes gleaned from the survey help explain the variation in actual portfolio and trading choices. Self-reported risk aversion {{is the single most}} important determ-inant of both portfolio diversification and turnover; other things equal, investors who report being more risk tolerant hold less <b>diversified</b> <b>portfolios</b> and trade more aggressively. Less experienced investors similarly tend to churn poorly <b>diversified</b> <b>portfolios.</b> The effect of perceived knowledge on portfolio choice is less clear cut; holding other attributes constant, investors who think themselves knowledgeable about financial securities indeed hold better <b>diversified</b> <b>portfolios,</b> but those who think themselves more knowledgeable than the average investor churn their portfolios more. 1...|$|R
