5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} {{the determinants of}} the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> in Tanzania with respect to the role of household behavioural factors. This is achieved by attempting three interrelated research questions: i) What are the financial experiences of households in Tanzania? ii) What are beliefs held by households in Tanzania about the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> iii) What are the effects of household behavioural characteristics for intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> and subsequent usage of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed to achieve the research objective. The empirical findings suggest that behavioural factors matter for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Firstly, the examination of household financial experiences on a sample of 30 households through the application of financial diary methodology revealed a variety of household financial experiences that highlight the necessity of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> to households. Secondly, despite the fact that most households do not use <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> it is found that households hold positive beliefs about <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> for saving facilities, security, finance, money management and improving economic well-being. Thirdly, structural equations models indicate that attitudes towards <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> perceived behavioural control and subjective norms significantly impact the intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived behavioural control is observed to prominently influence the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> The study offers the following contributions: Firstly, it develops a behavioural conceptual framework that integrates financial and psychological perspectives. This framework facilitates a broader understanding of the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> from various perspectives. Secondly, it provides distinct insights into the influence of behavioural characteristics in the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> This adds to the limited empirical literature about the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> specifically the effects of behavioural factors. Based on the findings, implications for financial inclusion initiatives and relevant future research have been identified...|$|R
