40|$|Social Security Disability Insurance is {{projected}} to be insolvent {{before the end of}} the decade. How best to restore the program to long-term financial health depends on what has been driving its rapid growth. Demographic shifts and other predictable factors explain part of the increase. But a sizable share reflects increasing participation in the program across population groups. Curbing this growth is important for putting the program back on a sustainable fiscal path. Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) is a federal benefits program for working-age adults. The number of workers receiving DI increased from 2. 9 million in 1980 to 8. 8 million in 2012. Population growth explains part of this increase. But DI caseloads as a share of the population age 20 to 64 —known as the disability recipiency rate—also have risen rapidly over the past several decades. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects that, absent policy action, DI will be insolvent by 2016. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO 2013) projects a slightly later <b>insolvency</b> <b>date</b> of 2017. What are the factors that have driven DI growth? And will those factors stay in place or wane? These questions expose sharp disagreements among academics, Social Security actuaries, and disability policy advocates...|$|E

40|$|Fraudulent phoenix {{activity}} and sham contracting are well-recognised {{issues in the}} context of protecting employees’ remuneration entitlements, both during the life of a company and after it has collapsed through <b>insolvency.</b> To <b>date,</b> much of the emphasis in dealing with these problems has been on the businesses’ controllers. This paper takes a different approach and ponders whether at least some of these improper and illegal arrangements could have been devised and executed without some expert advice. It asks whether a more effective approach might be to target those advisers. Several cases have considered the liability of advisers as accessories to the company’s or directors’ breaches of legislation. While these are useful starting points, the lack of other actions against advisers, coupled with a general failure of professional bodies to caution against these illegal and improper behaviours, undermines the continued effectiveness of these decisions. A concerted effort — by regulators, courts and professional bodies — is required to ensure that advisers are persuaded that advocating these sorts of fraudulent schemes is simply not worth the risk...|$|R

This work deals with an important sector of private international law - international insolvency law. Owing to the breadth of the topic, the author has chosen to focus specifically on issues surrounding COMI (Centre of Main Interests) in the European context in conjunction with Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346 / 2000 on <b>insolvency</b> proceedings <b>dated</b> 29 May 2000 and its amendment in 2015. In addition to the description of the general parameters of European insolvency regulations he refers to the discussion regarding {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} COMI as the main factor for the determination of a court's jurisdiction for the initiation and conduct of insolvency proceedings with an international element, and tries to show (with references to several judgments of the European Court of Justice and national courts - among them the Czech courts) both the development of its application in practice and the development of the definition of COMI itself and criteria for assessment.

40|$|PhDThe {{ongoing process}} of {{globalisation}} has witnessed {{an increase in}} cross-border corporate insolvencies involving multinational enterprises (MNEs). Yet, national insolvency laws have proven themselves ill-equipped to handle such matters in an international setting. Responsible policy-makers and academics argue {{for the creation of}} a viable international insolvency approach. This debate has revolved around an "either-or" spectrum of (1) the theory of "Universality" that proposes a single court charged with implementing a single bankruptcy law to worldwide claimants, and (2) the theory of "Territoriality" that asserts each jurisdiction can only adjudicate the debtor's insolvency on a territorial basis and distribute local assets to local claimants. But, this debate yet has yielded no practical solution. This thesis suggests that these two theories are not mutually exclusive, and both may be utilized in developing a pragmatic and "better" international <b>insolvency</b> framework. To <b>date,</b> there has been one non-binding international instrument based on moderate choice of forum/law provisions: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the Model Law). Although the Model Law has significant merits, it falls short of the broader expectations minimally acceptable international insolvency system should fulfill. In addition, the regional European Union Council Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (the Regulation) has recently been enacted. This thesis will argue that, while recognizing the special sui generic nature of the EU framework, important lessons can be learned from this Regulation, and when combined with certain elements from a revamped Model Law approach, a "better" international insolvency framework may be found. The concluding observations of this thesis will touch upon a range of existing international vehicles that may be complementary or alternative vehicles to channel interim reforms.

40|$|Economic {{rehabilitation}} is {{the notion}} underlying Canada’s Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA), providing consumer debtors with {{an opportunity for a}} “fresh start” through the mechanism of bankruptcy or making a proposal to their creditors for payment of their debts on terms that allow them to rehabilitate their financial status. This article undertakes a comparison of consumer proposals and consumer bankruptcies, examining 5, 773 individual insolvencies in the past two years, with a view to discerning choices by individual insolvent debtors of insolvency proceeding. It compares causes of financial distress, income levels, quantum of debt and the assets of those filing proposals or bankruptcies. The data indicate that overextension of credit is a primary cause of insolvency, being 20 % to 24 % the primary cause across all cohorts. Home mortgage liability is significant for the Division I proposal debtors, but less significant for bankrupts, many of whom do not have equity in homes. Credit card debt is a serious problem across all groups. Credit card debt, unlike fixed loans such as mortgages, can quickly escalate, is owed at much higher interest rates that can rapidly compound financial distress, and the lack of a defined payment plan, other than a minimum payment, means that consumer debtors are not encouraged to pay these debts first, leading to longer term financial distress. Yet, to <b>date,</b> <b>insolvency</b> policy does not really factor the nature of this debt into policy development. Job loss and seasonal employment together are a significant cause of insolvency across Division II consumer proposal debtors (26 %), Division II business proposal debtors (33 %), and bankrupts (28 %), but less so for Division I proposal debtors (16 %). These data suggest that there are broader economic and social challenges that need to be addressed, as financial distress is often beyond the control of the individual debtor. To date, there is little linkage in Canada between economic stimulus and employment policy development and insolvency law policy development. Medical reasons are also a significant cause for Division II business proposal debtors (15 %) and bankruptcy (11 %), compared with the other cohorts. However, it is uncertain whether medical bills and lack of coverage, or medical problems resulting in inability to earn sufficient income are the real source of the financial distress. Equally, medical debt may be masked if consumer debtors have paid for medical bills by credit card on exit from hospital or particular outpatient services, as is the normal practice in some regions. The study offers both observations on the data and recommendations for future research and policy development...|$|R
