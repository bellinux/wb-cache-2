40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{changes in}} tax rates affect government revenue in a Romer-style endogenous growth model. Lower tax rates on <b>financial</b> <b>income</b> (returns to physical capital and intellectual property) do increase {{the tax base}} in this environment, {{but not enough to}} expand revenue from this tax alone. Lower <b>financial</b> <b>income</b> taxes stimulate innovation and enhance labor productivity in the long run. For plausible parameter values, this generates higher overall tax revenue for the government in response to a reduction in the <b>financial</b> <b>income</b> tax rate. The analysis reveals the dynamics of the economy to be very sluggish and for some variables non-monotonic. Halflives for many variables are on the order of decades, rather than years...|$|R

We find robust evidence of an adverse effect of both financial payments (interests and dividends) and <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> on {{investment in fixed assets}} by the NFCs. This finding is robust for both the pool of all Western European firms and single country estimations. The negative impacts of <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> are non-linear with respect to the companies’ size: <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> crowd-out investment in large companies, and {{have a positive effect on}} the investment of only small, relatively more credit-constrained companies. Moreover, we find that a higher degree of financial development is associated with a stronger negative effect of <b>financial</b> <b>incomes</b> on companies’ investment. This finding challenges the common wisdom on ‘finance-growth nexus’. Our findings support the ‘financialization thesis’ that the increasing orientation of the non-financial sector towards financial activities is ultimately leading to lower physical investment, hence to stagnant or fragile growth, as well as long term stagnation in productivity...|$|R
