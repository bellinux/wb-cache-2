The present manuscript represents a summary of recent work [1]. I. RADIO INTERFEROMETRY Visibility measurement: Radio interferometry is a powerful technique for aperture synthesis in astronomy [2]. Thanks to interferometric techniques, radio telescope arrays synthesize the aperture of a unique telescope {{of the same size}} as the maximum projected baseline, i. e. the maximum projected distance between two telescopes on the plane perpendicular to the pointing direction of the instrument. The portion of the celestial sphere accessible to the instrument around the pointing direction tracked during observation defines the original signal or image to be recovered.

Detailed parametric studies are performed with these expressions to determine the effects of different random errors and illumination tapers on parameters such as gain loss and sidelobe levels.

40|$|The {{amount of}} infomation about {{the angle of}} arrival of a plane wave {{incident}} on a line aperture is shown {{to depend on the}} bandwidth of the incident signal {{as well as on the}} extent of the aperture. Conventional antenna theory assumes the angular resolution of an antenna depends only on the aperture extent and illumination. However, by autocorrelation techniques further angular resolution can be obtained. This additional directivity depends on the extent of the signal bandwidth. It is shown for line arrays that the obtainable directivity information depends on the aperture ilhmination function and the autocormlation function of the incident signal. In view of the vast amount of information available concerning conventional antennas, the results of this paper have been related to conventional antenna theory.
