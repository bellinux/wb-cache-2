5000|$|More than 30 {{mutations}} of the BRAF gene {{associated with}} human cancers have been identified. The frequency of BRAF mutations varies widely in human cancers, {{from more than}} 80% in melanomas and nevi, to as little as 0-18% in other tumors, such as 1-3% in lung cancers and 5% in colorectal cancer. [...] In 90% of the cases, thymine is substituted with adenine at nucleotide 1799. This leads to valine (V) being substituted for by glutamate (E) at codon 600 (now referred to as V600E) in the activation segment that {{has been found in}} human cancers. This mutation has been widely observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma, colorectal cancer, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer.

40|$|The BRAF kinase is mutated, {{typically}} Val 600 →Glu (V 600 E), {{to induce}} an active oncogenic {{state in a}} large fraction of melanomas, thyroid cancers, <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukaemias</b> and, to a smaller extent, {{a wide spectrum of}} other cancers. BRAF(V 600 E) phosphorylates and activates the MEK 1 and MEK 2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the ERK 1 and ERK 2 kinases, stimulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to promote cancer. Targeting MEK 1 / 2 is proving to be an important therapeutic strategy, given that a MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor provides a survival advantage in metastatic melanoma, an effect that is increased when administered together with a BRAF(V 600 E) inhibitor. We previously found that copper (Cu) influx enhances MEK 1 phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 through a Cu-MEK 1 interaction. Here we show decreasing the levels of CTR 1 (Cu transporter 1), or mutations in MEK 1 that disrupt Cu binding, decreased BRAF(V 600 E) -driven signalling and tumorigenesis in mice and human cell settings. Conversely, a MEK 1 -MEK 5 chimaera that phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 independently of Cu or an active ERK 2 restored the tumour growth of murine cells lacking Ctr 1. Cu chelators used in the treatment of Wilson disease decreased tumour growth of human or murine cells transformed by BRAF(V 600 E) or engineered to be resistant to BRAF inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that Cu-chelation therapy could be repurposed to treat cancers containing the BRAF(V 600 E) mutation...|$|R

RESULTS: No association was found between <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukaemia</b> and previous employment in a job exposed to solvents (odds ratio (OR) 0. 9 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 6 to 1. 3).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (HCL) have an {{increased}} susceptibility to intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria and Listeria. Although several abnormalities of T-cell populations have been described in HCL, the effector mechanism responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections is not known. METHODS: Blood was collected from 11 patients with HCL and 22 age- and gender-matched volunteers. Proinflammatory cytokine production by freshly isolated mononuclear cells was stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide or various heat-killed microorganisms. Cytokine concentrations were assessed by specific ELISAs. RESULTS: We demonstrate that mononuclear cells harvested from HCL patients have a specific defect of IFNgamma production when stimulated with a broad panel of bacterial stimuli. In contrast, the production of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL- 1 beta and IL- 6, did not differ between HCL patients and controls. CONCLUSION: The specific defect in IFNgamma production {{may play a role}} in the susceptibility of patients with <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukaemia</b> towards intracellular pathogens...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>cell</b> leukemia is an {{uncommon}} B-cell lymphoproliferative disease of unknown etiology in which tumor cells display characteristic microfilamentous membrane projections.
