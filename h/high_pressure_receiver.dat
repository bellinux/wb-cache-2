40|$|Recent {{attempts}} to find energy-efficient thermal management systems for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have led to secondary loop systems as an alternative approach to meet dynamic heating and cooling demands and reduce refrigerant charge. As such, {{a thorough understanding of}} the vapor compression cycle, which serves as the central thermal supply unit, is required. In addition to design considerations concerning the type and size of components such as the heat exchangers or compressor, the refrigerant reservoir choice between a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>receiver</b> or a low pressure accumulator is critical for energy-efficient operation under varying operation conditions. In this work, two possible positions of the accumulator/receiver are experimentally examined and optimal control is applied. Therefore, either the superheating at the compressor inlet or outlet of the receiver system or the subcooling at the condenser outlet of the accumulator system are chosen as control variables and adjusted by an electrical expansion valve. Experimental results based on a simple automotive R 134 a primary loop system containing a scroll compressor are presented. Comparing these two different systems with a receiver or an accumulator, a receiver system shows a slightly higher COP under the examined operation conditions when operated optimally. However the receiver/accumulator position has a non-negligible impact on high and low pressure itself resulting in an advantage for the accumulator system in a cold winter scenario...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 111 - 114) Central receivers {{for solar}} power towers {{have recently been}} under intense investigation. They can convert solar radiation into electricity by supplying heat to a thermodynamic cycle. In particular, air-cooled solar central receivers can power gas turbine engines for electrical generation. Solar heating of the compressed air is realized in a pressurized volumetric receiver. A new type of receiver module consists of an insulated pressure vessel, closed by a quartz glass window and a mixture of small particles in air as working medium. The process {{has so far been}} investigated mainly in Spain, Israel, Germany and United States with different designs with varying power outputs, all below 400 kW. However, the critical part of the whole assembly is the window which transmits solar flux into the receiver. To overcome the drawbacks of the previously designed windows a new geometry was developed and an appropriate method of building it economically and commercially is suggested. The main focus of this project is to analyze different materials obtainable from the market, Optimize the window design of one large window and Ideal mounting arrangement. A part of this work is carried out by using Finite Element Analysis of quartz glass windows of different shapes using the commercial software Hypermesh and Solidworks. The analysis will be performed taking in to account the load and boundary conditions for the window design. The operating conditions for the receiver will provide a uniform 5 bar pressure distribution on the window. The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> makes <b>receiver</b> window design difficult, further analysis was done with considering different seal arrangements for window design and a better seal arrangement with reduced stresses on to the window is suggested. Finally a unique morphed geometry of the window was produced and a seal arrangement for it was suggested.

In {{order to promote}} evaporators overfeeding, an ejector circulates liquid from the low <b>pressure</b> <b>receiver</b> back to the intermediate <b>pressure</b> <b>receiver.</b> Since {{there is not a}} need for superheat at the evaporator exit, each evaporator expansion valve can be controlled by a signal representative, either of the evaporator load, or the evaporator performance, such as the air temperature at its inlet or outlet. When compared to dry-expansion evaporator systems, the proposed solution offers energy saving and smooth operating conditions, typical of flooded evaporators, while still maintaining a simple plant lay-out. The concept was experimentally validated: the evaporators were maintained in flooded conditions, while the ejector was able to promote liquid recirculation. Direct comparison with dry-expansion operations was performed. The suggested method is mainly intended for commercial refrigeration plants, where many evaporators are arranged in parallel...|$|R

The interaural differences are caused by sound diffraction and arrival-time differences, and consequently depend strongly on head size. In all tetrapods, the middle ear cavities are connected through Eustachian tubes and the mouth cavity. In mammals, the tubes are usually closed and very narrow, and this precludes a tight acoustical coupling between the ears. In contrast, the two ears of non-mammals (lizards, frogs, turtles, crocodiles and many bird species) are connected by wide Eustachian tube...|$|R

40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil {{reservoirs}} {{is always}} associated with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep reservoirs with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> are more prone to such leftover <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs to ensure higher ultimate oil recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs, the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir.
