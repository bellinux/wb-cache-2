60|$|Water was everywhere. The Elsinore {{was rushing}} through a {{blurring}} whirr of water. Seas creamed and licked the poop-deck edge, now to starboard, now to port. High in the air, over-towering and perilously down-toppling, following-seas pursued our stern. The air {{was filled with}} spindrift like a fog or spray. No officer of the watch was in sight. The poop was deserted, save for two helmsmen in streaming oilskins under the half-shelter of the open wheel-house. I nodded <b>good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{thousand}} pounds!"

60|$|I found Tony, the suicidal Greek, {{steering}} {{this morning}} when I came on deck. He seemed sensible enough, and quite rationally {{took off his hat}} when I said <b>good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> him. The sick men are improving nicely, with the exceptions of Charles Davis and O'Sullivan. The latter still is lashed to his bunk, and Mr. Pike has compelled Davis to attend on him.

6000|$|... "Sir Knight," [...] he {{said with}} some firmness, [...] "I have twice given you <b>good</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>to</b> which the absence of your mind hath, I presume, {{prevented}} you from yielding attention, or from making return. This exchange of courtesy is at your pleasure to give or withhold--But, as what I have further to say concerns your comfort and your motions in an especial manner, I will entreat you {{to give me some}} signs of attention, that I may be sure I am not wasting my words on a monumental image." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{has been}} {{chattering}} and clattering enough between them, {{but to no}} purpose. When any distinct word has been flung into the air, it has had no sense or sequence. Wherefore ‘unintelligible!’ is again the comment of the watcher, made with some reassured nodding of his head, and a gloomy smile. He then lays certain silver money on the table, finds his hat, gropes {{his way down the}} broken stairs, gives a <b>good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> some rat-ridden doorkeeper, in bed in a black hutch beneath the stairs, and passes out.|$|R
5000|$|Angela tells Gabriel {{that her}} {{disability}} originated with her parents' infidelities. Eleven years ago, {{when her father}} started her relationship with his mistress, Angela's illness appeared. When her mother began an affair with Kolbe, the doctors declared Angela's condition as hopeless. However, Kast dismisses the child's allegation as nonsense. The next morning Angela goes {{from room to room}} <b>to</b> say <b>good</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> her parents, and finds them naked with their respective lovers. During the day, as the adulterous Christs come to terms with their respective infidelities, Angela tries to play them and their lovers off each other.|$|R
