5|$|As critic Richard Roeper has stated, {{perhaps one}} of the strongest {{indicators}} of the influence of Sesame Street have been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> Bert and Ernie.|$|E
5|$|Rio Dewanto as Hendra (Ping Hen), {{the son of}} Tan Kat Sun and Lim Giok Lie. He {{constantly}} argues {{with his}} parents, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> running the restaurant.

5|$|After joyous family gathering, with Frasier and Sam {{alone in}} the living room, Sam tells Frasier that Sam left his fiancée Sheila, with whom Sam has a {{relationship}} for six months, at the wedding altar the previous day. Frasier assures Sam that Sam has wedding jitters and that Sam is ready to leave his old empty sex life behind {{in favor of a}} committed relationship. Frasier advises him to continue this relationship and to be always honest to her, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> leaving her at the altar.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl {{was portrayed}} by Dutch actress Carice van Houten in Race, a sports drama film {{directed}} by Stephen Hopkins about Jesse Owens. It {{was released in}} North America on February 19, 2016. To make her sympathetic portrayal acceptable to an American audience, the film dramatizes her quarrels with Goebbels over her direction of the film, Olympia, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> filming the African American star who {{is proving to be}} a politically embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany's claims of Aryan athletic supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E

25|$|He became {{interested}} in Marxism, while following the Russian Revolution of 1917.

5000|$|Talking <b>about</b> future success, <b>especially</b> boasting <b>about</b> it, is {{considered}} bad luck. It {{is considered}} {{better to be}} silent until the success has been achieved or to even sound pessimistic.|$|R
25|$|Regarding {{institutional}} reforms, {{the party}} was a long-time supporter of presidentialism and a plurality voting system, and came to support also federalism and to fully accept the alliance with Lega Nord, although the relations with that party were tense at times, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> issues regarding national unity.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{internal}} imagery can {{overwhelm the}} sensory input from external stimuli when sharing neural pathways, or if indistinct stimuli is perceived and manipulated to match one's expectations or beliefs, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> the environment.

25|$|Newcastle {{continued}} his march southward, however, and gained {{ground for the}} King as far as Newark-on-Trent, {{so as to be}} in touch with the Royalists of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire (who, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> Newark and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, were strong enough to neutralise the local forces of Parliament), and to prepare the way for the further advance of the army of the north, when the Queen's convoy should arrive from overseas.|$|E

This book {{contains}} several collected theories and myths about Khufu, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> the Great Pyramid. Though King Khufu himself is seldom mentioned, many Arab writers are convinced that the Great Pyramid (and the others, too) were built by the god Hermes (named Idris by the Arabs).|$|E
25|$|Of {{those who}} accept {{that there are}} inconsistencies, {{scholars}} such as Raymond Brown have examined contradictions in the Gospels, particularly in the infancy narratives of Christ. W. D. Davies and E. P. Sanders claim that: “on many points, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> Jesus’ early life, the evangelists were ignorant … they simply did not know, and, guided by rumour, hope or supposition, did the best they could”. More critical scholars see the nativity stories either as completely fictional accounts, or at least constructed from traditions that predate the Gospels.|$|E
25|$|In European policy, Alexander I {{switched}} Russia {{back and}} forth four times in 1804–1812 from neutral peacemaker to anti-Napoleon to an ally of Napoleon, winding up in 1812 as Napoleon's enemy. In 1805, he joined Britain in the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon, but after the massive defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz he switched and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) and joined Napoleon's Continental System. He fought a small-scale naval war against Britain, 1807–12. He and Napoleon could never agree, <b>especially</b> <b>about</b> Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810.|$|E
