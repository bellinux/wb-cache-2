5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E
500|$|The 2012 story [...] "The Savage Six" [...] {{sees the}} return of a symbiote-less Eddie Brock, who is intent on exterminating all of the symbiotes (resulting {{in the deaths of}} Scream and Hybrid). Crime Master forms the Savage Six: a team {{including}} Jack O'Lantern, <b>Death</b> <b>Adder,</b> Megatak and the Human Fly. Brock is involuntarily recruited onto the team after being possessed by the Toxin symbiote which Thompson stole for Crime Master in Venom #12. The Savage Six is sent after Thompson and his loved ones after he tries to murder Crime Master, resulting in Betty's learning Thompson's secret identity. Crime Master is ultimately unmasked as Betty's brother, Bennett Brant. Venom immolates Toxin and Brock, defeating Crime Master's remaining forces; Betty shoots Crime Master dead to save Venom. Venom later confesses his covert actions to the Secret Avengers. Jack O'Lantern escapes and goes on a killing spree to torment Venom, abusing his father's body; he is eventually defeated and incarcerated by Venom.|$|E

5000|$|Acanthophis is a genus of elapid snakes. Commonly called <b>death</b> <b>adders,</b> {{they are}} native to Australia, New Guinea and nearby islands, and {{are among the}} most venomous snakes in the world. The name of the genus derives from the Ancient Greek acanthos/ἄκανθος [...] "spine" [...] and ophis/ὄφις [...] "snake", {{referring}} to the spine on the <b>death</b> <b>adder's</b> tail.|$|R
50|$|In home console {{versions}} of Golden Axe, <b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> {{is accompanied by}} his son, <b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> Jr., and father, Death Bringer. These characters are palette swaps of the original <b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> sprite, with similar powers and abilities. In the Genesis sequels, Golden Axe II and Golden Axe III, Death Adder's role is filled by Dark Guld and Damud Hellstrike, both of whom bear a strong resemblance to <b>Death</b> <b>Adder.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Avengers series {{dedicated}} to the American Armed Forces, <b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> appears {{as a member of}} the Serpent Society. Unlike the original <b>Death</b> <b>Adder,</b> this version was not mute (which may indicate he is the Theodore Scott version).|$|E

40|$|Australian <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> (genus Acanthophis) {{are highly}} venomous snakes with {{conservative}} morphology and sit-and-wait predatory habits, with only moderate taxonomic diversity that nevertheless remains incompletely understood. Analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences and morphological characteristics of <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> in northern Australia reveal {{the existence of}} a new species from the Kimberley region of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, which we describe as Acanthophis cryptamydros sp. nov. Although populations from the Kimberley were previously considered conspecific with Northern Territory <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> of the A. rugosus complex, our mtDNA analysis indicates that its closest relatives are desert <b>death</b> <b>adders,</b> A. pyrrhus. We found that A. cryptamydros sp. nov. is distinct in both mtDNA and nDNA analysis, and possesses multiple morphological characteristics that allow it to be distinguished from all other Acanthophis species. This study further supports the Kimberley region as an area with high endemic biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Death</b> <b>adders</b> (genus Acanthophis) {{differ from}} most other elapid snakes, and {{resemble}} many viperid snakes, in their thickset morphology and ambush foraging mode. Although these snakes are widely distributed through Australia and Papua New Guinea, their basic biology remains poorly known. We report morphological and ecological data based upon dissection of > 750 museum specimens drawn {{from most of}} the range of the genus. Female <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> grow larger than conspecific males, to about the same extent in all taxa (20 % in mean adult snout-vent length,  =  SVL). Most museum specimens were adult rather than juvenile animals, and adult males outnumbered females in all taxa except A. pyrrhus. Females have shorter tails (relative to SVL) than males, and longer narrower heads (relative to head length) in some but not all species. The southern A. antarcticus is wider-bodied (relative to SVL) than the other Australian species. Fecundity of these viviparous snakes was similar among taxa (mean litter sizes 8 to 14). <b>Death</b> <b>adders</b> encompass a broad range of ecological attributes, taking a wide variety of vertebrate prey, mostly lizards (55 %), frogs and mammals (each 21 %; based on 217 records). Dietary composition differed among species (e. g. frogs were more common in tropical than temperate-zone species), and shifted with snake body size (endotherms were taken by larger snakes) and sex (male <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> took more lizards than did females). Overall, <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> take a broader array of prey types, including active fast-moving taxa such as endotherms and large diurnal skinks, than do most other Australian elapids of similar body sizes. Ambush foraging is the key to capturing such elusive prey...|$|R

50|$|The evil giant, <b>Death</b> <b>Adder,</b> has {{invaded the}} {{countries}} of Firewood, Nendoria and Altorulia and killed the royal families. A young hero from Firewood sets out on a quest to destroy the giant. To counter Adder's evil magic he needs to find the nine crystals {{of the royal family}} from Firewood. These crystals warded off <b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> until the king was betrayed by a minister who sold the crystals to Adder. <b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> has hidden the crystals in nine labyrinths. On his quest the hero visits numerous villages and discovers numerous people hiding from <b>Death</b> <b>Adder.</b> He can learn the Thunder, Earth, Fire and Water magics. He learns that the princess of Firewood is still alive and that he is the son of the king of Altorulia. After finding all nine crystals the hero is able to enter the tenth and final labyrinth where he must find the mythical Golden Axe, the only weapon that can harm <b>Death</b> <b>Adder,</b> before facing the giant himself.|$|E

40|$|Adaptations {{that enhance}} fitness in one {{situation}} can become liabilities if circumstances change. In tropical Australia, native snake species {{are vulnerable to}} the invasion of toxic cane toads. <b>Death</b> <b>adders</b> (Acanthophis praelongus) are ambush foragers that (i) attract vertebrate prey by caudal luring and (ii) handle anuran prey by killing the frog then waiting until the frog's chemical defences degrade before ingesting it. These tactics render <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> vulnerable to toxic cane toads (Bufo marinus), because toads elicit caudal luring more effectively than do native frogs, and are more readily attracted to the lure. Moreover, the strategy of delaying ingestion of a toad after the strike does not prevent fatal poisoning, because toad toxins (unlike those of native frogs) do not degrade shortly after the prey dies. In our laboratory and field trials, half of the <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> died after ingesting a toad, showing that the specialized predatory behaviours <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> use to capture and process prey render them vulnerable to this novel prey type. The toads' strong response to caudal luring also renders them less fit than native anurans (which largely ignored the lure) : all toads bitten by adders died. Together, these results illustrate the dissonance in behavioural adaptations that can arise following the arrival of invasive species, and reveal the strong selection that occurs when mutually naive species first interact...|$|R
50|$|Desert <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> {{are members}} of the Acanthophis genus, highly venomous elapids with short and thick bodies, {{triangular}} heads, mobile fangs, and a thin tapering tail. They grow to lengths up to 70 centimeters, with a snout to vent length of 62 cm, and have a flattened appearance. Desert <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> are coloured brick-red, or yellow-reddish, with strong or inconspicuous yellow bands which are camouflaged with their surroundings. The tail tip is used as a lure to attract potential prey and is distinctively darker in colour. Their fangs are longer than most of Australia’s venomous snakes.|$|R
50|$|Desert <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> {{are found}} in living in remote areas, amongst {{porcupine}} grass, stony flats, sandy ridges and rocky outcrops of Central and Western Australia. In southwest Australia they occur in hummock grass in mallee.|$|R
50|$|<b>Death</b> <b>Adder</b> later {{appears as}} part of the new Crime Master's {{syndicate}} that serves as the main antagonist in the 2010 Venom series.

50|$|The common <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> (Acanthophis antarcticus) is {{a species}} of <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> native to Australia. It {{is one of the}} most venomous land snakes in Australia and globally. While it remains {{widespread}} (unlike related species), it is facing increased threat from the ongoing Australian cane toad invasion.|$|E
50|$|Common death adders eat {{small mammals}} and birds {{as a primary}} diet. Unlike other snakes, the common <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> lies in wait for its prey (often for many days) until a meal passes. It covers itself with leaves—making itself inconspicuous—and lies coiled in ambush, {{twitching}} its grub-like tail close to its head as a lure. When an animal approaches to investigate the movement, the <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> quickly strikes, injecting its venom and then waits for the victim to die before eating it. The <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> is not aggressive and less {{of a threat to}} humans.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Death</b> <b>adders</b> can inject {{on average}} 40-100 mg of highly toxic venom with a bite. The [...] of the venom was {{reported}} as 0.4-0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous {{and it is}} completely neurotoxic, containing neither haemotoxins nor myotoxins, unlike most venomous snakes.|$|R
50|$|It {{remains unclear}} how many species this genus includes. Traditionally, only A. antarcticus, A. praelongus and A. pyrrhus have been recognized. In 1998 five new species were {{described}} (A. barnetti, A. crotalusei, A. cummingi, A. wellsei and A. woolfi) and in 2002 an additional three were described (A. groenveldi, A. macgregori and A. yuwoni). These were received with scepticism, and only A. wellsi, where an extended description has been published, {{has been widely}} recognized. Further confusion exists over the <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They have variously been placed in A. antarcticus or A. praelongus. In 2005 it was shown that neither is appropriate, and the New Guinea <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> fall into two main clades: The rather smooth-scaled A. laevis complex (including <b>death</b> <b>adders</b> from Seram), and the rough-scaled A. rugosus complex. The latter {{can be divided into}} two sub-clades; one, A. rugosus sensu stricto, from southern New Guinea, and a second, A. hawkei, from northern Queensland and the Northern Territory in Australia. It is likely some of these include more than one species, as populations included in e.g. A. laevis show extensive variation in both pattern and scalation.|$|R

5000|$|Death adders were {{originally}} called [...] "deaf adders" [...] by early settlers of Australia.Unlike other snakes {{that tend to}} run away from human disturbance, the <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> is inclined to hold its ground, leading to the notion that the <b>death</b> <b>adder</b> cannot hear.

50|$|As well as {{the native}} <b>death</b> <b>adders,</b> tiger snakes, and several species of lizard {{including}} goannas, many of the islands have introduced mammals such as feral cats, house mice or chinchilla rabbits.
