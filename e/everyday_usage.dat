2500|$|The diction of Plautus, {{who used}} the colloquial speech of his own day, is {{distinctive}} and non-standard {{from the point of}} view of the later, classical period. M. Hammond, A.H. Mack, and W. Moskalew have noted in the introduction to their edition of the Miles Gloriosus that Plautus was [...] "free from convention... sought to reproduce the easy tone of daily speech rather than the formal regularity of oratory or poetry. Hence, many of the irregularities which have troubled scribes and scholars perhaps merely reflect the <b>everyday</b> <b>usages</b> of the careless and untrained tongues which Plautus heard about him." [...] Looking at the overall use of archaic forms in Plautus, one notes that they commonly occur in promises, agreements, threats, prologues, or speeches. Plautus's archaic forms are metrically convenient, but may also have had a stylistic effect on his original audience.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater <b>everyday</b> <b>usage.</b>|$|E
5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in <b>everyday</b> <b>usage</b> also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{somewhat}} exotic {{field of study}} called the history and sociology of science. It basically try to describe and explain the factors {{that are involved in}} the initiation and growth of any area of organized study. Among other findings, it has been discovered that there are some predictable stages in the development of concepts used in any scientific area. Typically and particularly in a relatively new field of research, the earlier workers in the area, almost inevitably start out using everyday terms and labels to describe and explain whatever they are studying. Then as the scientific field develops, certain distinctions begin to be made. Certain phenomena which are put together by everyday labels are analytically pulled apart and given different labels, whereas other phenomena which are not treated under the same name by ordinary discourse are conversely put together in the scientific conceptualizations. Eventually, as the field matures, new and different from everyday terminology terms and labels are often created and used as major concepts in the area. In this last stage, both the names for the concepts and the phenomena being conceptualized are frequently rather different from the original <b>everyday</b> <b>usages...</b>|$|R

25|$|Varieties of Hokkien are {{spoken in}} Fujian Province in {{mainland}} China, Taiwan, Chinese communities in Malaysia, Singapore, and other Chinese expatriate communities. Initially {{there was no}} effort {{by the government of}} the Republic of China on Taiwan, nor other governments, to create a standardized Hokkien vernacular. During the initial stages of Kuomintang rule in Taiwan, the official Kuomintang language policy was to promote the use of Mandarin Chinese in everyday speech, and to discourage the use of other dialects such as Hokkien and Hakka; this was done in an attempt to promote national linguistic unity, and to promulgate a Chinese identity over that of a Taiwanese one for political reasons. Following the Taiwan localization movement, education and <b>everyday</b> <b>usage</b> of spoken and written Hokkien by local Taiwanese became more widely used. A Chinese character online dictionary for Hokkien was released in 2008 by the ROC Ministry of Education. Nevertheless, within literature circles there is still ongoing debate over which writing system should be used to write Taiwanese Hokkien, and controversy exists between the various rival systems currently used to write Hokkien. Today usage of languages remains a politicized issue in Taiwan. In Singapore, in an effort to promote Mandarin as a lingua franca amongst ethnic Chinese through the Speak Mandarin Campaign, usage of other varieties such as Hokkien is discouraged.|$|E
