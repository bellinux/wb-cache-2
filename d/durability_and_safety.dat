50|$|Because a stiff wheel {{rolling on}} a rigid rail {{requires}} far less energy per ton-mile moved than road transport (with a highly compliant wheel on an uneven surface), railroads are highly {{suitable for the}} movement of dense, bulk goods such as coal and other minerals. This was an incentive to experiment with many configurations and shapes of wheels and rails. In the late 1760s, the Coalbrookdale Company began to fix plates of cast iron to the upper surface of the wooden rails. These (and earlier railways) had flanged wheels as on modern railways, but another system was introduced, in which unflanged wheels ran on L-shaped metal plates - these became known as plateways. John Curr, a Sheffield colliery manager, invented this flanged rail, though the exact date of this is disputed. The plate rail was taken up by Benjamin Outram for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his Butterley ironworks. Meanwhile, William Jessop, a civil engineer, had used a form of edge rail successfully for an extension to the Charnwood Forest Canal at Nanpantan, Loughborough, Leicestershire in 1789. Jessop became {{a partner in the}} Butterley Company in 1790. The flanged wheel eventually proved its superiority due to its performance on curves, and the composite iron/wood rail was replaced by an all-metal rail, with its vastly superior stiffness, <b>durability,</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety.</b>|$|E
50|$|Listing and {{approval}} use and compliance is {{the activity of}} adhering to specific testing requirements designed to establish minimum performance for the installation or use of safety-related products and materials in conformance with an active certification listing or approval that has been issued by an organization that is accredited both for testing and product certification, such as those issued by Underwriters Laboratories, NTA Inc, FM Global, American Nuclear Insurers, or the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt). In concept, if a product, such as a fire door or a fire extinguisher, or a toaster {{is used in the}} intended manner the use of the component or system will perform as described in the listing and/or approval. The listing or test is often cited by a regulation, such as a building code or a fire code, and becomes enforcable through adopted codes or regulations. This concept is known as bounding in the nuclear industry. Products whose use is not mandated by any building codes or fire codes often lack a consensus test method. Unless there is a test standard in existence to prove the functionality and reliability of such a product, there can be no certification listing. Many authorities are charged to review and approve results from qualified testing agencies, when for the purpose intended, the evidence shows compliance for a material, product or construction method that provides equivalent strength, quality, fire resistance, <b>durability</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> when evaluated through general engineering practices.|$|E

50|$|Solid wall masonry fences, {{typically}} either brick or fieldstone, are a type {{of horse}} fencing with an ancient tradition.

50|$|Fighter kites {{are known}} as volantín. They are square shaped, and made with light paper and bamboo sticks. Unlike other square fighter kites of the world, the Chilean volantín uses 3 support threads (two {{at the top and}} one at the bottom) for easier, more stable manoeuvre. Whilst used widely for {{decorative}} purposes, the tail of the Chilean volantín is not used during competitive matches. The Chilean volantín can also vary in size, ranging from ñecla as the smallest size available, to pavo as the largest. However, in the context of kite fighting medio pavo or medium sized kites are the most popular choice due to their more balanced performance in terms of speed, strength, and accuracy.Practitioners of this activity usually begin fighting in September, when the spring winds are arriving to the Chilean coast. Clubs and professional associations, however, prefer to host tournaments throughout the drier summer months when the commercial kite season is over.Other particularities of the Chilean kite fighting practice include the use of carrete for the manipulation and storage of the abrasive thread, and the use of wooden sticks for the manipulation of the carrete in turn. Therefore, it is possible for a skilled kite fighter to complete a match without ever touching the thread with their hands if their mastery of carrete usage is advanced enough.Since the mid 2000s, the use of carrete has become widespread in Latin America and Europe. Its convenience, <b>durability</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> make {{it one of the most}} popular exports of the Chilean kite fighting culture.|$|E
