Ill-health and a disinclination to continue led Fielding to end its run after the Number 72 issue. He died two years later while staying in Lisbon, Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus {{was seldom}} {{mentioned}} during the Cold War and his pre-war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press, {{particularly in the}} US During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus {{began to appear in}} these newspapers, including Karys, Vienas iš daugelio (1950), Paskutinis žuvusiojo lakūno atvirukas (1955), and Kapitono Marcinkaus mirtis nelaisvėje (1956). The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> Švytūrys.

5|$|In 1907, {{the journal}} Zoologica {{was founded by}} Osborn and Hornaday {{specifically}} as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on equal footing with the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, {{for the purpose of}} further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.|$|E

Another common name for this species is banded stingray.|$|E
25|$|These recent {{arguments}} for Crippen's innocence have been disputed by some commentators. It {{has been argued}} that the DNA sample could have been tainted or mislabeled, or alternatively that the putative relatives were not actually blood relatives of Mrs. Crippen.

25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in European Journal of Personality, Heiner Rindermann compared the IQ scores from the book to a large number of international student assessment studies on subjects such as reading, mathematics, science, and problem solving, and found them to be highly intercorrelated. Statistical analyses indicated that the results could be explained by an underlying general cognitive ability. More than 30 commentaries on Rindermann's findings were published in the same <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal.</b>|$|E

25|$|The TSP, in {{particular}} the Euclidean variant of the problem, has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers in cognitive psychology. It has been observed that humans are able to produce good quality solutions quickly. These results suggest that computer performance on the TSP may be improved by understanding and emulating the methods used by humans for these problems, and have also led to new insights into the mechanisms of human thought. The first <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Journal</b> of Problem Solving was devoted to the topic of human performance on TSP, and a 2011 review listed dozens of papers on the subject.|$|E
