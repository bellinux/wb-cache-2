In 1987 the International Association onWater Quality (IAWQ) introduced a mathematical model, Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM 1), describing the biological processes in a tank of the treatment plant. In such a tank fluid flow plays an important role. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics this flow can be computed. Both models work separately very well in practice, but what happens if we combine these two models? It turns out that both models can be coupled using the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow and convection-diffusion equations for Activated Sludge Model No. 1.

40|$|Background and Aim: The aims of {{this study}} was to explore the {{feasibility}} of improving efficiency of the wastewater treatment system of the Fars Pegah Dairy Industries (FPDI) and propose ways to upgrade it in 2006 - 2007. The FPDI wastewater treatment system was of a successive anaerobic-aerobic type using anaerobic stabilization ponds and conventional and <b>extended</b> <b>aeration</b> activated sludge. Due to improper design and operation, it did not meet the required standards with regard to disposal to the surrounding cultivated land. Materials and Methods: To overcome the problem and eliminate the bad smell, modifications were made, such as changing the entries and exits of the ponds, adjustment of the activated sludge process, and converting the conventional activated sludge F/M to a step-feed activated sludge shift. The efficiency of the system was assessed before and after these modifications Results: The efficiency of the system to eliminate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), total coliform, and fecal coliform increased from 82. 42 %, 86. 87 %, 64. 18 %, 20. 23 %, 54. 56 % and 50. 87 % to 97. 34 %, 98. 61 %, 90. 4 %, 28. 44 %, 90. 09 % and 89. 95 %, respectively.

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} {{is complex}} waste water with considerable variation in both quality and quantity.

In general, leachate is highly contaminated with organic contaminants measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and also with high ammonium nitrogen concentration. Aerobic biological processes have been found the most effective and reliable treatment option of landfill leachate for developing country like Bangladesh. Leachate containing high concentrations of organic and nitrogen compounds results serious environmental problems near the landfill site. This research was undertaken to investigate the performance of both chemical treatment by alum coagulation and biological process that is extended–aeration activated sludge process without sludge return and anaerobic treatment of Savar Landfill leachate containing high organic and nitrogen concentrations. The main part of the study was studied on the removal efficiency of BOD, COD and ammonia in each method and heavy metals removal were also studied in coagulation and flocculation method. It is observed that in <b>extended</b> <b>aeration</b> process BOD removal is around 80 % at 6 days detention time and 94 % at 15 days detention time. In the same treatment method experiment results reveal that 75 % of ammonia removal is achieved in 6 days aeration period mainly due to air stripping process and in total 98 % removal is achieved in 15 days aeration period. The optimum pH of alum coagulant for leachate treatment was 6. 5. Also an effective dosage of alum is 1. 4 g/L for the best efficiency of heavy metals and COD removal. The maximum amount of COD and heavy metals that could be removed by the alum was about 21 and 77 - 91 % of the initial value, respectively. It is also found that anaerobic biological treatment alone cannot efficiently remove the COD content of leachate from the site. BOD/COD ratio was varies from 0. 19 to 0. 14 in anaerobic batch system for 20 and 41 days, respectively. This BOD/COD ratio means low biodegradability of treated leachate.
