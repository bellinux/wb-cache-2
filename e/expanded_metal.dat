The basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar. A second layer of lighter-gauge steel reinforcement bars was added, followed by two layers of <b>expanded</b> <b>metal.</b> A specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing, and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.|$|E

The zone consumed around – more than sixpercent of the East's territory, within which economic activity was severely curtailed or ceased entirely. The actual cost of the border system was a closely guarded secret, and even today it is uncertain exactly how much it cost to build and maintain. The BT-9 watchtowers each cost around 65,000East German marks to build and the <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> fences cost around 151,800marks per kilometre. The implementation of the [...] "modern frontier" [...] in the 1970s led to a major increase in personnel costs. The total annual expenditure on GDR border troops rose from 600million marks per annum in 1970 to nearly 1billion by 1983.

500|$|A [...] "third-generation" [...] fence, {{much more}} solidly constructed, was {{installed}} in an ongoing programme of improvements from the late 1960s to the 1980s. The fence line was moved back to create an outer strip between the fence and the actual border. The barbed-wire fences were replaced with a barrier that was usually 3.2–4.0 metres (10–13ft) high. It was constructed with <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> mesh (Metallgitterzaun) panels. The openings in the mesh were generally too small to provide finger-holds and were very sharp.

Nor could they be tunnelled under easily, as the bottom segment of the fences was partially buried in the ground. In a number of places, more lightly constructed fences (Lichtsperren) consisting of mesh and barbed wire lined the border. The fences were not continuous and could be crossed at a number of places. Gates were installed to enable guards to patrol up to the line and to give engineers access for maintenance on the outward-facing side of the barrier.|$|E

The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (<b>expanded</b> <b>metal)</b> with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the Berlin Wall was built.

The whole of the site was then covered with a solid mass of Portland cement concrete [...] thick, which when finished left the ironwork completely embedded in the same. Upon this foundation the superstructure was erected." [...] From a speech by F.W.J. Palmer at the opening of The Pavilion, 4 April 1904 Under all walls there was a damp course of fibrous asphalt. [...] The outer walls were of red and hard stock bricks with dressings of Victoria stone and facing bricks of Whiting's best reds The roof was made of rolled steel joists covered with sheets of expanded steel lathing, supplied and fixed by the New <b>Expanded</b> <b>Metal</b> Company, and the lathing for the ceilings was of sheets of this <b>expanded</b> <b>metal</b> lathing but of a smaller gauge.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and complications rate of covered and non-covered self <b>expanding</b> <b>metal</b> stents in the palliative treatment of oesophageal dysphagia. DESIGN: In this retrospective non-randomized study, we evaluated 11 non-covered and 17 covered stents of different types. RESULTS: Grade of dysphagia and improvement after treatment were similar in both groups, all the seven fistulas were sealed by covered stents. Covered stents seem to be safer regarding the rate of life-threatening complications and reinterventions. In contrast to published studies, bleeding was our major complication with death related in half of these patients. Aorto-Oesophageal fistula was proved by autopsy in two of them. CONCLUSIONS: Covered stents lead to less drawbacks than non-covered ones and seem to be recommended in the palliation of oesophageal dysphagia even in the absence of fistula...|$|R

There are less invasive means of imaging the biliary tree including transabdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound. If the biliary system is obstructed, PTC {{may be used}} to perform biliary drainage until a more permanent solution for the obstruction is performed (e.g. surgery). Additionally, self <b>expanding</b> <b>metal</b> stents can be placed across malignant biliary strictures to allow palliative drainage. Percutaneous placement of metal stents can be utilised when therapeutic ERCP has been unsuccessful, anatomy is altered precluding endoscopic access to the duodenum, or where there has been separation of the segmental biliary drainage of the liver, allowing more selective placement of metal stents. It is generally accepted that percutanous biliary procedures have higher complication rates than therapeutic ERCP. Complications encountered include infection, bleeding and bile leaks.|$|R

40|$|Self <b>expanding</b> <b>metal</b> stents (SEMS) play an {{important}} role in the management of malignant obstructing lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Traditionally, they have been used for palliation in malignant gastric outlet and colonic obstruction and esophageal malignancy. The development of the polyflex stent, which is a removable self expanding plastic stent, allows temporary stent insertion for benign esophageal disease and possibly for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to esophagectomy. Potential complications of SEMS insertion include perforation, tumour overgrowth or ingrowth, and stent migration. Newer stents are being developed with the aim of increasing technical and clinical success rates, while reducing complication rates. Other areas of development include biodegradable stents for benign disease and radioactive or drug-eluting stents for malignant disease. It is hoped that, in the future, newer stents will improve our management of these difficult conditions and, possibly, provide prognostic as well as symptomatic benefit in the setting of malignant obstruction...|$|R
