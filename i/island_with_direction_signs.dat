60|$|As time rolled on, the {{strength}} of the royal party gradually wasted away, while that of Parliament seemed to increase, until it became evident that the latter would, in the end, obtain the victory. The king retreated from place to place, followed by his foes, and growing weaker and more discouraged after every conflict. His son, the Prince of Wales, was then about fifteen years of age. He sent him to {{the western part of the}} <b>island,</b> <b>with</b> <b>directions</b> that, if affairs should still go against him, the boy should be taken in time out of the country, and join his mother in Paris. The danger grew more and more imminent, and they who had charge of the young prince sent him first to Scilly, and then to Jersey--islands in the Channel--whence he made his escape to Paris, and joined his mother. Fifteen years afterward he returned to London with great pomp and parade, and was placed upon the throne by universal acclamation.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 20th century Leslie Green {{established}} a house style for the tube stations built by the UERL, which were clad in ox-blood faience blocks. Green pioneered using building design to guide passengers <b>with</b> <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> on tiled walls, with the stations given a unique identity with patterns on the platform walls. Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas. Harry W. Ford was responsible for the design of at least 17 UERL and District Railway stations, including Barons Court and Embankment, and claimed to have first thought of enlarging the U and D in the UNDERGROUND wordmark. The Met's architect Charles Walter Clark had used a neo-classical design for rebuilding Baker Street and Paddington Praed Street stations before World War I and, although the fashion had changed, continued with Farringdon in 1923. The buildings had metal lettering attached to pale walls. Clark would later design [...] "Chiltern Court", the large, luxurious block of apartments at Baker Street, that opened in 1929. In the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Holden designed a series of modernist and art-deco stations some of which he described as his 'brick boxes with concrete lids'. Holden's design for the Underground's headquarters building at 55 Broadway included avant-garde sculptures by Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and Henry Moore.|$|R
50|$|Pennsylvania Route 304 Truck (PA 304 Truck) is a 2.2 mi truck {{route in}} and around Mifflinburg. Narrow streets within the borough are avoided by this designation, and a {{complicated}} intersection with Pennsylvania Route 45, which does not contain turning lanes, is bypassed. The route is concurrent with other highways for its entire length: It is cosigned with PA 104 for the first 1.7 mi of the route, and is designated SR 3004 (Red Ridge Road) for the remainder. It is signed in the eastbound <b>direction</b> only, <b>with</b> the opposite <b>direction</b> <b>signed</b> as PA 45 Truck.|$|R
25|$|A {{few miles}} west of Cheyenne, SH-47A {{branches}} off in a loop to the north, rejoining Highway 47 {{in a couple of}} miles. South of Cheyenne, SH-47 joins US-283 for a concurrency to the north. SH-33 also joins in on the concurrency, <b>with</b> a <b>signed</b> <b>direction</b> opposite that of SH-47 (a wrong-way concurrency). SH-47 and US-283/SH-33 parts ways at Roll, where SH-47 resumes its travel to the east.|$|R
5000|$|Antikythera {{is a very}} {{important}} stop-over site for migratory birds during their seasonal movements, due to its geographical position and certain features (a longitudinal <b>island,</b> <b>with</b> a north-south <b>direction</b> and very low human impact). Furthermore, the island hosts the largest breeding colony of Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) in the world. The importance of Antikythira for studying bird migration {{led to the creation of}} Antikythera Bird Observatory (A.B.O) by the Hellenic Ornithological Society. The island also has a large population of wild goats.|$|R
5000|$|Seventy of the 270 London Underground {{stations}} use {{buildings that}} are on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, and five have entrances in listed buildings. The Metropolitan Railway's original seven stations were inspired by Italianate designs, with the platforms lit by daylight from above and by gas lights in large glass globes. Early District Railway stations were similar and on both railways the further from central London the station the simpler the construction. The City & South London Railway opened with red-brick buildings, designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, topped with a lead-covered dome that contained the lift mechanism. The Central London Railway appointed Harry Bell Measures as architect, who designed its pinkish-brown steel-framed buildings with larger entrances.In {{the first decade of the}} 20th century Leslie Green established a house style for the tube stations built by the UERL, which were clad in ox-blood faience blocks.

40|$|We {{carefully}} {{analyze the}} supersymmetry algebra of closed strings and open strings {{in a plane}} wave. We use eight component chiral spinors, SO(8) Majorana-Weyl spinors, in light-cone gauge to provide a useful basis of string field theory calculation in the plane wave. We consider the two classes of half BPS D-branes, D_±-branes, preserving 16 supersymmetries. We exhaustively provide the supersymmetry algebra of the half BPS branes. We {{also point out that}} the supersymmetry algebra distinguishes the two SO(4) <b>directions</b> <b>with</b> opposite <b>sign</b> which is consistent with the Z_ 2 symmetry of the string action...|$|R
50|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> {{inform about}} places, businesses, routes, choice of lanes, choice of roads and {{distance}} to destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> <b>with</b> a yellow background (blue on motorways) show geographical destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> <b>with</b> a white background (or white fields on yellow and blue signs) show local destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> <b>with</b> a brown background show destinations {{of special interest}} to tourism. Orange backgrounds denote temporary detours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direction</b> and {{distance}} <b>signs</b> are rectangular with dark green backgrounds and white text. In urban areas, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> have dark blue backgrounds. The signs are normally written in Korean and English. In March 2010, Korea Expressway Corporation {{introduced a new}} type of <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> for expressways. Currently, Korea Expressway Corporation changes old <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> to new ones on their expressways. This new type of <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> is exit guide based sign and its typeface has changed from Sandol Doropyojipanche (Sandol traffic sign typeface, which can be seen on the distance <b>sign</b> and <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> below) to Hangilche (Hangil typeface).|$|R
5000|$|The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals {{divides the}} direction, position, or {{indication}} <b>sign</b> category into <b>direction</b> <b>signs,</b> which are only those giving distances or directions {{to a given}} location; road identification signs (also known as [...] "reassurance signs"), which repeat the name or number of the road, and place identification signs, which give {{the name of a}} landmark, such as a town, river or border. Unlike the other classes of <b>sign,</b> <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> remain broadly undefined by the convention; the only restrictions given are that <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> must be either a rectangle or an arrow shaped pentagon, and that they may not contain placenames in more than two languages. Additionally, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> on motorways must be blue or green, while temporary <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> are yellow or orange.|$|R
5000|$|Surface Painted Taxiway <b>Direction</b> <b>Signs</b> Yellow {{background}} <b>with</b> a black inscription, provided {{when it is}} {{not possible}} to provide taxiway <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> at intersections, or when necessary to supplement such signs. These markings are located on either side of the taxiway.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with other types of sign: for example, in the United Kingdom, if a warning or prohibitory sign appears on a <b>direction</b> <b>sign,</b> it means that the route indicated by the sign contains the hazard or prohibition sign posted.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "directional sign" [...] covers both Advance <b>Direction</b> <b>Signs</b> (ADS), {{placed on}} the {{approach}} to a junction, and <b>Direction</b> <b>Signs</b> (DS) at the junction itself, showing where to turn. A DS has a chevron (pointed) end, and this type is {{also referred to as}} a flag-type sign.|$|R
40|$|The {{unidirectional}} {{alignment of}} graphene islands {{is essential to}} the synthesis of wafer-scale single-crystal graphene on Ge(110) surface, but the underlying mechanism is not well-understood. Here we report that the necessary coalignment of the nucleating graphene islands on Ge(110) surface is caused by the presence of step pattern; we show that on the preannealed Ge(110) textureless surface the graphene islands appear nonpreferentially orientated, while on the Ge(110) surfaces with natural step pattern, all graphene islands emerge coaligned. First-principles calculations and theoretical analysis reveal this different alignment behaviors originate from the strong chemical binding formed between the graphene island edges and the atomic steps on the Ge(110) surface, and the lattice matching at edge-step interface dictates the alignment of graphene <b>islands</b> <b>with</b> the armchair <b>direction</b> of graphene along the [- 110] direction of the Ge(110) substrate. ope...|$|R
