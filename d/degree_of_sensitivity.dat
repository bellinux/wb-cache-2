When used for this purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E

The traditionally accepted method is by skin testing, which in turn may take the form of intradermal or epicutaneous (skin prick) tests. Prick testing, a stan-dard for allergy diagnosis since the work of Lewis and Grant 1 in 1926, is typically a first step in screening by the general allergist, because it readily identifies patients with high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> who are at risk for anaphylaxis if subjected to single-dilution intrader-mal testing. This type of test carries a significantly lower risk of systemic reaction than intradermal testing, although the latter is said to be more sensitive for the diagnosis <b>of</b> low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Otolaryngologic allergists perform intradermal testing without antecedent prick testing, beginning at an anticipate...|$|R
25|$|Proposals {{that may}} lead to a quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict {{violations}} of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light scalar fields with long Compton wavelengths, which should generate fifth forces and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10−13 to 10−18 range. Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> such that non-discovery of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.|$|E

2500|$|Attachment theory (Bowlby 1969, 1973, 1980) {{is rooted}} in the ethological notion that a newborn child is biologically {{programmed}} to seek proximity with caregivers, and this proximity-seeking behavior is naturally selected. Through repeated attempts to seek physical and emotional closeness with a caregiver and the responses the child gets, the child develops an internal working model (IWM) that reflects the response of the caregiver to the child. According to Bowlby, attachment provides a secure base from which the child can explore the environment, a haven of safety to which the child can return when he or she is afraid or fearful.

40|$|Cross-sectional classification, {{introduced}} in EUROCODE 3, {{is destined to}} comply with any type of cross-section, disregarding the slenderness of cross-sectional wall plates. From practical reasons, this classification refers to cross-sections considered as a general matter. But in the same cross-section, the plates loaded with compression stresses, thus exposed to local buckling can belong to different classes of sections depending upon the loads acting on that cross-section. Furthermore, the stress diagrams corresponding to these cross-sectional plates are themselves closely related to applied loads and they influence directly the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to local buckling. On the other hand, the different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to local buckling depend on the slenderness of cross-sectional plates. A cross-section is normally classified by quoting the highest (least favourable) class of its compression elements. The strength calculation (and general stability) of structural members depends on the cross-section classes...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century more complex {{classification}} systems were developed to allow governments to manage their information according to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The British Government codified this, to some extent, {{with the publication of}} the Official Secrets Act in 1889. By the time of the First World War, multi-tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters. In the United Kingdom this {{led to the creation of}} the Government Code and Cypher School in 1919. Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the Second World War necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls. An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather than men) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed.The Enigma Machine which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of warfare and successfully decrypted by Alan Turing [...] can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information. Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war (e.g. U-570).|$|E
