5|$|Metamorphosis in insects is the {{biological}} process of development all insects must undergo. There are {{two forms of}} metamorphosis: <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> and complete metamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches have <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> {{meaning that}} the nymphs are {{generally}} similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may take {{a few months to}} over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{insects that}} go through <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the {{presence}} of wings, which are not developed until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two {{types of}} {{metamorphosis}} are shown. In a complete (holometabolous) metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an adult {{that does not}} resemble the larva. In an <b>incomplete</b> (hemimetabolous) <b>metamorphosis</b> an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.|$|R
5000|$|All three {{categories}} of metamorphosis {{can be found in}} the diversity of insects, including no <b>metamorphosis</b> ("ametaboly"), <b>incomplete</b> or partial <b>metamorphosis</b> ("hemimetaboly"), and complete metamorphosis ("holometaboly"). While ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms (also known as [...] "direct development"), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in holometabolus organisms, of a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{research}} is to explore 5 yearold children’s initial ideas about two types of species metamorphoses (one incomplete: the dog; and one complete: the butterfly) and their life circles (cycles). A case study approach was used and {{the data were collected}} by using semi-structured individual interviews as well as drawings made by 18 children. The interview protocol included questions based on coloured photographs of dogs and butterflies. The source of children’s knowledge was also explored through questions. The results showed that the 18 young children in this study are more familiar with the concept of <b>incomplete</b> species <b>metamorphosis</b> than that of complete species metamorphosis. They could argue in a more scientifically correct way about the maintenance of both personal and species identity of the dog than that of a butterfly. It was also shown that the previous experiences of children, which {{can be used as a}} basis to build new knowledge, vary a lot from child to child...|$|R
5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual termite goes through an <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|While the {{development}} of wings in insects is clearly defined in those {{who are members of}} Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> do not have a pupal stage, therefore they must have a different wing morphogenesis. Insects such as those that are hemimetabolic have wings that start out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last instar of the nymph.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} insect forms showed direct development (ametabolism), and {{the evolution}} of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous [...] "true insects" [...] are still present today, such as bristletails and silverfish. Hemimetabolous insects include cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all insects in the Pterygota undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have hemimetabolous development, and undergo an <b>incomplete</b> or partial <b>metamorphosis,</b> or holometabolous development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, including a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.|$|R
40|$|Neural {{circuits}} projecting {{information from}} motor pathways to sensory pathways are common across sensory domains. These circuits typically modify sensory {{function as a}} result of motor pattern activation; this is particularly so in cases where the resultant behavior affects the sensory experience or its processing. However, such circuits have not been observed projecting to an olfactory pathway in any species despite well characterized active sampling behaviors that produce reafferent mechanical stimuli, such as sniffing in mammals and wing beating in the moth Manduca sexta. In this study we characterize a circuit that connects a flight sensory-motor center to an olfactory center in Manduca. This circuit consists of a single pair of histamine immunoreactive (HA-ir) neurons that project from the mesothoracic ganglion to innervate a subset of ventral antennal lobe (AL) glomeruli. Furthermore, within the AL we show that the Manduca sexta histamine B receptor (MsHisClB) is exclusively expressed by a subset of GABAergic and peptidergic LNs, which broadly project to all olfactory glomeruli. Finally, the HA-ir cell pair is present in fifth stage instar larvae; however, the absence of MsHisClB-ir in the larval antennal center (LAC) indicates that the circuit is <b>incomplete</b> prior to <b>metamorphosis</b> and importantly prior to the expression of flight behavior. Although the functional consequences of this circuit remain unknown, these results provide the first detailed description of a circuit that interconnects an olfactory system with motor centers driving flight behaviors including odor-guided flight...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Orthopteran migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, and {{lepidopteran}} Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, are {{two types}} of insects undergoing <b>incomplete</b> and complete <b>metamorphosis,</b> respectively. Identification of candidate genes regulating wing development in these two insects would provide insights into the further study about the molecular mechanisms controlling metamorphosis development. We have sequenced the transcriptome of O. furnacalis larvae previously. Here we sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of L. migratoria wing discs with special emphasis on wing development-related signaling pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Illumina Hiseq 2000 was used to sequence 8. 38 Gb of the transcriptome from dissected nymphal wing discs. De novo assembly generated 91, 907 unigenes with mean length of 610 nt. All unigenes were searched against five databases including Nt, Nr, Swiss-Prot, COG, and KEGG for annotations using blastn or blastx algorithm with an cut-off E-value of 10 - 5. A total of 23, 359 (25. 4 %) unigenes have homologs within at least one database. Based on sequence similarity to homologs known to regulate Drosophila melanogaster wing development, we identified 50 and 46 potential wing development-related unigenes from L. migratoria and O. furnacalis transcriptome, respectively. The identified unigenes encode putative orthologs for nearly all components of the Hedgehog (Hh), Decapentaplegic (Dpp), Notch (N), and Wingless (Wg) signaling pathways, which are essential for growth and pattern formation during wing development. We investigated the expression profiles of the component genes involved in these signaling pathways in forewings and hind wings of L. migratoria and O. furnacalis. The results revealed the tested genes had different expression patterns in two insects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides the comprehensive sequence resource of the wing development-related signaling pathways of L. migratoria. The obtained data gives an insight into better understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the wing development in L. migratoria and O. furnacalis, two insect species with different metamorphosis types...|$|R
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> change {{gradually}} by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> {{on the path}} to {{becoming}} alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
25|$|All tessaratomids are phytophagous. They {{generally}} {{feed upon}} plants {{belonging to the}} plant orders Rosales and Sapindales, and {{spend most of their}} lives in tree leaves and stems. They exhibit <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> and have lifespans that can be several years.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} hemipterans, tessaratomids are hemimetabolic, {{undergoing}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> This {{means that they}} do not possess larval and pupal stages. Instead, juvenile tessaratomids (called nymphs), hatch directly from the eggs. The nymphs resemble fully grown adults except for size and the absence of wings.|$|E
25|$|Hemimetabolous, or <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> The {{terrestrial}} {{young are}} called nymphs and aquatic young are called naiads. Insect young are usually {{similar to the}} adult. Wings appear as buds on the nymphs or early instars. When the last moult is completed the wings expand to the full adult size, e.g. Order: Odonata (Dragonflies).|$|E
25|$|Like all hemipterans, jewel bugs undergo <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> (hemimetaboly) and do {{not possess}} larval and pupal stages. Instead the adults develop from several stages (instars) of nymphs (usually five) through {{successive}} moltings (ecdysis). Nymphs resemble the adults except for size {{and the absence of}} wings. They can be of different coloration or patterns from adults.|$|E
25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (at {{least not in the}} males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> (Exopterygota) have gone a little further and completed the trend; here all the immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory here is that the pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it {{is nothing more than a}} theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E
500|$|Earwigs are hemimetabolous, {{meaning they}} undergo <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis,</b> {{developing}} {{through a series}} of 4 to 6 molts. The developmental stages between molts are called instars. Earwigs live for about a year from hatching. They start mating in the autumn, and can be found together in the autumn and winter. The male and female will live in a chamber in debris, crevices, or soil [...] deep. After mating, the sperm may remain in the female for months before the eggs are fertilized. From midwinter to early spring, the male will leave, or be driven out by the female. Afterward the female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in 2 days. Some earwigs, those parasitic in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, are viviparous (give birth to live young); they would be fed by a sort of placenta. When first laid, the eggs are white or cream-colored and oval-shaped, but right before hatching they become kidney-shaped and brown. Each egg is approximately [...] tall and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Dragonflies are {{hemimetabolous}} insects; they do {{not have}} a pupal stage and undergo an <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> with a series of nymphal stages from which the adult emerges. Eggs laid inside plant tissues are usually shaped like grains of rice, while other eggs are the size of a pinhead, ellipsoidal, or nearly spherical. A clutch may have as many as 1500 eggs, and they take about a week to hatch into aquatic nymphs or naiads which moult between six and 15 times (depending on species) as they grow. Most of a dragonfly's life is spent as a nymph, beneath the water's surface. The nymph extends its hinged labium (a toothed mouthpart similar to a lower mandible, which is sometimes termed as a [...] "mask" [...] as it is normally folded and held before the face) that can extend forward and retract rapidly to capture prey such as mosquito larvae, tadpoles, and small fish. They breathe through gills in their rectum, and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus. Some naiads, such as the later stages of Antipodophlebia asthenes, hunt on land.|$|E

50|$|Metamorphosis in insects is the {{biological}} process of development all insects must undergo. There are {{two forms of}} metamorphosis: <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> and complete metamorphosis.|$|E
50|$|Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are insects with an <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> (hemimetabolous). The aquatic larva or nymph hatches from an egg, and {{develops}} through eight to seventeen instars {{before leaving the}} water and emerging as the winged adult or imago.|$|E
50|$|All tessaratomids are phytophagous. They {{generally}} {{feed upon}} plants {{belonging to the}} plant orders Rosales and Sapindales, and {{spend most of their}} lives in tree leaves and stems.

50|$|Triatomines undergo <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> A {{wingless}} first instar nymph hatches from an egg, and may {{be small}} as 2mm. It passes successively through 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instars. Finally, the fifth instar turns into an adult, acquiring two pairs of wings.|$|E

50|$|Masked hunters, {{like other}} Hemiptera, undergo <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis.</b> Early {{stages of the}} {{lifecycle}} look like small adults and are called nymphs.

50|$|Cumaceans are epimorphic, {{which means}} that the number of body {{segments}} does not change during development.

50|$|Hemimetabolism or hemimetaboly, {{also called}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>metamorphosis</b> and paurometabolism, is {{the mode of}} {{development}} of certain insects that includes three distinct stages: the egg, nymph, and the adult stage, or imago.

50|$|The Mallophaga are a {{suborder}} of lice, {{known as}} chewing lice, biting lice or bird lice, containing more than 3000 species.
