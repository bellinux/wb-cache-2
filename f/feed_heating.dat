50|$|Fractional {{distillation}} is {{the most}} common form of separation technology used in petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, natural gas processing and cryogenic air separation plants. In most cases, the distillation is operated at a continuous steady state. New feed is always being added to the distillation column and products are always being removed.

50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure <b>feed</b> <b>heating</b> system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E
50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, <b>feed</b> <b>heating,</b> and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E

Introduction. In any multistage steam turbine with continuous expansion through the stages, the cumulative heat is the sum of the heat drops in the individual stages; the reheat factor is the ratio of the cumulative heat to the adiabatic drop from initial condition to exhaust pressure.

The groundwater flow and heat transport are modelled in the alluvial aquifer {{of the river}} Meuse {{in order to provide}} an integrated tool for assessing the feasibility of a low energy air cooling /heating system for a large office building by pumping groundwater and discharging in the river. First, a comparative sensitivity analysis is performed using three different codes (MT 3 D, SHEMAT and HYDROGEOSHERE) for assessing the influence of coupling and non linearities in the main parameters due to the temperature evolution in function of time. Then, assuming that the variations of the aquifer temperature are weak enough to neglect their influence on hydrodynamics and thermal parameters, the MT 3 D and HYDROGEOSPHERE codes are used for modelling the actual case-study. In practice, for cooling the office building with groundwater initially at 13 °C, the main influence of the relative hot water from the river Meuse (in hot summer conditions 27 °C) is computed and constitutes the major limiting factor. An optimisation of the pumping schema is computed to maximise the efficiency of the cooling/heating system. status: publishe...|$|E

The thermodynamics of the assumption are critically examined and it is found to be valid only over strictly limited ranges of properties (usually low-pressure levels). However, if such limitations are accepted, the analyses provide understanding of the effects of various key parameters on thermal eflciency, and of measures (such as <b>feed</b> <b>heating,</b> reheat, dual pressure boilers, etc.) that are taken to raise that eflciency.

Steam turbine based generating plants form the backbone of power generation in many countries in our country too, Base load is presently largely generated by fossil fuel based power plants. Most of these plants employ sub-critical coal fired boilers driving steam turbines to generate power. The adoption of “Supercritical cycles ” for thermal plants on a wide scale has the ability to improve overall system efficiency, as well as provide benefits of lower emissions both on land & in air. Steam cycles for supercritical application operate at very high pressure & temperatures; these are thus characterized by features that take full advantage of the advanced parameters like higher expansion in turbines, more stages of <b>feed</b> <b>heating</b> & higher input levels to boilers, contributing to higher system efficiency.

All of these contribute to lower land & water use, less consumption of coal & reduced wastes & emissions.
