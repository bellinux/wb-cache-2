5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} <b>diffusers</b> and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous {{diffusion}} process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a spray gun. Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the <b>diffusers,</b> they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

In particular, {{the effect of}} vaned <b>diffuser</b> geometry on the compressor unsteady aerodynamics has been considered, with particular emphasis on the <b>diffuser</b> vane unsteady loading generated by the impeller circumferentially nonuniform flowfield. A series of experiments was performed in the Purdue Centrifugal Compressor Facility to quantify the compressor performance, impeller blade and <b>diffuser</b> vane steady surface static pressure, vaneless <b>diffuser</b> steady and unsteady velocity field, <b>diffuser</b> vane unsteady surface static pressure, as well as surge and rotating stall occurrence. These measurements were made for various flow rates, number of <b>diffuser</b> vanes, <b>diffuser</b> vane leading edge/impeller exit radius ratios, <b>diffuser</b> vane stagger angles, and nonuniform circumferential vane spacing. ^ In conjunction with the above experiments, theoretical predictions of the unsteady vaneless <b>diffuser</b> wake velocities and the unsteady <b>diffuser</b> vane loading were developed.

40|$|This {{research}} {{characterizes the}} performance of a centrifugal compressor stage with a special focus on the pipe <b>diffuser.</b> Two <b>diffuser</b> configurations are studied, one of which is a truncated version of the other. Experimental data acquired on a research compressor stage is interrogated along with a set of well-designed Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes computations, complemented by reduced order flow modeling. The fundamental performance-limiting flow mechanisms in the <b>diffuser</b> are identified and used to physically relate important geometry features and operating conditions to the observed compressor pressure rise, efficiency, and operability characteristics. Despite large differences in their geometry, the two <b>diffuser</b> configurations exhibit similar pressure recovery characteristics due to differences in exit nonuniformity and flow angle which result in similar effective area ratios. Variations in the <b>diffuser</b> pressure recovery coefficient with operating point are found to be most influenced by the <b>diffuser</b> inlet flow angle, and secondly by the inlet Mach number. The <b>diffuser</b> inlet flow angle has the primary effect of setting the <b>diffuser</b> inlet one-dimensional area ratio, increasing diffusion at high flow angles. In addition, the <b>diffuser</b> incidence angle influences the formation of counter-rotating vortex pairs that persist throughout the <b>diffuser</b> passage. Using a two-dimensional integral boundary layer model that is modified to accommodate three-dimensional effects as source terms, these secondary flows are shown to detrimentally impact the <b>diffuser</b> pressure rise capability by accumulating high loss flow along the <b>diffuser</b> wall near the plane of symmetry between the vortices. This contributes to the extent and location of a large <b>diffuser</b> passage separation, especially for the baseline <b>diffuser.</b> The impact of the vortices on the boundary layer growth rate is shown to scale inversely with <b>diffuser</b> aspect ratio. The major performance difference between the two <b>diffuser</b> configurations is that the truncated <b>diffuser</b> configuration experiences enhanced stall margin over the baseline <b>diffuser</b> at the design speed. These differences are traced to reduced secondary flows influence and thus reduced separation extent for the higher aspect ratio truncated <b>diffuser.</b> It is hypothesized that the onset of stall for the baseline <b>diffuser</b> configuration is initiated by the transition of the vortex location and corresponding passage separation between <b>diffuser</b> pressure and suction sides with increasing cusp incidence. Conversely, because the extent of the passage separation in the truncated <b>diffuser</b> is diminished due to the higher aspect ratio, the switch in separation side does not immediately initiate instability. The fact that secondary flows have a large influence on <b>diffuser</b> pressure rise capability and compressor stability is counter to conventional preliminary <b>diffuser</b> design approaches which neglect such 3 D effects. The findings of this research may therefore be considered during preliminary design optimization to produce better-performing <b>diffuser</b> designs. by David W. Erickson. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{process from}} a <b>diffuser</b> rotating stall to a stage stall in a centrifugal compressor with a vaned <b>diffuser</b> was investigated by experimental and numerical analyses. From the velocity measurements, {{it was found}} that the rotating stall existed on the shroud side of the <b>diffuser</b> passage in the off-design flow condition. The numerical results revealed the typical vortical structure of the <b>diffuser</b> stall. The <b>diffuser</b> stall cell was caused by the systematic vortical structure which consisted of the tornado-type vortex, the longitudinal vortex at the shroud/suction surface corner (i. e., leading edge vortex (LEV)), and the vortex in the throat area of the <b>diffuser</b> passages. Furthermore, the stage stall, which rotated within both the impeller and <b>diffuser</b> passages, occurred instead of the <b>diffuser</b> stall as the mass flow rate was decreased. According to the velocity measurements at the <b>diffuser</b> inlet, the <b>diffuser</b> stall which rotated on the shroud side was shifted to the hub side. Then, the <b>diffuser</b> stall moved into the impeller passages and formed the stage stall. Therefore, the stage stall was caused by the development of the <b>diffuser</b> stall, which transferred from the shroud side to the hub side in the vaneless space and expanded to the impeller passages...|$|R

25|$|The local {{speed of}} sound, {{and thereby the}} Mach number, depends on the {{condition}} of the surrounding medium, in particular the temperature.

The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a nozzle, <b>diffusers</b> or wind tunnels channeling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless number.

It is well understood that the degree of the performance enhancement depends on several factors including the <b>diffuser</b> shape and geometries, blade airfoils, and the wind condition at the mounting site. The effect of <b>diffuser</b> shape and geometries is reported in this paper. Performance of <b>diffuser</b> with three different geometrical features namely: straight <b>diffuser,</b> nozzle-diffuser combination, and diffuser-brim (brimmed <b>diffuser)</b> combination have been investigated. This paper aims to compare the performance of bare and <b>diffuser</b> augmented turbine; and investigate the effect of the <b>diffuser</b> geometrical parameters: <b>diffuser</b> lengths (L/D= 0. 63 to 1. 5) and flange heights (H/D= 0 to 0. 2). Tests confirmed that placing the micro turbine model inside a shroud can substantially improve its performance. The <b>diffuser</b> only shroud improves the performance by 60 % compared to the bare turbine and the nozzle-diffuser enhancement of 63 % is slightly better than <b>diffuser</b> only. The improvement with brimmed <b>diffuser</b> also shows substantial performance enhancement. Increasing the <b>diffuser</b> length (L/D) does not affect the optimum Cp of the wind turbine but shifts the performance curve and the optimum Cp to higher tip-speed-ratio, λ. But adding brim (flange) at the exit plane of the <b>diffuser</b> increase the performance, Cp as well as reduce the cut in speed and shift optimum λ to higher value. The finding from this work demonstrates that shrouding micro wind turbine not only improves its performance but also points out how <b>diffuser</b> geometrical features (L/D) and/or (H/D) can be used to design a turbine with performance curve to suit the location...|$|R
