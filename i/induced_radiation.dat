50|$|A {{high energy}} {{particle}} undergoing multiple soft scatterings from a medium will experience interference effects between adjacent scattering sites. From uncertainty as the longitudinal momentum transfer gets small the particles wavelength will increase, if the wavelength becomes {{longer than the}} mean free path in the medium (the average distance between scattering sites) then the scatterings {{can no longer be}} treated as independent events, this is the LPM effect. The Bethe-Heitler spectrum for multiple scattering <b>induced</b> <b>radiation</b> assumes that the scatterings are independent, the quantum interference between successive scatterings caused by the LPM effect leads to suppression of the radiation spectrum relative to that predicted by Bethe-Heitler.|$|E

The muzzle is automatically sealed when the barrel is lowered into storage position. During a nuclear attack, the turret crew may not stay in the turret because of the initial radiation, but they may reoccupy it and be ready to fight immediately after the attack thanks to a special liner which reduces <b>induced</b> <b>radiation</b> to such a point that it is safe to immediately reoccupy the turret.|$|E

5000|$|Neutron effects: A neutron {{interacting}} with the semiconductor lattice will displace its atoms. This leads {{to an increase in}} the count of recombination centers and deep-level defects, reducing the lifetime of minority carriers, thus affecting bipolar devices more than CMOS ones. Bipolar devices on silicon tend to show changes in electrical parameters at levels of 1010 to 1011 neutrons/cm², CMOS devices aren't affected until 1015 neutrons/cm². The sensitivity of the devices may increase together with increasing level of integration and decreasing size of individual structures. There is also a risk of induced radioactivity caused by neutron activation, which is a major source of noise in high energy astrophysics instruments. <b>Induced</b> <b>radiation,</b> together with residual radiation from impurities in used materials, can cause all sorts of single-event problems during the device's lifetime. GaAs LEDs, common in optocouplers, are very sensitive to neutrons. The lattice damage influences the frequency of crystal oscillators. Kinetic energy effects (namely lattice displacement) of charged particles belong here too.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} quantum mechanical effects to {{various aspects of}} gravitational collapse. These quantum mechanical effects are implemented {{in the context of}} the Functional Schrödinger formalism. The Functional Schrödinger formalism allows us to investigate the time-dependent evolutions of the quantum mechanical effects, which is beyond the scope of the usual methods used to investigate the quantum mechanical corrections of gravitational collapse. Utilizing the time-dependent nature of the Functional Schrödinger formalism, we study the quantization of a spherically symmetric domain wall from the view point of an asymptotic and infalling observer, in the absence of radiation. To build a more realistic picture, we then study the time-dependent nature of the <b>induced</b> <b>radiation</b> during the collapse using a semi-classical approach.
