40|$|What is a Cockney? To {{have been}} born within the sound of Bow Bells is the most {{well-known}} qualification required. However, as Gregory Dart shows in his fascinating new book, Cockneys are people ‘with attitude’, who might labour through the week in old clothes but ‘transform themselves into dandies’ at the weekend. Cockneys, as Dart shows, have also been thought of as vulgar parochial upstarts who like new furniture, organized gardens and posh tearooms. This book examines, in particular, an understudied period, from 1820 to 1840, that links Romantic and Victorian cultures and overlaps the individual spheres that they are often separately studied in. It is an affectionate, interesting and generative study of Cockneyism, and how it engages with, among other things, architecture, art, city planning, fashion, literature, politics and suburban <b>gardens.</b> <b>Dart's</b> achievement is that he extends debates on Cockneyism out of the tight timeframe of 1812 – 1820, that previous academic studies have largely held them in and, in doing so, expands the cultural spheres that Cockneys engaged with...|$|R

6000|$|... "They said I fell among thieves," [...] mused Hare, when he {{was once}} more alone. [...] "I've fallen among saints as well." [...] He felt that he could never repay this August Naab. [...] "If only I might live!" [...] he ejaculated. How restful was this cottage garden! The green sward was a balm to his eyes. Flowers new to him, though of {{familiar}} springtime hue, lifted fresh faces everywhere; fruit-trees, with branches intermingling, blended the white and pink of blossoms. There was the soft laughter {{of children in the}} <b>garden.</b> Strange birds <b>darted</b> among the trees. Their notes were new, but their song was the old delicious monotone--the joy of living and love of spring. A green-bowered irrigation ditch led by the porch and unseen water flowed gently, with gurgle and tinkle, with music in its hurry. Innumerable bees murmured amid the blossoms.|$|R
6000|$|But {{this was}} not to be the only eventful {{conversation}} which Mrs. Westmacott held that day, nor was the Admiral {{the only person in the}} Wilderness who was destined to find his opinions considerably changed. Two neighboring families, the Winslows from Anerley, and the Cumberbatches from Gipsy Hill, had been invited to tennis by Mrs. Westmacott, and the lawn was gay in the evening with the blazers of the young men and the bright dresses of the girls. To the older people, sitting round in their wicker-work <b>garden</b> chairs, the <b>darting,</b> stooping, springing white figures, the sweep of skirts, and twinkle of canvas shoes, the click of the rackets and sharp whiz of the balls, with the continual [...] "fifteen love--fifteen all!" [...] of the marker, made up a merry and exhilarating scene. To see their sons and daughters so flushed and healthy and happy, gave them also a reflected glow, and it was hard to say who had most pleasure from the game, those who played or those who watched.|$|R
