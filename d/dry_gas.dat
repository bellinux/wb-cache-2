25|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. This is good for corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very <b>dry</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>dry</b> <b>gas</b> extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.|$|E

In this paper, threshold indicates {{the status of the}} fuel cell membrane hydration. The transient behavior during load change is investigated when <b>dry</b> <b>gases</b> are fed into the fuel cell.

25|$|Natural gas is {{dehydrated}} by {{ethylene glycol}}. In this application, ethylene glycol flows {{down from the}} top of a tower and meets a rising mixture of water vapor and hydrocarbon gases. <b>Dry</b> <b>gas</b> exits {{from the top of the}} tower. The glycol and water are separated, and the glycol recycled. Instead of removing water, ethylene glycol can also be used to depress the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of glycol used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene glycol) is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of glycol used for dehydration (triethylene glycol) is typically 95 to more than 99%. Moreover, the injection rate for hydrate suppression is much lower than the circulation rate in a glycol dehydration tower.|$|E

In September 2012, the Marcellus Shale overtook the Haynesville Shale of northwest Louisiana as the leading producer of both shale gas and overall natural gas in the United States.

2500|$|Recycling {{plants such}} as those at Kaybob, West Whitecourt and Crossfield {{produced}} liquids-rich gas from [...] "retrograde condensation" [...] reservoirs. They stripped condensate and natural gas liquids and sulfer (which they alternately stored in blocks or sold, depending on demand and price), then re-injected the <b>dry</b> <b>gas</b> to cycle the reservoir to capture more liquids.

In the case of West Whitecourt, they also processed dry but sour gas from the Pine Creek field (near Edson) as a source of make-up gas.

30|$|Depending on {{the type}} of atomizer, the liquid is mixed with the hot <b>drying</b> <b>gas</b> and flows into the drying chamber towards the outlet. When liquid FPH is {{supplied}} into the drying chamber and sprayed by the atomizer, the fine particles of liquid start immediately to interact with hot inert <b>drying</b> <b>gas,</b> which is delivered from the heating system. Simultaneous heat and mass transfer occurs while heat is supplied to the droplets from the drying agent by convection. The temperature of the droplets is rapidly increased up to the wet bulb temperature and the moisture from the particles starts to evaporate with a certain almost constant rate. At the same time, the <b>drying</b> <b>gas</b> temperature decreases. This period is considered as a first stage of spray drying; most water is removed during this stage. During the second stage, the temperature of the particles rises toward the air temperature at the outlet of the drying chamber (Huang et al. 2017, Wisniewski 2015). The final dried FPH is collected from the solid separator, which is mounted at the chamber’s outlet and delivered to be packed and further transported.|$|R
6000|$|... 627. But the {{diminution}} {{of power to}} one-half {{on the side of}} the gaseous body towards the metal is only a slight result of what seems to me to flow as a necessary consequence of the known constitution of gases. An atmosphere of one gas or vapour, however dense or compressed, is in effect as a vacuum to another: thus, if a little water were put into a vessel containing a <b>dry</b> <b>gas,</b> as air, of the pressure of one hundred atmospheres, as much vapour of the water would rise as if it were in a perfect vacuum. Here the particles of watery vapour appear to have no difficulty in approaching within any distance of the particles of air, being influenced solely by relation to particles of their own kind; and if it be so with respect to a body having the same elastic powers as itself, how much more surely must it be so with particles, like those of the platina, or other limiting body, which at the same time that they have not these elastic powers, are also unlike it in nature! Hence it would seem to result that the particles of hydrogen or any other gas or vapour which are next to the platina, &c., must be in such contact with it as if they were in the liquid state, and therefore almost infinitely closer to it than they are to each other, even though the metal be supposed to exert no attractive influence over them.|$|E
