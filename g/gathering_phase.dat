40|$|House {{maintenance}} {{is crucial to}} ensure the longevity of house components, {{in the same time}} retaining their functionality. Unfortunately, house owners are usually caught off-guarded, especially when house components were already deteriorated without warning. Adding salt to the wound, major house maintenance and rectification generally occur after defect liability period in which the costs incurred are not covered by the developer. The pertaining issue of lack prevention measures towards house components at certain point of time is prevalent. Since there is no established pre-rectification guideline that is able to assist house owners to proactively self-evaluate their house components from time to time, the said problem stays firm. Here, as far as maintenance’s guideline is concerned, knowledge gap in terms of life expectancy (LE) of generic house components is well observed. Therefore, the authors embarked on research exploration through literatures on identifying the factors leading to LE for house components and further suggested average LE for generic house components. However, the authors limit the paper within the initial process of research exploration to understand the central phenomenon of this study, which only governed the process of reviewing literatures. In a nutshell, the authors posit that LE was worth explored by embedding a multi-layered thematic analysis which comprised of several interconnected themes between house components and life expectancy of house component. Finally, the authors are optimist that the initial outcome from the literature reviews is paramount for subsequent phases, for instance validation and data <b>gathering</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{education}} and training of construction graduates are highly influenced by the higher education institutions which produced them and the relevant professional bodies, which set the competencies that guide both academic and industrial learning. Thus, {{it is important to}} ascertain what the key stakeholders perceive construction graduates should achieve in competencies. Construction is a practice-oriented collection of professions, thus, this research focussed on the quantity surveying (QS) profession that is responsible for cost control and management of construction projects, and accredited by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify and analyse the expected level of competencies attained by QS graduates, assess the industry perception of the achievement of competencies by QS graduates, and the ranking of competencies in the order of perceived importance. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted three different data <b>gathering</b> <b>phases</b> to include literature review, expert forum, and two surveys – industry and academia. Findings The research revealed unrealistically high expectations by the construction industry of QS graduates achieving a high level of competency in ten mandatory, seven core, and seven optional competencies. The research found that there were significant levels of dissatisfaction with the expected level of achievement of mandatory, core, and optional competencies by the QS graduates. Thus, a perception gap was identified between the academia and the industry. Practical implications This research will provide a benchmarking tool for curricula alignment for the construction degree programmes in higher education. Originality/value The identification of the exact nature of industry competencies requirements and any variations will assist the construction graduates to connect more effectively to the industry. These research findings confirm the need for continued expansion of curricula and diversification of pedagogies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{undertaken to}} determine the optimum configuration of a model that will assist all participants in a project alliance to both ensure and demonstrate the achievement of value for money (VfM) or best value. The research was focused on project alliances established to deliver infrastructure works in Australia. Despite the increasing adoption of project alliancing as a procurement approach for infrastructure projects, {{the absence of a}} sound methodology for ensuring and demonstrating VfM for such a commercial arrangement has proven to be the ‘Achilles heel’ of alliance contracting and is likely to limit the further and broader acceptance of this relationship based procurement approach. Further to a detailed review of the procurement literature, a preliminary model was devised which adopted the form of a lifecycle flowchart. The model sought to describe all of the primary activities involved in delivering a project, from inception to completion, through a project alliance procurement approach and identified milestones in the lifecycle, akin to gates in the Gateway© Review process, at which the VfM ‘health’ of the project should be monitored and addressed. This preliminary model was then tested and refined through two data <b>gathering</b> <b>phases.</b> During the first phase the model was presented to 27 individuals involved in 5 alliances to seek ‘verification’ of the content by knowledgeable practitioners in the field. The model was amended to reflect the feedback received. The second phase of the research involved obtaining feedback on the revised model, through a web based Delphi survey process, from a group of 12 recognised experts in the field of alliancing. Comments received though the Delphi process resulted in substantial changes being made to both the structure and content of the model. The responses obtained confirmed that the model was seen as offering a structured and disciplined approach to VfM for all participants at each stage of the lifecycle of a project...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Within-problem learning, and in {{particular}} learning from failure, {{has proven to be}} extremely beneficial in solving combinatorial problems in the boolean satisfiability domain (SAT) where both clause learning and clause weighting are used by many of the top SAT solvers. Similar research in solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) has been done on nogood learning and constraint weighting (to name but two). The latter closely resembles clause weighting while the former is comparable with clause learning. In this paper we focus on developing the constraint weighting strategy for guiding search, through variable ordering, to elements of most contention in the belief that handling these elements early in search will reduce overall effort. Our aim is to construct a general purpose approach, which has an information <b>gathering</b> preprocessing <b>phase,</b> for solving both soluble and insoluble problems. No prior knowledge of the problem is required. We show experimentally that such an approach can greatly improve on the normal use of constraint weights for guiding complete search. ...|$|R

As part of the design of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of arthroscopic surgery for FAI syndrome, we developed a protocol for non-operative care and evaluated its feasibility. Methods In phase one, we developed a protocol for non-operative care for FAI in the UK National Health Service (NHS), through a process of systematic review and consensus <b>gathering.</b> In <b>phase</b> two, the protocol was tested in an internal pilot RCT for protocol adherence and adverse events. Results The final protocol, called Personalised Hip Therapy (PHT), consists of four core components led by physiotherapists: detailed patient assessment, education and advice, help with pain relief and an exercise-based programme that is individualised, supervised and progressed over time. PHT is delivered over 12 – 26  weeks in 6 – 10 physiotherapist-patient contacts, supplemented by a home exercise programme. In the pilot RCT, 42 patients were recruited and 21 randomised to PHT.

40|$|Abstract With the {{development}} of real-time ray tracing in recent years, it is now very interesting to ask if real-time performance can be achieved for high-quality rendering algorithms based on ray tracing. In this paper, we propose a pipelined architecture to implement reverse photon mapping. Our architecture can use realtime ray tracing to generate photon points and camera points, so the main challenge is how to implement the <b>gathering</b> <b>phase</b> that computes the final image. Traditionally, the <b>gathering</b> <b>phase</b> of photon mapping has only allowed coarse-grain parallelism, and this situation {{has been a source}} of inefficiency, cache thrashing, and limited throughput. To avail fine-grain pipelining and data parallelism, we arrange computations so that photons can be processed independently, similar to the way that triangles are efficiently processed in traditional realtime graphics hardware. We employ several techniques to improve cache behavior and to reduce communication overhead. Simulations show that the bandwidth requirements of this architecture are within the capacity of current and future hardware, and this suggests that photon mapping may be a good choice for real-time performance in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This work is {{an extract}} of an {{on-going}} research work aimed at delivering a mobile application called AquaFriend. This mobile application is principally usable by fishermen in Malaysia, hence Bahasa Melayu {{is the language}} used for displaying its information. However, the requirement and process models {{presented in this paper}} are adaptable for usage in any geographical location. The requirement <b>gathering</b> <b>phase</b> of our study presents validated six functional requirements. From our findings, it is shown that: some of the existing mobile applications are only compatible with android operating system, and fully internet-dependent. These features are not consistent with the socio-economic status and technology literacy level of many of these fishermen. This is because: they are mostly rural dwellers.
