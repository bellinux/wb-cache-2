50|$|Bosenbach was {{inhabited}} {{not only}} by farmers, {{but also by the}} craftsmen who would normally be found in such a village. Quite early on, though, there were also workers who worked in the stone quarries, coalmines and chalk mines. Today, agriculture plays only a subordinate role. The village is today home to people of the most varied of occupations, who must commute to work. With respect to religion, the overwhelming majority belong to the Evangelical <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> Christianity. <b>Population</b> figures rose steadily from about 500 in the early 19th century to roughly 900 in the late 20th century, then growth stagnated and recently there has been a slight drop.|$|R

3000|$|The other {{independent}} variables are operationalized as follows. In order to measure cultural distance {{we rely on}} two different indicators. First, we construct a variable for linguistic distance where we count the share of foreigners from a country with only different national languages as the receiving country. We rely here on studies showing that linguistic distance is related with distance in norms and values (e.g. Licht, Goldschmidt, and Schwartz, 2007). Unfortunately this data is not available for the entire time series according to country of birth. Hence, the data has been estimated according to information of the citizenship of the foreign residents. In this case only data from 1975 to 1985 for the UK and 1997 for Spain remains unavailable. We also measure a variable for religious distance with the share <b>of</b> the Muslim <b>population</b> per country. We restrict ourselves to the Muslim population because in Western Europe it {{is by far the}} largest religion to which only few natives adhere. Among those it is also the only for which data has been systematically collected for the time period under investigation. However, not all countries have reliable official data on the <b>denomination</b> <b>of</b> its <b>population</b> (Brown, 2000). Hence, if there was no official data on the number of Muslims in a country, we made use of the estimates of Kettani, (1986) for 1982, and the Pew Research Centre (Grim and Karim, 2011) for 1990, 2000 and 2010.8 [...]...|$|R
