From volatility impulse response functions, we find that low S&P 500 returns cause substantial increases in the volatility of the energy index; however, we find only a weak response from S&P 500 volatility to energy price shocks. Moreover, our <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedge</b> ratio analysis suggests that the energy index is generally a poor hedging instrument...|$|R

To meet the emissions reduction targets, the regulated parties can choose to participate in the allowance-based market by purchasing the spot allowances.

Given the risky nature of the offset credits, this paper evaluates the <b>hedging</b> performance of <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios for the carbon offset credit (certified emissions reduction) market in the EU-ETS. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to evaluate the <b>hedging</b> performance of <b>dynamic</b> and constant <b>hedge</b> ratios in the carbon offset credit market.

Furthermore, the added benefits of using conditional volatility forecasting, namely an asymmetric generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (asymmetric GARCH) process, are examined when constructing <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedge</b> fund index portfolios. The evaluation period {{is based on a}} monthly out-of-sample comparison from May 2002 to June 2006 for nine Credit Suisse First Boston/Tremont hedge fund indices.

A multivariate asymmetric GARCH model is also considered for portfolio construction using daily S&P Hedge Fund sub-indices data. Before transaction costs are included, results show that when hedge fund indices exhibit volatility clustering, accounting for forecasted next-period volatility generates portfolios with the best risk-return profile among all portfolios under consideration.

Special classes of extended simultaneous volatility systems (ESVL) are estimated and used to generate out-of-sample hedge ratios. In a hypothetical <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedging</b> scheme, ESVLbased hedge ratios, which incorporate incremental information in the implied volatilities of the two S&P 500 option markets, generate profits from interim rebalancing of the futures hedging position that are incremental over competing hedge ratios.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} dominance {{model has}} long been proven to exhibit greater theoretical advantage than the Minimum-Variance (MV) approach in futures hedging. This paper aims to demonstrate the superiority of Extended Mean-Gini (EMG) framework {{which is consistent with}} the secondorder of stochastic dominance theory. The merits of the EMG model are credited to its specifications where the distributional assumptions of normality are not required. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of investors’ distinct risk averse behaviour towards optimal futures hedging strategy. The empirical distribution function method and the more efficient kernel estimation method are employed in the estimation of EMG hedge ratios. Furthermore, in order to investigate the suitability of ‘buy and hold’ strategy in futures hedging, the moving data window procedure is used to examine the stability of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios. The research is conducted on Malaysian Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and CPO Futures (FCPO) markets for the period of 16 th March 1995 to 28 th June 2011.

40|$|Commodity {{cash and}} futures {{prices have been}} rising {{steadily}} since 2006. As evidenced by the April 2008 Commodity Futures Trading Commission Agricultural Forum, there is much concern among traditional futures and options market participants that the usefulness of commodity derivatives has been compromised. When basis risk is particularly high, <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedging</b> methods may be helpful despite their complexity and higher transaction costs. To assess {{the potential benefits of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedging</b> in volatile times, this paper proposes a novel, empirical copula-based method to estimate GARCH models and to compute time-varying hedge ratios. This approach allows a nonlinear, asymmetric dependence structure between cash and futures prices. The paper addresses four principal questions: (1) Does the empirical copula-GARCH method overcome traditional limitations of <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedging</b> methods? (2) How does the empirical copula- GARCH hedging approach perform, for storable agricultural commodities, compared with traditional GARCH and Minimum Variance (static) hedging methods? (3) Is <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedging</b> more or less effective in the post- 2006 biofuels expansion time period? (4) How sensitive is the ranking of methods to the hedging effectiveness criterion used?

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to estimate the hedge ratios of foreign-listed single stock futures (SSFs) and to compare the performance of risk reduction of different methods. The OLS method and a bivariate GJR-GARCH model are employed to estimate constant optimal hedge ratios and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>hedging</b> ratios, respectively. Data of the SSFs listed on the London International Financial Future and Options Exchange (LIFFE) are used in this research. We find that the data series have high estimated constant optimal hedge ratios and high constant correlation in the bivariate GJR- GARCH model, except for three SSFs with their underlying stocks traded in Italy. Our findings provide evidence that distance is a critical factor when explaining investor’s trading behavior.
