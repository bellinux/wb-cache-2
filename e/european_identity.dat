5|$|While {{heavy metal}} {{throughout}} its history has referenced the occult, Viking metal bands use {{a very specific}} mythology, which informs their textual choices, album imagery, and, frequently, musical compositions. Despite a whole pantheon of Norse gods to choose from, Viking metal bands typically focus on Odin, the god of war, and on Thor and his hammer. Alcohol, particularly mead, is also a common lyrical focus. Viking metal bands tend to follow one of two approaches. The first is one of romanticism and escapist ideas, where bands cultivate an image of strength and barbarism and quote passages from various poems and sagas. The second approach emphasizes historical accuracy, typically relying on Norse mythology as the sole focus of lyricism and identity. Many Viking metal bands identify first with local roots– for instance, Moonsorrow with Finland or Einherjer with Norway– with a wider northern <b>European</b> <b>identity</b> coming second.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} traces military {{integration in}} Europe from the 1940 s {{to the early}} 2000 s in order to reveal {{the growth of a}} common <b>European</b> defence <b>identity.</b> Four factors characterize its approach. First, <b>European</b> defence <b>identity</b> is analyzed in relation to the broader path of European integration and its historical context, showing connections with key turning points in European integration, with the evolution of Franco-German relations and European-American relations, with the Cold War and subsequent Collapse of Communism, etc. Second, the dissertation applies theories of identity formation to guide the historical analysis. This approach draws attention, for example, to the important roles that borders and symbols played in <b>European</b> defence <b>identity</b> formation. Third, the thesis adopts a hybrid “top-down” and “bottom-up” approach; one side considers formal programs, policies, and institutions that promoted a <b>European</b> defence <b>identity,</b> while the other takes stock of public perceptions, actions by “rank and file” soldiers, etc. This dual approach helps to reveal more fully the complex, negotiated character of <b>European</b> defence <b>identity</b> formation. Finally, this thesis traces the growth of a <b>European</b> defence <b>identity</b> as a path of ideological and emotional change, growing commitment, and trust-building that spanned decades...|$|R
40|$|Trying to {{reconstruct}} and understand different perspectives on Europe and <b>European</b> <b>identities,</b> initially {{we made a}} distinction between the ‘internal’ and the ‘external’. In the course of the research process, however, this distinction proved to bring more ambiguities than it was supposed to resolve. Analysing the autobiographical narrative interviews with people born, raised and living in Europe, on the one hand, and those born on different continents and now living in Europe, on the other, we realised how complex the process of identification with Europe can be. The diversity of perspectives on Europe cannot be brought down to rough distinctions between the ‘internal’ and the ‘external’ as much as <b>European</b> <b>identities</b> cannot be brought down only to people, or to all the people, living on the European continent...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} concept of <b>European</b> Union <b>identity</b> and its {{significance}} for European integration by drawing upon insights from theories of nationalism and national <b>identity.</b> <b>European</b> Union <b>identity</b> is viewed as an ongoing process which is banal, contingent and contextual. The central hypothesis is that: European integration facilitates the flourishing of diverse national identities rather than convergence around a single homogeneous <b>European</b> Union <b>identity.</b> The role of the EU as facilitator for diverse understandings of collective identities encourages the enhabitation of the EU at an everyday level and the reinforcement {{of a sense of}} banal Europeanism which is a crucial aspect of the European integration process.

500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of <b>European</b> <b>identity</b> and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the advancement of}} the established body of literature on language and identity by ascertaining how discursive representations of multilingualism at an institutional level have interplayed with the construction and the definition of <b>European</b> <b>identities.</b> Using the Discourse Historical Approach (Wodak 2001), the analysis focuses on a corpus of official speeches given by the European Commissioner for Multilingualism to identify discursive strategies and linguistic devices and link them to wider socio-political and historic dynamics. Findings suggest that the institutional construction of Europeanness has primarily occurred through macro discourses predicated on cultural, civic and economic dimensions of multilingualism with some inherent tensions in contrasting representations of ‘diverse’ and multilingual EU-rope. It is suggested that through heterogeneous representations of multilingualism torn between identity politics and commodification, <b>European</b> <b>identities</b> emerge as hybrid and fragmented constructs in between national, post national and global dimensions.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} extent to which young people in {{predominantly}} middle-class environments identify with Europe and considers the influence of European education policy, school ethos and curricula. We compare data drawn from individual and focus group interviews with students aged 15 – 17 at a state school and a European School in England. The empirical analysis was informed by post-structuralism and found that young people at both schools developed multidimensional, multifaceted identities. Students at the European School, which has an ethos of developing both national and <b>European</b> <b>identities,</b> identified themselves more as European than their peers at the state school, which integrated students {{on the basis of a}} common British citizenship. The findings suggest that the policy on the European dimension in education contributes towards developing students’ identification with Europe and to their knowledge of Europe, though not at the expense of their ethnic and national identities, which were stronger than their <b>European</b> <b>identities.</b> Lack of a European dimension in education (both in and out of school) seems to result in a lack of identification with and knowledge about Europe...|$|R

Hence, Belgium and Britain, and France and Germany proffered theories of national superiority that justified colonialism as delivering the light of civilization to unenlightened peoples. Notably, la mission civilisatrice, the self-ascribed 'civilizing mission' of the French Empire, proposed that some races and cultures have a higher purpose in life, whereby the more powerful, more developed, and more civilized races {{have the right to}} colonize other peoples, in service to the noble idea of [...] "civilization" [...] and its economic benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Opposition to {{the tunnel}} {{over the decades}} {{reflected}} the high value the British placed on their insularity, and their preference for imperial links that they controlled directly. Only after the British Empire collapsed in the 1950s, and air travel replaced sea travel, could they appreciate the desirability of closer ties to the continent. [...] With opposition fading, the government could more carefully consider the long-term economic and strategic value, and the new sense of a <b>European</b> <b>identity.</b> [...] The British government's attitude toward a tunnel changed from hostility in 1948 to acceptance and promotion in 1964. This change reflected not only a more favourable view {{of being part of}} European unity, but also the calculation that the tunnel would provide economic advantages, especially if Britain ever joined the European Economic Community. By the 1960s, British attitudes toward the tunnel also reflected a realistic reappraisal of the country's international status: after Suez 1956 everyone realized the islands were no longer a super-power. Britain's prestige and security now seemed safest when tied closely to the continent.|$|E
2500|$|The British Indian Army {{organised}} regiments and {{units on}} the basis of religion and regional or caste identity. Bose sought to end this practice and build up one unified Indian identity among the men who would fight for independence. Consequently, the Indian Legion was organised as mixed units so that Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs all served side-by-side. Around the time of its formation in late 1942, 59% of the legion's men were Hindus, 25% were Muslims, 14% were Sikhs and 2% other religions. Relative to the British Indian Army, there were more Hindus and Sikhs, and fewer Muslims. The success of Bose's idea of developing a unified national identity was evident when Heinrich Himmler proposed in late 1943 (after Bose's departure) that the Muslim soldiers of the I.R. 950 be recruited into the new Handschar Division. The commander of the SS Head Office, Gottlob Berger, was obliged to point out that while the Bosnians of the [...] "Handschar" [...] perceived themselves as people of a <b>European</b> <b>identity,</b> Indian Muslims perceived themselves as Indians.
