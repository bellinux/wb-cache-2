Both gangs agree to settle their dispute, {{seemingly}} a street fight, but the Wanderers struggle to find a gang willing to back them. With no other options, Richie asks his girlfriend's father, local mafia boss Chubby Galasso, who agrees to <b>help</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> gangs' dispute.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that <b>help</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> team's case.|$|E
5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to <b>help</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Although many {{carbon offset}} {{projects}} tout their environmental co-benefits, some {{are accused of}} having negative secondary effects. Point Carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some hydro-electric projects as carbon offsets; some countries in the EU are not allowing large projects into the EU ETS, because of their environmental impacts, {{even though they have}} been individually approved by the UNFCCC and World Commission on Dams. It is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given {{the fact that they are}} a relatively new form of carbon reduction, and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to <b>help</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> issue of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|The Carioca Aqueduct is {{considered}} the architectural work of greater importance of Old Rio {{and one of the}} main symbols of the city. The impressive Roman-style building is 17.6 meters high, 270 meters long and 42 arches that connect the neighborhood of Santa Teresa to Morro de Santo Antônio. The Carioca Aqueduct was built in 1723, during the colonial Brazil, and was intended to lead water from the Carioca river height Morro do Desterro, on Santa Teresa for the Morro de Santo Antônio. The work would <b>help</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> problem of water shortage in the city. Problem that was already old. Studies to bring the waters of the Carioca river to the city began {{in the early years of}} the seventeenth century, but the works of installing water pipes in Rio de Janeiro did not start until a century later.|$|E

25|$|The IA allele gives type A, IB gives type B, and i gives type O. As both IA and IB are {{dominant}} over i, only ii {{people have}} type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, {{which means that}} type A and B parents can have an AB child. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child if they are both heterozygous (IBi,IAi) The cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen {{at the same level}} that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can <b>help</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.|$|E

The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation. To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also {{announced that}} Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases. Additionally, Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, {{while the number of}} phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.|$|E
