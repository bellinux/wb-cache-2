40|$|There {{are four}} {{parameters}} generally {{used to describe}} the treatment of grain by the continuous-flow dielectric heating system. Two of these parameters, the frequency of the electric field between the load plates and the electric field intensity, remain at reasonably constant values during treatment because of their primary dependence upon fixed elements in the system and their slight dependence upon the characteristics of the grain being treated. However, the remaining two parameters, the length of exposure to the electric field and the final grain temperature, are highly correlated and dependent to a large extent upon the characteristics of the grain being treated. Because of the interdependence of the exposure time and the final grain temperature, {{it would be impossible to}} hold all four treatment parameters constant when there is variation in the characteristics of the grain being treated. It is, therefore, the objective of this thesis to present the design and construction of a device which automatically regulates the final grain temperature through adjustment of the exposure time by means of the <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> Advisor: Stuart O.

40|$|The {{mapping of}} within-field crop yield {{variations}} offers {{a basis for}} the adjustment of input application rates to match yield potential. The aim of this project was to examine available yield mapping components and systems, and to assess the benefits that could accrue from yield mapping. The work also included site investigations of possible causes of yield reduction, and an evaluation of the potential increase in profitability from variable-rate N application. Yield mapping requires the continuous measurement of harvester position and grain yield. Accurate positioning was achieved with systems which received a remote correction signal via communications satellite. A <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> in the clean grain elevator gave low errors in conditions where the deflector plate could be kept clean. The production of useful yield maps was sometimes limited by rainy weather leading to wet crops, lodging, and big variations in harvest conditions within the field. Difficulties are also presented by small, irregularly-shaped fields. The level of within-field variation in cereal yields (25 % of the field area at least 21 % below the mean) suggests that there is scope for identifying low-yielding areas and either taking corrective action or applying reduced inputs. An analysis of the results of N fertiliser trials suggests a potential gain from about £ 20 /ha in sugar beet to less than £ 10 /ha in spring barley if N application rate could be varied to apply the optimum amount to each area within a field. All the costs of application map development and variable-rate application would need to fall below these gains to justify the use of the technology. To allow further use to be made of yield maps, it is desirable that the factors responsible for yield reduction be identified, in particular those which recur each year. In the present study, soil chemical analysis and compaction affected yield in only a small proportion of cases. Differences between maps from successive years have been small. It is concluded that the immediate financial benefits from the use of this technology will be small. However, in a future where the recording, justification and minimisation of inputs such as pesticides and fertiliser will grow in significance, and where the cost of the equipment and software will continue to fall, yield mapping and variable-rate input application will find a useful role.

40|$|The yield {{monitors}} use {{a constant}} delay time {{to match the}} <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> with location. Therefore, mixing and smoothing effects on the <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> are neglected. Although constant time delay compensates for time mismatch, actual <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> at a combine harvester head is not equal to the <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> measured by a sensor due to the dynamics effects. In order to eliminate the dynamics effects, a new method for estimating actual <b>grain</b> <b>flow,</b> called proportional distribution (PD), is proposed. This method assumes that actual <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> is directly proportional to the feedrate. Based on this assumption, the actual <b>grain</b> <b>flow</b> results from redistributing accumulated grain mass over a certain time according to {{the profile of the}} feedrate.

When changing oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> we have observed that sometimes, even with the same oxygen flow setting as before, a different S-pO 2 is obtained. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the precision and accuracy of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> used in hospital settings. METHODS: An experimental study was performed to test oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> from a tertiary hospital, by using a calibrated flow analyzer. Used and new <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> accuracy was tested by reading in the gas analyzer a single measurement at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 91 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and they were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. <b>Flow</b> <b>meter</b> precision was tested by reading in the flow analyzer 3 repetitive measurements set at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 11 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and the reproducibility of these measurements was conducted by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Friedman test. RESULTS: the mean measured flow rates were slightly lower than the stipulated flow rate at 1 L/min, very close for 3 L/min, and higher for the 5 and 10 L/min flow rates. There was a large variability among the measurements from different <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> mainly at low flow rates (1 and 3 L/min). There {{was no difference between}} new and used <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at the <b>flow</b> rates measured, except at 10 L/min. <b>Flow</b> <b>meters</b> precision analysis showed a good reproducibility in 3 repetitive measurements for each flow rate (minimum 0. 95, maximum 0. 99 intraclass correlations).

40|$|Balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are recent {{additions}} to an established class of simple, rugged <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> that contain no moving parts {{in contact with}} flow and are based on measurement of pressure drops across objects placed in flow paths. These <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are highly accurate, minimally intrusive, easily manufacturable, and reliable. A balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> can be easily mounted in a flow path by bolting it between conventional pipe flanges. A balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{can be used to}} measure the flow of any of a variety of liquids or gases, provided that it has been properly calibrated. Relative to the standard orifice-plate <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> introduces less turbulence and two times less permanent pressure loss and is therefore capable of offering 10 times greater accuracy and repeatability with less dissipation of energy. A secondary benefit of the reduction of turbulence is the reduction of vibration and up to 15 times less acoustic noise generation. Both the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and the standard orifice-plate <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> are basically disks that contain holes and are instrumented with pressure transducers on their upstream and downstream faces. The most obvious difference between them is that the standard orifice plate contains a single, central hole while the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> contains multiple holes. The term 'balanced' signifies that in designing the meter, the sizes and locations of the holes are determined in an optimization procedure that involves balancing of numerous factors, including volumetric flow, mass flow, dynamic pressure, kinetic energy, all in an effort to minimize such undesired effects as turbulence, pressure loss, dissipation of kinetic energy, and non-repeatability and nonlinearity of response over the anticipated range of flow conditions. Due to proper balancing of these factors, recent testing demonstrated that the balanced flow-meter performance was similar to a Venturi tube in both accuracy and pressure recovery, but featured reduced cost and pipe-length requirements...|$|R

All set-ups are in accordance with the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> specifications. The results demonstrate that both the change in temperature and the disturbed flow profiles introduce errors in the flow measurements. The change from 20 °C to 50 °C and 70 °C can cause a shift in meter performance larger than the specified maximum permissible error. Compared with the ideal installation the installations generating disturbed flow profiles cause errors up to more than 2 %. The errors due to temperature and installation effects have a bias to add when combined. This might lead to even larger errors.
