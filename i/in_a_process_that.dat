5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s {{four of the}} Universal-produced films {{fell into}} the public domain when their {{copyright}} was not renewed. These four films were restored and colourised. Some of the films in the series had become degraded over time, {{with some of the}} original negatives lost and others suffering from nitrate deterioration because of the unstable cellulose nitrate film. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the series, putting the films onto modern polyester film, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> was jointly paid for by UCLA, Warner Bros. and Hugh Hefner.|$|E

5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{metal can}} be isolated by electrolysis of its hydroxide <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> has changed little {{since it was}} first used by Humphry Davy in 1807.

De facto president Jorge Rafael Videla, who was convicted and given a life sentence in 1985 and pardoned years later, received a new life sentence in 2010. General Luciano Benjamín Menéndez, who waged war against the leftist guerrillas in the northern Argentine provinces, received a life sentence as well.|$|E

5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.|$|E
5|$|The territories were {{governed by}} {{mandatory}} powers, {{such as the}} United Kingdom {{in the case of}} the Mandate of Palestine, and the Union of South Africa in the case of South West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> did not end until 1990.

50|$|When {{consumers}} make unfavorable {{comparisons between}} the chosen option and the options forgone, they may feel post-decision regret or buyer's remorse.

50|$|The {{culture of}} the Square Mouthed Vases has spread widely in {{northern}} Italy, penetrating deeply among local populations, replacing the previous facies, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> may not always have been peaceful. We find the typical elements of this culture (grave goods with polished axes, use of bow and arrow, cylindrical frames) that suddenly supplant the pre-existing cultural groups; although sometimes they are assimilated elements as decorative elements, in the Veneto and Trentino aera. These cultural upheavals that occurred around 4000 BC, lead to a strong unification of the territories, with a homogeneity of style in the archaeological findings.|$|R
