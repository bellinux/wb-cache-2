To prevent the software that transmitted the message from tampering with the LEAF, a 16-bit hash was included. The Clipper chip would not decode messages with an invalid hash; however, the 16-bit hash was too short to provide meaningful security. A brute-force attack would quickly produce another LEAF value that would give the same hash but not yield the correct <b>keys</b> after the <b>escrow</b> attempt. This would allow the Clipper chip to be used as an encryption device, while disabling the <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> capability. In 1995 Yair Frankel and Moti Yung published another attack which is inherent to the design and which shows that the <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> device tracking and authenticating capability (namely, the LEAF) of one device, can be attached to messages coming from another device and will nevertheless be received, thus bypassing the escrow in real time.

A {{publicly}} verifiable {{secret sharing}} (PVSS) scheme, named by Stadler in [Sta 96], {{is a special}} VSS scheme in which anyone, not only the shareholders, can verify that the secret shares are correctly dis-tributed. The property of public verifiability is what the first proposed VSS scheme [CGMA 85] incorporated but later protocols [GMW 87, Fe 187, Ped 911 failed to include. PVSS can provide some interesting properties in the systems using VSS. For instance, it gives a practical solution to (k, /) -threshold VSS assuming no broadcast channel.

40|$|Lawful {{interception}} {{and the way}} it {{is performed}} have {{played a significant role in}} the effectiveness of this type of communication monitoring. Although the secrecy of interception and the related equipment are supposed to provide correct information to a law enforcement agency, there are some countermeasures that can be taken by the subject that can seriously undermine the collection of correct and accurate data. This thesis project attempts to identify the problems that exist for interception of telephony (be it fixed, mobile, or via the Internet). Moreover, there are some suggestions for improvements how lawful interception should be performed in order to avoid possible attacks that could decrease the credibility of the intercepted data. Numerous publications (in print or distributed on the Internet) have described weaknesses in the current state of the art lawful interception when using equipment that can be purchased in the market. This thesis presents improvements in how LI can be conducted in order to avoid these vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is a description of the <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> <b>systems</b> and the possibility of avoiding one of their most significant vulnerabilities. The main problem of the lawful interception is the rapid changes in telecommunications and the complicated architecture of the telecommunication networks, as both make monitoring vulnerable to specific countermeasures. An analysis of how lawful interception can take place and current countermeasures for lawful interception of Internet telephony are vital in order to identify the problems in carrying out such intercepts today and to make suggestions for improvements. This topic is especially relevant given the current Swedish “FRA lagen” regarding interception of electronic communication going into, out of, and through Sweden.

40|$|Lawful {{interception}} is {{a common}} practice for monitoring a telecommunication network by law enforcement agencies all over the world. It plays a vital role to ensure national security and to control crimes by providing authorized monitoring of communicating parties in a communication network. However, there are some important issues {{that need to be}} addressed, such as the privacy of individuals, malicious use of lawful interception by a “bad” cop, vulnerability of a lawful interception system to misuse by others, cost, legal liability, etc. These issues have lead to opposition to lawful interception. Many researchers have been looking for a secure and acceptable lawful interception system that would eliminate or minimize the undesirable aspects of lawful interception. One of the approaches that gained a lot of attention is a <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> encryption <b>system.</b> For lawful interception a key recovery <b>key</b> is <b>escrowed</b> with a trusted third party. This key can subsequently be used for decryption by the law enforcement agency. The trusted third party might be a government agency or a private company. The process for recovering keys should be based on a predefined securitypolicy. The trusted third party’s responsibility is to store the key and to protect it from malicious use. This malicious use could be by a competitor, a telecommunication operator, Internet Service Provider (ISP), a law enforcement agency, or other party. If the trusted third party itself utilizes the key or improperly discloses the key to another party, then the data that was protected by encryption could be compromised Unfortunately, there is no easy means to detect if the data has been tampered with or not. This thesis focuses on therefore in the case of voice over IP, where {{there is a need for}} a means to determine if a recorded conversation is authentic or not. Hence the objective of the overall thesis project is to design, implement, and evaluate a security mechanism that can be used with a trusted third party -based <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> encryption <b>system</b> that will prevent or reduce the risk of forgery by (a bad cop within) a lawenforcement agency using the <b>escrowed</b> <b>key.</b> This thesis describes how a <b>key</b> <b>escrow</b> encryption <b>system</b> would be improved by the proposed mechanism – with a focus on the actions of a party that has access to the <b>escrowed</b> <b>key.</b> We do not examine how the party got access to this key, but for the purposes of this thesis we assumed that this party is either a good cop or a bad cop. We have defined the meaning of these terms and examine what operations a bad cop might attempt to perform – given the access to the master key. For example, this party could capture the data packets of a Voice over IP session, and then decrypt the packets using the key provided by the escrow agent. After decryption we examined the ability of a bad cop to modify or forge data packets, then encrypt these forged packets with the key – in order to fabricate evidence. We then examined how to detect such modifications or forgery. The proposed system is able to detect this forgery, based upon the inability of the forger to generate the correctly signed hashed message authentication coded. We also examine additional extensions to the user agent and the escrow agent to be able to identify which packets (or groups of packets) were not generated by the original participant in the conversation. The goal is to understand if the proposed mechanism could make lawful interception more secure, while increasing the protection of the communicating parties’ conversation from undetected manipulation and making the digital record of a conversion easier to authenticate...|$|R
