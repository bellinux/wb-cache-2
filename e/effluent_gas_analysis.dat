40|$|In membrane-aerated biofilm {{reactors}} (MABRs), {{hollow fibers}} {{are used to}} supply oxygen to the biofilms and bulk fluid. A pressure and concentration gradient between the inner volume of the fibers and the reactor reservoir drives oxygen mass transport across the fibers toward the bulk solution, providing the fiber-adhered biofilm with oxygen. Conversely, bacterial metabolic gases from the bulk liquid, {{as well as from}} the biofilm, move opposite to the flow of oxygen, entering the hollow fiber and out of the reactor. Metabolic gases are excellent indicators of biofilm vitality, and can aid in microbial identification. Certain gases can be indicative of system perturbations and control anomalies, or potentially unwanted biological processes occurring within the reactor. In confined environments, such as those found during spaceflight, it is important to understand what compounds are being stripped from the reactor and potentially released into the crew cabin to determine the appropriateness or the requirement for additional mitigation factors. Reactor <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> focused on samples provided from Kennedy Space Center's sub-scale MABRs, as well as Johnson Space Center's full-scale MABRs, using infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography techniques. Process gases, such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrous oxide, were quantified to monitor reactor operations. Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) GC-MS analysis was used to identify trace volatile compounds. Compounds of interest were subsequently quantified. Reactor supply air was examined to establish target compound baseline concentrations. Concentration levels were compared to average ISS concentration values and/or Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) levels where appropriate. Based on a review of to-date results, current trace contaminant control systems (TCCS) currently on board the ISS should be able to handle the added load from bioreactor systems without the need for secondary mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Toxic product yields {{from five}} {{commercial}} cables {{obtained from a}} steady state tube furnace (SSTF) method (lEC 60695 - 7 - 50, Purser furnace) are compared with results from a large-scale test, which uses the physical fire model in the proposed prEN 50399 - 2 - 2 test, {{with the addition of}} <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis,</b> using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and for further comparison, a static tube furnace method (NF X 70 - 100). This work represents one of the first attempts to establish a relationship between bench- and large-scale toxic product yields for burning cables. This is difficult because the cables have been formulated for low flammability, and therefore do not burn consistently. The tube furnace burns the cable completely, whereas the large-scale test effluent {{is the result of a}} combination of flame spread and toxic product yields, both of which are fire scenario dependant. There is significant differentiation between cable types based on composition, and arising because only a portion of the cables burn in the large-scale test, accompanied by possible decomposition of hydrate sheaths. The fire stage of the large-scale test appears to have been replicated in an appropriate manner, given the correspondence of the CO 2 /CO ratios. The yields of CO 2, CO, HCl and smoke show reasonable agreement, given the differences in the extent of burning, and the accuracy of the mass-loss data available for the large-scale test. The yields and extent of burning have been combined to demonstrate the estimation of toxic hazard for a particular fire scenario based around the large-scale test, which shows only marginal sensitivity to the differences in toxic product yield between the SSTF and the large-scale test.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} first {{investigation of a}} novel mixed conducting BaZr 0. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 3 -? perovskite (BZF 10) in terms of materials properties, combined electrochemical and catalytic properties over a complete span of gas environments (O 2, CO 2, H 2 O, CO, H 2) as well as membrane separation applications. This unique combination of electrical conduction, catalytic activity and long-term material stability makes this material a promising candidate for solid oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) and solid oxide reversible fuel cell (SORFC) applications. Powder of BZF 10 was synthesized via solid-state reaction and characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD); results indicated {{the presence of a}} primary cubic perovskite phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated stable grain structure and well-defined grain boundaries within the pellet. Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) was carried out on the sintered pellet at 600 - 800 ?C under various oxygen partial pressures (pO 2). ECR indicated that both chemical diffusion coefficient DV and surface kinetic parameter k? increased with pO 2. The oxygen permeation flux through BZF 10 membrane at 900 ?C was 0. 102 mL/(min?cm^ 2) with air/Ar gradient. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and <b>effluent</b> <b>gasses</b> <b>analysis</b> were carried out at 600 - 800 ?C under a wide range of gas environments. Under dry O 2 conditions, this material displayed p-type semi-conduction behavior; upon exposure to dry CO 2 atmosphere, the material showed catalytic activity towards CO 2 reduction to CO and O 2; exposure to moisture inert suggested only mild interaction with steam; under moist CO environment, a complex conduction mechanism was displayed alongside significant rates of water-gas-shift reaction; exposure to humidified H 2 resulted in increase in conductivity with H 2 partial pressure indicating n-type semi-conduction. Upon completion of > 1, 000 hours of continuous exposures, physical inspection of the BZF 10 electrochemical cell indicated negligible chemical or mechanical degradation. XRD and TEM indicated stable phase composition and stable grain structure within the pellet. The hydrogen permeation flux was 0. 75 mL/(min?cm^ 2) at 900 ?C when exposed to 20 %H 2 /Ar and controlled by bulk diffusion. In the range of 600 - 700 ?C, the hydrogen permeation was limited by the electronic transport with higher activation energy (Ea); while in the range 700 - 900 ?C, the hydrogen permeation was limited by the mixed protonic-electronic transport with low Ea...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the problem of fire {{protection}} mainly in industrial units in the region of Northern Greece. The region represents a large enough sample to allow applications of the findings to the rest of Greece. The approach adopted was two Parts: Part 1 : Collection and analysis of ali significant industrial fires in Northern Greece between 1999 - 2003. Fire incident data were gathered from the Greek Fire Service, National Statistical service, Greek Insurance Union. In total seven hundred and three (703) fire incidents were analyzed. Analysis involved categorizing according industry type. Further analysis for the biggest categories of Timber and Textile industries with respect to place of origin, ignition sources, first ignited materials, time of ignition, degree of spread, financial loss. The data were further processed to provide the probability of fire breaking, fire spread and the expected financial loss was determined using Extreme Value Theory. The main finding ofthe statistical analysis were: Ã‚Â• Although the Textile and Timber industries account for lees than 6 % of the industrial units they account for 47 % ofall fire incidents Ã‚Â• The largest values of probability of fires breaking -out were' mostly seen in the ' production and machinery areas, due to electricity, followed by fires breaking in storage areas due to electrical causes or arson. Ã‚Â• Event tree analysis showed that the' probability of the fire spreading beyond the item first ignited was large(about 70 %) for Textile and Timber industries in comparison. to other countries. The statistical analysis showed clearly that prevention of fire spread beyond the first item ignited would {{have a major impact on}} the reduction of fire losses. 24 % of first-ignited materials were wooden surfaces.

Part 2 : As a possible solution to the problem the effect of three (3) typical intumescent flame retardants (latest technology) on the most common types of Timber in Greek industries was examined in small (cone calorimeter) and medium scale (1 m 3 enclosed fire rig) experiments combined with online <b>effluent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> equipment (FTIR). Analysis involved thermal behavior, smoke production and toxic species analysis of the samples. The main findings ofthe experimental analysis were: Ã‚Â• No ignition' and lower toxic emissions compared to untreated samples were. observed at 35 kW/m 2 (small scale). Ã‚Â• The same behavior was observed in those cases where wooden surfaces located next to ignition source had been treated (medium scale). As a next step the experimental and statistical data was employed in an event-tree analysis for cases of fires in Timber industries Based in this analysis it was estimated that the probability of a fire spreading beyond the first ignited materials in case of treatment with -.. [...] -. _- flame retardants reduced by 58 % A tentative cost benefit analysis using a typical industrial unit supported the use of flame retardants on a financial basis with a payback period of two (2) years.
