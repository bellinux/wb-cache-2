25|$|Zanfona (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, {{with three}} melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older {{examples}} had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually {{tuned to the}} key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the bordonciño in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the bordón in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the bordonciño (this string was sometimes known as the human voice, because <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if someone is humming the melody an octave lower).|$|E
500|$|Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{gave the}} album {{one out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "the cheapest-sounding record in recent memory; <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if it was {{recorded}} in less time that it takes to play." [...] He did note Hung's improvement as a vocalist, saying that [...] "he sings with more confidence and at least vaguely sings something resembling the melody." [...] The New York Daily News called the album a cult classic.|$|E
500|$|While {{other members}} went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading factual books {{regarding}} serial killers, including Gordon Burn's Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West. Araya was seeking inspiration, and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself {{to sound like}} a gimmick. Araya sang the lyrics more [...] "over-the-top" [...] than done on previous albums, as King's writing style is more [...] "aggro." [...] This resulted in Kerrang! reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album's lyrics as [...] "so packed with foul and abusive language that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if D-12 and the Sopranos family were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon." ...|$|E
60|$|But to Gerald <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> {{if he were}} insistent {{rather than}} confident.|$|R
60|$|The Brook {{had changed}} her note again. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though she were mumbling {{something}} soft.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never again." [...] I think Mrs. Fursey took a {{pleasure}} in the phrase. <b>It</b> <b>sounded,</b> <b>as</b> she said <b>it,</b> {{like something out of}} the prayer-book.|$|R
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair outed {{the song}} as a [...] "heart-on-my-sleeve number", {{and called it}} the [...] "crux of the album". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt the song [...] "made Mariah likeable again" [...] and wrote [...] " [...] an {{inspirational}} ballad that's equal parts 'Butterfly' and 'Hero'." [...] A writer from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune compared it to Carey's debut single, [...] "Vision of Love", and called {{it one of the}} best cuts from The Emancipation of Mimi. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic gave the song a mixed review, criticizing the condition of Carey's voice, [...] "As good as those Wright-helmed cuts are, they are also the times that the mixes slip and don't hide the flaws in Mariah's voice, and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet." ...|$|E
500|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{wrote that}} the album [...] "feels more like a band record than {{anything}} [...] done in decades". He praises Clarke's choice in bandmates, calling them [...] "prodigies in their own right" [...] but does not praise the whole album. He called [...] "Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu's Report" [...] a [...] "clumsy, failed attempt at summing up the music's history to date" [...] and that [...] "Bass Folk Song No. 6" [...] does not [...] "work [...] well" [...] {{as some of the}} other tracks but [...] "these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording". Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there [...] "are no radical departures" [...] on this album and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if Clarke is [...] "taking a victory lap here, revisiting past triumphs" [...] but that he [...] "still pull sounds out of his assortment of electric, acoustic and Alembic basses like nobody else, and [...] still slapping, plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary, fusion jazz, rock, funk and whatever else he puts his mind to".|$|E
500|$|... "Army of Me" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Andrew Hampp for Billboard and Chris Younie for 4Music both though that [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{could have been}} a potential single, the latter of whom writing [...] "This track must be a future single." [...] Younie continued to write that the song [...] "captivates and excites right from the very start", has a [...] "euphoric" [...] energy and is the type of [...] "angry" [...] pop song that Kelly Clarkson [...] "would give her right arm for". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe described it as a [...] "Gloria Gaynor-meets-Depeche Mode dance of anger." [...] Mike Wass for Idolator wrote that although [...] "Army of Me" [...] is a [...] "quality" [...] song, it is an album filler. Writing that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> though {{it would have been a}} good song to include on her previous studio album, Bionic, Wass thought that Aguilera was [...] "not exaggerating" [...] when she refers to it as [...] "Fighter 2.0". He concluded his review by saying that although her vocals are sparse, it is a [...] "quirky" [...] addition to Lotus. The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski described Aguilera as a [...] "playful" [...] and [...] "sassy techno diva" [...] on [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
6000|$|... "'Chick-a-dee-dee, ma'am, chick-a-dee-dee!'" [...] {{answered}} the {{bird in the}} same cheerful tone. And <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if he said, 'I shall be cared for. I'm not afraid.' ...|$|R
50|$|The British version, by Alain Legrand, {{removed the}} vocals and {{increased}} the tempo of the tune while making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> were played on a fairground organ.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{man with}} {{concussion}} {{of the brain}} doesn't cry out like that. Besides, {{did you hear the}} end of <b>it?</b> <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though some one were choking him. Hush!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Animal Boy {{featured}} {{a range of}} genres and musical elements {{that had never been}} seen in previous albums. Heavier and more frequent use of the synthesizer, as well as the use of extremely minimal and [...] "gimmicky" [...] lyrics, [...] made critics and fans alike feel as though this was the least like their early albums, despite Animal Boy predecessor Too Tough Too Die being acclaimed for the band returning to their roots. [...] "The main problem with Animal Boy" [...] explain author Everett True, [...] "was that there was no longer one discernible Ramones sound: <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> disjointed as the band members probably felt. The guitar parts could've been played by anyone, and Richie's drumming was slipping away from Tommy's original template. The Ramones were turning into a 9-5 job, night not day." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks {{reviewed}} the follow-up {{book about the}} next generation titled Millennials Rising (2000). [...] "Millennials" [...] is a term coined by Strauss and Howe. Brooks wrote: “This {{is not a good}} book, if by good you mean the kind of book in which the authors have rigorously sifted the evidence and carefully supported their assertions with data. But it is a very good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if you get away from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really do seem to be taking place.” [...] Further, Mr. Brooks wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E
2500|$|Delson's {{style is}} {{sometimes}} criticized {{as being too}} simplistic, lacking complexity, and largely limited to non-solo, non-instrumental sections, particularly during the Hybrid Theory and Meteora eras. He has stated that he [...] "doesn't like to show off", and that he attempts to play his guitar so that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> though it were the keyboard or strings so as to seamlessly {{fit in with the}} band's hip-hop- and electronica-style compositions. [...] Delson has also stated that he likes to produce a gritty, [...] "sampled" [...] feel with his sound. [...] Although a self-described [...] "fervent opponent of guitar leads," [...] he started performing solos in the Minutes to Midnight era after his bandmates encouraged him to do so. Delson performs guitar solos on the tracks [...] "What I've Done," [...] "In Pieces" [...] and [...] "The Little Things Give You Away." [...] Delson also played many solos on Linkin Park's 6th studio album The Hunting Party.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{call him}} in and make him dance!" [...] cried the girls, all {{chirping}} at once, till <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if a flock of sparrows had taken possession of the shed.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment the {{children}} fired, the Indians in hiding discharged their weapons, detonations being echoed and reëchoed from mountain to mountain, until <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if a severe engagement was in progress.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if he {{were asking}} if he had caught cold or hurt his foot, and Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. [...] "I {{want to see her}} again. I must see her." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tracy E. Hopkins of Barnes & Noble {{wrote that}} the song [...] "won't wow too many fans with its nursery rhyme-like." [...] Spence D. of IGN was mixed, writing, [...] "The {{obligatory}} star power guest shot occurs with 'Call On Me' featuring Nelly. Janet goes for her delicate wisp, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if she's trying hard to maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't {{the way to do}} that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E
60|$|Don't say that; <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> {{though you}} regretted having married her.|$|E
60|$|JULIA. Don't say that: I hate it. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if I were a mere animal.|$|E
60|$|Again {{and again}} the {{question}} was asked, and the answer became fainter and fainter, although <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> was a distant cry in response to Rujub's shout rather than spoken in an ordinary voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's splendid!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{and he could}} not doubt the {{approval}} in her voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> if she meant to applaud him as well as show her satisfaction with the consequences of his exploit.|$|R
50|$|This makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> {{though the}} {{punishment}} {{was more of}} a prolonged ducking than anything intended to inflict serious injury or trauma. Indeed, a footnote in one source suggests that it may have evolved from the medieval punishment of ducking.|$|R
60|$|Dor. Ay, for ever! <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> hellishly to me, {{as it can}} do to you, but there's no {{help for}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{favourite}} indoor sport!" [...] said Freddie with enthusiasm. [...] "Hullo! What's up? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> {{if there}} were dirty work at the cross-roads!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, dear. I know <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if {{all their}} insides {{were coming out}} of their mouth. But we want to be serenaded, don't we, nurse?--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm terribly interested," [...] said Ruth. (But {{she made}} <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> though she really was.) [...] "I think it's so wonderful.... I {{want to go}} off {{tramping}} through the Berkshires. I'm so tired {{of going to the}} same old places." ...|$|R
50|$|The musicians {{included}} the Everlys on guitars, Floyd Cramer on piano, Floyd Chance on bass and Buddy Harman on drums. The distinctive drum sound {{was achieved by}} recording the drums with a tape loop, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if there were two drummers.|$|R
5000|$|... "By {{fostering}} {{better life}} decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence. Yet opponents make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> {{if the government}} would be forcing people into unhappy unions. It's nonsense." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. This {{noise is}} {{extremely}} unpleasant. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> {{if he was}} having an argument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and often convincing.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I {{wanted to}} say, {{but it sounds}} {{different}} on your lips. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> though you meant it yourself, and that you meant it because of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not entirely, if it please your honour," [...] said Joceline; [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> if {{you were}} preaching a sermon, and has a marvellous twang of {{doctrine}} with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Audiomatic - This is a {{sound effects}} unit that adds vintage audio quirks to music, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> were being played back from past devices such as analog tape, a vinyl record, a {{crackling}} radio, an old television set, etc.|$|R
60|$|We watched {{each other}} for a few minutes; and I noticed that his mouth kept opening and shutting, though he said nothing. Suddenly, edging closer to me, he spoke in a thick whisper. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> though his mouth were full of wool.|$|R
60|$|Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock {{grappled with}} Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, {{and there was}} a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
