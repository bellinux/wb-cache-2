25|$|Attempts to {{sell the}} mine, or its assets, came to nothing. Eventually Captain Borlase, who had retired in 1919, {{proposed}} a new investment by the old shareholders and negotiated new terms with the landowners. Shareholders agreed to a reconstruction of the company which involved allotting four new £1 ordinary shares {{for each of the}} 7,680 old shares, and issuing 4,280 preference shares to raise money needed for development of the mine. The new 1923 Greenside Mining Company Ltd. came into being, and the landowners agreed a <b>dead</b> <b>rent</b> of £225 per year for five years, with a reduced scale of royalties payable on top of the rent after that time.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the company}} {{wanted to be}} sure that Greenside Mine {{contained}} sufficient reserves of ore to enable the large-scale mining operation which would make it profitable. They proposed taking a two-year option on the mine, during which they would refurbish the property and prove its resources, paying the landowners a <b>dead</b> <b>rent</b> of £90 per year. Many terms of the old leases they rejected as inappropriate to a large, modern mining company. They proposed a fixed royalty payment of 1/40th (5%) {{of the value of the}} lead concentrates, arguing that if the mine was worked on a large enough scale, these royalties would be quite satisfactory to the landowners.|$|E

50|$|Unlike German mining law, in Great Britain and the Commonwealth the {{principle}} of mining by landowners prevails. The crown only lays claim to gold and silver reserves. In exceptional cases (e.g. where land ownership is divided) mining rights may be given to a third party, whereby the landowners have to be compensated. The mining company pays the landowner a lease, <b>dead</b> <b>rent</b> or a royalty. The rights to above- and below-ground minerals (as a rule quarries and mines) may be awarded separately.|$|E
50|$|Mr Lonsdale {{agreed to}} lease Mr Walsh a mill for seven years. Rent varied {{with the number}} of looms being operated, but there was a minimum <b>dead</b> <b>rent</b> paid yearly in advance on demand. The lease was not in fact granted by deed (as was {{required}} for leases over three years), yet Mr Walsh moved in and began paying rent quarterly. Mr Lonsdale demanded payment in advance and levied distress for non payment of rent. If the terms of the agreement were enforceable, then Mr Lonsdale had acted lawfully.|$|E

Times changed, and in 1870 a new lease was negotiated with the Lonsdale family, with an increased <b>dead</b> <b>rent</b> of £500 per annum and 6d royalty per ton. Despite the school's wealth and academic lustre, the Education Commissioners for Cumberland remcommended in the 1870s that St. Bees cease teaching Ancient Greek and therefore become a [...] "second rate school".|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} had to {{move the}} filming of the beach sequences from the previous episodes due {{to changes in the}} tides at that time of year. Similar to the previous episode, the spaceship was computer-generated. The sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up. Fifty thousand <b>dead</b> crickets were <b>rented</b> from a local entomologist for the scene where Scully's tent was attacked by bugs. The live insects were portrayed by blowing popcorn and packing foam at Anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production.|$|R

5000|$|On 21 February 1982 Booth {{remarried}} to Gail Mathieson, {{an office}} executive, in Redfern. When {{his good friend}} and fellow left-faction member, Jack Ferguson, retired as Deputy Premier and Leader, Ferguson recommended Booth as his preferred successor, however, following some opposition from within the left faction, Booth lost the ballot to Ron Mulock. He remained as Treasurer until {{the defeat of the}} Unsworth Labor government at the state election in March 1988. In opposition Booth was appointed by the new Leader, Bob Carr, as Shadow Minister for Energy and Shadow Minister for Mineral Resources from 11 April 1988. He was accused by the new Minister for Administrative Services, Matt Singleton, of interfering, as Treasurer, with a Government office accommodation deal that resulted in $350,000 in <b>dead</b> <b>rent.</b> The unsubstantiated allegations infuriated the ALP Opposition and Booth was supported by Opposition Leader, Bob Carr. A subsequent Police inquiry cleared Booth of any wrongdoing. Booth however, did not live to see his name cleared and Carr commented that: [...] "the tragedy of this case is that Ken Booth died before his name could be cleared". He died in office, survived by his daughter and his second wife, of a myocardial infarction on 1 November 1988 at his home and was cremated.|$|E
50|$|The {{title is}} a {{biography}} and true account of Susan Berman and her December 23, 2000, murder.

She was discovered <b>dead</b> in her <b>rented</b> Beverly Hills home, lying face down in a spare bedroom after her dogs were seen running {{in and out of}} an open back door. Originally, Los Angeles police thought Berman’s death was a mob hit, because Berman’s father, Davie Berman, was a Jewish mobster with ties to the Chicago syndicate, plus Berman was killed with a single bullet {{to the back of her}} head, which at the time was believed to be a contract-style hit.|$|R

40|$|Lime {{has been}} burnt {{all over the}} Cotswolds ever since Roman times, yet the subject has never {{received}} the attention it deserves. The last works on any considerable scale were in an isolated spot south of Chedworth, {{but they have been}} strangely forgotten, without even a passing mention in several books devoted to the old Midland & South-Western Junction Railway which served them. Few records have so far come to light, and much of what follows are the recollections of old employees gathered over a long period. The Pre-war Years It appears that the Fosse Lime and Limestone Co. was promoted by the late T. F. Coke of Cheltenham, a co-director being his secretary, a Miss Potts. A Mr Pearson was also involved. Previously, Coke had been a director of the Leckhampton Quarry Co., near Cheltenham, an ill-fated venture which attempted to expand a very old industry out of all proportion to the potential. (Its history is described in my book Old Leckhampton, 1994). After taking full advantage of Government loans, bankruptcy ensued in 1926, and many years later Coke told me of many bad mistakes which had been made. But much had been learnt in the process, and T. F. COKE & Sons became well-known quarry owners in the locality. They were eventually taken over by Hills of Swindon. Following the Leckhampton debacle, Coke turned his attention to Fosse Cross, where a long quarry-face alongside the main line and served by a siding already existed. The stone was a very pure white limestone in the Great Oolite formation. The company obtained a lease from the Great Western Railway (who now owned the line) for 21 years from 25 th March 1928 with an annual <b>dead</b> <b>rent</b> of £ 50, mergible into royalties on the sale of quick-lime and other products. There was also a rental on the railway sidings. Quite when production began is not clear, but according to Linsdal Richardson the geologist, the plant comprised the following, as well as a 2 ft. gauge quarry tramway: "Mr. Thomas F. Coke, a Director of the Fosse Lime and Limestone Company, has furnished me with the following particulars of the Plant:...|$|E
