5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, K-III {{continued}} acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991. K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR {{continued to make}} new <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity. In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the absence of}} an active high yield market {{prompted}} KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988. KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications, a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.|$|E

40|$|Public {{and private}} {{investment}} {{and economic growth}} in Zimbabwe: An empirical testThis study performs an examination {{on the impact of}} public and private investment on economic growth in Zimbabwe from 1970 to 2014. In addition to estimating the economic growth model, the study also estimates the crowding effect of public investment on private investment. The study utilised the newly developed ARDL-bounds testing approach with better small sample properties than the traditional cointegration techniques. The results show that while public investment has higher short-run impact on economic growth than private <b>investment,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run, private investment contributed more to economic growth than public <b>investment.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> results reported the crowding-in effect on private investment of infrastructural public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run and gross public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. Furthermore, the results found the crowding-out effect on private investment of gross public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run and non-infrastructural public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run. The results suggest that the short-run and long-run contribution to economic growth of private <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> Zimbabwe can be improved by cutting back on non-infrastructural public investment to necessary minimum level while stimulating <b>the</b> growth <b>in</b> infrastructural public <b>investment.</b> Colleges of Economic and Management Science...|$|R
5|$|Boeing {{issued a}} {{petition}} for bankruptcy 22 June 1971, which {{was carried out}} by Oslo District Court the following day. The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company because the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages. Tjøntveit stated on 8 September that he intended to sue Boeing for damages from the seizure of the aircraft, but by October no writ of summons had been received by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim. Manufacturing {{became an important}} component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{controversy}} {{arose in}} the NP when lawyer Olaf Madsen– who had cooperated with Ola Thommessen for more than 20 years at the newspaper Verdens Gang and was responsible for its economic decisions– wanted to have more dividend for his <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspaper. Editor Ola Thommessen considered this to be an inappropriate intervention in the editorial part of the newspaper, and took his staff with him and started a new newspaper named Tidens Tegn. Vogt supported Thommessen in his decision, and came {{at odds with the}} chairman of Morgenbladets board, lawyer and politician Edmund Harbitz. Both left Morgenbladet in the summer of 1913 {{as a result of the}} disaccord, although Vogt continued as theatre and literature critic in the paper until his 1927 death. As editor, Vogt was succeeded by C. J. Hambro.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{the work}} to {{establish}} a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started. It was passed, in 2001, by {{the city and county}} councils, as well as the Norwegian Parliament. Oslo Package 2 allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier was for 33 units (or 99 cars), and was approved by the board on 28 June 2003. The initial order cost NOK1.6 billion, and included options for further orders. Five other manufactures had been rejected during the procurement process. Combined with other <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network, the new trains will allow faster travel times on the metro.|$|E
5|$|Korketrekkeren was {{originally}} part of Frognerseterveien, a road which {{ran up to}} Frognerseteren. It was completed in 1867 to the orders of landlord Thomas Johannessen Heftye, who had been purchasing forest properties in the area. The section between Svendstuen and Frognerseteren gradually became known as Korktrekkeren. Holmen- og Voksenkollselskapet was established in 1888 and undertook a series of public infrastructure <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, including the construction of roads, skiing trails, natural tobagganing tracks and a chapel. The property was given to Kristiania Municipality (today Oslo Municipality) in 1894. Tobagganing became a popular sport from the 1880s and Holmen- og Voksenkollselskapet rented out sleds which were permitted to be used on roads and designated tracks after 19:00 on evenings with moonlight.|$|E
5|$|The Lewisville Police Department had 27 sworn police {{officers}} in 1977, and the number had increased to 136 by 2007. As of 2015, the department included 229 full-time employees, four of whom were administrators. The Lewisville Fire Department included 146 full-time employees, six of whom were administrators. After the September 11 attacks, the fire department and its then chief, Rick Lasky, attracted national attention when they raised {{a large amount of}} donations for victims' families. As a reward, John Travolta, Joaquin Phoenix, and Robert Patrick visited the department in 2004 to promote the release of the film Ladder 49. In May 2011, Lewisville residents approved a sales tax increase to create two public safety districts.

5|$|The loss of {{its only}} {{access to the}} Baltic Sea was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which {{represented}} only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained {{a third of its}} industry. Lithuania also lost its heavy <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> port's infrastructure. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government. Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country: in March–April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20% of total deposits. After the loss of Klaipėda, Lithuania drifted into the German sphere of influence, especially in terms of trade. At the end of 1939, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and for 86% of its imports. Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. Not surprisingly, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany. The Nazis {{went so far as to}} suggest a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region, but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were {{designed}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the World Bank, then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became operational in 1946. Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could {{play an important role}} in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms, rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests. In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars) in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars) loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG). In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking. In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), Eurobank (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National Bank of Greece (20 million).|$|E
