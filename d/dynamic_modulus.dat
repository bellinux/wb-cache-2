Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.|$|E

One of the several methods to evaluate the long-term performance of concrete during winter is KS F 2456.

METHODS: To measure relative <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity, ultra sonic is generally used.
