40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>eptastigmine</b> in patients with moderate to moderately severe AD. BACKGROUND: <b>Eptastigmine</b> is a centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor. METHODS: The study was carried out according a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. Patients received a 24 -week treatment with placebo or <b>eptastigmine</b> 15 mg or 20 mg three times daily after a 4 -week, stepwise dose escalation. The effects of treatment on cognition, global function, and {{activities of daily living}} were evaluated with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus (CIBIC-Plus), and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL), respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-six centers recruited 491 patients: 164 on placebo, 166 on <b>eptastigmine</b> 15 mg three times daily, and 161 on <b>eptastigmine</b> 20 mg three times daily. Percentages of patients completing double-blinded treatment were 87 % in the placebo group and 86 % in both the eptastigmine-treated groups. At the end of treatment, the intent-to-treat analysis on 463 patients showed a dose-dependent effect of <b>eptastigmine</b> on all efficacy variables, with a statistically significant effect of the 20 mg three times daily dose compared with placebo on the ADAS-Cog, CIBIC-Plus, and IADL. Patients on <b>eptastigmine</b> 15 mg three times daily performed significantly better than placebo-treated patients only on the ADAS-Cog. Eleven patients on placebo (7 %), 13 patients on <b>eptastigmine</b> 15 mg three times daily (8 %), and 12 patients on <b>eptastigmine</b> 20 mg three times daily (8 %) discontinued study treatment because of adverse events. Adverse events were recorded in 49 % of patients on placebo compared with 54 % on <b>eptastigmine</b> 15 mg three times daily and 48 % on <b>eptastigmine</b> 20 mg three times daily. Cholinergic side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) were reported with similar frequency in the eptastigmine- and placebo-treated patients. There was a dose-dependent transient and mild neutropenic effect associated with <b>eptastigmine</b> treatment, and one patient on 20 mg three times daily had an asymptomatic pancytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Eptastigmine</b> produces significant cognitive, clinical, and functional benefits in patients with probable AD. Although the cholinergic tolerability of <b>eptastigmine</b> was found to be favorable, its potential adverse hematologic effects limit its clinical utility. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An enzyme {{inhibition}} biosensor, developed in our laboratory and previously {{used for the}} analysis of compounds with anticholinesterase activity (e. g. physostigmine, neostigmine, pyridostigmine nicotine and organophosphorus compounds) has now been tested {{for the analysis of}} another recently synthesized cholinesterase inhibitor, i. e. <b>eptastigmine.</b> In addition nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, although displaying weaker inhibition properties, were also tested in pharmaceutical products using the same inhibition enzyme sensor. The biosensor consisted of a hydrogen peroxide amperometric electrode coupled to a functionalised nylon membrane chemically bonding both the enzymes butyrylcholinesterase and choline oxidase; a butyrylcholine standard solution in glycine buffer acted as substrate, The response of the system to all the inhibitors considered was characterised completely and the analysis of several pharmaceutical formulations containing nicotinamide or nicotinic acid was also performed...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} cholinergic drugs {{in the treatment of}} neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) by a systematic review of the literature on the following agents: choline, lecithin, physostigmine, tacrine, 7 -methoxyacridine, ipidacrine, galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine, <b>eptastigmine,</b> metrifonate, arecoline, RS 86, xanomeline, cevimeline, deanol, and meclofenoxate. All relevant randomized controlled trials, without any language or year limitations, were obtained from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group 2 ̆ 7 s Register of Trials. Trials were classified according to their methodological quality. For binary and continuous data, relative risks (RR) and weighted or standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated, respectively. Eleven trials with a total of 261 randomized patients were included in the meta-analysis. Cholinergic drugs showed a minor trend for improvement of tardive dyskinesia symptoms, but results were not statistically significant (RR 0. 84, 95...|$|E
40|$|Present {{and future}} of cholinesterase inhibitors in the {{treatment}} of Alzheimer's disease Sedanjost in prihodnost inhibitorjev holinesteraze v zdravljenju Alzheimerjeve bolezni Ezio Giacobini 2 Presently, cholinesterase inhibitors (CHEIs) represent the drug of choice for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Application of ADAS-cog scale in more than 30 phase III clinical trials that included over 6000 subjects from comparable patient population during a 6 -month treatment period, demonstrated significant effects of three different reversible (tacrine, donepezil and galanthamine) and three pseudo-irreversible or irreversible CHEIs (<b>eptastigmine,</b> rivastigmine and metrifonate) on cognition. Clinical effect of most CHEIs in AD seems to be stabilisation of the patient symptomatology rather than improvement of the disease from base-line. In addition to positive effects on cognition, CHEIs produce significant effects on behaviour. They alleviated particularly such symptoms as apathy, motor agitation and hallucinations. Improvement of behavioural symptoms may translate into a better quality of life for both patient and his caregiver. Long-term studies have shown that clinical efficacy of CHEIs can be extended to 12 months or more.,]YOHþHN Inhibitorji holinesteraze (CHEI) predstavljajo trenutno zdravilo prve izbire v zdravljenju Alzheimerjeve bolezni (AD).

40|$|In {{recent years}} muscarinic {{receptor}} agonists and cholinesterase inhibitors {{have been developed}} for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We have evaluated examples from both classes of compounds in rodent tests of reference and working memory, as well as tests that are sensitive to the side-effects of these compounds. Thus, three selective muscarinic receptor partial agonists L- 689, 660, (M 1 /M 3), AF 102 B (M 1 /M 3) and L- 687, 306 (M 1) and two cholinesterase inhibitors, E 2020 and <b>eptastigmine,</b> were compared in a mouse tail-flick (TF) test, a rat response sensitivity (RS) test, in rat tests of reference memory, passive avoidance (PA) or conditioned suppression of drinking (CSD), and working memory (delayed-matching-to-position, DMTP). In the TF test, all of the compounds tested, with the exception of L- 687, 306, (1. 0 - 30. 0 mg/kg) dose-dependently induced antinociception of which L- 689, 660 was the most potent (minimum effective dose (MED) = 0. 03 mg/kg). In the RS test, all of the compounds, but again with the exception of L- 687, 306, (1. 0 - 30. 0 mg/kg), dose-dependently reduced response rates, of which L- 689, 660 was again the most potent (MED = 0. 1 mg/kg). In the reference memory test, all the compounds reversed the effects of a scopolamine-induced deficit with L- 687, 306 being the most potent (MED = 0. 01 mg/kg). By contrast, in the DMTP test, although both the cholinesterase inhibitors and L- 687, 306 reversed the effects of scopolamine-induced deficit, L- 689, 660 and AF 102 B were without effects. These results suggest that cholinesterase inhibitors and low efficacy M 1 selective muscarinic receptor agonists can reverse the effects of a scopolamine-induced deficit in animal tests of reference and working memory at doses that do not induce the side-effects usually associated with cholinomimetics...|$|E
