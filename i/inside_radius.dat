SAAMI defines the length to the shoulder as the demarcation point where the bottom of inside curvature radius (corresponding roughly to CIP's r1) [...] of the shoulder begins and the length to the neck as where the outside curvature radius (approximating CIP's r2) meets the neck. However, CIP does not define the location of the centers of the r1 and r2 whereas SAAMI provides this as being in inline with the length to the shoulder (<b>inside</b> <b>radius)</b> and length to neck (outside radius). This is due to the CIP treatment of r1 and r2 values as fillet radii as they do with many other cartridges.|$|E

5000|$|For {{insulated}} cylinders, {{a critical}} radius must be reached. Before the critical radius is reached any added insulation increases heat transfer.

If the outside radius of a cylinder is increased by applying insulation, a fixed amount of conductive resistance (equal to ln(2)/(2πkL)) is added.

40|$|For a {{supercritical}} accretion regime, {{we propose}} a critical accretion disk, where the mass-accretion rate is regulated {{just at the}} critical rate {{with the help of}} wind mass-loss. We first derive a critical <b>radius,</b> <b>inside</b> of which the standard picture is violated, using the condition that the radiative force is balanced by the gravity in the vertical direction. The critical radius r_(cr) is found to be r_(cr) =(9 sqrt(3) sigma_T/ 16 (pi) cm_p) M_(input) = 1. 95 (M_(input) /M_(crit)) r_g, where M_(input) is the mass-accretion rate at {{the outer edge of the}} disk, M_(crit) the critical accretion rate, and r_g the Schwarzschild radius of the central object. Outside of this critical radius, the disk is in a radiation-pressure dominated standard state, while <b>inside</b> this <b>radius</b> the disk is in a critical state, where the excess mass is expelled by wind and the accretion rate is kept to be just at the critical rate at any <b>radius</b> <b>inside</b> r_(cr). In such a critical accretion disk, the disk thickness is H ～ (1 / 6 sqrt 3) _r and the surface temperature is sigmaT^ 4 ～ (2 / 3 sqrt 3) L_E/ 4 (pi) r^ 2, where L_E is the Eddington luminosity. The total disk luminosity becomes L_(disk) ～ (2 / 3 sqrt 3) [In(r_(cr) /r_(in)) + l]L_E, where r_(in) is the inner radius.

5000|$|If one imagines a {{toroidal}} confinement area {{wrapped with}} ring-shaped magnets, {{it is clear}} that the magnetic field is greater on the <b>inside</b> <b>radius</b> than the outside - this is the basic stability problem that the tokamak's electric current addresses. However, the difference in that field is a function of aspect ratio; an infinitely large toroid would approximate a straight solenoid, while an ST maximizes the difference in field strength. Moreover, as there are certain aspects of reactor design that are fixed in size, the aspect ratio might be forced into certain configurations. For instance, production reactors would use a thick [...] "blanket" [...] containing lithium around the reactor core in order to capture the high-energy neutrons being released, both to protect the rest of the reactor mass from these neutrons as well as produce tritium for fuel. The size of the blanket is a function of the neutron's energy, which is 14 MeV in the D-T reaction regardless of the reactor design, Thus the blanket would be the same for a ST or traditional design, about a meter across.|$|E

This provides the spatial distribution of the initial electrons SE as they are acted upon by the uniform electric field that moves them from the cathode to the anode, while the electrons also diffuse away due to thermal collisions with the gas molecules.

50|$|Most meanders {{occur in}} the region of a river channel with shallow gradients, a {{well-developed}} floodplain, and cohesive floodplain material. Deposition of sediment occurs on the inner edge, because the secondary flow of the river sweeps and rolls sand, rocks and other submerged objects across the bed of the river towards the <b>inside</b> <b>radius</b> of the river bend, creating a point bar below the slip-off slope. Meandering morphology is dependent upon similar bank erosion and bar growth rates. Erosion is greater {{on the outside of the}} bend where the soil is not protected by deposits of sand and rocks. The current on the outside bend is more effective in eroding the unprotected soil, and the inside bend receives steadily increasing deposits of sand and rocks, and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a small cliff called a cut bank. This can be seen in areas where willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the inside of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river. This demonstrates the river's movement. Slumping usually occurs on the concave sides of the banks resulting in mass movements such as slides.|$|E
