40|$|NFPA 101, section 5 - 9 {{mandates}} that, where {{required by}} building classification, all designated emergency egress routes {{be provided with}} adequate emergency lighting {{in the event of}} a normal lighting outage. Emergency lighting is to be arranged so that egress routes are illuminated to an average of 1. 0 <b>footcandle</b> with a minimum at any point of 0. 1 <b>footcandle,</b> as measured at floor level. These levels are permitted to drop to 60 % of their original value over the required 90 minute emergency lighting duration after a power outage. The Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) has two designations for battery powered egress lights ''Emergency Lights'' are those battery powered lights required by NFPA 101 to provide lighting along officially designated egress routes in those buildings meeting the correct occupancy requirements. Emergency Lights are maintained on a monthly basis by procedure ZSR- 12 N- 001. ''Backup Lights'' are battery powered lights not required by NFPA, but installed in areas where additional light may be needed. The Backup Light locations were identified by PFP Safety and Engineering based on several factors. (1) General occupancy and type of work in the area. Areas occupied briefly during a shiftly surveillance do not require backup lighting while a room occupied fairly frequently or for significant lengths of time will need one or two Backup lights to provide general illumination of the egress points. (2) Complexity of the egress routes. Office spaces with a standard hallway/room configuration will not require Backup Lights while a large room with several subdivisions or irregularly placed rooms, doors, and equipment will require Backup Lights to make egress safer. (3) Reasonable balance between the safety benefits of additional lighting and the man-hours/exposure required for periodic light maintenance. In some plant areas such as building 236 -Z, the additional maintenance time and risk of contamination do not warrant having Backup Lights installed in all rooms. Sufficient light for egress is provided by existing lights located in the hallways...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{and documents}} {{the performance of}} the daylighting design at Northern Guilford Middle School over an entire year. Photometric sensors and dataloggers were used to collect illumination data from the school from March 2007 to February 2008. A few experiments were performed as well during this period to determine the effect of certain design elements on the daylighting. The daylighting design uses a unique curved translucent interior light-shelf that is intended to distribute light deep into the classroom. Illumination values at fixed locations within a classroom are presented on a monthly basis as a direct measure of the daylighting performance. The research indicates that this daylighting design is highly dependent on direct beam sunlight falling on the translucent light-shelf with the annual daylighting performance varying depending upon the position of the sun in the sky. The daylighting performance can be identified as being distinctly different for the winter, equinox and summer periods. On an average, the illumination levels in the winter are well above 300 fc, near the equinox at 300 fc while in the summer they fall below the 50 <b>footcandle</b> targe...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, a positivistic {{approach}} in daylighting studies {{seems to have}} gained a tremendous momentum. Architects who favor this approach tend to downplay the fact that quality of light cannot by easily described in scientific terms. In daylighting situations, <b>footcandle</b> levels are abstract figures {{quite apart from the}} phenomenal qualities of light. In the design of courtyards, the quantity of light is not as important as its quality. ^ Architecture should be experienced emotionally through the impact of variation in light and shadow. Any daylight study which does not respond to the effect of shadow fails to address the real subject matter in a comprehensive way. Architecture is a world of light that was brought about by means of shadow. ^ A realization of this design concept is evident in buildings of hot-arid regions and particularly in the work of Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Louis Kahn, and Rifat Chaderji. While the focus of the dissertation is on building shadows in courtyard buildings in the region of Iraq, the discussion of the work of the above mentioned architects is used to highlight the various means they had used in manipulating the visual as well as the thermal effects of shadows. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the design}} of buildings, {{there is a great}} demand to make them {{sustainable}} and energy efficient. Especially in the U. S., certification by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is becoming a top priority for public and private projects. LEED is the most widely used green building certification system in the U. S. and the use of it as a standard is growing internationally as well. In the evaluation of daylight performance, LEED 2. 2 requires that a minimum daylight illumination level of 269 lux (25 <b>footcandles)</b> be achieved in a minimum of 75 % of all regularly occupied areas. However there is no tool to estimate this credit during the schematic design process and no consideration about daylight performance in current and past LEED-certified buildings. Therefore, this paper provides a simplified analysis method for evaluating the daylight performance, in meeting the daylight requirement of LEED 2. 2. The analysis of the interactions among different floor areas, window areas and visible transmittance (VT) has been evaluated. In order to verify the influence of geographical location, three different cities (Dubai, Chicago and London) were selected. Based on a series of computer simulations using RADIANCE, the results include fenestration criteria in meeting LEED 2. 2 daylight requirements.

40|$|Effective use of {{daylighting}} is {{an essential}} component to achieve a sustainable building design. In a tall building, the amount of useable space with a potential {{for the use of}} daylight is the space between the exterior wall and the core. This is commonly referred to as the ‘lease span’. Class A offi ce buildings in the USA have typically utilized lease spans of around 45 ft (13 · 7 m), primarily due to effi ciency of space usage. In Europe, however, lease spans in high-rise offi ce buildings have typically been shortened due to concerns of natural light penetrations and views. For instance, in Germany, the amount of leasable space per fl oor is less than in the USA. The maximum allowable depth of space in Germany is typically about 18 ft (5 · 5 m), whereas in the USA, as much as 50 ft (15 m) is no rarity. The lease span also has an impact on other items, such as the aspect ratio, fl oor-to-fl oor height, total height and total fl oor area. In this study, to assess and predict daylight performance, two different requirements were analysed: daylight factor (DF) and the daylight requirement of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 2. 2 green-building rating system. The recommended average DF (DFave) ranges from 2 to 5 % and LEED 2. 2 requires that a minimum daylight illumination of 25 <b>footcandles</b> be achieved in at least 75 % of all regularly occupied areas.

40|$|The 33 kDa {{manganese}} stabilizing protein (MSP) {{has been}} proposed to provide ligands to stabilize Mn ions in the water lysis reaction of photosystem II of photosynthesis. In previous research site-directed mutagenesis had been performed on regions of the psbO gene encoding two aspartic acid residues of MSP which were thought to {{have the potential to}} form carboxyl bridges with Mn ions. The purpose of this research was to analyze these mutants. Plasmids pUC 120 - 33 (# 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15) containing mutant psbO genes could not be isolated from E. coli because the expressed MSP was toxic to the cells. However, a psbO mutant gene carried in pPGV 5 - 33 (# 7) was isolated from E. coli and transformed into cyanobacterium Svnechococcus PCC 7942. Cyanobacterial cells carrying the MSP mutant showed a susceptibility to intensive light (100 <b>footcandles)</b> with a decrease of 30 % in the growth rate within the first 100 hours after inoculation. This result suggested a possible function of the MSP in protecting the oxygen evolving complex from intensive light exposure. However, the mutant appeared to revert after this time probably due to homologous gene recombination with the wild type gene. In order to further analyze the function of mutants without recombination occurring, the construction of an MSP deletion was attempted using insertion of a kanamycin cartridge {{into the middle of the}} psbO gene. The inactivated psbO gene was transformed into E. coli and transformants were selected by kanamycin resistance. However, plasmid DNA carrying the interrupted genes could not be isolated, probably due to toxicity of the expression product in E. coli cells. Thus, future studies should be directed to reconstruction of a deletion mutant by direct transformation into cyanobacterial cells. Once a deletion mutant has been constructed analyses of the site-directed mutations could be performed in cyanobacteria. Department of BiologyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Lighting {{accounts}} for about 20 % of total electrical energy consumption in the United States. Using natural lighting is a cost-effective way to reduce this consumption and, at the same time, {{enhance the quality of}} the indoor environment. For several years, architects and engineers have used scale models, hand calculator programs, and sophisticated main-frame computer programs (such as LUMEN-II) to determine levels of interior daylight for different building configurations. However, none of these tools determines the annual energy savings from daylighting, information which could have an important effect on design decisions. For this reason, a daylighting simulation has been added to DOE- 2. Taken into account are such factors as window size, glass transmittance, inside surface reflectances of the space, sun-control devices such as blinds and overhangs, and the luminance distribution of the sky. Because this distribution depends on the position of the sun and the cloudiness of the sky, the calculation is made for standard clear- and overcast-sky conditions and for a series of 20 solar altitude and azimuth values covering the annual range of sun positions. The calculations are performed prior to the complete simulation, and the the resulting daylight factors are stored for later use. Analogous factors for glare are also calculated and stored. For the hourly envelope simulation, the illuminance from each window is found by interpolating the stored daylight factors (using the current-hour sun-position and cloud cover), then multiplying by the current-hour exterior horizontal illuminance. If the glare-control option has been specified, the program will automatically close window blinds or drapes to decrease glare below a pre-defined comfort level. Adding the illuminance contributions from all the windows gives the total number of <b>footcandles</b> at each reference point.

Results of monitoring 8 differing artificial ovitraps set at 7 different sites in Chambers County, TX, from March 1990 to December 1991 indicate that adult female Cx. salinarius prefer to oviposit in black ovitraps containing grass infusion as opposed to white ovitraps with and without infusions or black ovitraps without grass infusion. Adults of this species occurring in a salt marsh environment preferred to oviposit more often in ovitraps containing brackish water, while adults occurring in upland fresh water environments oviposited more often in ovitraps containing fresh water. The reason for these differences in ovitrap selection are not known at the present time. As a result of different water preferences of this mosquito species in each of the previously mentioned environments, adult females were trapped and dissected for half a year and examined for parity rates on the suspicion that adults were migrating from the brackish marsh to upland fresh water areas. Nulliparous females are indicative of young, newly-emerged mosquitoes which {{are more likely to have}} migrated from distant areas. Parous females indicate that the mosquito was collected a short distance from the trap site, as gravid mosquitoes are most likely to oviposit at the closest available breeding site. Statistical analyses of the parity data collected on Cx. salinarius specimens from Chambers County indicated that migration from marsh sites to upland fresh water sites was not the reason for the differences in water preferences with respect to this species. Because adult female Cx. salinarius appear to prefer to oviposit in ovitraps baited with a plant infusion, a study was conducted to determine which of 5 commonly occurring marsh plant species in the Gulf Coast region of Texas might serve as the best infusion material. Spartina patens (marshhay cordgrass) and Distichlis spicata (saltgrass) baited ovitraps collected the highest mean numbers of egg rafts over the 18 -month study. Using Duncan's multiple range test for variability, the collection means for traps containing infusions of these 2 plant species were shown to be significantly higher than egg raft collection means obtained from ovitraps baited with infusions of Scirpus spp. (bulrush), Typha spp. (cattail) and Eleocharis spp. (spikerush). However, cattail and spikerush may stand to serve as a more practical choice for infusion material due to their abundance in both brackish marsh and upland fresh water environments. In regard to the biting activity of Cx. salinarius females in the Upper Coastal region of Texas, cloud cover and temperature were significant (p < 0. 05) environmental factors influencing the biting activity of this species. On warm nights (95 - 700 F), peak biting activity occurred 37. 2 minutes after official sunset in light of 0. 12 - 0. 01 <b>footcandles</b> (fc). On cool nights (75 - 50 0 F), peak biting activity occurred slightly sooner, 33. 2 minutes after official sunset and sometimes in light as bright of 0. 59 fc. On warm nights, biting was usually initiated in light of approximately 0. 10 fc; on cool nights, it was initiated earlier in brighter light (as high as 191. 00 fc). It is suspected that cooler temperatures stimulated biting activity of adult females in brighter light earlier in the evening when temperatures were still relatively high, thus taking advantage of these warmer temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This thesis {{reports a}} portion of a general {{ecological}} study of a stream under conditions of controlled flow and low levels of organic enrichment. It is concerned with the effects of experimental variations of light intensity and concentration of soluble organic enrichment imposed on seasonal variations of temperature and total light energy received upon the periphyton and benthic plants. Suitable enrichment was predicated on establishment and maintenance of an abundant growth of Sphaerotilus and involved the isolation and study of this organism in pure cultures, in laboratory streams {{as well as in the}} experimental stream. Abundant growth of Sphaerotilus was obtained in cultures at temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C while in the laboratory streams and the experimental stream, the organism produced abundant growths at a range of temperatures from 2 to 12 °C. A variety of carbon and nitrogen sources was investigated for maintenance of growth of Sphaerotilus. Abundant growth was produced when the enrichment included a specific nitrogen source combined with a specific carbon source. A carbon-nitrogen ratio of 8 to 1 proved satisfactory for maintaining Sphaerotilus in the stream. An investigation of the cropping effect of stream snails indicated that the presence of large numbers of snails decreased the standing crop of Sphaerotilus both in the laboratory streams and the experimental stream. A method was devised for determining the daily mean percentages of full sunlight reaching the four experimental sections of Berry Creek. Approximately 4 percent reached the shaded sections and 50 percent reached the light sections during the summer months. The range of mean saturating light intensities on the four experimental sections was from 250 to 950 <b>footcandles.</b> Methods designed to sample the plant communities in the experimental sections of the stream included: artificial substrates (microscope slides) used to observe the density and diversity of micro-algae; a system of grids used to record distribution of the plant biomass; and the removal of {{a portion of}} the stream substrate for the detailed examination of the benthic community. Both microscopic and macroscopic observations indicated that twice as many species and greater numbers of autotrophic organisms were present in the unenriched than in the enriched sections. Sub-samples of the harvested and homogenized materials scoured from the stream substrate, were used to determine biomass, organic matter, caloric content and pigment content. The biomasses from the enriched sections were greater than those from the unenriched sections, but contained large amounts of silt and were lower in organic matter and caloric content. The mean percentages of organic matter for the sections were: shaded, unenriched- 33; light, unenriched- 42; shaded, enriched- 19 and light, enriched- 19. The range of chlorophyll a from the four experimental sections was 0. 03 to 0. 28 g/m². The concentration of chlorophyll, when representing spatial and seasonal variations, is an acceptable measure of the productive ability of communities in shallow, rapidly flowing streams. A photosynthesis-respiration chamber was used to determine primary production and community respiration for each of the experimental sections. The range of rates of gross primary production expressed as mean O₂,g /m²/day for the unenriched sections was 0. 62 - 2. 47 and 0. 53 - 0. 59 for the enriched sections. Annual rates of gross primary production in glucose equivalents ranged from 0. 07 kg/m² for the enriched sections to 0. 30 for the unenriched. The stream communities were characterized as heterotrophic communities with production-respiration ratios ranging from 0. 47 - 0. 65 for the unenriched and 0. 16 - 0. 20 for the enriched sections. The efficiency of the fixation of light energy as organic matter was 1. 90 - 2. 23 for the unenriched and 0. 37 - 2. 70 for the enriched sections. The photosynthetic efficiencies of the communities on the experimental sections of Berry Creek were much lower than those reported for most laboratory communities, but were comparable to other natural aquatic communities...|$|R
40|$|Piping light {{represents}} the first tenable method for recovery and reutilization of lighting related heat. It {{can do this}} by preserving the energy generated at the lamp as radiative, departing from precedent and avoiding absorption of and re-emission of radiant heat as convection and conduction. Within thermodynamic limits, the radiant heat generated by an electric lamp or the sun is available for optical concentration and for reconstitution as a high thermodynamic quality power reservoir. Piping light from a large central lamp facilitates the decoupling of lighting related heat at the source, and also means that the efficiency of one central fixture can be stringently optimized instead of the multitude of fixtures it replaces in buildings. Luminous efficacy for a full-spectrum lamp decoupled of its infrared can be shown to approach theoretical limits of 250 lumens/watt. UV generated by the lamp, if coupled along with the illumination into the transport fibers, can be converted into visible radiation at the emitting end of the fiber, supplementing the light output. Fiber optics are used to carry information over long distances (actually encoded pulses of radiative IR), but certain fiber optics can carry tremendous amounts of energy. As fiber optics {{become more and more}} plentiful in telecommunications, their prices will come down. Cost and operating expense studies included in the final chapter of this thesis indicate that a large single source with light that is efficiently coupled and piped throughout a building's interior could reduce electric light consumption to one-fourth, and that even at current fiber pricing levels some systems can be competitive in initial cost to conventional lighting. Certain aspects of centralization suggest further reductions in cost and operating expenses such as centralized, instead of localized, relamping and cleaning, and eliminated requirements for thermal, electrical, and structural hardware at room fixture locations. The economic and technical feasibility of a central system depends on the simultaneous minimization of fiber aperture area and energy losses. Thermodynamically, the concentration of light for transport cannot surpass the energy density of the source. So such a system employs, at best, an optical process that preserves the extent of the source. That is, a high brightness source must be used to drive the system, regardless of the lamp's lumen output. High brightness lamps, then, can be viewed as an alternative to high efficacy lamps for increasing the energy performance of lighting systems in buildings. This thesis anticipates the existence of high brightness, high lumen lamps. The sun's 10, 000 <b>footcandles</b> in peak conditions can be a potent contributor to the energy efficacy of buildings if a collection and utilization strategy is properly devised. At 100 sq. ft of available illumination for each sq. ft of collected sunlight, a scenario including simultaneous collection and distribution of electric light and heat and sunlight and solar heat in a building could reduce to near zero the energy consumed for lighting during peak sun conditions. Studies in this thesis indicate that an economically driven future role of solar energy in the lighting, heating, and cooling of buildings could very well revolve around keeping sunlight in the form of illumination and sunheat in the form of radiative heat, instead of converting both into electricity via photovoltaics and reconversion of this electricity back into electric light. Conventional lighting is an inefficient process, essentially using heat sources for the light they provide. Not only is lighting related electricity generating predominantly waste heat, this heat must be removed from the building's envelope by an additional input of energy. Even energy saving fluorescent lamps and fixtures produce at least 80 % heat. This might serve to explain why 30 % of the country's electricity is consumed by lighting. This thesis proposes a method for decoupling and recovery of lighting related heat, and transporting light in lieu of electricity to lighting fixtures (Chapters 2 and 6). Each of the optical components that would comprise such a system is examined. Chapter 7 investigates the radiation source. Chapter 8 develops the source reflector which will direct the source's radiative output in a particular direction. Chapter 9 studies a mirror that will separate the source's radiation beam into a light beam and a heat beam for subsequent processing. Chapter 10 looks at the heat collector that will convert the heat beam into a usable high-temperature power reservoir. Chapter 11 devises the light collector/ concentrator that will facilitate coupling of light energy into a fiber optic transport network. Chapter 12 assembles the constituent components into central modules. Chapter 5 surveys the light transport media, in particular fiber optics and Prism Optical Light Guide, for suitability to building lighting applications. The exact method of solar couplature is not introduced. Sample energy efficiency comparisons, cost and payback scenarios, implementation issues and concepts for room emitters are included in chapter 13. Related concepts for a transparent concentrating solar collector for use as a window or skylight, and a solar concentrating wall are disclosed in the conclusory chapter.
