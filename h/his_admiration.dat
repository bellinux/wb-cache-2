5|$|Pick {{was widely}} read and was {{influenced}} by many writers on scientific, sociological and social matters including works by Alfred North Whitehead, Leonard Hobhouse, Edwin Lankester, Arthur Eddington and John Ruskin. On design, he {{was influenced by}} D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's description of design in nature in On Growth and Form and by architect William Lethaby. <b>His</b> <b>admiration</b> for William Morris led him to adopt Morris's favourite colour of green as his own, using green ink {{for the majority of}} his correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Winter, who {{has never}} seen combat, resents the remark. He then takes {{exception}} to what he perceives as Irwin's attempt to change {{the attitudes of the}} prisoners, <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for Irwin fading fast. On one occasion, Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, Corporal Ramon Aguilar (Clifton Collins, Jr.), who had made the mistake of saluting Irwin in the prison yard.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Suspicious, Skinner {{learns that}} Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate {{son and the}} {{rightful}} heir to the restaurant, which jeopardizes Skinner's control of the restaurant and the lucrative packaged food enterprise he formed using the restaurant's reputation after Gusteau's death. Remy discovers the evidence of Linguini's inheritance and, after eluding Skinner, gives it to Linguini, who deposes Skinner as owner. The restaurant continues to thrive, and Linguini and Colette develop a budding romance, leaving Remy feeling left out. Remy finds that his clan has come to Paris as well, and is taken to their new lair, but despite his father Django's attempts to rid his son of <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> of humans, Remy leaves.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Olympic Games {{were the}} first held in the Modern era and the most {{important}} international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted. The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times—in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men—and <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for the ancient Olympic Games, when only men were allowed to participate in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and to applaud a man's effort.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} profiles of eight heads {{in a modest}} space. The various figures represent people of different faiths {{in a moment of}} prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with his head covered carrying a religious book who is Jewish, an older woman who is Protestant, and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding rosary beads who is Catholic. In 1966, Rockwell used Freedom of Worship to show <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for John F. Kennedy in a Look story illustration entitled JFK's Bold Legacy. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to Freedom of Worship along with Peace Corps volunteers.|$|E
60|$|Of Coleridge {{there was}} little said. Coleridge was now dead, not long since; nor was his name {{henceforth}} much heard in Sterling's circle; though on occasion, {{for a year or}} two to come, he would still assert <b>his</b> transcendent <b>admiration,</b> especially if Maurice were by to help. But he was getting into German, into various inquiries and sources of knowledge new to him, and <b>his</b> <b>admirations</b> and notions on many things were silently and rapidly modifying themselves.|$|R

5|$|Within the sonnet, {{the speaker}} contemplates his {{inability}} to articulate <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for the Fair Youth, a fault he attributes to his jealousy of the Fair Youth's appearance in the poems of the speaker's Rival Poet. Sonnet 86 is notable within the Rival Poet subsection of sonnets because it allegedly provides important clues as to the historical identity of this Rival Poet. The sonnet is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, containing 14 lines of iambic pentameter and ending in a rhymed couplet.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a shot to the chest.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar Ray {{died when}} Satyajit was barely three, {{and the family}} survived on Suprabha Ray's meager income. Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School, Calcutta, and {{completed}} his BA in economics at Presidency College, Calcutta then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, though his interest was always in fine arts. In 1940, his mother insisted that he study at the Visva-Bharati University at Santiniketan, founded by Rabindranath Tagore. Ray was reluctant due to his love of Calcutta, and the low opinion of the intellectual life at Santiniketan His mother's persuasion and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to try. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. He later admitted that he learned much from the famous painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee. Later he produced a documentary film, The Inner Eye, about Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta stimulated <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for Indian art.|$|E

5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for The Curfew.|$|E
5|$|When the University of Berlin awarded {{an honorary}} degree in 1934 to American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School Roscoe Pound, who had toured Germany earlier {{that year and}} {{made no secret of}} <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for the Nazi regime, Conant refused to order Pound not to accept it, and {{attended}} the informal award ceremony at Harvard where Pound was presented with the degree by Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States. While Conant declined to participate in the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars, Harvard awarded honorary degrees to two notable displaced scholars, Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein, in 1935. What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble, despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor. It was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{planned to}} use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs, while the fast bowlers rested. However, Verity was not {{expected}} to be a big success on the tour. The good batting conditions, the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity's lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack, but Verity had a successful start to the tour. Assisted by overnight rain, he took seven for 37, including the wicket of Don Bradman, against a Combined XI, comprising some of the best Australian players. In the following game, against South Australia, Verity took eight wickets, including five for 42 in the second innings. By now, the press had begun to pay attention to Verity's achievements, and former Australian batsman Clem Hill expressed <b>his</b> <b>admiration</b> for Verity. Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances, Verity bowled just 17overs in the game, mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest. He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly. England won the match, using Bodyline tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour. After the Test, the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against the state team. Verity played in the second, and although rain interrupted play, restricting Verity to five overs, he scored his first half-century in first-class cricket. However, he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes. England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface; the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow-paced pitch and Australia levelled the series.|$|E
