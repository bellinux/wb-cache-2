Moreover, this study demonstrates that the positive relationship between <b>green</b> transformational leadership and <b>green</b> performance is partially mediated by the two mediators: <b>green</b> mindfulness and <b>green</b> self-efficacy. It means that <b>green</b> transformational leadership can not only directly affect <b>green</b> performance positively but also indirectly affect it positively through <b>green</b> mindfulness and <b>green</b> self-efficacy.

5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the <b>Greener</b> Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the <b>Greener</b> Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge.

5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have <b>greener,</b> broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
