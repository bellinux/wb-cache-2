500|$|Reviewer Peter Martin confided, [...] "The Warped Ones baffled and mystified me, but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> very much." [...] J.R. Jones, for The Reader's Guide to Arts & Entertainment, {{found the}} film [...] "actually celebrates the values it's {{supposed}} to be condemning," [...] but recommended it for its kineticism and action. TV Guide and Allmovie did not recommended it, both gave it one star in their respective four and five star rating systems.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with 60 Minutes, Hoffman revealed he {{had engaged in}} {{drug and alcohol abuse}} during his time at New York University, saying he had used [...] "anything I could get my hands on. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> all."

Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I always liked 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not like anything else. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E

500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left."

500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly laudatory {{reviews from}} television critics, particularly for its unusual {{departure from the}} standard Mad Men episode structure and {{is considered to be}} one of the best in the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix exalted the episode and the [...] "more formally experimental" [...] season, admitting, [...] "I'm still not sure I understood 100% of it. But I know <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> A lot." [...] Sepinwall characterized [...] "Far Away Places" [...] as [...] "an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober. Matt Weiner, co-writer Semi Chellas, director Scott Hornbacher, and the actors combined to give us some of the most memorable moments the show has ever done." [...] Todd VanderWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A grade, compared it to previous [...] "structurally daring" [...] episodes like [...] "Seven Twenty Three" [...] and [...] "The Jet Set", and praised the director for the [...] "beautifully shot" [...] episode and the [...] "gorgeous image of [...] and Jane lying, heads touching, on the floor, admitting their marriage just isn’t working", while noting that the enemy of the season is [...] "the passage of time itself".|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "…Baby One More Time" [...] {{has been}} covered on {{numerous}} occasions. One {{of the earliest}} live covers of the song was by the Scottish band Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at [...] "The Bay Tavern" [...] in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England. The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, [...] "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, [...] "We did it for a laugh the first time. [...] And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It's a very well-crafted song. It [...] that magic thing." [...] The Guardian said this cover showed {{a new and more}} [...] "dark" [...] side of the band, commenting [...] "slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet [...] "This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time" [...] sounded". PopWreckoning.com called it [...] "perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame". Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, [...] "It was so weird. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did".|$|E
500|$|Since Carey {{intended}} #1's {{to serve}} as a sign of gratitude to her fans, the album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums. The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' [...] "Sweetheart" [...] (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album Daydream, and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, [...] "I was thinking of the old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a really cute record. Young girls'll like it the way <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> when I was growing up." [...] Another new song featured on #1's was [...] "When You Believe", which Carey said was included because she felt it was [...] "a miracle" [...] that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song [...] "When You Believe" [...] for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt. Carey and Houston were shown the film separately, and both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project.

500|$|A promotional teaser was {{released}} before the full {{release of the}} video; it saw Roberts walking on the New York City pavements, {{with a pair of}} backing dancers gaining looks from men. It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really. Nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting. Maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier." [...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful. Her short-dress in the video sparked criticism from some critics, to which Roberts responded saying [...] "I'm not safe with fashion, and I haven't been for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> and everybody on the team liked it on the day.

500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, and I think I stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode.

Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a sucker for a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'. I'm sure they could one day, but this one fell a bit short for me musically. [...] In the context of the show, however, it was a great moment." ...|$|E

[...] Juliet is a character who simply isn't interesting enough to fully sustain one's attention over a flashback. [...] She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over this season, and it felt like a token gesture to foreground her at last. [...] There was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and Jack." [...] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a [...] "C+"; however, he wrote that [...] "the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell [...] was [...] "not impressed with Jack and Juliet's chemistry" [...] and found their kiss [...] "unconvincing".
