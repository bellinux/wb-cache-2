30|$|The rising {{demand for}} energy, coupled with {{uncertain}} sources {{of fossil fuels}} and concerns over the effects of increasing carbon dioxide, {{has contributed to the}} search for alternative energy sources. In this sense, the translation of biomass derived from crop plants into biofuels has emerged as an attractive solution. Currently, sucrose from sugarcane and starch from corn are used as feedstock for ethanol fermentation. However, there is increasing interest in using the bulk of plant biomass in the form of cell walls [1],[2] or triacylglycerols [3] to meet the energy needs of the future. Some attempts to make the production of lignocellulosic biofuels possible include the development of strategies to <b>harness</b> <b>structural</b> sugars from plant cell walls by prospecting novel microbial enzymes and biomass-oriented plant breeding. However, to achieve this, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying plant biomass production [4] and microbial conversion pathways [5],[6]. These processes rely on complex signaling networks closely linked to the metabolism. Therefore, understanding how plants and microorganisms grow in response to environmental stimuli and how they can adjust their metabolic ratios could also provide means to simplify the conversion of biomass into biofuels [7].|$|E
40|$|The enzymic {{degradation}} of insoluble polysaccharides {{is one of}} the most important reactions on earth. Despite this, glycoside hydrolases attack such polysaccharides relatively inefficiently as their target glycosidic bonds are often inaccessible to the active site of the appropriate enzymes. In order to overcome these problems, many of the glycoside hydrolases that utilize insoluble substrates are modular, comprising catalytic modules appended to one or more non-catalytic CBMs (carbohydrate-binding modules). CBMs promote the association of the enzyme with the substrate. In view of the central role that CBMs play in the enzymic hydrolysis of plant structural and storage polysaccharides, the ligand specificity displayed by these protein modules and the mechanism by which they recognize their target carbohydrates have received considerable attention since their discovery almost 20  years ago. In the last few years, CBM research has <b>harnessed</b> <b>structural,</b> functional and bioinformatic approaches to elucidate the molecular determinants that drive CBM–carbohydrate recognition. The present review summarizes the impact structural biology has had on our understanding of the mechanisms by which CBMs bind to their target ligands...|$|R

Most IE research involves algorithms for learning to exploit regularities inher-ent in the textual information and language use, and such systems generally assume that each document can be processed in isolation. We are extending IE techniques to multi-document extraction tasks, in which the information to be extracted is distributed across several documents. For example, many kinds of work-flow transactions are realized as sequences of electronic mail messages comprising a conversation among several participants. We show that IE perfor-mance can be improved by <b>harnessing</b> the <b>structural</b> and temporal relationships between documents. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for abstracting designs {{in order to}} increase the efficiency of formal property checking.

Recent approaches using sequential ATPG techniques, which <b>harness</b> the <b>structural</b> information of the design, have been shown to perform better than SAT-based BMC. However, these techniques require an effective methodology to deal with the size of commercial designs.

Furthermore, a generalization of the ATPG-based approach, which checks for unbounded liveness, is also presented...|$|R

In collaboration with arachnologists, musicians and sound engineers based in Singapore and elsewhere, Saraceno has <b>harnessed</b> the <b>structural</b> properties of spider silk, transforming the web into a musical instrument. Since spiders do not possess an auditory system, they perceive {{the world around them}} with pressure and vibrations that come from their own movement, for example web-plucking. A cobweb is therefore a sensory object, an extension of a spider’s body and the vibrations communicated via this practice are used for attraction, hunting and other social interactions. Saraceno has succeeded in amplifying these inaudible vibrations and web-pluckings into acoustic rhythms. This was presented by Saraceno at the ‘Arachnid Orchestra Jam Session’, curated by Ute Meta Bauer at the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore (2015). The focus of this exhibition, which included a run of live performances, was to push the boundaries of interspecies communication. This insight into non-human modes of communication helped formulate a more complex understanding of interspecies cohabitation - an idea at the fore of Saraceno’s vision.|$|R
40|$|Integration of {{multiple}} heterogeneous data sources {{continues to be}} a critical problem for many application domains and a challenge for researchers world-wide. With the increasing popularity of the XML model and the proliferation of XML documents on-line, automated matching of XML documents and databases has become a critical issue. In this paper, we present a hybrid schema match algorithm, QMatch, that provides a unique path-based framework for <b>harnessing</b> traditional <b>structural</b> and semantic information, while exploiting the constraints inherent in XML documents such as the order of XML elements, to provide improved levels of matching between two given XML schemata. QMatch is based on the measurement of a unique quality of match metric, QoM, and a set of classifiers which together provide not only an effective basis {{for the development of a}} new schema match algorithm, but also a useful tool for tuning existing schema match algorithms to output at desired levels of matching. In this paper, we show via a set of experiments the benefits of the path-based QMatch over existing structural, linguistic, and hybrid algorithms such as Cupid, and provide an empirical measure of the accuracy of QMatch in terms of the true matches discovered by the algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Social {{capital is}} an {{important}} network based intangible asset with a potential for maximizing individual and team productivity in a social setting like software development. It is important to investigate intervening factors that challenge software development productivity. In this paper, the authors mixed method approach <b>harnesses</b> a <b>structural</b> equation model (SEM) for its quantitative part to establish a paradigm for understanding the effects of social factors for software development organizations. The proposed SEM model measures the cor- relations between several potential factors associated with productivity, social productivity, and social capital that are chosen as latent variables. For the qualitative phase, an industrial focus group is used to single out these factors and their association with potential social aspects. Quantitative data is gathered from a survey conducted at a university. The qualitative phase encompasses an industrial focus group, initially starting with the factors from the literature and refined through participants’ field experience. Findings indicate that a high correlation exists between several social factors that are reported by the focus group. Finally, initial results suggest that understanding the factors that affect social capital in software development is essential for building and sustaining highly productive development environments...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{legal and}} {{economic}} scholarship has {{recognized that the}} government can use structural systems as an efficient way to reduce prohibited behavior. The federal tax system employs structural mechanisms, such as withholding taxes, to foster compliance. The use of structural systems to reduce tax evasion need not be limited to tax administration, however. The Article argues that substantive federal income tax law can - and in many contexts does - foster compliance by <b>harnessing</b> the <b>structural</b> incentives of third parties. Although this phenomenon has gone largely unnoticed, third parties are routinely used by the tax system to verify the bona fides of taxpayer claims in diverse contexts involving reimbursed amounts and other receipts. Yet, third parties do not always behave in ways that are helpful for tax enforcement. The Article therefore identifies contexts in which a third party may have an incentive to collude with the taxpayer. The Article argues that these contexts are ones that the government needs to scrutinize closely and, in certain cases, obstruct with legislation. By contrast, the government can afford to free ride on the incentives of a third party in contexts in which the transfer of funds from the third party to the taxpayer is a zero-sum game...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Every year {{millions}} of people are displaced due to natural disasters and very primitive transitional shelters, or 't-shelters', exist to provide semi-permanent housing. Many t-shelter designs do not cater to all the needs of their inhabitants and are only functional in the short term, often leaving many people relying on t-shelters for housing in an unsafe and unsanitary environment. This thesis addresses the problem of people needing housing and of unsafe transitional housing by presenting a new design process and ultimately a t-shelter design specifically for the victims of the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal in the Kathmandu area. The process involves three key elements; identifying the specific needs of the displaced people, analyzing what materials and labor are available and ensuring that the shelter will be used as intended and therefore remain safe. The resulting shelter design <b>harnesses</b> the <b>structural</b> strength of the geodesic dome, the simplicity of reciprocal joinery and strong yet lightweight nature of bamboo. The effectiveness of the proposed new design process is demonstrated through checking the resulting shelter design meeting measurable outcomes like cost, structural integrity and skill level required to construct. by Jamie L.

40|$|Engineering {{broadband}} light absorbers {{is crucial}} to many applications, including energy-harvesting devices and optical interconnects. The performances of an ideal absorber are that of a black body, a dark material that absorbs radiation at all angles and polarizations. Despite advances in micrometre-thick films, the absorbers available to date are still far from an ideal black body. Here, we describe a disordered nanostructured material that shows an almost ideal black-body absorption of 98 - 99 % between 400 and 1, 400 nm that is insensitive to the angle and polarization of the incident light. The material comprises nanoparticles composed of a nanorod with a nanosphere of 30 nm diameter attached. When diluted into liquids, a small concentration of nanoparticles absorbs on average 26 % more than carbon nanotubes, the darkest material available to date. By pumping a dye optical amplifier with nanosecond pulses of 100 mW power, we <b>harness</b> the <b>structural</b> darkness of the material and create {{a new type of}} light source, which generates monochromatic emission (5 nm wide) without the need for any resonance. This is achieved through the dynamics of light condensation in which all absorbed electromagnetic energy spontaneously generates single-colour energy pulses. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|How to {{recognize}} the structural fold of a protein {{is one of the}} challenges in protein structure prediction. We have developed a series of single (non-consensus) methods (SPARKS, SP 2, SP 3, SP 4) that are based on weighted matching of two to four sequence and structure-based profiles. There is a robust improvement of the accuracy and sensitivity of fold recognition as the number of matching profiles increases. Here, we introduce a new profile-profile comparison term based on real-value dihedral torsion angles. Together with updated real-value solvent accessibility profile and a new variable gap-penalty model based on fractional power of insertion/deletion profiles, the new method (SP 5) leads to a robust improvement over previous SP method. There is a 2 % absolute increase (5 % relative improvement) in alignment accuracy over SP 4 based on two independent benchmarks. Moreover, SP 5 makes 7 % absolute increase (22 % relative improvement) in success rate of recognizing correct structural folds, and 32 % relative improvement in model accuracy of models within the same fold in Lindahl benchmark. In addition, modeling accuracy of top- 1 ranked models is improved by 12 % over SP 4 for the difficult targets in CASP 7 test set.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{structural}} properties of several naturally arising networks (the Internet, social networks, the web graph, etc.) {{have been studied}} intensively {{with a view to}} understanding their evolution. In recent empirical work, Leskovec, Kleinberg, and Faloutsos identify two new and surprising properties of the evolution of many real-world networks: densification (the ratio of edges to vertices grows over time), and shrinking diameter (the diameter reduces over time to a constant). These properties run counter to conventional wisdom, and are certainly inconsistent with graph models prior to their work. In this paper, we present the first model that provides a simple, realistic, and mathematically tractable generative model that intrinsically explains all the well-known properties of the social networks, as well as densification and shrinking diameter. Our model is based on ideas studied empirically in the social sciences, primarily on the groundbreaking work of Breiger (1973) on bipartite models of social networks that capture the affiliation of agents to societies. We also present algorithms that <b>harness</b> the <b>structural</b> consequences of our model. Specifically, we show how to overcome the bottleneck of densification in computing shortest paths between vertices by producing sparse subgraphs that preserve or approximate shortest distances to all or a distinguished subset of vertices. This is a rare example of an algorithmic benefit derived from a realistic graph model. Finally, our work also presents a modular approach to connecting random graph paradigms (preferential attachment, edge-copying, etc.) to structural consequences (heavy-tailed degree distributions, shrinking diameter, etc.) ...|$|R

A total of fourteen microbial cultures consisting of ten bacteria and four yeast strains {{were used in the}} biological study while affinity of the compounds for DNA gyrase, a validated antibacterial drug target, was investigated by docking method. Results indicate that both thiomorpholine and piperazine had zero activity against the Gram negative organisms tested. With morpholine, similar result was obtained except that cultures of Escherichia coli (ATCC 15442) and Salmonella typhi (ATCC 6539) presented with weak sensitivity (7 - 8 mm) as shown by the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) measurement. The Gram positive organisms were more sensitive to morpholine than the other compounds. The highest IZD values of 15 - 18 mm were achieved except for Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619) in which mobility of the compound stopped after 12 mm. S. pneumoniae was resistant to both thiomorpholine and piperazine. The yeast strains were not sensitive to any of the studied compounds investigated. The MIC tests evaluated against a reference antibiotic show that while morpholine was most active at 4 μg. ml- 1 against both B. cereus ATCC (14579) and B. subtilis, the least active compound was thiomorpholine which inhibited S. aureus (ATCC 25923) at 64 μg. ml- 1. The three compounds demonstrated high affinity for the target protein (DNA gyrase) ranging from - 4. 63 to - 5. 64 Kcal/mol and even showed better ligand efficiencies than three known antibiotics; chlorobiocin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline.

This report demonstrates a novel strategy exploring bifunctional nanoparticles for spectroscopic detection and magnetic intervention of DNA assembly, disassembly, and enzyme cutting processes in a solution phase. In contrast to existing single-function based approaches, this strategy exploits magnetic MnZn ferrite nanoparticles decorated with gold or silver on the surface to retain adequate magnetization while producing sufficient plasmonic resonance features to impart surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) functions. The decoration of MnZn ferrite nanoparticles with Au or Ag (MZF/Au or MZF/Ag) was achieved by thermally activated deposition of Au or Ag atoms/nanoparticles on MZF nanoparticles. Upon interparticle double-stranded DNA linkage of the MZF/Au (or MZF/Ag) nanoparticles with gold nanoparticles labeled with a Raman reporter, the resulting interparticle "hot spots" are shown to enable real time SERS monitoring of the DNA assembly, disassembly, or enzyme cutting processes, where the magnetic component provides an effective means for intervention of the biomolecular processes in the solution.

40|$|César Franck (1826 - 1890), a Belgian {{who spent}} most of his life in Paris (before {{eventually}} taking French nationality in 1873), remains one of the most undervalued of all composers. Towards the end of his life, from the 1870 s onwards, the French capital was a turbulent place to be a musician – after a long period of Austro-German musical dominance during much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the outcome of the Franco-Prussian War (1870 - 71) inspired a great change in musical circles. Franck’s contemporaries began to reject this music in favour of revitalising their native tradition that had been dormant since the Baroque period, as they endeavoured to create and promote a style of music that was distinctly French – and it was during this time that Franck would write a handful of works are considered to be his greatest achievements. But, whilst he did follow the nationalistic tendencies of his contemporaries to some extent in his late output, he always maintained a more personal and cosmopolitan approach to composition. One of the main aspects of this cosmopolitanism was his deep admiration of the Baroque and Classical masters of Austro-Germany, as well as Liszt, and it is structural unity – a concept synonymous with this tradition – that forms the analytical focus here. The idea of a multi-movement work possessing the overarching effect of a singular musical journey is a fundamental aspect of Franck's compositional approach, and whilst his use of cyclic recurrence is already quite well documented, this thesis aims to demonstrate that his distinctly French <b>harnessing</b> of <b>structural</b> unity runs deeper than this relatively straightforward motivic technique. By taking into account such issues as Franck's innate spirituality and the nationalistic climate of late nineteenth century Paris, this dissertation aims to reveal what makes Franck’s late style so personal and to redress the balance of critical neglect, through an investigation of how a French composer might adopt the Austro-German principle of structural unity in three particular late works: •	Prelude, Chorale & Fugue (1884) •	Violin Sonata (1886) •	Prelude, Aria & Finale (1887...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith the {{continuous}} ageing of infrastructures, live load distributions related to actual traffic {{has become one}} of the key inputs in asset management. However, it is also one fraught with difficulty, due to its complex and dynamic nature, which can only be addressed at a network level. At this level, it is impossible to envisage in-situ SHM systems installed for all critical assets. In this context, the development of reliable alternative techniques to estimate live load distributions would be a valuable addition to infrastructure asset management tools. As is well known, the accuracy of such estimates depends on several factors such as road capacity, asset condition/performance, traffic composition and seasonal effects, among others. Thus, the deployment of in-situ asset-specific systems needs to be complemented with other types of monitoring systems based on inexpensive and easy to install traffic flow sensors (point and line) in order to infer, with acceptable accuracy, rather than measure directly the live load distributions pertinent to different asset types on the network. This paper presents an approach to derive load distributions based on a Transport Infrastructure Utilisation and Maintenance Framework by utilizing recent advances achieved in two, often non-communicating, fields: structural engineering and transportation engineering. From the realm of transport analysis, the parameter ÔflowÕ has been combined with the parameter Ôlive loadÕ pertinent to structural performance. Taking advantage of traffic flow sensor systems, the aim is to examine how information related to the former enables the understanding and modelling of the latter, thus paving the way for smart transport mobility technology to be <b>harnessed</b> by the <b>structural</b> asset management community...|$|R
