5|$|In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the {{greatest}} of the Noldor, created the Silmarils in which he stored {{a part of the}} light of the Two Trees that were lighting Valinor. After three ages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Halls</b> <b>of</b> Mandos, Melkor was released, feigning reform. He however spread his evil and started to poison the minds of the Elves against the Valar. Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then swore to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> <b>of</b> the temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E

Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, {{politician}} and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating [...] "extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests." [...] On her own, Stanton added a more radical point {{to the list of}} grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights. To the grievances, she added [...] "He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of [...] "the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> <b>of</b> legislation..." [...] Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife [...] "you will turn the proceedings into a farce." [...] He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.|$|E
