Most live {{in and around the}} village of Marisco at the south of the island. Most visitors are day-trippers, although there are 23 holiday properties and a camp site for staying visitors, mostly also around the south of the island.|$|E
2500|$|Beatrice White, Frederick's wife, {{was born}} in 1864 at Castle Huntly in Longforgan, the fifth child of James Farquhar White, who had amassed a fortune trading with America in jute, linen and other 'dry goods'. [...] She married Fred in 1896 - her older sister, Eleanor having married Fred's oldest brother, John Sharp in 1886. Beatrice's oldest brother was the liberal MP, J Martin White, who with his father had {{installed}} electricity at their house, Balruddery, in 1881, possibly the first house in Scotland and second in Britain after Cragside to have a domestic electrical generating plant (though Lord Kelvin at Largs had installed electricity earlier using batteries). Beatrice was thus well-equipped to partner Frederick in the modernisation of Hill of Tarvit and her <b>house-keeping</b> and hospitality were always considered exemplary.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{household}} {{have you}} had here, Sir Henry Lee, within these few days--what guests--what visitors? We know that your means of <b>house-keeping</b> are not so profuse as usual, so the catalogue cannot be burdensome to your memory." ...|$|E

60|$|Matilda was a tall, thin, graceful fair girl, with {{a rather}} large nose. She was the Mary to Emmie's Martha: that is, Matilda loved {{painting}} and music, and read a good many novels, whilst Emmie looked after the <b>house-keeping.</b> Emmie was shorter, plumper than her sister, {{and she had no}} accomplishments.

[...] "I will help, {{and we will}} set up <b>house-keeping</b> there again, and if Raybold doesn't choose to come and live in his own camp he can go {{wherever}} he pleases.

60|$|The {{waters of}} the bay were dancing in the sunshine, a fresh wind stirred the chestnut-trees with a {{pleasant}} sound, and the garden below was full of roses, butterflies and bees. A great chirping and twittering went on among the birds, busy with their summer <b>house-keeping,</b> and, far away, the white-winged gulls were dipping and diving in the sea, where ships, like larger birds, went sailing to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I {{have told}} Livy all about Annie's {{beautiful}} house, and about Sam and Charley, and about Charley's ingenious manufactures and his strong manhood and good promise, and how glad I am {{that he and}} Annie married.

6000|$|Nothing of {{consequence}} passed betwixt them, until Lord Glenvarloch, landing at Paul's Wharf, took leave {{of his friend}} the citizen, and retired to his own apartment, where his attendant, Richie, not a little elevated with {{the events of the}} day, and with the hospitality of Lord Huntinglen's <b>house-keeping,</b> gave a most splendid account of them to the buxom Dame Nelly, who rejoiced to hear that the sun at length was shining upon what Richie called [...] "the right side of the hedge." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she made}} her few {{arrangements}} in the <b>house-keeping</b> line, called in her grand vizier and prime minister from the kitchen, and held with her a counsel of ways and means; put on her india-rubbers and Polish boots, and walked up through the deep snow-drifts to the Springdale post-office, where she dropped the fateful letter with a good heart on the whole; and then {{she went on to}} John's, the old home, to offer any parting services to Lillie that might be wanted.|$|E
60|$|I {{think my}} wife would be twice as strong as she is, but for this wearing and wearying slavery of <b>house-keeping.</b> However, she thinks she must submit to it {{for the sake of}} the children; whereas, I have always had a {{tenderness}} for parents too, so, for her sake and mine, I sigh for the incendiary. When the evening comes and the gas is lit and the wear and tear of life ceases, we want to keep house always; but next morning we wish, once more, that we were free and irresponsible boarders.|$|E
60|$|Whereat I was silent. Their {{marriages and}} their divorces only concern these people; and neither I travelling, nor you, who may come after, have {{any right to}} make rude remarks about them. Only--only coming from a land where a man begins to lightly turn to {{thoughts}} of love not before he is thirty, I own that playing at <b>house-keeping</b> before that age rather surprised me. Out in the West, though, they marry, boys and girls, from sixteen upward, and I have met more than one bride of fifteen--husband aged twenty.|$|E
6000|$|I say [...] "chief purpose" [...] of the Republican organization; {{for it is}} {{certainly}} true that if the national House shall {{fall into the hands of}} the Republicans, they will have to attend to all the matters of national <b>house-keeping</b> as well as this. The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently conservative. It proposes nothing save and except to restore this Government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the Government themselves expected and looked forward to.|$|E
6000|$|But when {{he brings}} home a wife, besides the {{furnishing}} his house, {{he must have}} a formal <b>house-keeping,</b> even at the very first; and as children come on, more servants, that is, maids, or nurses, that are as necessary as the bread he eats--especially if he multiplies apace, as he ought to suppose he may--in this case let the wife be frugal and managing, let her be unexceptionable in her expense, yet the man finds his charge mount high, and perhaps too high for his gettings, notwithstanding the additional stock obtained by her portion. And what {{is the end of}} this but inevitable decay, and at last poverty and ruin? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{would have}} thought that ought to suffice; but not so. Bedding, shoes, firkins of butter, mighty cheeses, ropes of onions, {{quantities}} of loose jam, kegs of oysters, titanic fowls, crates of crockery and glassware, assorted <b>house-keeping</b> things, cooking ranges, and tons of coal poured down in broad cataracts from a bounteous heaven, piling themselves above that infant to a depth of twenty feet. The weather was more than two hours in clearing up; and as late as half-past three a ponderous hogshead of sugar struck at the corner of Clay and Kearney Streets, with an impact that shook the peninsula like an earthquake and stopped every clock in town.|$|E
60|$|Somehow I {{could not}} {{predicate}} these simple joys {{of the people}} I have been talking of, for the very reason, that they were themselves so simple. It was our sophistication which enabled us to taste pleasures {{which would have been}} insipidities to them. Their palates would have demanded other flavours--social excitements, balls, flirtations, almost escapades. I speak of the two women; the man, doubtless, like most other Americans of his age, wanted nothing but to get back to business in the small town where he was important; and still more I speak of the young girl; for the young wife I fancied very willing to go back to her <b>house-keeping,</b> and to be staying on in Saratoga only on her friend's account.|$|E
60|$|They rambled {{about for}} some time, {{looking at the}} {{different}} rooms, and at the various conveniences for <b>house-keeping</b> which Albert had planned, and which were all just ready for use when Albert had died. There was a sink in the kitchen, with a little spout leading into it, from which the water was running in a constant stream. It came from an aqueduct of logs brought under ground. There was a tin dipper there upon {{the top of the}} post which the water-spout came out of, and Mary Bell and Bella had an excellent drink from it the first thing. The kitchen floor was covered with shavings, and the children played in them for some time, until they were tired. Then they went and got another drink.|$|E
60|$|City {{and country}} are still so widely apart in every civilization {{that one can}} safely count upon a {{reciprocal}} strangeness in many every-day things. For instance, in the country, when people break up <b>house-keeping,</b> they sell their household goods and gods, {{as they did in}} cities fifty or a hundred years ago; but now in cities they simply store them; and vast warehouses in all the principal towns have been devoted to their storage. The warehouses are of all types, from dusty lofts over stores, and ammoniacal lofts over stables, to buildings offering acres of space, and carefully planned for the purpose. They are more or less fire-proof, slow-burning, or briskly combustible, like the dwellings they have devastated. But the modern tendency is to a type where flames do not destroy, nor moth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal. Such a warehouse is a city in itself, laid out in streets and avenues, with the private tenements on either hand duly numbered, and accessible only to the tenants or their order. The aisles are concreted, the doors are iron, and the roofs are ceiled with iron; the whole place is heated by steam and lighted by electricity. Behind the iron doors, which in the New York warehouses must number hundreds of thousands, and throughout all our other cities, millions, the furniture of a myriad households is stored--the effects of people who have gone to Europe, or broken up <b>house-keeping</b> provisionally or definitively, or have died, or been divorced. They are the dead bones of homes, or their ghosts, or their yet living bodies held in hypnotic trances; destined again in some future time to animate some house or flat anew. In certain cases the spell lasts for many years, in others for a few, and in others yet it prolongs itself indefinitely.|$|E
60|$|One day in October a {{carriage}} {{drove up to}} the door, after the work on the house had been carried as far as Claxon's mood and money allowed, and he and Clementina were picking up the litter of his carpentering. He had replaced the block of wood which once served at the front door by some steps under an arbor of rustic work; but this was still so novel that the younger children had not outgrown their pride in it and were playing at <b>house-keeping</b> there. Clementina ran around to the back door and out through the front entry in time to save the visitor and the children from the misunderstanding they began to fall into, and met her with a smile of hospitable brilliancy, and a recognition full of compassionate welcome.|$|E

He has felt your misfortunes keenly, and did all he could to avert the sad affair about Clawbonny.

We did all we could, I can assure you, Wallingford; but I was about commencing <b>house-keeping,</b> and was in want of cash at the moment,--and {{you know how it}} is under such circumstances. Poor Clawbonny! I was exceedingly sorry when I heard of it; though they say this Mr. Daggett, your successor, is going to do wonders with it,--a capitalist, they tell me, and able to carry out all his plans." ...|$|E
60|$|I am loth to {{make any}} part of my writing a satire upon the women; nor, indeed, does the extravagance either of dress or <b>house-keeping,</b> lie all, or always, {{at the door of}} the tradesmen's wives--the husband is often the {{prompter}} of it; at least he does not let his wife into the detail of his circumstances, he does not make her mistress of her own condition, but either flatters her with notions of his wealth, his profits, and his flourishing circumstances, and so the innocent woman spends high and lives great, believing that she is in a condition to afford it, and that her husband approves of it; at least, he does not offer to retrench or restrain her, but lets her go on, and indeed goes on with her, to the ruin of both.|$|E
60|$|In {{proportion}} to their servants, the tradesmen now keep their tables, which are also advanced in their proportion of expense to other things: indeed, the citizen's and tradesmen's tables are now the emblems, not of plenty, but of luxury, not of good <b>house-keeping,</b> but of profusion, {{and that of the}} highest kind of extravagance; insomuch, that it was the opinion of a gentleman who had been not a traveller only, but a nice observer of such things abroad, that there is at this time more waste of provisions in England than in any other nation in the world, of equal extent of ground; and that England consumes for their whole subsistence more flesh than half Europe besides; that the beggars of London, and within ten miles round it, eat more white bread than the whole kingdom of Scotland,[21] and the like.|$|E
60|$|To {{begin with}} <b>house-keeping.</b> I have already hinted, that every thing {{belonging}} to the family subsistence bears a higher price than usual, I may say, than ever; {{at the same time}} I can neither undertake to prove that there is more got by selling, or more ways to get it, I mean to a tradesman, than there was formerly; the consequence then must be, that the tradesmen do not grow rich faster than formerly; at least we may venture to say this of tradesmen and their families, comparing them with former times, namely, that there is not more got, and I am satisfied there is less laid up, than was then; or, if you will have it, that tradesmen get less and spend more than they ever did. How they should be richer than they were in those times, is very hard to say.|$|E

60|$|After {{a little}} while they were more at home with each other; {{she began to feel}} herself more their child, and less Maxwell's wife; the {{barriers}} of reluctance against him, which she always knew were up with them, fell away from between them and herself. But her father said they had come to get her and Maxwell to lunch with them at their hotel, and then Louise felt herself on her husband's side of the fence again. She said no, they must stay with her; that she was sure Brice would be back for lunch; and she wanted to show them her <b>house-keeping.</b> Mrs. Hilary cast her eye about the room at the word, as if she had seen quite enough of it already, and this made Louise laugh again. She was no better in person than the room was, and she felt her mother's tacit censure apply to her slatternly dressing-gown.|$|E
60|$|At last, their curiosity satisfied, Meriem was alone. As of old, she was {{permitted}} {{the freedom of}} the village, for the stockade was high and strong and the only gates were well-guarded by day and by night; but as of old she cared not for the companionship of the cruel Arabs and the degraded blacks who formed the following of The Sheik, and so, as had been her wont in the sad days of her childhood, she slunk down to an unfrequented corner of the enclosure where she had often played at <b>house-keeping</b> with her beloved Geeka beneath the spreading branches of the great tree that had overhung the palisade; but now the tree was gone, and Meriem guessed the reason. It was from this tree that Korak had descended and struck down The Sheik the day that he had rescued her from the life of misery and torture that had been her lot for so long that she could remember no other.|$|E
