50|$|The {{change in}} overall social surplus {{of the market}} depends on whether the {{increase}} in producer surplus due to lower production costs is larger or smaller than the fall in consumer surplus due to higher prices. Note that it is theoretically possible that the fall in unit costs due to the merger could be sufficiently large that the post merger monopoly price ends up being lower than the pre merger competitive price in which case both producer and consumer surplus would increase. In that situation no trade-off exists and the merger is unambiguously beneficial to all market participants. More generally however, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>merger</b> can involve both costs and benefits.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical ratification of efficiency of internal capital markets. The efficiency of internal capital market is {{examined in the}} context of <b>horizontal</b> <b>mergers.</b> In Cournot oligopoly, merged firms often optimally select the multidivisional structure in which competition among the merging partners remains in production while the headquarters establishes strong central control over resource allocation to the divisions. Under this structure, mergers not only combine the merging partners' capital, but also provide the merged firm with a new opportunity to reallocate that capital in an efficient way. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>mergers</b> are profitable due to the efficiency of internal capital markets. Such <b>horizontal</b> <b>mergers</b> also enhance market competition. I discuss the conditions under which the multidivisional structure (the M-form) is optimal for the merged firm while complete fusion of all the merging partners under a single authority is also feasible. ...|$|R
