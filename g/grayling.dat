5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{originally}} signposted in 1919, the north–south highway through <b>Grayling</b> {{was part of}} the original M-14. At that time, M-93 was only a spur from downtown <b>Grayling</b> to the future Camp <b>Grayling.</b> It was later redesignated as part of US Highway27 (US27) in 1926. By 1932, M-93 was extended northward through <b>Grayling</b> to the state park. In 1940, M-72 was extended through the <b>Grayling</b> area. I-75 in the <b>Grayling</b> area opened in 1961 and, the former routing of US27 through <b>Grayling</b> northward to Hartwick Pines Road back to I-75 was redesignated BL I-75.|$|E
5|$|M-93 {{starts at}} the main gate of Camp <b>Grayling.</b> From there it runs north and east along Sharon Road {{parallel}} to the shore of Lake Margarethe through {{the edge of the}} base complex. The highway continues through forested terrain to a junction with M-72 west of the city of <b>Grayling.</b> M-93 turns east, running concurrently along M-72 into town. As the highway approaches downtown, the landscape becomes more urbanized after crossing the Au Sable River. In <b>Grayling,</b> M-93 turns north along the former route of US27, which is now BLI-75. M-72 turns south with BLI-75 along James Street, ending the M-72/M-93 concurrency.|$|E
5|$|The roadway runs north {{through town}} passing the <b>Grayling</b> Army Airfield, and BLI-75/M-93 becomes <b>Grayling</b> Highway. Together {{they make a}} right turn onto Hartwick Pines Road when they {{intersect}} Old 27 Road, turning back towards I-75; this area {{is part of the}} <b>Grayling</b> State Forest. The BLI-75 designation ends at I-75 while M-93 continues along Hartwick Pines Road. The M-93 designation ends at the park's former main gate. The roadway continues further into Hartwick Pines State Park as White Road, a rural road that intersects unsigned route County Road 612 north of the park boundaries.|$|E
50|$|On Earth-One, Gardner <b>Grayle</b> was a {{sergeant}} in the army. His platoon was the infamous Platoon 13 and its symbol was a knight. Feverishly opposed to nuclear war, <b>Grayle</b> volunteered for a virtual reality experiment {{to see how}} people would react to a post atomic war world. Within this experiment, <b>Grayle</b> believed that the adventures of the Atomic Knights were only a dream. After emerging from the experiment, <b>Grayle</b> donned a S.T.A.R. Labs battle suit and declared himself a modern knight in shining armor, briefly becoming the second Shining Knight and serving with the Seven Soldiers of Victory.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grayle</b> {{was the son}} of John <b>Grayle,</b> priest, of Stone, Gloucestershire, {{where he}} was born. At the age of 18 he entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, as a batler, and {{proceeded}} B.A. in 1634 and M.A. on 15 June 1637. Brook states that <b>Grayle,</b> having married, in the end of 1645, a daughter of Henry Scudder, went the next year, probably as minister, to live at Colling-bourne-Ducis, Wiltshire. He subsequently became rector of Tidworth in the same county.|$|R

5|$|The highway crosses into Kalkaska County at Barker Creek and {{continues}} eastward to Kalkaska. There, M-72 meets US131/M-66 (Cedar Street) {{on the north}} side of downtown, and M-72 turns south along Cedar Street and forms another triple concurrency through downtown. South of town, the highway crosses the Boardman River again, and M-72 turns east again headed toward the city of <b>Grayling.</b> M-66 follows M-72 to cross a set of railroad tracks that belong to the Great Lakes Central Railroad before leaving to follow its path to Lake City. M-72 crosses the Manistee River at the Kalkaska–Crawford county line and passes the northern shore of Lake Margrethe west of town in the Camp <b>Grayling</b> military reservation. North of the camp gate, M-72 joins M-93 into downtown <b>Grayling.</b> Together they meet James Street, which carries Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). M-93 turns north to follow BL I-75 out of town, and M-72 turns south to follow it through downtown. At South Down River Road, M-72 turns east again to leave <b>Grayling,</b> crossing I-75 in the process. There is no direct access to I-75 from M-72. Instead traffic is directed to follow BL I-75 in either direction to get to the freeway.|$|E

5|$|After the US127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, {{and passes}} {{to the east}} of <b>Grayling.</b> There are a pair of {{interchanges}} on either end of town for BL I-75, and the southern one is a partial interchange; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for M-72; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of <b>Grayling,</b> there is a full interchange for BL I-75/M-93 that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, At the time, the {{original}} M-14 designation was assigned from the Ohio state line northward through Jackson, Lansing, Mount Pleasant, Clare, and <b>Grayling.</b> The highway also continued from <b>Grayling</b> northward through Gaylord to Cheboygan. Seven years later, the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, and in Michigan's initial assignments, US27 replaced M-14 between Lansing and Cheboygan, while US127 ran from Lansing southward through Jackson to the Somerset area where it turned southeasterly, replacing the former M-80 and M-34 through Adrian to Toledo, Ohio. The remainder of M-14 south to the state line remained a shortened M-14.|$|E

50|$|Marlowe calls Mrs. <b>Grayle,</b> {{ostensibly to}} have her pick him up at his {{apartment}} for their date. Malloy, responding to Marlowe's message, shows up first and hides when Mrs. <b>Grayle</b> arrives. Marlowe confronts her: she is Velma and had used Marriott to keep Mrs. Florian in line after she recognized Velma's voice on <b>Grayle's</b> radio station. Marriott had worked as an announcer at the same station. Mrs. <b>Grayle</b> convinced Marriott to set up Marlowe to be killed in the canyon, but actually did so to kill Marriott because she viewed him as a 'weak link' who would reveal her secret past. She had also informed on Malloy about the robbery that sent him to prison. When Malloy hears this, he steps out to confront Velma, who shoots him fatally and flees. Amthor, Sonderborg, and the crooked cops are all exposed; Red gets his job back. Velma flees, but when she is eventually tracked down in Baltimore, she kills the detective who recognizes her and commits suicide when cornered.|$|R
50|$|Lt. Randall, the cunning but honest Los Angeles cop {{investigating}} Marriott's murder, {{is skeptical}} about the story.

5|$|On July 1, 1919, {{the initial}} routing of M-76 {{connected}} Standish with Roscommon via a circuitous path through Sterling, Alger, West Branch, and St. Helen. By 1927, M-76 was extended north to <b>Grayling</b> and west to Kalkaska. Before {{the construction of}} its later routing along the present-day Lake State Railway between St. Helen and Roscommon, the route of M-76 followed present-day Saint Helen Road (present-day F-97), then Au Sable, Keno, and Silsby roads; at the Crawford-Roscommon county line, it then followed present-day M-18 westerly into Roscommon. A short non-contiguous segment of M-76 opened near Empire, extending eastward to County Road 669 in 1934. In late 1940 or early 1941, M-76 was truncated to Roscommon; all of M-76 from <b>Grayling</b> to Kalkaska and the segment near Empire was redesignated as M-72.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{species of fish}} in the park: Northern pike and European perch are the most common, others include <b>grayling,</b> common minnow, burbot, three-spined stickleback and the least common, brown trout.

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{originally}} signposted in 1919, the highway running northwest–southeast through Roscommon was numbered M-76. In 1949, M-18 was extended north into Roscommon and then west along M-76. During the early 1970s, M-76 was being {{converted into a}} freeway {{to be used as}} part of I-75. In 1971, I-75 was completed southward from the <b>Grayling</b> area to what is now exit239. Two years later, I-75 was completed between Roscommon and West Branch, and M-76 between the two communities was decommissioned. At the same time, M-18 was realigned to northeasterly out of Roscommon instead of following M-76 toward <b>Grayling.</b> BL I-75 was commissioned at this time to overlap M-18 from the freeway north into Roscommon and to replace the former M-18/M-76 west of the village to the new freeway.|$|E

50|$|While {{a strict}} presbyterian, <b>Grayle</b> {{was charged with}} Arminianism, and defended his {{principles}} in a work, which was published after his death with a preface by Constantine Jessop, minister at Wimborne, Dorset, entitled A Modest Vindication of the Doctrine of Conditions in the Covenant of Grace and the Defenders thereof from the Aspersions of Arminianism and Popery which Mr. W. Eyre cast on them, London, 1655. The preface (dated 15 September 1654) says that the book had been delivered to William Eyre in the author's lifetime; Eyre, <b>Grayle's</b> critic, was minister of St Edmund's, Salisbury. A neighbouring minister, Humphrey Chambers, preached his funeral sermon, and it was published with the Modest Vindication.|$|R
5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, <b>grayling,</b> pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic <b>grayling.</b> Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently.

5|$|Beginning in 1958, I-75 in Michigan was {{constructed}} in several discontinuous segments. M-76 was {{to become one of}} the portions incorporated into the route of I-75. Although other portions of I-75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75.
