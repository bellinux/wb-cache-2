40|$|Background: During the Dutch Q fever {{epidemic}} {{more than}} 4, 000 Q fever cases were notified. This provided logistical {{challenges for the}} organisation of serological follow-up, which is considered mandatory for early detection of chronic infection. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the proportion of acute Q fever patients that received serological follow-up, and to identify regional differences in follow-up rates and contributing factors, such as knowledge of medical practitioners. Methods: Serological datasets of Q fever patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2009 (N = 3, 198) were obtained from three Laboratories of Medical Microbiology (LMM) in the province of Noord-Brabant. One LMM offered an active <b>follow-up</b> <b>service</b> by approaching patients; the other two only tested on physician’s request. The medical microbiologist in charge of each LMM was interviewed. In December 2011, 240 general practices and 112 medical specialists received questionnaires on their knowledge and practices regarding the serological follow-up of Q fever patients. Results: Ninety-five percent (2, 226 / 2, 346) of the Q fever patients diagnosed at the LMM with a <b>follow-up</b> <b>service</b> received at least one serological follow-up within 15 months of diagnosis. For those diagnosed at a LMM without this service, this was 25 % (218 / 852) (OR 54, 95 % CI 43 – 67). Although 80 % (162 / 203) of all medical practitioners with Q fever patients reporte...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence for the {{efficacy}} of late effects surveillance in adult cancer survivors is lacking {{and there is little}} agreement among clinicians on appropriate follow-up care. METHODS: We report the views of both cancer experts and general practitioners (GPs) on long-term follow-up provision for cancer survivors, focussing on the 18 – 45 years age group. A total of 421 cancer experts (36 % haematologists, 33 % oncologists, 18 % surgeons, 10 % nurses, 2 % other) and 54 GPs responded to a structured online survey. Reasons for follow-up care (clinical or supportive); advantages and disadvantages of follow-up in primary care; current practice; and resources required for a quality <b>follow-up</b> <b>service</b> were assessed. RESULTS: Clinicians valued clinical reasons for follow-up more highly than supportive reasons (Po 0. 001). Learning more about late effects and checking for cancer recurrence were rated as the most important reasons for follow-up by cancer experts and GPs. A total of 85 % of cancer specialists hold follow-up consultations alongside patients on active treatment. Cancer experts agreed that primary care follow-up would increase their availability for acute oncological care, but reduce information on late effects. The most important resource to provide a quality <b>follow-up</b> <b>service</b> was specialist nursing support (91 %). CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up guidelines that include late effects surveillance are needed. Where and who should deliver this care requires further debate...|$|R

Our hospital has been a center for the use of radioiodine to treat thyrotoxicosis for several years, but we began carrying out patient satisfaction surveys and implementing changes after 2008. The aim of the project reported here was to assess patient satisfaction with our radioiodine treatment and telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>service,</b> and to compare results with our previous surveys. Patients and methods: Anonymous patient satisfaction questionnaires were sent to all patients who received radioiodine treatment for thyrotoxicosis between January 2012 and December 2013. Patients were asked to answer four questions concerning informed consenting, treatment, and telephone follow-up using a four-point Likert scale, and post back the questionnaires. A suggestion box was included for comments and suggestions for improvement. Results: A total of 56 questionnaires were posted out (to 44 females and 12 males) and 34 questionnaires were returned (60. 8 % response rate). Between 94 % and 100 % of the responders, depending on the question asked, were satisfied with the service they received. Patients also put useful comments and suggestions in the suggestion box provided. Conclusion: Patients with thyrotoxicosis were satisfied with our radioiodine treatment and telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>service.</b> This survey has revealed areas for service improvement, and highlights the importance of patient satisfaction when assessing a patient-centered service.

40|$|Background: the {{paediatric}} oncology community {{is focused on}} providing appropriate care to survivors of childhood cancer, given that despite increases in survival rates {{it is estimated that}} 60 % will have one or more problems related to their disease or treatment. Agreement and consistency in how follow-up for this group of young people should be designed and delivered has not yet been reached and rarely have young people been asked to contribute to this discussion. Methodology: the study aimed to find out what young people who are receiving long-term follow-up for childhood cancer would like from their <b>follow-up</b> <b>service.</b> It aimed to illuminate the dimensions of care valued by young people as well as make explicit to professionals health care needs that must be met to provide optimum care into their adult life. The emphasis was on qualitative, participatory methods using reflexive and responsive approaches to give primacy to the voice of participants. Data were generated through a series of workshops, interviews and questionnaires. Findings: forty young people (12 male: 30 % and 28 female: 70 %), participated in the study. Preliminary analysis yielded a descriptive typology that could serve as a basis for classifying and clarifying health care needs: defined as what the young people in this study wanted from a <b>follow-up</b> <b>service.</b> Five categories of health care need were identified: (i) need for a positive relationship with health care professionals; (ii) need for information; (iii) need for communication; (iv) need for parents to be supported; (v) need for health care professionals to have appropriate knowledge. Conclusions and relevance to practice: young people in this study were clear about the structure and process of a service that would meet their needs.
