Another type of <b>data,</b> <b>panel</b> data (or longitudinal data), combines both cross-sectional and time series data ideas and looks at how the subjects (firms, individuals, etc.) change over time. Panel data differs from pooled cross section data across time, because it deals with the observations on the same subjects in different times whereas the latter observes different subjects in different time periods. Panel analysis uses panel data to examine changes in variables over time and differences in variables between the subjects.|$|E

50|$|Data sets {{to which}} econometric {{analyses}} are applied {{can be classified}} as time-series data, cross-sectional <b>data,</b> <b>panel</b> data, and multidimensional panel data. Time-series data sets contain observations over time; for example, inflation {{over the course of}} several years. Cross-sectional data sets contain observations at a single point in time; for example, many individuals' incomes in a given year. Panel data sets contain both time-series and cross-sectional observations. Multi-dimensional panel data sets contain observations across time, cross-sectionally, and across some third dimension. For example, the Survey of Professional Forecasters contains forecasts for many forecasters (cross-sectional observations), at many points in time (time series observations), and at multiple forecast horizons (a third dimension).|$|E
50|$|A {{time series}} is {{one type of}} Panel <b>data.</b> <b>Panel</b> data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a {{one-dimensional}} panel (as is a cross-sectional dataset). A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data. One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records. If the answer is the time data field, then {{this is a time}} series data set candidate. If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (student ID, stock symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate. If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate.|$|E
