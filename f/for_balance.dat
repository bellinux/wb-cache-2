5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used <b>for</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (<b>for</b> <b>balance)</b> and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|Five non-documentary German short films won Academy Awards as well. The Academy Award for Animated Short Film was won by Christoph Lauenstein and Wolfgang Lauenstein <b>for</b> <b>Balance</b> in 1989, and by Tyron Montgomery and Thomas Stellmach for Quest in 1996. Two other German {{films were}} {{nominated}} for {{but did not}} win the Academy Award for Animated Short Film: The Periwig-Maker (2000) by Steffen Schäffler and Das Rad (2002) by Chris Stenner, Arvid Uibel and Heidi Wittlinger. The Academy Award for Live Action Short Film was won by Pepe Danquart for Black Rider (Schwarzfahrer) in 1993, by Florian Gallenberger for Quiero ser (I want to be...) in 2000 and by Jochen Alexander Freydank for Spielzeugland (Toyland) in 2008. Gregor's Greatest Invention by Johannes Kiefer was nominated for the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film in 2001 but lost.|$|E

5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread <b>for</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E
5|$|Director Masahiro Sakurai first {{announced}} that a new Super Smash Bros. game was planned for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U at E3 2011 in June 2011, but development only officially began following the completion of Sakurai's other project, , in March 2012. The game was later revealed to be a joint-project between Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Games, with various staff members from Bandai Namco's Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development. Sakurai, who was previously the sole person responsible <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> in the series' multiple fighters, has involved more staff to further improve the game's competitive balance. The game was officially revealed at E3 2013 on June 11, 2013 during a Nintendo Direct presentation. Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game's official website and Miiverse community, various cinematic trailers were released, introducing each of the brand new fighters. Sakurai chose to use these trailers, which benefit from Internet sharing, as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl, as he believed the impact of seeing the mode's cinematic cutscenes {{for the first time}} was ruined by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used <b>for</b> <b>balance,</b> and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E

After crushing, the grapes were placed in large pithoi, jars where fermentation took place.|$|E
25|$|Dunne had {{obtained}} a War Office order for two D.8s, though one was cancelled because of late delivery. The other {{was delivered to}} Farnborough on 3 March 1914, where it was given the RFC number 366. It made several flights on 11 March piloted by N. S. Percival, who had flown the first D.8 many times at Eastchurch and was now an RFC officer. The general judgement {{was that in the}} search <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> between stability and controllability, the Dunne design overemphasised the former.|$|E
25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} <b>for</b> <b>balance</b> and as leverage {{when they}} fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or {{getting back to the}} fall line. Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E
