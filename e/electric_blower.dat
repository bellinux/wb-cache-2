25|$|The first {{documentary}} {{evidence of a}} pipe organ in the church is from 1847 when a new instrument a 2-manual with 14 stops, by George Sherborne, was installed on the west gallery. In the 1860s it {{was moved to the}} east end of the south aisle and then, in 1880s enlarged and the console moved to the chancel with the pipes being positioned behind the screen. A clarinet was added in the 1920s and in 1939 an <b>electric</b> <b>blower</b> was added. In the 1960s a major restoration was undertaken with further work on the organ in 1986, 1991 and 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 {{an organ}} was bought {{for the church}} {{at a cost of}} £100. It was first used on Palm Sunday. It was {{replaced}} in 1903 with one designed by George Benson of Manchester. This organ had great and swell manuals, pedals and two arrays of stops. It was installed by Robert Jackson, the organist of St Peter's Church in Oldham. The bellows were initially powered by a hydraulic engine working from mains water pressure (with the exhaust water being used by the nearby Neville Mill) but an <b>electric</b> <b>blower</b> was installed in 1923. The value of the Benson organ was estimated in 1965 to be £3,000. It was left to be broken up on the closure of the Westwood church building.|$|E

5000|$|The last mass-producer of {{harmoniums}} in North America was the Estey company, which ceased manufacture in the mid-1950s; {{a couple}} of Italian companies continued into the 1970s. As the existing stock of instruments aged and spare parts became hard to find, more and more were either scrapped or sold. It was not uncommon for harmoniums to be [...] "modernised" [...] by having <b>electric</b> <b>blowers</b> fitted, often very unsympathetically. The majority of Western harmoniums today {{are in the hands}} of enthusiasts, though the instrument remains popular in South Asia.|$|R
25|$|A pellet stove {{is a type}} of {{clean-burning}} stove {{which uses}} small, biological fuel pellets which are renewable and very clean-burning. Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material –- typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are currently {{more than half a million}} homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, and probably a similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a feed screw to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an <b>electric</b> <b>blower.</b> The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the heat output.|$|E
500|$|... 1910 saw the {{restoration}} of the rood screen in a style consistent with that of the two ancient panels, the reconstruction of the rood loft, and the installation of a Norman and Beard two-manual organ with more than a thousand pipes. The organ pipes are above the parclose screens; the bellows, wind chest and <b>electric</b> <b>blower</b> are concealed in the chamber above the chancel. The stalls with their misericords were restored in 1913. The rood crucifix, flanked by St Mary and St John, came from Germany in 1913.|$|E
50|$|The {{key action}} and stop action are both mechanical. The two bellows can be pumped either by foot or with an <b>electric</b> <b>blower.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1931 {{the organ}} was reconstructed by Henry WillisIII {{when the number}} of stops was {{increased}} to 120 and electro-pneumatic action introduced for the combination systems and some of the key action. Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some reed stops. In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 <b>electric</b> <b>blowers</b> remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.|$|R

50|$|Church of England worship continued. From 1932 to 1934, {{the church}} was renovated internally, {{electricity}} and a new heating system were installed. Also an <b>electric</b> <b>blower</b> for the organ was installed. During this period, church services were held at the nearby Moorend School.|$|E
50|$|In 1888 a small Sunday school hall, {{which later}} became a kindergarten, was built {{at the rear of}} the church. The {{northern}} half of the church transepts was added in 1899. In 1902 a pipe organ was installed, to which an <b>electric</b> <b>blower</b> was added in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Playing {{the organ}} before {{electricity}} required {{at least one}} person to operate the bellows. When signaled by the organist, a calcant would operate a set of bellows, supplying the organ with air. Because calcants were expensive, organists would usually practise on other instruments such as the clavichord or harpsichord. By the mid-19th-century bellows were also being operated by water engines, steam engines or gasoline engines. Starting in the 1860s bellows were gradually replaced by wind turbines which were later directly connected to electrical motors. This made it possible for organists to practice regularly on the organ. Most organs, both new and historic, have <b>electric</b> <b>blowers,</b> although others can still be operated manually. The wind supplied is stored in one or more regulators to maintain a constant pressure in the windchests until the action allows it to flow into the pipes.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>blower</b> in the {{basement}} of the church replaced the calcant powered foot bellows in the 1960s. Originally, a child, or [...] "urchin" [...] acted as the calcant and powered the organ from within the case. Several current church members remember serving in this capacity as children.|$|E
50|$|The {{pipe organ}} (by Norman and Beard) at St. John's {{is among the}} oldest and rarest, and very {{difficult}} to repair. Initially, air had to be pumped manually.

5000|$|The {{system was}} simple, had few controls, a single {{automatic}} gas valve, and no blower. These furnaces {{could be made}} to work with any fuel simply by adapting the burner area. They have been operated with wood, coke, coal, trash, paper, natural gas, and fuel oil. Furnaces that used solid fuels required daily maintenance to remove ash and [...] "clinkers" [...] that accumulated {{in the bottom of the}} burner area. In later years, these furnaces were adapted with <b>electric</b> <b>blowers</b> to aid air distribution and speed moving heat into the home. Gas and oil-fired systems were usually controlled by a thermostat inside the home, while most wood and coal-fired furnaces had no electrical connection and were controlled by the amount of fuel in the burner and position of the fresh-air damper on the burner access door.|$|R
50|$|The Organ at Union Chapel was {{designed}} and built specially for the size and acoustics of the new Chapel building in 1877 by master organ builder Henry “Father” Willis. It is undoubtedly {{one of the finest}} in the world.Neither James Cubitt, the architect of the Chapel, nor Rev Henry Allon, the minister at the time, wanted the congregation to be distracted by the sight of an organ or organist: they wanted the music itself to be the focus during worship. So the organ is deliberately hidden away behind ornate screens under the rose window, which itself actually hints at the organ’s importance, with its depiction of eight angels all playing different musical instruments. It is one of just two organs left in the United Kingdom, and the only one in England, with a fully working original hydraulic (water powered) blowing system, which can be used {{as an alternative to the}} <b>electric</b> <b>blowers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The sewage {{treatment}} efficiency of hybrid constructed wetlands (CWs) was evaluated under different ventilation methods. The removal efficiencies of {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the vertical flow- (VF-) horizontal flow (HF) CWs using an <b>electric</b> fan air <b>blower</b> by the renewable energy of solar and wind power were higher than those by natural ventilation, excluding only suspended solids (SS). The TN treatment efficiency in the CW using the air blower especially increased rapidly by 16. 6 % {{in comparison with the}} CW employing natural ventilation, since the VF bed provided suitable conditions (aerobic) for nitrification to occur. The average removal efficiencies of BOD, SS, TN, and TP in the effluent were 98. 8, 97. 4, 58. 0, and 48. 3 % in the CW using an <b>electric</b> fan air <b>blower,</b> respectively. The treatment performance of the CWs under different ventilation methods was assessed, showing TN in the CW using an <b>electric</b> fan air <b>blower</b> to be reduced by 57. 5 ~ 58. 6 % for inlet TN loading, whereas reduction by 19. 0 ~ 53. 3 % was observed in the CW with natural ventilation. Therefore, to increase the removal of nutrients in CWs, an improved ventilation system, providing ventilation via an <b>electric</b> fan air <b>blower</b> with the renewable energy, is recommended...|$|R

25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s that the {{courthouse}} undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the courtroom and some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench for the judge and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass window behind the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two gas heaters with <b>electric</b> <b>blowers</b> were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975.|$|R

50|$|Volkswagen used straight-five {{engines in}} their Eurovan, and {{developed}} a different straight-five engine which {{was used in the}} Jetta, Passat, Golf, Rabbit, and New Beetle in North America until the early 2010s. In South Africa, the well known VW Microbus/Caravelle (a passenger carrier) was later equipped with an Audi 5-cylinder 2.5 L (1991-1994) and still later a 2.6 L (1995-2002) water cooled engine, replacing the old air cooled Volkswagen 1,800 and 2,100 cc power plants that gave substandard performance to the large family bus. The tall straight-five Audi engine had to be slanted to fit below a rear engine deck, employing an extra <b>electric</b> cooling <b>blower</b> on shut-down, so as to prevent warping of the hot aluminium head and inlet manifold.|$|R

40|$|Aerated {{treatment}} wetlands {{have become}} an increasingly recognized technology for treating wastewaters from domestic and various industrial origins. To date, treatment wetland aeration is provided by air pumps which require access to the energy grid. The requirement for electricity increases the ecological footprint of an aerated wetland and limits the application of this technology to areas with centralized electrical infrastructure. Wind power offers another possibility as a driver for wetland aeration, but its use for this purpose {{has not yet been}} investigated. This paper reports the first experimental trial using a simple wind-driven air pump to replace the conventional <b>electric</b> air <b>blowers</b> of an aerated horizontal subsurface flow wetland. The wind-driven air pump was connected to a two-year old horizontal flow aerated wetland which had been in continuous (24 h) aeration since startup. The wind-driven aeration system functioned, however it was not specifically adapted to wetland aeration. As a result, treatment performance decreased compared to prior continuous aeration. Inconsistent wind speed at the site may have resulted in insufficient pressure within the aeration manifold, resulting in insufficient air supply to the wetland. This paper discusses the lessons learned during the experiment...|$|R
