The materials developed are characterized by a pronounced structural homogeneity at medium grain sizes near the submicron range, a minimum residual porosity #=# 4. 5 MPa m"-" 1 "/" 2, a specific electrical resistance of 10 "-" 3 ohm/cm for electrical discharge machining, and a good machinability (cutting properties, <b>edge</b> <b>tear</b> <b>resistance,</b> buffability). Positive results were obtained applying Al_ 2 O_ 3 TiC composite ceramics as thin-film magnet head substrates. The substitution of Al_ 2 O_ 3 by Y-ZrO_ 2 improved the wear resistance, edge stability, and microstructure characteristics. The investigated composite ceramics are suited for manufacturing wear-resistant microprecision components for machines and apparatuses as well as for manufacturing special-purpose ceramic inserts.

40|$|AbstractDetermination of <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{heterogeneous}} dissimilar metal welds (DMW) {{that are}} critical structures of pipes in nuclear power plants (NPPs) is important in assessment of the structural integrity. Currently, <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of heterogeneous materials is determined by standards developed for homogeneous materials. The fracture behaviour of heterogeneous materials differs from fracture behaviour of homogeneous materials. Thus standards developed for homogeneous materials are not necessary directly applicable to heterogeneous materials. To develop a standard for heterogeneous materials {{the current level of}} knowledge of fracture behaviour in heterogeneous specimens needs to be increased. To enhance the knowledge of fracture in heterogeneous materials <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of 10 × 10 × 55 mm 3 and 10 × 20 × 100 mm 3 single edge bend (SE(B)) specimens extracted from a NPP ferrite-austenite DMW were measured.

As <b>tearing</b> <b>resistance</b> curves of the two specimen geometries are compared toughness and scatter varies, which can be explained by differing crack location with respect to the fusion line.
