5|$|The current voting format {{introduced}} in 1999 is a positional voting system, {{similar to that}} used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result <b>is</b> <b>announced.</b> The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points, which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Each jury award 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2011, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points. The song with the highest number of points {{at the end of the}} voting is the winner.|$|E
