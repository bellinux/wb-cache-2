25|$|Cruzado had {{the rare}} {{chance to put}} her stamp on five of the university's colleges in 2011 and 2012.

In 2012, the dean of the College of Letters and Science stepped down to return to the faculty, while the dean of the library and the dean of the College of Education, <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Development</b> both retired.

25|$|In October 2012, Cruzado {{appointed}} two new deans at MSU.

After a somewhat raucous campus meeting, Cruzado agreed to a longer search, but set a date of January 1, 2013 {{to have a new}} dean in place. Rae was awarded the position from a pool of 16 candidates, and he assumed his position on January 1, 2013.
