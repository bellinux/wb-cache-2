We first formalize the concepts of events and create a time primitive called an event unit. We then present a succession of organization schemes to compose event units for generating complex motion sequences. We present a directed graph representation for the organization of time and events that suggests {{the form of an}} eventbased time programming language. Details of implementation of a general event simulation system are given. Our approach provides a clean partitioning for the problem of motion design, a hierarchical scheme to compose motion behaviors from time primitives and a programming model for organizing animation. Traditional methods of <b>kinematic</b> <b>controls</b> and key frame interpolation are special examples of our general scheme.

40|$|Sediment-hosted {{stratiform}} Zn-Pb-Ag deposits {{have been}} interpreted as forming during exhalative hydrothermal activity synchronous with the deposition of host rocks and during either syn-diagenetic or syn-metamorphic veining and {{replacement of the}} host rocks later in their orogenic history. This study analyzes the distribution metal and oret ypes at the George Fisher deposit and investigates spatial and temporal relationships between high-grade mineralization and structures at all scales throughout the deformation history. The study aims to determine whether remobilization and upgrading of synsedimentary and/or syn-diagenetic proto-ore or primary syntectonic mineralization {{are involved in the}} formation of economic mineralization. Analysis of the <b>kinematic</b> <b>controls</b> on any Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization which is structurally controlled may enable other prospective structures in the near-mine region to be identified. The George Fisher Zn-Pb-Ag deposit is located 22 km north of Mt Isa in Queensland, Australia; and is hosted by Proterozoic sedimentary rocks of similar age and lithology to the Mt Isa and adjacent Hilton Zn-Pb-Ag deposits. The host-rocks at George Fisher preserve a structural history comprising four distinct ductile deformations with concomitant faulting and younger brittle faults which cut the ore-bearing sequence. The first, D₁ is manifest as an open fold (F₁) with an approximately east-west striking axial plane and was overprinted by F₂ folding and a pervasive slaty/solution cleavage (S₂) during the regionally extensive D₂ episode. An episode of sub-vertical shortening/sub-horizontal extension (D₃) followed this main phase of sub-horizontal shortening which formed folds with sub-horizontal axial planes and gently-dipping crenulations of the S₂ cleavage and bedding. D₃ features are overprinted by sub-vertical crenulations (S₄) and minor folds (F₄) with sub-vertical axial planes. Ore shoots that comprise high-grade and thicker mineralization plunge parallel to the F₁ fold axes and are largely confined to the short-limb of this fold. Subsidiary ore shoots are coincident with areas of more intense F₂ folding, and trend parallel to both F₂ and F₄ fold axes in longitudinal projection. Vein-hosted sphalerite and medium-grained galena breccia are the main sources of Zn and Pb metal in the deposit, respectively. Logged widths of each form shoots of thicker mineralization which are broadly coincident with high-grade shoots defined by the assay data. Sulphide textural studies and vein - host-rock fabric cross-cutting relationships suggest that both postdate D₂. Empirical relationships between ore shoot geometry and the structural framework of the deposit imply a D₄ control on metal distribution. This is supported by the interpretation of a dominantly syn-D₄ relative timing of the vein-hosted sphalerite and medium-grained galena breccia based on development of these mineralization-types in unique structural settings and the apparent lack of deformation of their constituent sulphides. Potential pre- F₂ mineralization types include some disseminated sphalerite and fine-grained sphaleritegalena breccias which do not currently constitute economic mineralization and account for ca. 10...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, much {{research}} in motor neuroscience has focused on understanding how humans make coordinated reaching movements, yielding valuable insight into the planning and control of reaching movements, and establishing a foundation for robot-assisted rehabilitation. The goal of this doctoral research {{was to provide a}} quantitative characterization of humans' wrist rotations, paving the way for intelligent robot-assisted wrist rehabilitation. More specifically, we have characterized the kinematics, dynamics, and adaptation of wrist rotations, and discussed implications for planning and control. Kinematics: It is well known that humans make relatively straight reaching movements, suggesting that reaching movements are primarily under <b>kinematic</b> <b>control</b> of hand position. We used a motion capture system to test if wrist rotations are also under <b>kinematic</b> <b>control.</b> We found that wrist rotations exhibit a pattern with significantly more path curvature and variability than reaching movements (p = 0. 001). While the increased path curvature could indicate that wrist rotations are not under <b>kinematic</b> <b>control,</b> this work provides evidence that the curvature is instead due to imperfect peripheral execution. Dynamics: In order to determine the exact cause of path curvature, an anatomically-accurate, mathematical model of the wrist was developed, including recent measurements of passive wrist stiffness. Combining experimentally-measured kinematics from human subjects with the wrist model revealed that moderately-sized wrist rotations can be approximated by a very simple model with virtually no loss in accuracy. Interaction torques, for which the nervous system compensates in reaching movements, are present but negligible in wrist rotations. (cont) Rather, wrist rotation dynamics are dominated by stiffness, which was shown to be the likely cause of path curvature. Adaptation: When perturbed during reaching movements, humans adapt by straightening their paths, confirming that kinematics play a prominent role in planning reaching movements. We found that subjects consistently adapted to a conservative,velocity-dependent force field. Interestingly, this adaptation was more difficult to detect than in perturbation studies involving reaching movements. Taken together, these results suggest that wrist rotations are also primarily under <b>kinematic</b> <b>control</b> (albeit imperfect). by Steven K. Charles. Thesis (Ph. D.)
