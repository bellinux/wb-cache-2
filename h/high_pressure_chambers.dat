An attempt is made to explain the ionization bursts containing 400 - 1600 particles observed at high altitudes in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chambers</b> heavily shielded with lead, in terms of short-lived neutral mesons produced by primary protons colliding with shield nuclei; neutral mesons instantly decay into photons which initiate electron cascades in the shield resulting in an ionization burst inside the chamber. The primary interaction is treated {{by means of a}} simple model for multiple meson production which assumes constant cross section, complete inelasticity and constant multiplicity throughout the energy region [ [...] . ] ev; 1 / 3 of the primary energy is assumed to go into neutral mesons. The contribution of the soft component of high energy air showers is estimated and found to be negligible at all altitudes. An analysis of burst data obtained by Neher and Biehl at three altitudes (307 gm, 616 gm, 1030 gm) then shows that the majority of high altitude bursts can be explained by neutral mesons produced in the primary encounter; but not a negligible fraction must be attributed to secondary collisions. From the data of Neher-Biehl and Fahy mean free paths of 185 [plus or minus] 20 gm in air and 355 [plus or minus] 55 gm in lead are deduced. ...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} are crystalline compounds made of gas {{and water}} molecules. Methane hydrates are found in marine sediments and permafrost regions; extensive amounts of methane are trapped {{in the form of}} hydrates. The unique behavior of hydrate-bearing sediments requires the development of special research tools, including new numerical algorithms (tube- and pore-network models) and experimental devices (<b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chambers</b> and micromodels). Hydraulic conductivity decreases with increasing variance in pore size distribution; while spatial correlation in pore size reduces this trend, both variability and spatial correlation promote flow focusing. Invading gas forms a percolating path while nucleating gas forms isolated gas bubbles; as a result, relative gas conductivity is lower for gas nucleation than for gas invasion processes, and constitutive models must be properly adapted for reservoir simulations. Physical properties such as gas solubility, salinity, pore size, and mixed gas conditions affect hydrate formation and dissociation; implications include oscillatory transient hydrate formation, dissolution within the hydrate stability field, initial hydrate lens formation, and phase boundary changes in real field situations. High initial hydrate saturation and high depressurization favor gas recovery efficiency during gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments. Even a small fraction of fines in otherwise clean sand sediments can cause fines migration and concentration, vuggy structure formation, and gas-driven fracture formation during gas production by depressurization.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in the {{automotive}} field, as well as in other fields, there is an increasing demand for components producing low levels of noise and vibrations, due to comfort reasons. This is consequently one of the main problems for the suppliers of automotive components, which are forced to increase their knowledge on the dynamic behaviour of their products; to this end, mathematical models can be very useful tools for the identification of noise and vibration sources, and to predict the effects of design modifications and so reducing the number of tests required for design improvement. This work concerns external gear pumps for automotive applications, which operate at high speed and low pressure. In this situation gear pumps have two main noise sources both of them sharing the same fundamental frequency: fluid borne noise, {{as a consequence of the}} flow from the low to the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>chambers,</b> and mechanical noise due to the gear meshing. In this context, a combined non linear lumped/finite element model including the main important phenomena involved in the pump operation as time-varying oil pressure distribution on gears, time-varying meshing stiffness and hydrodynamic journal bearing reactions has been developed. The model was experimentally validated by using a non standard methodology based on the comparison between simulations and experimental results concerning accelerations, forces and moments. Therefore the model can be used in order to analyse the pump dynamic behaviour and to identify the effect of design and operational parameters, in terms of vibration and dynamic forces...|$|E
