5|$|Jackson, {{leading the}} new Democratic Party, won the 1828 presidential election, and in March 1829 Eaton {{resigned}} <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> seat to accept appointment as Jackson's Secretary of War.

5|$|Minton ran for {{re-election}} to <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> seat in 1940. McNutt was challenging Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination, forcing Minton {{to choose between}} the administration and his allies in the state party.

5|$|As a {{candidate}} for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. By the time of <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.|$|E

5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, McCain {{returned}} to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there.

As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters, to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to have him expelled from the body.

Although the bill was initially rejected in the House of Representatives, an amended version of it, which extended Black's original maximum workweek proposal to forty-four hours, was passed in 1938 (after Black left the Senate), becoming the Fair Labor Standards Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Hatfield {{had been}} {{considered}} a possible candidate to run against Morse for <b>his</b> <b>Senate</b> seat, but Hatfield instead ran for re-election.

5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and <b>his</b> <b>senate</b> delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E

The Coalition {{believed that if}} Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not advise new elections, Kerr would have to dismiss him. Supply would run out on 30November.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840 presidential election, Crittenden again {{encouraged}} Kentucky Whigs {{to support}} the nomination of Henry Clay.
