2500|$|In late 2005, Pomers {{checked into}} an {{anorexia}} nervosa treatment facility. The 5' 2" [...] actress' weight {{had dropped to}} 73 pounds and she was exercising as much as six hours per day. Scarlett's character, Kyra, was absent {{from most of the}} fifth season of Reba, having only appeared in two episodes out of twenty-two. She was out of the facility by January 2006. Following her release from treatment, Pomers became an ambassador for the National Eating Disorders Association, and began an organization called Arch-Angels, which raises money for people who suffer from eating disorders but cannot afford treatment. Her efforts led Teen People magazine to name her one of the 20 teens who will change the world. Scarlett returned to the set of Reba and appeared in episodes for season six until the show ended in 2007. Pomers, who is a vegetarian, began practicing Kundalini yoga in June 2006 after reading a book about Golden Bridge studio director Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, and earned her teaching certificate in the practice.

Janine has such low self-esteem that she's deliberately reckless. She thinks, 'Why not take drugs if they make me feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>myself</b> for a while?'

[...] Brooks left the show in 2004 but returned in 2008, originally for a three-episode guest stint. In June 2009 she signed a three-year contract.|$|E

5000|$|Spence was a {{progressive}} thinker who challenged {{her students to}} discuss social norms. Teaching in a predominantly white classroom, she encouraged her students to think about race and gender in the literature they studied, something that was unheard of prior to the 1960s. Theatrical producer Joe Papp called Eulalie Spence [...] "the most influential force in his life." [...] He continued to speak about her in reverential terms even fifty years after {{he was a student}} in her classroom, at Eastern District High School, where she was the only black teacher. Papp credited Spence with [...] "scrubbing his tongue" [...] of its Brooklyn accent and eliminating his [...] "gutter speech" [...] by teaching him grammar and proper enunciation. She brought actors to class and gave her students poetry and plays to read. Papp said that Spence [...] "was interested in me. She made me feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>myself.</b> She took me under her wing. And she was interested in an area that I seemed to find interesting: language." [...] Papp never forgot the impact of Spence on his life and career, but was unaware of her life as playwright, only learning about her theatrical work years later at a Harlem museum exhibit.|$|E

I went on and Googled “How to break out of prison,” “How to break into a car,” and found these fascinating things, and I just used them. I figured that’s what he would do. I also knew I would fail spectacularly, at least at first. But then I would continue. And I’d get the shit beat out of me, and I would trust the wrong people, and I would do the wrong things. I’d start to feel really <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>myself,</b> that I’d figured the whole thing out, and then something would go wrong. I would just keep going until I either was caught or we got out or something happened. That’s what he does. So, I just tried to make him an everyman. I loved the fact that this guy was also an English teacher, so he was a romantic. He was talking about Don Quixote. He’s got this whole romanticized vision of how you sacrifice yourself for a woman, how you go about something like this. It’s terribly romanticized and so completely impractical.|$|E

5000|$|The clip {{opens with}} Inna walking in a bikini and J Balvin doing rap movements, {{sporting}} a black T-shirt and pants along with red shoes. Subsequently, Inna is portrayed performing a synchronized choreography with two fellow background dancers while {{wearing a white}} body suit. For the second strophe of the song, Inna makes appearance in a darkened whole where she swims in a body of water, poses topless or dances along with the backup performers showed in the beginning. While further accompanying J Balvin for his rap cameo, the video ends with her staring at the camera before the screen becomes dark. Scenes interspersed through the main plot present Inna playing in sand and touching her body, angle shots of her standing on a rock, or shadowed singer and men with instruments in their hands. [...] "I feel that the video for 'Cola Song' {{is one of my}} sexiest videos, it makes me feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>myself,</b> full of energy, ready for a long and beautiful summer and I hope all my Club Rockers will enjoy watching it, they will dance {{and have a good time}} listening to it." [...] Music portal Dance Charts was positive towards the music video, although expressing that viewers may neglect the music when watching it. Echoing this thought, Hitfire further wrote that it is [...] "surely a contender for the hottest video of the year". While German magazine Klatsch-Tratsch noticed [...] "much charm, naked skin and great moves" [...] in the visual, Kevin Apaza of Direct Lyrics pointed out Inna [...] "flaunting that smokin' hot body of hers as she soaks up the sun at the beach, getting wet in a lake and performing sensual choreographies." [...] Website MuuMuse wrote that the visual is [...] "quite important for showcasing Inna's ferocious moves and luscious assets, including her Coca Cola shape — and especially her Coca Cola shake", and French publications Purebreak and Pure People noticed Inna's [...] "suggestive" [...] and [...] "lascivious" [...] posing in bathing suits. Portal Cosmopolitan Staragora compared the music video to Inna's previous material, as the singer [...] "appears little dressed in paradisiac landscapes: ocean blue lagoon, sunset, fine white sand, pretty girls ...". Spanish website Jukebox wrote that the singer [...] "evokes the similarity between her curvilinear forms and those of a bottle of Coca-Cola. It is not clear if it is an advertising for the drink or not, but there is no doubt that this fresh and summery video promotes the consumption of the soft drink", alongside stating that Inna [...] "shines in trikini" [...] and [...] "dances in purest Latin style". Music portal Musicserver was more negative towards the clip; although stating that it [...] "probably will please the male fanbase", the website concluded that, [...] "Everyone already knows that it is sexy, so why offering the same for the tenth time?" [...] The music video received a nomination for Best Video at the Romanian Music Awards gala in 2014.|$|E
