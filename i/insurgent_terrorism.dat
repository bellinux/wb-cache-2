40|$|My essay {{begins by}} {{analyzing}} how Hegel and Honneth’s theory of recognition {{would seem to}} lend support to insurgent terrorists’ struggle {{for the right to}} self-determination. <b>Insurgent</b> <b>terrorism</b> often looks like a concretization of what Honneth calls the moral protest of the oppressed launched against the dominating powers. <b>Insurgent</b> <b>terrorism</b> also bears affinity to the politics of recognition {{in the sense that it}} challenges the legitimacy and authority of the forces owned by the state, and seeks to gain public recognition instead for the legitimacy of their own cause. Precisely because what matters uppermost to terrorists is the gaining of recognition for their cause as just, terrorists are eager to seize the mass media as a means of spreading their ideas. My essay will end, however, by pointing out major differences between <b>insurgent</b> <b>terrorism</b> on the one hand, and Hegel and Honneth on the other. </div...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the use of}} law and intimidation and direct censorship {{in relation to the}} purported strategic needs of terrorism and counter-terrorism. It explains the role of the media and the strategic efficacy of censorship in <b>insurgent</b> <b>terrorism,</b> which includes subnational and transnational actors attempting to gain political power. The chapter further explains the role of the media and the strategic efficacy of censorship in state terrorism, where terrorism is deployed to sustain and strengthen political power. The role of the media and the strategic efficacy of censorship in counter-terrorism are also analyzed. The chapter talks about the strategic relationship between <b>insurgent</b> <b>terrorism</b> and counter-terrorism where the media and the efficacy of media censorship are a strategic response against terrorism as opposed to their being a tool of terrorism, which is sometimes the case in state terrorism.

Drawing on Dr. Felbab-Brown’s extensive fieldwork {{in the three}} countries over the past decade, it highlights {{the similarities and differences}} between the <b>insurgent</b> and <b>terrorism</b> groups and evaluates the effectiveness of policies adopted to end conflict. In all three countries, counterinsurgency and stabilization efforts were adopted, but with strikingly different designs and outcomes. Unlike in Somalia, the governments of Afghanistan and Colombia are currently involved in efforts to negotiate with “narcoterrorists,” a policy that would have been politically taboo only a few years ago. The process and even temporary outcomes have been strikingly different as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This essay {{discusses}} the promises {{and problems of}} several major approaches to studying the role of mass media {{in the evolution of}} <b>insurgent</b> <b>terrorism.</b> The question of how the coverage of media is related to attention-seeking attempts by insurgent terrorists and their subsequent response has been approached primarily within two major traditions in the literature. In the tradition of Media Determinism, media are suggested to have determined the outcome of terrorism either by legitimizing terrorism, which, in turn, results in the prevalence of terrorist violence, or by regressing toward the established norms, which discredits adversaries. The tradition of News Sociology, on the other hand, emphasizes the reality-responsive quality of news and deemphasizes the ideologically-directed nature of news selection process. It is suggested in this paper that a third, Social-Cultural, perspective is much in need, in which mass communication is viewed as both the means for stimulating change and contributing to the climate of terrorism reality, and as disseminating information in response to terrorist situations. Furthermore, the likelihood that terrorist violence is an interlocking behavior must also receive attention in order to uncover how else terrorism may persist in addition to the possible contribution of mass media...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the social conditions {{responsible for the}} lack of sustained <b>insurgent</b> <b>terrorism</b> in Quebec. Through the use of social movement and collective action theory, the relationship between FLQ terrorism and other forms of protest is investigated and compared with the growth of labour and separatist organizations. The years 1963 to 1976 are examined in an attempt to explain how terrorist activity changed over these years as the organization of the separatist movement changed. It was found that as the separatist movement grew and evolved into large and complex organizations, FLQ terrorism was replaced with conventional mass-based protest and other forms of collective action. The FLQ and future would-be FLQ cells became absorbed by the PQ and other more organized mass-based groups using more efficient methods of protest. Connections between separatist organizations and labour organizations were forged in attempts to provide another outlet of expression for this separatist sentiment.

2500|$|Metz {{warns that}} the {{paradigm}} may have changed. [...] "Insurgency matters today because it {{is linked to the}} phenomenon of transnational <b>terrorism.</b> <b>Insurgents</b> have long used terrorism in the operational sense, deterring those who supported the government and creating an environment of violence and insecurity to erode public trust in the regime. But now terrorism plays a strategic role as well. <b>Insurgents</b> can use <b>terrorism</b> as a form of long-range power projection against outsiders who support the government they are fighting. This could deter or even end outside assistance. It is easy to imagine, for instance, that the already fragile backing for American involvement in Iraq would erode even further if the Iraqi insurgents launched attacks in the United States. Even more important, an insurgent movement able to seize control of a state could support transnational terrorists. The idea is that insurgents have demonstrated an affinity for violence and extremism which would flavor their policies if they came to power." ...|$|R

In addition to observing the effects of foreign support on the adoption of terrorism, the effects of government regime type, insurgent group goal type, insurgent group strength, and foreign benefactor type are analyzed. After executing a multiple logistic regression analysis of 109 intrastate conflicts occurring from 1972 to 2007 and conducting detailed case studies for the Tamils in Sri Lanka and the Kurds in Iraq, this thesis concludes that specific types of foreign support from non-state actors not only make insurgent groups significantly stronger but also make them more likely to adopt terrorism thus calling into question the weapon of the weak argument...|$|R
