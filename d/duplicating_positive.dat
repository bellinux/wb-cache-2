40|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of cinema in terms of ‘pictures that move’, film history has always meant by this the movement of film through the camera and projector, and the appearance of movement on the screen. Until recently, historians have paid less attention {{to the ways in which}} film prints move around their territories of distribution, and the implications of this in terms of the social mobilisation of particular audiences to view them. Histories of early cinema-going acknowledge a period characterised by travelling showmen or itinerant exhibitors, but imply that this mobility was transformed into stasis by the appearance of fixed or permanent venues. Another way of looking at this, however, is to suggest that until the appearance of digital distribution, cinema has always had an itinerant dimension. By this I mean that the chief operational challenge of the cinema business has been to match the physical distribution of product with the means of audience attendance at a singular event at a specified location and time. In fact, it is this practical capacity to travel which was recognised as among the defining conditions of cinema’s social impact by the authors of the Production Code: The motion picture, because of its importance as an entertainment and because of the trust placed in it by the peoples of the world, has special MORAL OBLIGATIONS....

40|$|Much like humans, gene duplicates may {{be created}} equal, {{but they do}} not stay that way for long. For four {{completely}} sequenced genomes we show that 20 %– 30 % of duplicate gene pairs show asymmetric evolution in the amino acid sequence of their protein products. That is, one of the duplicates evolves much faster than the other. The greater this asymmetry, the greater the ratio Ka/Ks of amino acid substitutions (Ka) to silent substitutions (Ks) in a gene pair. This indicates that most asymmetric divergence may be caused by relaxed selective constraints on one of the duplicates. However, we also find some candidate <b>duplicates</b> where <b>positive</b> (directional) selection of beneficial mutations (Ka/Ks > 1) {{may play a role in}} asymmetric divergence. Our analysis rests on a codon-based model of molecular evolution that allows a test for asymmetric divergence in Ka.

40|$|Abstract. Different {{models of}} gene family {{evolution}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the mechanism whereby gene copies created by gene duplications are maintained and diverge in function. Ohta proposed a model which predicts a burst of nonsynonymous substitutions following gene duplication and the preservation of <b>duplicates</b> through <b>positive</b> selection. An alternative model, the duplication–degeneration– complementation (DDC) model, does not explicitly require the action of positive Darwinian selection {{for the maintenance of}} duplicated gene copies, although purifying selection is assumed to continue to act on both copies. A potential outcome of the DDC model is heterogeneity in purifying selection among the gene copies, due to partitioning of subfunctions which complement each other. By using the dN/dS (x) rate ratio to measure selection pressure, we can distinguish between these two very different evolutionary scenarios. In this study we investigated these scenarios in the b-globin family of genes, a textbook example of evolution by gene duplication. We assembled a comprehensive dataset of 72 vertebrate bglobin sequences. The estimated phylogeny suggested multiple gene duplication and gene conversion events. By using different programs to detect recombination, we confirmed several cases of gene conversion and detected two new cases. We tested evolutionary scenarios derived from Ohta’s model and the DDC model by examining selective pressures along lineages in a phylogeny of b-globin genes in eutherian mam...|$|R

ZN, direct FM and concentration FM detected 36. 0, 38. 6 and 37. 0 %, respectively, of 272 culture-positive specimens. Patient-wise, there were 8. 1 % (126 / 1553) positives on any smear compared with 12. 0 % (187 / 1553) on any culture. ZN, direct FM and concentrated FM smear were positive in 43. 3, 46. 5 and 45. 5 %, respectively, of culture-proven cases. All differences between microscopy and culture were significant (P< 0. 001), but not those between microscopy techniques. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were not rare in 60 % of 48 <b>duplicate</b> smears, <b>positive</b> in ZN or FM only. Simple LJ culture, but not FM on direct or concentrated smears, was thus significantly more sensitive than ZN smears. The considerable numbers of AFB found in positive direct smears from discordant microscopy sets suggest that repeating smears can improve microscopy sensitivity more than variations of correctly executed technique, provided that overload is avoided.

30|$|What {{workers are}} remunerated for (and {{actually}} claim proportionate remuneration for) {{is not just}} a)  their productive contribution to the cooperative production of marketable goods and services, or the utility of labor to the firm, but also b)  the intrinsic labor disutility they experience {{in the process and}} for which they claim compensation. Wages compensate workers for an uncertain mix of either of these aspects, with the question remaining hard to decide whether workers earn their remuneration by what they do (contribute) or by what they endure while doing it. Everyday evidence shows that there is no co-variation between these two variables. That is to say, jobs with relatively low skill requirements and low productivity are often associated with intrinsically highly undesirable characteristics (repetitiveness, physical stress, exhaustion, low autonomy, no authority, no opportunities for skill acquisition etc.), while others combine high skills requirements with high productivity and high intrinsic satisfaction. In such “good” jobs, not only negative features (health and accident hazards, dirty work environment, tedious routines) are absent, but the intrinsic valuation of “interesting” challenges is typically greater {{than it is in the}} case of jobs that require fewer qualifications and are less productive. In addition, intrinsically satisfying jobs are often also rewarded by higher wages and higher job security. One might object to this practice, from the point of view of intuitions about distributional fairness, that it amounts to unfairly <b>duplicating</b> the <b>positive</b> and negative rewards attached to positions within organizational hierarchies.|$|R

Recent publications have failed to <b>duplicate</b> the <b>positive</b> outcomes reported initially which has cast doubt on the future of these interventions. We previously reported on 29 patients from a developing country who completed 12 months in an assertive intervention which was a modified version of the international assertive community treatment model. We demonstrated reduction in readmission rates as well as improvements in social functioning compared to patients from the control group. The obvious question was, however, if these outcomes could be sustained for longer periods of time. This study aims to determine if modified assertive interventions in an under-resourced setting can successfully maintain reductions in hospitalizations. Methods Patients suffering from schizophrenia who met a modified version of Weidens’ high frequency criteria were randomized into two groups. One group received a modified assertive intervention based on the international assertive community treatment model.

They were referred with either one or all of the following symptoms: i) recurrent pneumonia, ii) bronchiectasis, iii) failure to thrive, iv) malabsorption or v) history of meconium ileus obstruction during the neonatal period. When the clinical features suggested strongly of CF sweat tests will be performed in <b>duplicates</b> and considered <b>positive</b> when the sweat chloride or sweat sodium was more than 60 mmol/l for both results. Seventy- two hours fecal fat excretion or stool for fat globule was performed to document malabsorption. From the year 1987 to 2003, 16 patients were confirmed to have cystic fibrosis in Malaysia by positive sweat tests. Thirteen patients were diagnosed in Paediatric Institute while the remaining three were diagnosed in UMMC. On follow-up two patients died due to severe bronchopneumonia at the age of two years old. Although once considered rare, CF should now he considered in any children with clinical presentations of recurrent chest infections, bronchiectasis, in {{the presence or absence of}} malabsoption simptoms and in neonates with rneconium ileus obstruction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The most {{acceptable}} {{criteria for}} diagnosing bovine intramammary infections include results of bacteriological culture {{and measures of}} inflammation. Therefore, information on the diagnostic characteristics of the procedures used to identify infected quarters is required. Thus, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate a set of criteria to classify the infectious status of an udder at the quarter (single and duplicate milk samples) and cow (composite milk sample) levels, and to compare the infectious status with somatic cell counts (SCCs) of the samples. Here, the SCC thresholds determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis had a higher Youden index using mammary quarter duplicate milk samples as the gold standard for testing compared with single quarter and composite milk samples, especially for samples for which at least one of the <b>duplicates</b> was microbiologically <b>positive,</b> regardless of the mastitis pathogen isolated. The kappa coefficient for bacteriological results of the single quarter milk samples (single S 1 and S 2) was 0. 85 ± 0. 019, indicating that single quarter milk sampling can be useful in mastitis control programs. Therefore, the use of composite milk samples to detect mastitis pathogens may be limited to the detection of major pathogens, given their predictive values. Thus, our findings suggest that the milk SCCs and microbiological examinations, although regarded as the most reliable indicators of ongoing mastitis, should be used in an integrated manner in mastitis control programs. Furthermore, the accuracy of single, duplicate and composite microbiological analyses to diagnosis mastitis should be considered for its implications in mastitis control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The NeoAzure {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} {{that the use of}} the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (Zol) in the neoadjuvant setting increases the rate of complete response in primary breast cancer and therefore indicates direct antitumor activity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the antitumor effect of Zol with standard chemotherapy in primary breast cancer cells using ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA). Methods Breast cancer specimens were obtained from patients with breast cancer who underwent primary breast cancer surgery at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tübingen, Germany, between 2006 through 2009. Antitumor effects of Zol, TAC (Docetaxel, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide) and FEC (5 -Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide) were tested in 116 fresh human primary breast cancer specimens using ATP-TCA. ATP-TCA results were analyzed with different cut-off levels for the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50), for IC 90 and for the sensitivity index (IndexSUM). Each single agent or combination was tested at six doubling dilutions from 6. 25, 12. 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 % of test drug concentrations (TDC) derived from the plasma peak concentrations determined by pharmacokinetic data. The assay was carried out in <b>duplicate</b> wells with <b>positive</b> and negative controls. Results The median IndexSUM value was lower for Zol than for the combined regimen FEC (36. 8 %) and TAC (12. 9 %), respectively, indicating increased antitumor activity of Zol in primary breast cancer cells. The difference regarding Zol and FEC was significant (p[*] Conclusion Zoledronic acid has a strong antitumor effect on primary breast cancer cells in vitro which is equal or superior to commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens for treating breast cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gene {{families}} from different functional categories have been preferentially expanded either by small scale duplication (SSD) or by whole-genome duplication (WGD). In particular, gene families prone to dominant deleterious mutations and implicated in cancers and other genetic diseases in human have been greatly expanded through two rounds of WGD dating back from early vertebrates. Here, we strengthen this intriguing observation, showing that human oncogenes involved in different primary tumors have retained many WGD duplicates compared to other human genes. In order to rationalize this evolutionary outcome, we propose a consistent population genetics model to analyze the retention of SSD and WGD duplicates taking into account their propensity to acquire dominant deleterious mutations. We solve a deterministic haploid model including initial duplicated loci, their retention through sub-functionalization or their neutral loss-of-function or deleterious gain-of-function at one locus. Extensions to diploid genotypes are presented and population size effects are analyzed using stochastic simulations. The only difference between the SSD and WGD scenarios is the initial number of individuals with duplicated loci. While SSD duplicates need to spread through the entire population from a single individual to reach fixation, WGD duplicates are de facto fixed in the small initial post-WGD population arising through the ploidy incompatibility between post-WGD individuals {{and the rest of the}} pre-WGD population. WGD duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations are then shown to be indirectly selected through purifying selection in post-WGD species, whereas SSD <b>duplicates</b> typically require <b>positive</b> selection. These results highlight the long-term evolution mechanisms behind the surprising accumulation of WGD duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations and are shown to be consistent with cancer genome data on the prevalence of human oncogenes with WGD duplicates...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 30 years, the {{conventional}} wisdom has been that executive compensation packages should include very large proportions of incentive pay. This incentive pay orthodoxy has become so firmly entrenched that the current debates about executive compensation simply {{take it as a}} given. We argue, however, that in light of evolving corporate governance mechanisms, the marginal net benefit of incentive-laden pay packages is both smaller than appreciated and getting smaller over time. As a result, the assumption that higher proportions of incentive pay are beneficial is no longer warranted. A number of corporate governance mechanisms have evolved to <b>duplicate</b> incentive pay’s <b>positive</b> incentive effects, thereby reducing its marginal benefit. Most significantly, a newly robust CEO labor market has made incentive pay largely redundant in focusing CEO attention on stock prices. In addition, while the marginal benefit of incentive pay has been overstated, its costs are significant and often overlooked. As a result, we believe that the net overall effect of incentive pay on shareholder wealth is now either minimally positive or even negative. We also argue that, given the strength of the corporate governance mechanisms discussed in the Article, attempts to improve company performance by “fixing” incentive pay structures are unlikely to succeed. Nevertheless, the trend towards greater and greater incentive pay continues unabated. This resiliency, however, is not surprising even in a competitive market. In the past,the incentive pay orthodoxy was justified because the corporate governance mechanisms were not as robust. Incentive-laden contracts therefore became the key marker for “good governance” in the compensation context. In addition to the stickiness of that status quo, incentive pay’s staying power has been supported by private interests who benefit from the conventional view of its efficacy. As a result of the incentive pay orthodoxy, executives receive greater pay, boards bear less responsibility for that pay, and compensation consultants and experts garner more attention. On the other hand, there is no constituency with a significant incentive to soberly assess the benefit of incentive pay that is not afflicted with informational disadvantages or collective action problems...|$|R
30|$|Two interfertility {{tests were}} {{undertaken}} by pairing {{six of the}} haploid, single-spore isolates of the New Zealand Armillaria species listed in Table  2 (two each of A. limonea, A. novae-zelandiae and A. sp. nov.) with diploid Armillaria species isolates of known or unknown identity obtained from basidiocarp or rhizomorph tissue or from multiple spore drops (also listed in Table  2). A third test was undertaken by pairing between haploid × haploid single-spore isolates of the same or different species (A. hinnulea, A. limonea, A. novae-zelandiae or A. sp. nov.) (Anderson et al. 1980; Guillaumin et al. 1991). The purpose of testing was to use interfertility, firstly, to verify, or otherwise, the uniqueness of A. sp. nov. and, secondly, to confirm the unidentified isolates as belonging, or not, to this species through positive or negative interfertility. The haploid test isolates were purposely selected for their appearance in culture (fluffy, of limited rhizomorph growth and coloured white or off-white with minimal dark pigmentation) to contrast {{with that of the}} diploid isolates. Isolates were paired 3 – 10  mm apart on 2  % malt agar plates and incubated at ambient temperature (ca. 20  °C) after sealing around the edge of each plate with a ribbon cut from commercial Glad Wrap® plastic transparent film. Interfertility was assessed after 5 – 6  weeks. Positive interfertile pairings were indicated by a diploidisation of the haploid isolates denoted by a distinct morphological change with the development of areas of an appressed, dark red-brown or purple, glabrous, spreading crust. Most pairings were <b>duplicated,</b> and one <b>positive</b> replicate was sufficient for the pairing to be judged interfertile. Occasionally, pairings were doubtful. Where this was so in the third, haploid × haploid test, a small mycelium piece from the junction region between the two isolates was sub-cultured on 2  % malt agar to help clarify the result from its appearance. For a number of selected pairings, the hyphae from this junction region were also examined microscopically after 10  days for the presence of clamp connections (Armillaria sp. nov., eight within-species pairings; A. hinnulea, 14 within-species pairings; Armillaria sp. nov. × A. hinnulea, 12 between-species pairings).|$|R
