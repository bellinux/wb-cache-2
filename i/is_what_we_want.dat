"I {{keep trying}} to {{convince}} people in the movement that the charge of sickness is perhaps our greatest problem ... we can't really progress in other directions until the unsubstantiated assumption of sickness...is demolished! It's almost always there, however slyly or covertly or even unconsciously, however 'sympathetic' the person: the attitude that homosexuality is somehow undesirable, some sort of twist or malfunction or failure or maladaptation or other kind of psychic sickness. And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO not get equal treatment. Equal treatment— no more, no less— <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want!</b> And compassion— which many homosexuals gladly swallow {{because they think it}} represents an improvement in attitudes toward them— is not equal treatment." ...|$|E

2500|$|The flame {{was reduced}} to a pilot light during World War II (from December 25, 1941) and just prior to the 1946 Paris peace conference, President Truman commented about the inscribed motto, Peace Eternal in a Nation United: [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> but let's change that word (nation) to world and we'll have something."

60|$|LADY CAROLINE. I am {{not at all}} {{in favour}} of amusements for the poor, Jane. Blankets and coals are sufficient. There is too much love of {{pleasure}} amongst the upper classes as it is.

6000|$|But {{when the}} lieutenant--such a big, brave, gentle giant--rose to his feet, he {{delivered}} {{what seemed to}} me as the speech of the evening.

6000|$|... "That {{of course}} is the danger," [...] said Lady Bailquist quietly; [...] "probably two-thirds of the {{available}} strength will hold back, but a third or even a sixth would be enough; it would redeem the parade from the calamity of fiasco, {{and it would be}} a nucleus to work on for the future.

5000|$|The duo saw the {{new album}} as an {{opportunity}} to redefine themselves as a band, and this hope is reflected in the album's name, 6.1.

5000|$|He {{added that}} the sanctioning body doesn't [...] "want that to happen again. <b>We</b> don’t <b>want</b> any of our events to be altered {{in a way they}} shouldn’t <b>be.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to prevent {{happening}} is drivers or any participant in NASCAR to take {{matters into their own hands}} and begin to control the outcome of races beyond hard racing.

6000|$|... 'We are too severe both in {{sculpture}} and architecture,' said he. 'More fancy and vigour in our sculptors, more use {{of gold and}} more ornament in our architects--that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want.</b> But I think it is past praying for. It {{would be better to}} subdivide the work of the world, according to the capacity of the different nations. Let Italy and France embellish us.

6000|$|... "Excellent! You're {{just the}} man. You will {{bring to the}} work a mind unclouded by theories. You will act solely {{by the light of}} your intelligence. And you've got lots of that. That novel of yours showed the most {{extraordinary}} intelligence--at least as far as that blighter at the bookstall would let me read. I wouldn't have a professional chicken farmer about the place if he paid to come. If he applied to me, I should simply send him away.

6000|$|The {{scientific}} fact of sex is no {{more sex}} than a skeleton is a man.

It is disastrous to the deep sexual life. But perhaps that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bananarama did {{not like}} the song. Group member Keren Woodward later said of the True Confessions album, [...] "It is all our ideas, it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to sound like and sing about. Except 'Do Not Disturb' which Swain and Jolley wrote and which we don't think is very good. Thats why there's eleven songs on the LP instead of ten".

5000|$|Filming was {{completed}} {{on the day}} of the deadline for the UK Film Council Completion Fund which [...] "provides finance and support for short films that show outstanding potential but lack the funds to finish." [...] Despite being only a rough assembly, the film won a completion funding award: [...] "the completion fund <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> the most really...it's actually, apart from Cinema Extreme, the only nationwide UK Film Council short film funding scheme.
