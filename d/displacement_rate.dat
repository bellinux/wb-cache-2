5000|$|G. David Tilman {{developed}} the R* rule {{in support of}} resource competition theory. Theoretically, a plant species growing in monoculture, and utilizing a single limiting resource, will deplete the resource until reaching an equilibrium level where growth and losses are balanced. The concentration of the resource at the equilibrium level is termed R*; this is the minimum concentration at which the plant is able to persist in the environment. Population growth is indicated by values greater than the R*. Conversely, population decline is associated with values lower than the R*. If two species are competing for the same limiting resource, the superior competitor will have the lowest R* value for that resource. This will eventually lead to the displacement of the inferior competitor, regardless of initial plant densities. <b>Displacement</b> <b>rate</b> depends on {{the magnitude of the}} difference in R*. Greater differences lead to a faster exclusion. Every plant species differs in R* values due to differences in plant morphology and physiology. The realized R* level is dependent on physical factors that vary by habitat, such as temperature, pH, and humidity.|$|E

Cylindrical samples of heights (5, 10, 15 and 20 mm) and diameters (19. 05 and 25. 4 mm) were tested under non-lubricated, lubricated and increased friction conditions. Sample flatness (λ = 4 height/diameter of sample) of specimens ranged between 0. 79 and 4. 20. <b>Displacement</b> <b>rate</b> effect was also examined by performing tests at 50, 100, 200 and 400 mm min- 1. Measured fracture parameters were Cauchy strain (εC), engineering stress (F/A 0), true stress (F/Af), work of fracture (Wf), and the apparent elastic modulus (E). Fracture parameters showed a dependence upon sample flatness when no lubricant was used, which decreased with lubrication and increased with increasing friction conditions. A lower flatness ratio led {{to an increase in}} stress at a given strain level, i. e. the material appeared to be stiffer than it truly is. Shorter samples and increased friction resulted in an observed dependence upon displacement rate; a higher <b>displacement</b> <b>rate</b> resulted in a lower fracture stresses for a given strain level. Lubrication increases significantly the Cauchy strain, and reduces the true stress, values. Cauchy strain was found to increase with <b>displacement</b> <b>rate</b> and decreased when the flatness ratio increased. Engineering stress, true stress, and work of fracture decreased as <b>displacement</b> <b>rate</b> and sample flatness are increased. Lubrication was found to reduce the effect of <b>displacement</b> <b>rate</b> on the Cauchy strain. Sample flatness influenced engineering stress, work of fracture and apparent elastic modulus, whereas <b>displacement</b> <b>rate</b> influenced true stress and apparent elastic modulus. Increased friction resulted in a higher sample flatness influence on all fracture parameters.

Different from the conventional approach the proposed method estimates the VDRs by multi-temporal interferometric SAR processing (i. e., temporarily coherent point InSAR, TCPInSAR) and the localized least square (LS) solution, {{through which the}} horizontal <b>displacement</b> <b>rates</b> (HDRs) can be also derived as the by-product. The three types of <b>displacement</b> <b>rates</b> in the radar line of sight (LOS) are first estimated by TCPInSAR with use of the ascending/descending CSK and descending TSX data. Both the VDRs and HDRs are then estimated by a localized LS method {{on the basis of}} the three types of LOS <b>displacement</b> <b>rates</b> derived by TCPInSAR. For comparison purposes, the VDRs for the single-platform SAR data are also obtained through dividing the LOS <b>displacement</b> <b>rates</b> by the cosine of the radar incidence angle. The analysis with the aid of GPS data shows the horizontal motion due to the geological settings in Shanghai cannot be ignored, and the VDRs derived from the single-platform data are not accurate and reliable without taking into account the horizontal motion. The experimental results indicate the TCPInSAR-LS method can be used to efficiently improve the accuracy in the VDRs by integrating the multi-platform SAR data and considering both horizontal and vertical motion, thus overcoming the disadvantages in the conventional approach. The improved VDRs in Shanghai range between − 22. 8 and 9. 6 mm/year, while the relative east-west motion rates range between − 7. 2 and 6. 2 mm/year, and the relative north–south motion is subtle and can be ignored. Analysis of the improved VDRs shows that a slightly uplifting area of about 70 km 2 appears in the west downtown of Shanghai, and a subsiding bowl appears in the Hongkou District of Shanghai. The validation indicates that the uplifting trend can be ascribed to the measures conducted by the Shanghai municipal government, i. e., decreasing the groundwater pumping volume and increasing the groundwater recharge volume...|$|R

Static and dynamic tests, with stroke rates ranging from 8. 33 × 10 - 4 in/s to 100 in/s, were conducted on double cantilever beam and end notch flexure specimens. Both [0 °] N and [± 45 °] N laminates were studied in this investigation. The rate sensitivities were characterized in terms of the initiation fracture toughness and crack growth resistance. The average mode-I initiation fracture toughness, GIc of NB 321 / 7781 [0 °] laminate was observed to decrease with stroke rate from 6. 5 lbf-in/in 2 to 4 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 6 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening <b>displacement</b> <b>rates.</b> The resistance tended to be constant with crack length for the low rate tests. At higher rates, the resistance decreased gradually. The tests data indicated ductile stable and brittle unstable behavior with a transition stick-slip behavior.

The opening mode initiation toughness of T 700 G/ 3900 [0 °] laminate decreased from 3. 5 lbf-in/in 2 to 2 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 3. 2 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of viii crack opening <b>displacement</b> <b>rates.</b> The delamination resistance indicated constant pattern irrespective of the stroke rates. The fracture behavior at low rates indicated transition stick-slip behavior, whereas brittle unstable behavior was evident at higher rates. The mode-II fracture toughness tended to be constant at 4. 5 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of shear <b>displacement</b> <b>rates.</b> Brittle stable fracture behavior was observed at all rates. The opening mode initiation toughness of T 700 G/ 3900 [± 45 °] laminate was observed to decrease from 2. 75 lbf-in/in 2 to 1. 8 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 2. 8 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening <b>displacement</b> <b>rates.</b> The delamination resistance tended to increase with crack length at lower rates, whereas it tended to decrease at higher rates. The fracture behavior indicated transition stick-slip behavior at lower rates, whereas brittle unstable behavior was evident at the highest rate tested. The T 800 S/ 3900 [0 °] laminate’s opening mode initiation toughness was observed to steadily decrease from 5 lbf-in/in 2 to 2. 5 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening <b>displacement</b> <b>rates.</b> The delamination resistance was observed to increase with crack length at lower rates, whereas it tended to decrease gradually at higher rates. Brittle stable fracture behavior was observed at all rates. Fiber bridging was prominent with an increase in test rates. The mode-II fracture toughness increased steadily from 9 lbf-in/in 2 to 20 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of shear <b>displacement</b> <b>rates.</b> Brittle stable fracture behavior was observed at all rates...|$|R
