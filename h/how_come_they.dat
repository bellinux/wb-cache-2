KickOff-camp for youth is an initiative in development. Purpose and research question: The study has a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, and the intention was to explore adolescent experiences by attending camp. Which experiences can youngsters who have attended KickOff- camp tell about, <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>they</b> expressed at the camp, and in what ways might their experiences at camp affect the normal development? Method: The method used for data collection was a qualitative research interview with four youths, in addition with participant observation. Results: The study shows that being a participant in a group where experiences are shared with others, having social support and acquiring new knowledge, are important experiences that youth refer at camp. This can provide opportunities to develop their own problem-solving ability, emotion regulation, reflection, language development and learning. Conclusion: The results indicate that participation at camp can support normal development. There is reason to believe, that it may affect the ability to develop communication forms that are necessary to solve life problems, understand other people's motives and consciously adjust to group norms. Simultaneously, the study also shows that this does not apply to all youngsters and it says nothing about possible changes that can be transferred to other areas in their life.

40|$|The term {{sustainable}} agriculture may be formulated, {{but not yet}} practically integrated in agriculture. This thesis investigates the organic farmers´ ideas and experiences of what they consider sustainable or not sustainable in agriculture. Using unstructured phone interviews and "walk-alongs" with KRAV-farmers in Kristianstad, I have sought to understand their ideas and experiences, inspired by the phenomenological approach. The thesis communicates the experiences of organic farmers of {{sustainable agriculture}} based on an explicit role as stewards of the same. <b>How</b> <b>come</b> <b>they</b> express themselves and act the way they do? Why are these issues important {{and how do they}} relate to each other? The result, using the three dimensions of economical, ecological and social sustainability, is presented. How farmers experience profitability, eco-awareness and influence in their stewardship are important. The overlapping areas for sustainability describe the need of fair terms in socioeconomic terms. Agroecologically, the stewards need to experience the work to be practically feasible, both financially and ecologically. Socioecologically, their stewardship becomes more acceptable within an eco-aware market, which adds to their individual creation of meaning. Even though there are ideas and experiences of what sustainable agriculture includes, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} this is what the farmers find in their work. In the eyes of these farmers, their experiences need to be more just, feasible and acceptable for sustainability. How farmers continue to handle complex choices in agriculture for economic, ecological and social sustainability is interesting; not only for the farmers themselves, but also in a societal perspective for long-term domestic food security. What they see as sustainable depends on the choices of other stakeholders and how the farmers themselves formulate goals and purpose with regard to their own farming. They argue that one thing leads to another, which the thesis gives plenty of practical examples of. The thesis should be seen as a normative contribution to the public debate about what is sustainable, listening to the voices of organic farmers...|$|E

To put {{all out of}} doubt; the saint, when he hath {{done what}} he can to bring forth good works by faith, yet he dares not show these works before God but as they pass through the Mediator Christ, but as they are washed {{in the blood of}} the Lamb. And {{therefore}} Peter saith, those sacrifices of ours that are truly spiritual are only then accepted of God, when offered up by Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5). And therefore it is said again, that the prayers of the saints, which are the fruits of faith, come up before the throne of God through the angel's hand; that is, through the hand of Christ, through his golden censer, perfumed with his incense, made acceptable by his intercession (Rev 8:3,4). It is said in the Book of Revelation, that it is granted to the bride, the Lamb's wife, that she should be 'arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; which white linen is the righteousness of saints.' This fine linen, in my judgment, is the works of godly men, their works that sprang from faith. But <b>how</b> <b>came</b> <b>they</b> clean? <b>How</b> <b>came</b> <b>they</b> white? Not simply because they were the works of faith. But mark, they 'washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.' And 'therefore they stand before the throne of God' (Rev 7:14,15).

40|$|Translation begins] Tuesday My Darling, Well, {{another day}} has gone by- I didn’t mail {{the letter that}} I wrote you last night so I’ll mail it with this. Anyway, today I got three dresses – 2 for me and 1 for mother. One is red + white print. The other is {{a black and white}} western print top with a black crepe skirt. Hope you like them but it’s too late now. Darling, only {{nineteen}} more days, golly, and we’ll be married. It’s snowing madly out. What a night! Just as the weather gets nice and the snow is melting + you can walk all night. Then it snows again- what a life. I’ll sure be glad to get down South. But then I’ll probably wish it were cold again. Gee, honey, 19 days isn’t very long. It seems years but when you think it’s less than three weeks, it doesn’t seem so long. This week will go pretty fast for me because I’m not working and have something planned for every minute. Bobbie leaves for Texas day after tomorrow. Tomorrow I’m going to see her + Mom. They’re bringing Ricky to Mrs. Nisou’s house to stay until Bobbie gets home from Texas. Then mom + Bobbie are coming over to see my things. Then we’re going up to their house, I guess. It’s too bad that Bobbie can’t see my wedding dress but it isn’t finished being fitted yet. She wants us to send her a picture right away. I sure hope they come out well. You take such marvelous picture and I always take a horrible one. Honey, I’m so angry most of the dresses that I wanted aren’t being cut. What a time I’ve been having trying to get them. Golly, honey, you’ve sure {{been doing a lot of}} flying, haven’t you? I hope you’re not too tired when we get down there. When are you going to start instruments? Wish that they’d get that over with, darling, so that you’d have that off your mind. <b>How</b> <b>come</b> <b>they</b> have changed your address? Are you in a different sqdrn or what? I didn’t know they let you fly two cross countries at once. How many hours have you now darling. Not too many more to go. As you probably know by now Charlotte’s not coming down with us. So now you don’t need to get her a date. I like my hair better in those pictures than the way I’ve been wearing it lately. And I don’t like the way it was when you were at Stewart. What else decides whether you’re going to be a 2 nc Lieutenant? When do you find out what you’ll be, not until 10 days before graduation? What is the deciding factor? No, honey, I didn’t see Winged Victory. It wasn’t playing. It was “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” and we didn’t get to see it. “Winged Victory is coming this weekend and we’ll probably see it Friday, Woody and I. It’s really a shame that Mona isn’t given a chance to look as beautiful as she is. If they’d only let her act her age- oh, well. She’s had pretty good parts so far. I’ll have to see “Roughly Speaking” when it comes. It’s such a relief to know that I don’t have to work in that place any more. Golly, it really was getting me down. Yeah, I think all men are babies! Yes, women act their ages. Well, you haven’t me the right people yet. What am I saying. Well, you may be glad that I’ve gained some weight but I’m furious. What “spots” could I have used some. It was the wrong ones that I gained it in! I feel much better since I’ve had my tonsils out + as soon as I begin losing weight again I’ll feel real good. But as soon as I gain I feel awful. Now that I’m not working any more my mind will be more at ease too. Well, honey, Woody has complete faith in Steve. She hasn’t heard from him in two weeks now. He sure is handing her a line. I just hope he means it. Woody really would feel awful if she thought he didn’t’ mean it. The cigarette shortage is really bad around here. People stand in line for everything! You should see them at a store. It’s really pitiful. Honey, gee, I miss you so. It seems so darned long since the last time we were together- I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you but I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying. It won’t be long, now, honey til we’re together again. Oh honey, I think it would be better for mother if we spent Thursday night in Atlanta- she’s not in any condition to travel. Rode home with Dick Eddington and Dick Molke and Mike Romeo. They all said to say hello + wish you luck. Started to say send their love then I realized what I was saying. Oh, have you seen “To Have And Have Not”? What a picture! It was wonderful. I like Lauren Bacall. She was really good- she’s a very good actress. Went to the same dramatic school that Woody is going to now. Well, darling, I’ve got to get to bed. Bob Hope will be on soon + I never can write when he’s on. I love you so. It won’t be long until we’re together. I’ll love you, Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
