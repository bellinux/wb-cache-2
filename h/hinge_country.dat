40|$|Countries {{around the}} world are faced with {{inevitable}} demographic change and the phenomenon of ageing populations. Estimating the burden of aging across <b>countries</b> <b>hinges</b> on the availability of valid and comparable indicators. Demographic indicators like old-age dependency ratios and median ages are widely used to rank countries by age [...] however, these are exclusively based on chronological age distributions. Based on such measures, the populations of Germany or Japan are much older than those of China or Mexico. Alternative aging measures include those based on subjective health and economic activity levels. However, these measures may be influenced by for instance cultural variation in revealing health problems or by business cycle fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Review {{of public}} health {{perspectives}} of preeclampsia in developing countries and implications for health system strengthening. Methods. Literature from Pubmed (MEDLINE), AJOL, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database were reviewed. Results. The prevalence of preeclampsia in developing countries ranges from 1. 8 % to 16. 7 %. Many challenges exist in the prediction, prevention, and management of preeclampsia. Promising prophylactic measures like low-dose aspirin and calcium supplementation need further evidence before recommendation for use in developing countries. Treatment remains prenatal care, timely diagnosis, proper management, and timely delivery. Prevailing household, community, and health system factors limiting effective control of preeclampsia in these countries were identified, and strategies to strengthen health systems were highlighted. Conclusion. Overcoming the prevailing challenges in the control of preeclampsia in developing <b>countries</b> <b>hinges</b> {{on the ability of}} health care systems to identify and manage women at high risk...|$|R
40|$|Investment in {{renewable}} energy sectors {{in many developing}} countries has grown significantly in the last decade. Developing countries now seek to attract investment in the {{renewable energy}} sector. Foreign investment in developing <b>countries</b> <b>hinges</b> on factors such as security of investment, entry barriers, cost of doing business, repatriation of profits, dispute resolution, etc. This is where the role of the government and policy-makers becomes critical. Unless a sector-specific policy is adopted that is not only coherent and adaptable but also extends the right incentives, foreign investors will remain reluctant to invest in the renewable energy sector even if a huge investment potential exists. This article highlights Pakistan as a case study to examine law and policy issues pertaining to investment and transaction costs associated with investing in a developing country that possesses significant wind energy potential...|$|R
25|$|In Italy, {{the prisoners}} of war were forgotten, a fate seen in other {{countries}} too. In the United States, a Prisoner of War Medal was established, but only in 1986. Prisoners symbolised what the public {{did not wish to}} see. For the latter, they were not part of the war, did not defend their country and were living symbols of defeat. Thus, the memory of the prisoners was voluntarily buried, just as they themselves tried to forget in order to continue to live. However, they were the ones best suited to reflect on the Germans with whom they lived. The richness of their memoirs reveals analyses that are sometimes quite advanced, as is for instance the case with Jacques Rivière. For historiography, the prisoner is a <b>hinge</b> between two <b>countries,</b> who can reveal the importance of what was culturally and nationally at stake during the period.|$|R
40|$|Political {{campaigns are}} much more attack-filled in some {{countries}} than in others. What accounts for it? One answer <b>hinges</b> on the <b>country’s</b> party system. We propose that two-party systems encourage more negativity than multiparty systems because parties in a multiparty system (1) must maintain good relationships with parties with which {{they may want to}} enter into coalition and (2) run the risk of supporters of the attacked party moving to support a third party. We test the relationship between party system and attack behaviour in New Zealand, which in 1996 changed from a single-member district, first-past-the-post system to a mixed-member proportional system. The result was a more fragmented party sys-tem, resulting in coalition and minority governments. Analysing over 250 ads and party election broadcasts aired from 1969 to 2011, we find that advertising has become more positive since 1996, suggesting that party systems affect the tone of election campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{commonly}} accepted that iron deficiency {{is one of the}} most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in the world today (1), successful national intervention programs in the last de-cade have been virtually nonexistent. This issue contains a report by Layrisse et al (2) on the outcome of a national iron-fortification program that was instituted in Venezuela in 1993. The authors describe the effect of providing iron-forti-fled precooked white and yellow maize and wheat flours on indexes of iron status in a select cohort of children from Caracas, Venezuela. The precipitating events in Venezuela, as in many other developing <b>countries,</b> <b>hinged</b> on an economic crisis in which the availability of affordable basic foodstuffs became limited to an increasing proportion of the population.

30|$|The African continent, evidently {{is known}} to be relegated in {{comparison}} to other developing areas. Countries in the Africa are mostly characterized by poor institutional qualities and the prevalence of poverty marked characteristics etc. The development of African <b>countries</b> <b>hinges</b> on the ability for these economies to convert every resource, revenue or grant for economic development. The study of the financial development of these countries, which {{is known to}} contribute immensely to economic growth is important. With increased number of migrants in recent years from Africa, it is deemed reasonable to see increased levels of remittances. With dire economic conditions compared to other developing countries, recipients rely greatly on these migrant funds for numerous reasons. Among the already mentioned reasons, how these funds can help promote the accessibility to credit facilities, indulgence in formal banking by recipients and the circulation of funds to promote the financial infrastructure, is what this study ventured to explore.|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Houseflies {{are one of}} {{the major}} pest {{problems}} worldwide. The currenthousefly control strategy in the <b>country</b> <b>hinges</b> on the use of Dichlorvos as a housefly larvicide andpyrethrum spray in kitchens/dining areas. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the newerhousefly control options in the wake of concerns about human toxicity of Dichlorvos and itscontinued use in public health. Methods: Efficacy of Diflubenzuron WP and granule formulations (chitin synthesis inhibitor) visà-vis Dichlorvos EC in the control of housefly was assessed in laboratory by adult emergenceinhibition after treatment and in field conditions by estimation of density post-application up tothree weeks using standard methods. Results: Dichlorvos EC and Diflubenzuron formulations (WP and granule) brought about 100 %inhibition of adult emergence under laboratory conditions. However, in the field evaluation, effectivesuppression of housefly population was brought about by Dichlorvos and Diflubenzuron granuleformulation (though delayed). Conclusion: Dichlorvos EC and Diflubenzuron granule formulation are effective housefly larvicides. It is recommended that Diflubenzuron WP formulation be evaluated at a higher frequency toenhance its effectiveness and its use may be considered in conjunction with an initial suppressionof housefly adults with an adulticide, e. g.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} that a fiscal expansion can induce both a short- and long-run depreciation of a currency and, by parallel arguments, fiscal contraction can induce short- and long-run appreciation. This possibility <b>hinges</b> on a <b>country</b> being a debtor {{with at least}} some of its debt servicing costs reset periodically in response to changes in its domestic interest rates. In the simpler version of our model, we show that a fiscal expansion can lead to an instantaneous depreciation and a current account deficit, causing the currency to continue to depreciate over time. The current account deficit develops despite the currency depreciation because debt service payments increase due to the higher interest rates induces by the fiscal stimulus. The second version of our model assumes the trade deficit responds with a lag to relative prices. This model implies that expansionary fiscal policy may induce not only a currency depreciation and a current account deterioration, but a widening of the trade deficit as well. In both models, an instantaneous depreciation following a fiscal expansion becomes more likely if a country's net external debt is large. Money; Fiscal policy...|$|R
40|$|Since 1990, governments {{around the}} {{developing}} world have broken contracts made with multinational corporations (MNCs), but the incidence of breach varies across countries and over time. I argue that shared firm nationality is a key determinant of contract sanctity. MNCs are likely to divert investments or exit in response to breach with a firm of the same nationality but unlikely to react in ways costly to the host government otherwise. At {{the level of the}} economy as a whole, host govern-ments gain permissive space to trade-off among national groups of investors when a greater diversity of foreign direct investment nationalities is present. I use national-, firm-, and dyadic-level data from 1990 to 2008 to demonstrate nationality-tied firm responses to breach. Counterintuitively, deeper integration with more nationally diverse MNCs enables more breach, as governments gain space to prioritize other goals over the property and preferences of foreign capital.

40|$|Comparing {{the burden}} of aging across <b>countries</b> <b>hinges</b> on the {{availability}} of valid and comparable indicators. Existing alternative indicators based on health or economic activity suffer from measurement and comparability problems. We propose an indicator based on age variation in cognitive functioning, which has been shown to strongly relate to productive capacity. We use data from standardized tests of seniors' cognitive abilities for countries from different world regions. In the wake of long-term advances in countries’ industrial composition, and technological advances, the ability to handle new job procedures is now of high and growing importance, which increases the importance of cognition for work performance over time. In several countries with older populations, we find better cognitive performance on the part of populations aged 50 + than in countries with chronologically younger populations. This variation in cognitive functioning levels may be {{explained by the fact that}} seniors in some regions of the world experienced better conditions during childhood and adult life, including nutrition, duration and quality of schooling, lower exposure to disease, and physical and social activity patterns. Because of the slow process of cohort replacement, those countries whose seniors already have higher cognitive levels today are likely to continue to be at an advantage for several decades to come...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{there has}} been new coal, iron-ore and {{manganese}} discoveries in southern African countries, and increased trade with emerging economies. However, a key concern is market access and critical infrastructure challenges regarding railways and ports. These factors combine to hinder expansion of trade within Africa and globally. As a result of historic underinvestment in transport infrastructure, these countries are facing an “infrastructure gap”. Most of the railway systems in southern Africa are not functioning as they should. Hence, economic development and regional integration in Southern African <b>countries</b> <b>hinges</b> on rehabilitation of existing rail infrastructure and on building new rail infrastructure. Following a review of corridors and railway projects, this paper identifies the strategic challenges with regard to rail infrastructure provision. In the policy context, the gauge and inter-operability issue i. e. Standard Gauge vs Cape Gauge, {{taking into account the}} requirements for interconnections with other regional railways is examined. Some of the other enablement issues are promotion of green technologies, and a robust institutional framework for providing clear guidelines on balanced regulation for ownership and operational structures, promotion of principle of multiple users, and access agreements. Moving forward, an overview of plans and programmes viz.; the Southern African Development Community (SADC) - Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan, the forthcoming Programme of Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) by the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), and the key to policy transfer are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ensuring the {{involvement}} of private sector creditors in the resolution of sovereign debt crises is crucial to ensure an effective management and orderly resolution of those crises. A review of experience gained in past financial crises suggests that crisis management practices have been largely following a case-by-case approach. This has led to some uncertainty about how the official sector addresses different types of crises, which in turn might partially account for the very mixed results achieved so far. From a global welfare perspective, the resolution of international financial crises is too costly and takes too long. Efforts to improve predictability of crisis resolution processes – through guiding debtor, creditor and official sector behaviour – could lower overall costs of such crises and bring about a better distribution of these costs. Past experience with such private sector involvement shows that, in certain cases, existing instruments have successfully contributed to minimising the economic disruptions caused by crises. However, the effective use of these instruments requires predictable and strong commitment of all parties involved. Key variables in that regard are the country’s economic fundamentals and its track record prior to the crisis, underscoring the importance of effective surveillance and crisis prevention. Success also <b>hinges</b> on the <b>country’s</b> resolve to implement necessary domestic adjustment measures. A transparent process providing for early dialogue between a debtor and its creditors also facilitates private sector involvement. Finally, the IMF {{plays a key role}} in crisis situations, as accurate and timely diagnosis by the IMF helps identify at an early stage the need for private sector involvement.

40|$|From a little-known, foreign {{concept to}} a {{critical}} component of the country’s increasingly multi-layered capital markets, private equity in China has undergone tremendous development in the past decade. This Note first reviews the representative deals of major U. S. private equity firms (Bain Capital, Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR, TPG, Warburg Pincus, and the private equity arms of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) in China, and profiles leading Chinese private equity firms and their relationship with the U. S. firms. Then, the Note analyzes the evolving web of laws that regulates China’s private equity industry, with special attention to the rise of RMB funds, and recent legal developments such as the Foreign-Invested Partnership (“FIP”) regulation and the Qualified Foreign Limited Partners (“QFLP”) program that many believe will lead to a level playing field for foreign and domestic firms. The thesis of this study is two-fold. First, the development of a legal framework for private equity in China is closely tied to the country’s economic fundamentals. To date, private equity boomed in China largely in response to the unmet financial needs of small and medium-sized private companies and a financial system overly reliant on stateowned banks; going forward, the prosperity of foreign private equity firms in China will <b>hinge</b> on the <b>country’s</b> gradual relaxation of its foreign exchange control and its plans for the renminbi to become a global currency. Second, private equity offers a unique lens for understanding China’s legal system. In particular, this study examines the advantages and potential pitfalls of China’s administrative rulemaking process, and the important yet controversial role of the government in a historic economic transformation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{overview}} of the relationship between international migration and international trade as well as capital movements. After taking a brief historical perspective, we first investigate migration flows between two countries in a static, neoclassical context. We allow for a disaggregated view of migration that distinguishes between different types of labor and emphasizes the distinction between migration flows and pre-existing stocks. We focus on different welfare channels, on internal income distribution, international income convergence and on whether migration and trade are substitutes or complements. Complementarity/substitutability <b>hinges</b> on whether <b>countries</b> share the same technology, and the pivotal {{question is whether or not}} technology is convex. Generally, under substitutability between trade and migration and with convex technology, globalization tends to lead to convergence. Moreover, under non-convex technology trade and migration tend to be complements. Turning to dynamic models with capital adjustment costs and capital mobility, the same is true for the relationship between migration and capital flows. Nevertheless, in neoclassical models, we may observe emigration at the same time as capital accumulates during the transition to a steady state. Moreover, we can explain reverse migration. We also touch upon the effects of migration on the accumulation of both knowledge and human capital, by invoking endogenous growth theory. Finally, we review the empirical literature exploring the link between migration and trade. The discussion is based on the so called gravity model of trade, in which trade between pairs of countries is related to measures of their respective sizes, preferences, and trade costs. We revisit the identification of the overall trade-creating effect of migration and its break-down into the trade channel and the preference channel. We clarify the role of product differentiation for the size of estimated effects, discuss the role of immigrants' education and occupation, and emphasize direct and indirect networks and their trade-enhancing potential...|$|R
