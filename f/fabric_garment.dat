40|$|Fabric {{garments}} augment {{and transform}} {{the body as}} a second skin. This project is a poetic, heuristic inquiry that investigates taking this ‘second skin’ through multiple forms, transitioning between flat <b>fabric,</b> <b>garment</b> form, flat <b>fabric,</b> <b>garment</b> form etc. In this cyclical long-term relationship, {{the surface of the}} textile-skin is inscribed and augmented as cuts are made, and ‘healed’ through various textile processes. The scars write a story on the surface. There is a ceremonial sensation to removing and the ‘flattening’ the skin, which evokes the collection of a pelt. Using a phenomenological methodology the ‘flat’ and ‘form’ iterations are performed and photographed, growing a catalogue of the fabric’s evolution. Returning a garment to ‘flat’ offers erasure of form; it can become a level plane for a new construction. This action is achieved by utilising the method of ‘zero waste’ design, in which no fabric is removed in the construction of a garment. This enables the form to be unpicked, reassembled and sewn back to a flat-fabric state. The flat/ form/flat/form cycle is played out as a conversation with the cloth, responding to the flow and tendencies of each textile. The central proposition is that the flat-form-flat cycle provides a channel to engage in the transformative performance of dress, while enacting a use practice that diverges from problematic consumption models. In doing this, a unique surface pattern is inscribed on the cloth. The process asks: ‘what might be allowed to develop?’ The outcome demonstrates a collection of nine textile ‘pelts’ with documented progression; liminal pieces that are detailed artefacts in themselves, yet invite further interaction.

Despite alterations through artificial and self-organizing biochemical, physiological, and electronic modifications, the paramount piece of technology enabling human non-terrestrial flirtations was the "exogenous device" of the spacesuit. In this instance, the incorporation of high-tech textiles and manufacturing techniques accommodates the design process {{to the point where}} the distinction between <b>fabric,</b> <b>garment,</b> and astronaut merge. This article uses the spacesuit as an illustrative example in arguing that a particular utility value of fashion is its role as "aerial"; transmitting and receiving messages that feed into, and draw from, social and cultural archives. This article explores the concept of to-and-fro transmission/ reception, arguing that fashion, as aerial, contributes to a highly complex meaning system, in which negotiation becomes a passive, unconscious activity...|$|E

40|$|Drape is {{a unique}} {{property}} that allows a fabric to be bent {{in more than one}} direction with double curvature. For many years, researchers studied fabric drape in order to evaluate the aesthetic performance of finished garments.

Such difference would affect the prediction of garment drape based on fabric drape.
