5000|$|From humble beginnings, Henry then 16, started {{operations}} out of Fishery Port Road as a <b>Fish</b> <b>Grader</b> in Jurong Fish Market by assisting ship-chandlers {{to commence}} trading in Singapore. Contrary to popular beliefs, his success story {{is as simple}} as one can possibly imagine. Henry simply stressed that he was [...] "lucky" [...] and adventurous during his prime which led to him rising from rag to riches. HQ: The only question is are you hungry enough to succeed? If yes, are you willing to do what most common people are unwilling to do? Which is to labor at the Fish Market in the wee hours where everyone else is asleep without fail or to seek an opportunity in any industry which requires hand-one's work and determination to succeed. There is lots of [...] "opportunities" [...] in the market but are you willing to step out of your [...] "comfort zone" [...] and give it a shot like what Henry did? In the interview, it clearly seems like a simple answer which any one of us could simple do and make it in today's competitive world but sadly the new generation is simply not the same as before. Maybe all of this was attributed to the fact that Henry was a primary school-leaver which [...].- Reported by Jessica Wong ...|$|E
50|$|After {{graduating from}} Union University in 1979, Gaines began studies for a Master of Divinity degree at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. For seven years {{he served as}} Professor Roy <b>Fish’s</b> <b>grader,</b> longer than anyone else to ever hold that position. In {{the final year of}} his master’s program, the seminary preaching faculty awarded Steve with the H. C. Brown, Jr. Preaching Award for “Outstanding Achievement in the Study and Practice of Preaching.” At the same time, the evangelism faculty {{presented}} him with the W. Fred Swank Evangelism Award for best demonstrating the spirit of evangelism as a graduating student. Fred Swank was the legendary pastor of Sagamore Hill Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas.|$|R
40|$|The {{stocking}} of size-graded catfish {{into production}} ponds should increase production efficiency, but grading {{large numbers of}} fish with existing technology is laborious. We evaluated {{the effectiveness of a}} mechanical grader recently developed at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) relative to that of box and sock graders and assessed injuries sustained by stocker channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus during grading. Three 0. 25 -acre ponds were stocked at 11, 777 lb/acre. Initial total length (TL) ranged from 6. 3 to 15. 7 in, and initial weight of individuals ranged from 0. 04 to 1. 10 lb. The fish population in each pond was divided into three groups graded with the box grader, UAPB grader, or sock <b>grader.</b> <b>Fish</b> were graded twice with the box and UAPB graders; a bar spacing of 1 (3) /(32) in was used to grade off small fish and a spacing of 1 (3) /(8) in to grade off large <b>fish.</b> Sock <b>grader</b> mesh size was 1 (3) /(8) in. Mean weights and lengths of the size-classes produced by grading (small, medium, and large) were compared to those of the initial population in each pond. Blood samples were collected from sampled fish, and serum was analyzed for creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities to assess fish injury levels. Each grader separated the initial population into distinct populations. Mean weight and TL of the medium size-class was significantly lower for the UAPB grader than for the box grader. The frequency distributions of the fish populations obtained from each grader differed significantly. Undergrade and overgrade error for the medium size-class did not differ significantly between the box and UAPB graders. Undergrade error averaged 5. 4 % for TL and 1. 6 % for individual weight; overgrade error averaged 7. 8 % for TL and 10. 3 % for weight. Serum CPK and LDH activities were highly variable, which prevented detection of significant treatment differences...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) {{identified}} {{a need for}} a small-scale, portable floating fish collection (PFFC) device to gather additional information on juvenile fish movement in Willamette Valley Project (WVP) reservoirs. This device was intended to provide a cost-effective means of safely obtaining juvenile fish in WVP reservoirs for use in research, monitoring and evaluation efforts as well as to gather information on the behavior of both tagged and run of river fish near and within a small floating surface collector. There are three planned deployments for the device: Lookout Point, Detroit and Cougar Reservoirs. Of these Cougar Reservoir represented the most challenging of the installations due to the large storage capacity provided for flood control and resulting wide range of reservoir water surface elevations. The facility design ultimately provides the USACE a device that can be broken down into components sized to allow safe and normal transport over the state highway system. The attraction flow can be varied from 20 to 140 cfs with hydraulic components that allow tuning of the flow to optimum hydraulic performance for each flow. The anchoring system is designed to accommodate up to a 200 ft variation in reservoir water surface, including rapid fluctuations. Features that provide separation and protection of various sized <b>fish</b> include a <b>grader</b> with adjustable bar spacing, shelter areas and the means to sort fish by way of a crowder and hopper system. Power for operating systems is provided via a submerged cable tied into station power. The cable also contains wiring {{that can be used to}} convey instrumentation and operational readings back to land based computer equipment. Once positioned, the winch/anchor system can be used to vary the orientation of the PFFC. With this system it is also possible to move the PFFC within the reservoirs to different locations by lifting the anchors and using an auxiliary craft to push the PFFC to a new location and then re-deploying the anchors...|$|R
