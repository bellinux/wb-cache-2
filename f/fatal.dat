5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{system of}} KOF '94 {{is similar to}} SNK's previous games like the <b>Fatal</b> Fury series, Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown. The game uses a four attack button configuration similar to <b>Fatal</b> Fury 2 and <b>Fatal</b> Fury Special, that consists of light punch, light kick, strong punch and strong kick. Like in <b>Fatal</b> Fury 2, specialized techniques are performed by pressing buttons in combination, allowing the player to dodge an opponent's attack or to launch a character's powerful knockdown attack. As with most other fighting games, each character has a set of basic, unique, and special moves that can be performed by the player with a specific series of joystick and button inputs.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The <b>fatal</b> injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the <b>fatal</b> injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high <b>fatal</b> injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Another {{common and}} {{potentially}} <b>fatal</b> complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening {{infection of the}} bowel.|$|E
5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will be <b>fatal.</b> In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs survive. In the US, firearms {{are the most common}} cause of <b>fatal</b> TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.|$|E
5|$|Bowfin with {{liver cancer}} and with <b>fatal</b> leukemia have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly <b>fatal</b> hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly <b>fatal</b> disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fatal</b> attacks {{attributed}} to the copper shark (bronze whaler) include the 2014 death of a swimmer in Tathra, New South Wales, Australia, and the 1976 death of a swimmer in Te Kaha, New Zealand. Three out of ten shark attacks in New Zealand are {{attributed to}} Copper sharks. Witnesses also attributed a <b>fatal</b> attack on September 2011 in Bunker Bay, Western Australia to a copper shark.|$|E
5|$|From 2014 to 2016, <b>fatal</b> rail {{fatalities}} were 227, 234 and 231; with trespassers, fatalities are 749 for 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Derbyshire Police {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} monitor motorcyclists using the pass, who are particularly {{at risk of being}} involved in a <b>fatal</b> accident.|$|E
5|$|Like many large, active sharks, {{this species}} adapts poorly to captivity; {{it tends to}} bump into the sides of its enclosure, and the {{resulting}} abrasions then become infected with often <b>fatal</b> consequences.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 1974, a Royal Air Force Phantom FGR2 was {{involved}} in a <b>fatal</b> collision with a civilian PA-25-235 Pawnee crop-sprayer over Norfolk, England.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2006, a {{memorial}} stone was unveiled in Sweden near {{the scene of}} the <b>fatal</b> crash. It is located by the parking lot to Gyllene Rasten.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>fatal</b> flight, 8,545 feet of {{photographic}} film were carried as cargo. Air Navigation Orders specified that {{a maximum of}} 3,000 feet {{of photographic}} film may be carried.|$|E
5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly <b>fatal</b> in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be <b>fatal.</b> The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be <b>fatal.</b> An example of a <b>fatal</b> genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E

5|$|The Miz {{returned}} as a Pro {{for the second}} season of NXT, to mentor Alex Riley, the only Pro to return. On the June 14 episode of Raw, The Miz defeated R-Truth, John Morrison, and Zack Ryder in a <b>fatal</b> four-way match to win the United States Championship for the second time, and successfully retained the championship against R-Truth at the <b>Fatal</b> 4-Way pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{was the fifth}} <b>fatal</b> accident with a Twin Otter in Norway and the fourth <b>fatal</b> accident by Widerøe in eleven years. The company's executive management met in Bodø {{the evening of the}} accident before chief executive officer Bård Mikkelsen and others traveled to Namsos to investigate the crash site of the third <b>fatal</b> accident since Mikkelsen started in his position in 1988. Widerøe stopped all advertisements in the period after the accident. Widerøe announced in November that they would accelerate the replacement of their Twin Otter and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft with new de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but denied that the accident influenced the decision and instead cited financial reasons. Widerøe's chief operating officer, Per-Helge Røbekk, announced in July 1994 that he would step down because of the strain of the three accidents.|$|E

5|$|The <b>fatal</b> shot severed {{the return}} oil line, and Koga's plane {{immediately}} began trailing oil. Koga reduced speed {{to keep the}} engine from seizing as long as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The <b>fatal</b> dose is about 10g, and several <b>fatal</b> intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|The {{poly-drug use}} of {{powerful}} depressant drugs poses {{the highest level}} of health concerns due to {{a significant increase in the}} likelihood of experiencing an overdose, which may cause <b>fatal</b> respiratory depression.|$|E

5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably <b>fatal,</b> two are not inherently <b>fatal</b> but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; <b>fatal</b> or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated with}} potentially <b>fatal</b> complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes <b>fatal</b> chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially <b>fatal</b> anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E

5|$|Von Kressenstein {{succeeded in}} {{withdrawing}} his battered force from a potentially <b>fatal</b> situation; both his advance to Romani and the withdrawal were remarkable achievements of planning, leadership, staff work and endurance.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause <b>fatal</b> overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While <b>fatal</b> overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
