Christine arrives and laments over her father's death. The Phantom tries to win her back by pretending to be her father's angel, but Raoul arrives and stops him.

5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March, Jesé {{returned}} to the Santiago Bernabéu {{for the first time}} ahead of Las Palmas' La Liga encounter with Real Madrid. During the build-up to the match, he revealed that he owed a debt to Real Madrid for welcoming him at the club and blamed the cruciate ligament injury he suffered as the reason <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> becoming a star with them. He also defended his previous criticism of former manager José Mourinho, stating that he has no regrets over his actions. Jesé started in the match between the two sides which ultimately ended in a 3–3 draw. He scored his first goals for the club four days later, netting a brace in a 5−2 league win over Osasuna. The result was Jesé's first win with Las Palmas, after the club failed to record a victory in its previous five matches following his arrival. He ultimately made 16 appearances for the campaign, scoring three goals and registering an assist as the side dropped to end the season in fourteenth position. Upon the conclusion of Jesé's loan agreement, Las Palmas elected not to attempt to sign him permanently, with his poor overall performance, high salary demands and off-field behaviour ultimately contributing to the club's decision.|$|E

5|$|Paul's nephew, Daniel (Tim Phillipps), {{arrives in}} town and agrees to stay with him. Paul re-opens Charlie's and announces {{that it has been}} renamed The Waterhole, a name chosen by Kate before she died. After {{purchasing}} a painting from Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly), Paul learns from the police that its ownership is disputed. He asks Naomi for his money back, but she tells him she has spent it. Paul then asks Naomi to have sex with him, in exchange <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> pressing charges against her. Naomi blackmails Paul into dropping the charges. Paul and Mark join forces to find Kate's killer. Matt Turner (Josef Brown) informs Paul that Victor Cleary (Richard Sutherland), Gus's younger brother, has become a suspect in Kate's murder. Paul realises that he may be responsible for Kate's death. He buys a gun and meets with Victor who taunts Paul about killing Kate, before Matt and Mark arrive. Mark tackles Paul and Matt arrests Victor. Paul develops depression, knowing that his actions were responsible for Kate's death, and Terese tries to help him. After a public meltdown, Paul is suspended as mayor. He begins volunteering at Sonya's (Eve Morey) garden nursery, while Lucy also helps him overcome his grief.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with other}} Greek intellectuals, Posidonius favored Rome as the {{stabilizing}} {{power in a}} turbulent world. His connections to the Roman ruling class were <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> only politically important and sensible but were also important to his scientific research. His entry into government provided Posidonius with powerful connections to facilitate his travels to far away places, even beyond Roman control.|$|E
25|$|With his twentieth victory, he {{qualified}} for Germany's highest decoration for valor, the Prussian Pour le Mérite. He was nominated in early November. One of the extant photographs, a formal portrait, shows him wearing a Blue Max. However, {{there is no}} surviving evidence of its award. A number of nominees lost out on their award when the Kaiser resigned on 9 November, but his name is not recorded among them. However, {{this is the most}} likely explanation <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> receiving the medal he earned.|$|E

25|$|The faction fight resumed, and Essex and {{the younger}} Cecil each tried to {{diminish}} the other's influence by proposing the Irish appointment (and therefore removal from Court) {{of members of the}} opposing faction. Once the list of candidates was exhausted the Cecil faction named Essex as the only remaining option, and he felt bound to offer his services. On December 30 the Queen formally opted <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>not</b> merely as her deputy in Ireland but as Lord Lieutenant, and Essex announced his determination to beat O'Neill in the field.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of October Carafa broke his {{alliance}} with Sforza, as Philip II decided to return the fiefdom Palli Colonnie Marcantonio and ordered the Spanish cardinals to prevent the selection of Gonzaga at all costs. Cardinal d'Este allied himself with Carafa, hoping to win the election, but the vote on 1 December showed this was in vain, with many who had promised to vote <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> doing so. The French also – without much success – tried to get cardinals Tournon and Suau elected.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Allan Border {{threatened}} to resign if Australia {{did not win}} the four game One Day International series and then saw New Zealand go 2-0 up. Fortunately Australia won {{the last two games}} and Matthews was Man of the Match in the Fourth ODI at Eden Park, where he made 54, took 9-1-33-3 and held onto three catches in Australia's 44 run win. This allowed Border to announce that the team had improved enough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> to resign, much to the advantage of Australian cricket.|$|E

25|$|Baden-Powell {{returned}} to Africa in 1896, {{and served in}} the Second Matabele War, in the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo. This was a formative experience <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> only because he commanded reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in the Matopos Hills, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced Baden-Powell to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e. scoutcraft), and here that he wore his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief for the first time.|$|E

A few months before (over the summer), his brother and sister had both died, so Morin had asked Air France if it was possible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> to fly during the actual Christmas celebrations, but they had refused his request... so he went to work on the flight feeling very reluctant, because he had wanted to be with his parents and family.|$|E

However, when Kirito's true identity is revealed, she is heartbroken {{and the two of them}} have an awkward exchange in the real world where Sugu reveals her feelings <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Not</b> knowing how to respond or comfort her, Kazuto tells her he will be waiting for her in game. When they meet up they engage in a fight which culminates with both of them letting down their guard expecting the other one to kill them, however that only leads to them hugging and apologizing to each other. Leafa lets go of her feelings for Kirito and after pulling herself together she helps him rescue Asuna from the top of the world tree. She regularly plays ALO together with Kirito, Asuna, Silica, Klein and the rest of their group. Leafa, Lisbeth and Silica also feature as protagonists in the spin-off manga series Sword Art Online: Girls' Ops, where they form a team with Kirito away on a study program and Asuna tied up in family affairs.|$|E

500|$|There {{are other}} {{possibilities}} beyond madness or religious fervor {{that may have}} led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> to cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and {{had nothing to do with}} a mental imbalance. However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank. Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's [...] "religious fervor" [...] tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated. Smart's own testimony that he [...] "blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of Green Cloth, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness. If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for [...] "frenzy" [...] at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.|$|E
