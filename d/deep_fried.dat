5|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>frying</b> (also {{referred}} to as <b>deep</b> fat <b>frying)</b> is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. <b>Deep</b> <b>frying</b> may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. <b>Deep</b> <b>frying</b> is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|R

5000|$|Although the nouns [...] "deep-fried", [...] "deep-frying", and {{the verb}} [...] "deep-fry" [...] were not {{documented}} until 1916, 1932, and 1933 (respectively); {{the practice of}} <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> food has been around much longer. One of the earliest known practices of <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> came from the Egyptians in the 5th millennium BCE. Later developments included the Greeks <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> food in olive oil in the 5th century BCE. In the 1st century CE, a Roman cookbook, Apicius, appears to list the ancient Romans' first use of <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> spread {{to other parts of}} Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century. The <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> of food in Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century. Evidence of potato frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.|$|R

5|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>frying</b> {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} <b>deep</b> <b>fry</b> them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>frying</b> {{is another}} oil based cooking {{technique}} {{that is similar}} to pan <b>frying.</b> However, in <b>deep</b> <b>frying,</b> the entire piece of food is submerged in the oil.

5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, <b>deep</b> <b>fried,</b> or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} <b>deep</b> <b>fried</b> at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles.

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been <b>deep</b> <b>fried</b> was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages.

Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E
