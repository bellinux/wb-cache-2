It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Crazy Horse. And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' I {{just thought it was}} the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé was trying to be [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel Custer was {{an outspoken}} Democrat who taught his {{children}} politics and toughness {{at an early}} age. In a February 3, 1887 letter to his son's widow, Libby, he related an incident [...] "when Autie [...] was about four years old. He {{had to have a}} tooth drawn, [...] and he was very much afraid of blood. When <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He pulled it out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him." ...|$|E

At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E

[...] "My father is tired, he will {{lie down on}} the sledge with a bearskin round <b>him,</b> while <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the igloes of my people.

6000|$|... "Mr. Moulder, that's an {{objectionable}} word," [...] said Mrs. Smiley. [...] "If John Kenneby {{is the man}} <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be,--and who's a {{right to}} speak if I haven't, seeing that I am going to commit myself for this world into his hands?"--and Mrs. Smiley, as she spoke, simpered, and looked down with averted head on the fulness of her Irish tabinet--"if he's the man that <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be, he won't say on this thrilling occasion {{no more than the}} truth, nor yet no less. Now that isn't gammon--if I know what gammon is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do, and pray, pray {{take care}} of that black horse's legs. He's turning out more of a horse than <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be, and I should be sorry to see him injured. Where have you been to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Know him!' {{returned}} the locksmith. 'I didn't know him--how could I? I {{had never seen}} him, often as I had heard and spoken of him. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Mrs Rudge's; and she no sooner saw him than the truth came out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fault on my part! Of {{course there}} has been fault on my part. No one can make any mistake without fault to some extent. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a man of sense, {{and he is a}} fool. Go to Naples indeed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Tom, if Mr. Ford {{prove to}} be the Ford <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be, I'll {{undertake}} that you shall see through him, and be heartily ashamed of yourself. Give me back the letter,--you do not deserve to have it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'He is too young; <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Hellingsley, and he {{lost his}} head on the third day. I {{entrusted}} the soufflées to him, and, but for the most desperate personal exertions, all would have been lost. It was an affair of the bridge of Areola.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked all}} the way back with me, and I was frightened to see how tired he looked. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Long for the {{refreshment}} she loved to give, and begged for the pony for him to ride home on, and a boy to fetch it back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} are right," [...] {{returned}} his older brother. [...] "Evidently Waltham is a meaner fellow than <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be.

6000|$|... "Then, {{if he is}} the man <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be, {{that answer}} will go for nothing. Of course he knew all that before he came here.

60|$|All {{this while}} this was indeed but {{a copy of}} my countenance; for, as my {{circumstances}} would not admit of my stay in London, at least not so as to appear publicly, I resolved, if <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> live remote in the country, or go out of England with him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I call it dam clumsy from {{beginning}} to end;--dam clumsy. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a different man, and I feel more than half ashamed of myself because I trusted such a fellow.

6000|$|... "Well, it {{was quite}} a simple process. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> my own room, had a good bed made for him, dressed his wounds, and tended him myself, until he got fairly on his feet again. And, in process of time, I had free papers made out for him, and told him he might go where he liked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{garden is}} insufferable, this morning." [...] Saying those words, she fanned herself with her handkerchief, and noticed Geoffrey's {{presence}} {{in the room with}} a look of very thinly-concealed annoyance at the discovery.

"He spoke {{throughout}} in an exoteric vein," [...] {{said the}} grey-headed gentleman, [...] "and I apprehend {{was not very}} sure of his audience; but <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> mean, indeed it was {{the gist of the}} speech, that if you wished for a time to retain your political power, you could only effect your purpose by securing for the people greater social felicity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he hadn't come up there," [...] said Toby, [...] "I'd {{never known}} how lonesome he was, an' I'd gone right on havin' {{a good time}} without ever once thinkin' of him. An' if he hadn't come up there, perhaps he wouldn't got hurt, an' it seems almost as if I'd done it to him, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the circus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he is {{a greater}} scoundrel than <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be, or else a more utter fool.

5000|$|... "At {{the foot}} of the street was an inn where I entered to eat, and finding there another man- <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have been a shopkeeper- I {{determined}} to talk politics, and began as follows: 'Have you any anti-Semitism in your town?' 'It is not my town,' he said, 'but there is anti-Semitism. It flourishes.' 'Why then?' I asked. 'How many Jews have you in your town?' He said there were seven.|$|R
5000|$|Lamer's dissent {{prompted}} the then-Chief Justice, Roland Ritchie, to offer this concise summary {{as to the}} practical implications of a primacy clause being taken at face value—that is, when a primacy clause is not simply ignored by the courts: [...] "Laskin characterizes the Canadian Bill of Rights as a “quasi constitutional instrument” by which <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> mean that its provisions are to be construed and applied {{as if they were}} constitutional provisions...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he's {{a gentleman}} of his word, as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be," [...] said Mrs. Ray, [...] "he'll {{have a great}} call to show himself.
