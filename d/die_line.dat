This method has drawn lessons from the <b>die</b> <b>line</b> design of airplane is used to parametric numerical modeling for the lifting body, and extract the characterization of shape parameters as design variables, a combination of lifting body reentry vehicle aerodynamic conditions, aerodynamic heating, volumetric Rate and the stability of performance.

40|$|The work on soybean {{breeding}} {{conducted at}} the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad, results {{each year in the}} development of a number of new soybean lines that are tested in both Varietal Commission trials and in a macrotrial network which covers all important regions of soybean growing in the country. The purpose of die latter network was to test the reaction of new material to different agroecological conditions, so that most suitable variety can be recommended for each region. Adaptability and stability of genotypes were measured using genotype-yield regression coefficient related to the average yield of all genotypes in the locations investigated over three years. Growing conditions were different over the years, so that the investigated genotypes showed different stability levels, because mean value of all genotypes was used as standard, and, by definition, stability of the genotype applies only in relation to die other genotypes tested. However, <b>die</b> <b>line</b> NS-L- 330219 showed stability above the average (b<l) in each of the three years, while it achieved highest yields in two of die three years. ...|$|E

40|$|Extrusion is a {{continuous}} solid state deformation process which {{is widely used}} in the aluminium industry. The demand for aluminium extrudates are growing and extruders are pressurized to extrude products {{as fast as possible}} without lowering the quality of the product. Important extrusion parameters and conditions are exit temperature, extrusion speed and alloy composition. It is widely accepted in extrusion industry that extrusion surface defects increase when the extrusion speed and exit temperature are increased for a constant alloy. One of the major surface defects is the so-called die pick-up and it is presently uncertain if increase with extrusion speed (from a low 25 m/min) would result in an increase of the number of die pick-up defect. Die pick-up appears like a scratch mark or comet {{on the surface of the}} extrudate which damages the appearance. Previous research suggests that second phase particles, eutectic reactions (555 °C - 600 °C), extrusion process conditions and die conditions may influence the cause of die pick-up. However the influencing factors for die pick-up are not well established. The research started by determining the lowest melting temperature for AA 6060 alloy as this temperature limit the highest temperature above which incipient melting starts. This temperature corresponds to the eutectic melting temperature for AA 6060 alloy. Eutectic melting was only detected above 610 °C and therefore the exit temperature could be increased to a maximum of 610 °C. For an AA 6 xxx alloy system the lowest melting temperature is 555 °C if Mg 2 Si and excess silicon were present. However as Mg 2 Si may have fully dissolved into the solid solution, no reaction can take place. A preliminary investigation was conducted to study the characteristics of the newly installed extrusion control and monitoring system. Through this study the relationship between the set extrusion speed and the actual extrusion speed was established. It was found that the actual extrusion speed was lower than the set extrusion speed and was further complicated by the capacity limit of the extrusion pressure. Exit temperature measurements were accurate, however it was measured about 1 m away from the die exit. Experiments were carried out to estimate the exit temperature drop and hence the exit temperature measurements were corrected accordingly. Thus, the aim of the present research was to establish the relationship between die pick-up and extrusion conditions (extrusion speed, exit temperature and die condition) and to propose the likely formation mechanism for die pick-up. In this research AA 6060 alloy was used and was extruded at 25 m/min, 30 m/min, 35 m/min, 40 m/min and 45 m/min. The exit temperature was found to increases from 542 °C to 567 °C. Three types of die pick-up was identified which were named as normal pick-up, <b>die</b> <b>line</b> pick-up and lump pick-up. Normal pick-up occurred regardless of the extrusion speed and exit temperature; however the amount of normal pick-up did not increase when the extrusion speed was increased. <b>Die</b> <b>line</b> pick-up occurred when the extrusion speed was 45 m/min and appeared only on the die lines. Lump pick-up is not significant since it was very rare. AA 6060 (0. 4 %Mg and 0. 5 %Si) alloy has about 0. 27 % excess silicon and therefore at 555 °C, Mg 2 Si particles react with aluminium and excess silicon to form liquid. However normal pick-up and <b>die</b> <b>line</b> pick-up still occurred at temperatures lower and higher than 555 °C and therefore it confirms that eutectic reactions do not influence formation of pick-up. Therefore die pick-up is most likely to be caused due to a mechanical process rather than a metallurgical process...|$|E
