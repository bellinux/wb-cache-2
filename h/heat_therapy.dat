5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of <b>heat</b> <b>therapy</b> for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness and budget {{impact of a}} new <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy</b> for low back pain compared to paracetamol and ibuprofen {{from the perspective of}} the UK National Health Service (NHS). MethodsWe evaluated cost-effectiveness using data from a phase III trial comparing the three therapies in 371 patients aged 18 to 55 years presenting with acute uncomplicated low back pain. The primary effectiveness measure used was successful treatment, defined as both clinically meaningful pain relief and clinically meaningful reduction in disability. We conducted a simple evaluation using NHS prescription costs and a modeled extrapolation including the costs of further treatment and consultations for patients treated unsuccessfully or with adverse events. Uncertainty was addressed using nonparametric bootstrapping and sensitivity analyses. ResultsSuccessful treatment was reported by 57 % of patients treated with <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy,</b> 26 % treated with paracetamol and 18 % treated with ibuprofen (P < 0. 05 for heat wrap vs. both other groups). NHS prescription cost per patient was estimated to be £ 1. 35 for <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy,</b> £ 0. 26 for paracetamol, and £ 0. 28 for ibuprofen and cost per successful treatment was £ 3. 52 for <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy</b> compared to paracetamol, and £ 2. 72 compared to ibuprofen. In the modeled extrapolation, NHS cost per patient was £ 27. 77 for <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy,</b> £ 34. 20 for paracetamol, and £ 36. 04 for ibuprofen. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the findings were robust to plausible changes in data and assumptions. ConclusionsEconomic evaluation of this study suggests that the NHS cost of introducing <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy</b> in place of oral analgesics would be modest and <b>heat</b> wrap <b>therapy</b> might potentially reduce the total cost of managing episodes of lower back pain...|$|R
40|$|Envenomation by marine creatures is common. As {{more people}} dive and snorkel for leisure, the {{incidence}} of envenomation injuries presenting to emergency departments has increased. Although most serious envenomations occur in the temperate or tropical waters of the Indo‐Pacific region, North American and European waters also provide a habitat for many stinging creatures. Marine envenomations can be classified as either surface stings or puncture wounds. Antivenom is available for {{a limited number of}} specific marine creatures. Various other treatments such as vinegar, fig juice, boiled cactus, heated stones, hot urine, hot water, and ice have been proposed, although many have little scientific basis. The use of <b>heat</b> <b>therapies,</b> previously reserved for penetrating fish spine injuries, has been suggested as treatment for an increasing variety of marine envenomation.

Clinical studies do not support the popular belief that moist heat is more effective than dry heat. Moist heat results in the perception that the tissue is heated more deeply.

40|$|In general, salvage EMIR after {{radiotherapy}} (RT) {{is regarded}} as contra- indicated in esophageal cancer. We report here three cases of mucosal esophageal cancer found within the irradiated field of previous RT and treated successfu 11 y with EMR and local <b>heating</b> <b>therapy.</b> Case 1, a 73 -year-old man, was diagnosed with operable squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the esophagus (T 1 bN 0 M 0 : stage I). We performed radical radiotherapy (RT) of 70 Gy and the responses of these tumors were complete response (CR). Twenty-four months after RT, we found metachronous mucosal esophageal cancer within the irradiated field. Case 2, a 57 -year-old man, was diagnosed with SCCs of the esophagus (T 1 aN 0 M 0 : stage 0). We tried to perform endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for the tumors, but could not resect them completely. Then, we performed additional RT of 60 Gy for the residual tumors. The tumor responses were CR. Twenty months after RT, we found recurrent mucosal esophageal cancer. Case 3, an 81 -year-old man, was diagnosed with SCC of the esophagus (T 1 bN 0 M 0 : stage I). We performed radical RT of 60 Gy because of his advanced age, and the tumor response was CR. But 6 months after RT, we found recurrent mucosal esophageal cancer. For these mmors, we performed EMR and local <b>heating</b> <b>therapy.</b> In conclusion, these endoscopic treatments {{may be useful in}} patients with mucosal esophageal cancer within the irradiated field...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Deep <b>heating</b> <b>therapy</b> (DHT) {{has shown}} to improve pain and {{function}} {{in patients with}} knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the short term. Benefits of superficial <b>heating</b> <b>therapy</b> (SHT) are controversial. Long-term effects of both heating modalities {{have not yet been}} investigated. AIM. To compare the effects of DHT and SHT in patients with symptomatic knee OA, and to determine the DESIGN: Double-blind randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of Geriatrics and Physiatrics, University Hospital. POPULATION: Fifty-four patients with radiologically established diagnosis of moderate knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III) and pain lasting for at least three weeks. METHODS: DHT: local microwave diathermy (three 30 -min sessions a week for four weeks); SHT: application of hot packs (three 30 -min sessions a week for four weeks). Primary outcome measure: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) index for the assessment of joint pain, stiffness and physical function limitations. Secondary outcome measures: British Medical Research Council (BMRC) rating scale for the evaluation of muscle strength, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment. Follow up: 24 weeks for all outcome measures; 12 months for the primary outcome. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses showed a treatment effect in favor of DHT for all outcome measures. No clinically relevant changes were observed in the SHT group. Benefits of DHT were maintained over 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: DHT via localized microwave diathermy improves pain, muscle strength and physical function in patients affected by knee OA, with benefits maintained over the long term. No clinically relevant improvements were observed in patients who underwent SHT. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: DHT via microwave diathermy delivered three times a week for four weeks significantly improves pain and function in patients affected by moderate knee OA, with benefits retained for at least 12 months. No clinically relevant changes are observed in knee OA patients treated with SHT...|$|R

30|$|Non-contact {{radiant heat}} {{bandages}} {{have also been}} tested as a potential aid in wound healing. A non-contact radiant heat bandage consists of a power supply and a heating element, attached to two flaps of polymeric film.

Studies have been conducted using Ovine Staphylococcus Aureus dermal infections as the experimental model. The use of local radiant heat {{had the effect of}} controlling the spread of infection and promoting wound healing (Lee et al. 2000).
