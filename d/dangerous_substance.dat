Also, arrangements must be in place to ensure adequate ventilation so that pressure build-up does not rupture the packaging.

25|$|The {{driver of}} the car Barry crashed into, Gustavo Castillo Gutierrez (born June 28, 1988), was arrested on {{criminal}} complaints of manslaughter, causing an accident while operating a vehicle without a driver's license, and making an illegal U-turn. He was also charged with possession of a controlled <b>dangerous</b> <b>substance</b> when jailers found a one-half gram bag of cocaine in Gutierrez's possession. Gutierrez was placed on an immigration hold at the Oklahoma County Jail until his legal status in the United States was determined, prohibiting him from being released {{even if he is}} able to post a set $18,500 bond. Gutierrez was formally arraigned on the multiple complaints on June 22, appearing before a judge via video link from the jail facility; a court date will be set for Gutierrez upon filing of charges against him. Gutierrez was deported from the United States thrice before this fatal accident. A public memorial service for Barry was held on June 26, 2015 at Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma City.|$|E
500|$|In a key {{episode in}} the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's {{violation}} is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks {{to have sex with}} Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and <b>dangerous</b> <b>substance,</b> akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in [...] "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result [...] "gives birth" [...] to the disk. In [...] "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> by rail. The transport follows the instructions of international legal regulation which is called Regulations Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID). The Regulations is the main document for transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> in the CR and also in other forty contractual countries which accepted RID's conditions. <b>Dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> are transported a lot and the increase of transported substances {{in the future is}} predictable. The theoretical part of the bachelor thesis contains an enumeration of international and internal legal regulations which are related to problems of transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances.</b> The theoretical part also describes risks of <b>dangerous</b> chemical <b>substances</b> and mixtures and the labelling of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> according to RID. The Regulations includes the description of particular categories of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances,</b> the characteristic of substances and the pattern which is used on the precautionary sign. All the means of transport which are used for transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> are labelled according to UN system. This precautionary labelling must be on all the wagons. The important section of the theoretical part is the chapter focuses on activities and duties of safety advisers. The end of the theoretical part is the chapter about treatment with <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> which includes packaging, loading and unloading. These goals were determined for processing of this thesis: To map and to describe the transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> from loading to unloading. To evaluate how safety the transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> by rail is. To evaluate preparedness of fire and rescue services for possible extraordinary events connected with leakage of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> during the transport by rail. Thanks to analysis of available literary sources and corresponding legal regulations was discovered that European regulations and international agreements are successfully accepted into legal regulations of the CR. For fulfilment of goals and for answer a research question, it was necessary to make qualitative research via prepared questionnaires. The questionnaire was created from sixteen open questions. These questions were aimed at safety advisers from different companies in the CR. The condition was: The companies have to deal with cargo transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> by rail according to RID. The questionnaire was mainly focused on duties and training of safety advisers, on the transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> by rail and their quantity, on the description of activities during loading and unloading, on activities of employees and fire and rescue services during the extraordinary events connected with leakage of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances.</b> It is also focused on their own evaluation how safety the transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> by rail is. From the five addressed companies even four safety advisers were willing to cooperate and to contribute to creation of this bachelor thesis. They were willing to cooperate despite their workload. The goals were fulfilled thanks to gained data from the questionnaires. The research question was also answered. It was discovered that the transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> by rail is, according to specialists, safe for all the time during the treatment with <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances.</b> The most <b>dangerous</b> thing is the human failure during the loading and unloading processes. The fire and rescue services intervene during the leakage of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> which happens in the course of transport. The fire and rescue services cooperate with safety advisers and they solve the actual extraordinary event. Their preparedness is on the high level. It is because of regular training where it is simulated the leakage of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> according to inner emergency plan. Finally, some of the railway transit corridors for the regular transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>substances</b> were mapped...|$|R
2500|$|The {{process of}} taking {{hydrogen}} sulphide {{out of a}} gas stream is called [...] "sweetening" [...] the gas. The Union Gas Company of Toronto built Canada's first sweetening plant in 1924 at Port Alma, Ontario, to scrub Tillbury gas. Hydrogen sulphide is a <b>dangerous</b> <b>substance</b> which at low concentrations has an obnoxious rotten egg smell. This odour annoyed Union's customers and prompted it to build the Port Alma plant. It removed hydrogen sulphide by exposing the sour gas to dissolved soda ash. Although previously used on coal gas, the application at the Port Alma plant {{was the first time}} this process sweetened natural gas.|$|E
