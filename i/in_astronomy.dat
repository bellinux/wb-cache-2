5|$|Concern for {{the future}} of {{civilisation}} prompted him to install fivekilowatts of photovoltaic cells (for solar energy) at his house.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>astronomy,</b> constellations {{named after}} {{arthropods}} include the zodiacal Scorpius, the scorpion, and Musca, the fly, {{also known as}} Apis, the bee, in the deep southern sky. Musca, the only recognised insect constellation, was named by Petrus Plancius in 1597.|$|E
5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She earned her bachelor's degree <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> in 1948, the only graduate <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position {{as a graduate student}} at Cornell University.|$|E
50|$|Babylonian {{astronomy}} was {{the basis}} for much of what was done <b>in</b> ancient Greek <b>astronomy,</b> <b>in</b> classical Indian <b>astronomy,</b> <b>in</b> Sasanian, Byzantine and Syrian <b>astronomy,</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>in</b> the medieval Islamic world, and in Central Asian and Western European astronomy.Neo-Babylonian astronomy can thus be considered the direct predecessor of much of ancient Greek mathematics and <b>astronomy,</b> which <b>in</b> turn is the historical predecessor of the European (Western) scientific revolution.|$|R

50|$|Problems with Ptolemy's {{system were}} well {{recognized}} <b>in</b> medieval <b>astronomy,</b> {{and an increasing}} effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period {{eventually led to the}} Copernican heliocentrism developed <b>in</b> Renaissance <b>astronomy.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some widely {{accepted}} and studied theories and models <b>in</b> <b>astronomy,</b> now {{included in the}} Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, Cosmic inflation, dark matter, and fundamental theories of physics.|$|E
5|$|The Coopers {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. in 1938, where 10-year-old Vera {{developed}} an interest <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> watching the stars from her window. She built a crude telescope out of cardboard with her father, {{and began to}} observe and track meteors. She attended Coolidge Senior High School, graduating in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Theorists <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{endeavor}} to create theoretical models {{and from the}} results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Non-SI units whose {{values in}} SI units must be {{obtained}} experimentally (Table 7). This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{such as the}} dalton, the electron mass, the electron volt, the astronomical unit, the solar mass, {{and a number of}} other units of measure that are well-established, but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields <b>in</b> <b>astronomy,</b> and in all of science, is the {{measurement}} of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of {{the positions of the}} Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit {{could turn into a}} scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work <b>in</b> <b>astronomy,</b> mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits {{for the good of the}} community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> fit this ideal.|$|E
50|$|Filar {{micrometers}} {{are little}} used <b>in</b> modern <b>astronomy,</b> having {{been replaced by}} digital photographic techniques where digital pixels provide a precise reference for image distance.

50|$|Parenago then {{assumed a}} post at Moscow University as reader <b>in</b> stellar <b>astronomy,</b> {{becoming}} {{the first person to}} teach a lecture course on the subject of galactic <b>astronomy</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union in 1934.

She then traveled in America and in Europe, during which time she lost her hearing.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{advances}} <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{came about}} {{with the introduction of}} new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but {{with a wide range of}} temperatures, masses, and sizes.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{composed}} primarily {{of the chemical}} elements hydrogen and helium; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% {{of the mass of}} the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements, called metals <b>in</b> <b>astronomy,</b> account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars <b>in</b> <b>astronomy,</b> or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of its}} history, astrology was {{considered}} a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, new scientific concepts <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing problem <b>in</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{has been}} the {{identification}} of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer than a century. Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source. The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor was a white dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
