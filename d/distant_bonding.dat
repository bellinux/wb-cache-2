40|$|We {{investigate}} dynamical {{aspects of}} the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLS) in finite lattices. Starting from a periodic chain with nearest neighbor interactions, we insert randomly links connecting distant pairs of sites across the lattice. Using localized initial conditions {{we focus on the}} time averaged probability of occupation of the initial site {{as a function of the}} degree of complexity of the lattice and nonlinearity. We observe that selftrapping occurs at increasingly larger values of the nonlinearity parameter as the lattice connectivity increases, while close to the fully coupled network limit, localization becomes more preferred. For nonlinearity values above a certain threshold we find a reentrant localization transition, viz. localization when the number of long <b>distant</b> <b>bonds</b> is small followed by delocalization and enhanced transport at intermediate bond numbers while close to the fully connected limit localization reappears.

40|$|Several biologically active {{peptides}} {{contain a}} D amino acid in a well-defined position, which is position 2 in all peptide epimers isolated to date from vertebrates and also some from invertebrates. The detection of such D-residues by standard analytical techniques is challenging. In tandem mass spectrometric (MS) analysis, although fragment masses are {{the same for all}} stereoisomers, peak intensities are known to depend on chirality. Here, we observe that the effect of a D amino acid in the second N-terminal position on the fragmentation pattern in matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) strongly depends on the peptide sequence. Stereosensitive fragmentation (SF) is correlated to a neighborhood effect, but the D-residue also exerts an overall effect influencing <b>distant</b> <b>bonds.</b> In a fingerprint analysis, multiple peaks can thus serve to identify the chirality of a sample in short time and potentially high throughput. Problematic variations between individual spots could be successfully suppressed by cospotting deuterated analogues of the epimers. By identifying the [D-Leu 2] isomer of the predicted peptide GH- 2 (gene derived bombininH) in skin secretions of the toad Bombina orientalis, we demonstrated the analytical power of SF-MALDI-TOF/TOF measurements. In conclusion, SF-MALDI-TOF/TOF MS combines high sensitivity, versatility, and the ability to complement other methods...|$|R
40|$|The labile {{fraction}} of heavy metals in soils {{is the most}} important for toxicity for plants. Thus it is crucial to reduce this fraction in contamined soils to decrease the negative effect of heavy metals. In an experiment, the effects of two additives on the labile fractions of Cu, Mn and Zn were investigated in a soil contamined during long-term application. The additive used was the coal fly ash. The treated soil was further enriched with heavy metals and allowed to age at room temperature for 30 days. After this period, they were extracted plant-available (EDTA; HNO 3; CH 3 COOH) metal species. The addition of fly ash strongly reduced the plant-available of Mn for plants but to a lesser extent this applies to the plant-available of Cu and Zn for plants. By addition of 1 % of fly ash as well as 2 % of fly ash, the labile {{fraction of}} Cu, Mn and Zn were lowered by 6. 3, 145. 0 and 29. 7 mg?kg - 1, respectively. Moreover essential correlation between total Cu and Zn contents was stated in the soil with plant-available content of metals, with reference to both metals. Value of coefficients of correlation is attesting to it between the total and plant-available Cu and Zn contents which are respectively equal: R(Cu) = 0. 845, R(Mn) = 0. 864 and R(Zn) = 0. 872 for p = 99. 5 %. The results suggested that leading into the soil of the additional amount of fly ash can be an effective way of chemical remediation with reference to soils contaminated by Cu or Mn or Zn. Because he causes immobilization of examined heavy metals in the soil and in the process in the arrangement a—soil is limiting the availability of these metals plant and more <b>distant</b> <b>bonds</b> of the food chain...|$|R

For example, unexpected changes in monthly nonfarm payroll employment numbers cause large movements at short and medium maturities, but do not affect long-term interest rates. Inflation news affects the long end of the term structure.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the calculation of}} the similarities between pairs of substituents on ring systems. An R-group descriptor characterizes the distribution of some atom-based property, such as elemental type or partial atomic charge, at increasing numbers of <b>bonds</b> <b>distant</b> {{from the point of}} substitution on the parent ring. The similarity between a pair of descriptors is then calculated by a comparison of the corresponding property vectors. Experiments with the BIOSTER database demonstrate the ability of such similarity measures to discriminate between bioisosteric and nonbioisosteric functional groups. ...|$|R
40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization {{time-of-flight}} {{mass spectrometry}} (MALDI-TOF-MS) {{was used to}} demonstrate cross-linking of peptides induced by transglutaminase. The presence of ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide cross-link in the acid hydrolysate of the cross-linking reaction mixture was also demonstrated by MALDI-TOF-MS without prior separation. MALDI-TOF-MS quickly provided peptide mass maps after pro-nase digestion of the cross-linked peptide adduct, which enabled us to monitor the hydrolytic sequence. Pronase appears to preferentially hydrolyze peptide <b>bonds</b> <b>distant</b> from the cross-link before hydrolyzing peptide bonds around the cross-link.

40|$|Molecular Orbital Bond Index (MOBI) {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out on selected organolithium tetramers and hexamers, and on certain lithium 'ates, all of which had previously been shown to exhibit short Li ⋯ HC contacts in their solid-state structures. Species so examined comprised (MeLi) 4, (EtLi) 4 and their “dimerized” forms (to mimic the further association of these tetramers in the crystal), (Me 2 CHLi) 6 and (H 3 SiCH 2 Li) 6, [as models for (c-C 6 H 11 Li) 6 and (Me 3 SiCH 2 Li) 6, respectively], and (LiAlEt 4) n and (LiBMe 4) n, with n = 1, 2. The calculational results indicate that the short Li ⋯ HC distances observed reflect genuine three-centre interactions between lithium centres and CH bonds: thus, summed Li ⋯ H bond indices (measures of the electron density between the nuclei concerned) contribute significantly (44 → 14 %) to the total lithium valency, and concomitant weakening of the indices of involved CH bonds (0. 80 – 0. 90; cf. indices of <b>distant</b> CH <b>bonds,</b> ca 0. 95) is observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} system labels microbes and host debris for clearance. Degradation of surface-bound C 3 b is pivotal to direct immune responses and protect host cells. How the serine protease factor I (FI), assisted by regulators, cleaves either {{two or three}} <b>distant</b> peptide <b>bonds</b> in the CUB domain of C 3 b remains unclear. We present a crystal structure of C 3 b in complex with FI and regulator factor H (FH; domains 1 - 4 with 19 - 20). FI binds C 3 b-FH between FH domains 2 and 3 and a reoriented C 3 b C-terminal domain and docks onto the first scissile bond, while stabilizing its catalytic domain for proteolytic activity. One cleavage in C 3 b does not affect its overall structure, whereas two cleavages unfold CUB and dislodge the thioester-containing domain (TED), affecting binding of regulators and thereby determining the number of cleavages. These data explain how FI generates late-stage opsonins iC 3 b or C 3 dg in a context-dependent manner, to react to foreign, danger or healthy self signals...|$|R

Using this technique, long-range correlations between a proton and phosphorus {{that is up}} to 5 <b>bonds</b> <b>distant</b> are observed. Thus, the 3 ′-, 4 ′- and 5 ′-proton resonances can be traced ‘sequentially’ along the chain on the 2 D NMR chart. Application of this technique to the complete assignment of the sugar proton and phosphorus resonances for d(ApGpA) is reported.

40|$|Cysteine site-directed {{mutagenesis}} {{was used to}} create variants of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L 7 /L 12 that have single cysteine substitutions, at residues 63 or 89, located in different exposed loops {{in the structure of}} the globular C-terminal domain indicated by the crystallographic structure. That structure shows a possible dimer interaction in which the two sites of cysteine substitution appear to be too <b>distant</b> for disulfide <b>bond</b> formation. After mild oxidation in solution both of the overexpressed purified cysteine-substituted proteins formed interchain disulfide crosslinked dimers in high yield. Both crosslinked dimers were fully active in restoring activity in poly(U) -directed polyphenylalanine synthesis to ribosomal core particles depleted of wild-type L 7 /L 12. These results show that the two C-terminal domains have independent mobility. The activity of dimeric L 7 /L 12 does not require the independent movement of the two globular C-terminal domains in an L 7 /L 12 dimer; moreover, it appears independent of their mutual orientation when joined by crosslinking at the two loops. A third variant with a cysteine substitution at residue 33 near the junction between the alpha-helical N-terminal domain and the flexible hinge was prepared and tested. This protein was active in the protein synthesis assay in the reduced state. Oxidation produced the interchain crosslinked dimer in high yield, but this crosslinked dimer was inactive in polyphenylalanine synthesis. The inactivation was due to the inability of the Cys 33 -Cys 33 oxidized dimer to bind to the core particle...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to report on a novel phenomenon that occurs when resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (RMGICs) are bonded to moist human dentine. Methods. Dentine surfaces from extracted third molars were abraded with 180 -grit SiC paper. Ten teeth were prepared for each of the two RMGICs tested (Fuji II LC, GC Corp. and Photac-Fil Quick, 3 M ESPE). RMGIC buildups were made according to the manufacturers' instructions. After storage at 37 °C, 100 % humidity for 24 h, the bonded specimens were cut occlusogingivally into 0. 9 × 0. 9 mm beams. Dentine surfaces bonded with the two RMGICs were examined along the fractured RMGIC/dentine interfaces. Additional beams fractured within the RMGICS and at 3 mm away from the interfaces were used as controls. The fractured beams were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission-environmental SEM (FE-ESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results. SEM and FE-ESEM revealed numerous solid spherical bodies along the RMGIC/dentine interfaces. By contrast, no spherical bodies could be identified within the RMGIC fractured 3 mm <b>distant</b> from the <b>bonded</b> interface. TEM and energy dispersive X-ray analyses performed on carbon-coated ultrathin sections showed that these solid spherical bodies consisted of a thin aluminum and silicon-rich periphery and an amorphous hydrocarbon core within the air voids of the original resin matrix. Conclusion. The spherical bodies probably represent a continuation of GI reaction and poly(HEMA) hydrogel formation that results from water diffusion from the underlying moist dentine. Their existence provides evidence for the permeation of water through RMGIC/dentine interfaces. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
