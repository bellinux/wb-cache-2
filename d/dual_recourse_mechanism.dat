Two methodologies i. e. qualitative content analysis and the survey method were used. The study comprised two categories of respondents, rights holders (residents of Banda Parish) and duty bearers (representatives of institutions considered as having the mandate to promote RtF). Results show that: The RtF in Uganda can be inferred from objectives XIV and XXII of the 1995 Constitution, diets of rights holders seem inadequate and the level of child malnutrition seems unacceptably high. Additionally, there are no clear <b>recourse</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for violations of the RtF, rights holders seem grossly unaware of the RtF, hygiene and sanitation appears to be poor and access to tapped water is limited.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine two South Africa {{legislations}} dealing with over indebtedness of a consumer. It is clear that in terms of the South African law, section 129 (1) and 130 (3) of the National Credit Act provide that a creditor provider who wishes to enforce a debt under a credit agreement must first issue a section 129 (1) (a) notice to the consumer (the purpose of the notice is to notify the consumer of his/her arrears). On the other hand, the South African National Credit Act encourages the consumers to fulfil the financial obligations for which they are responsible. The second legislation to be examined which serve or appear to serve same purpose as the National Credit Act is the Insolvency Act. It therefore, postulated that the compulsory sequestration of a consumer in terms of the Insolvency Act would stand as an alternative remedy for a credit provider before she/he can have <b>recourse</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as debt review that are focused on satisfaction of the consumer’s financial obligation, in terms of the provisions of the National Credit Act.

40|$|AbstractAdverse {{weather is}} the {{dominant}} cause of delays in the National Airspace System (NAS). Since the future weather condition is only predictable with {{a certain degree of}} accuracy, managing traffic in the weather-affected airspace is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a geometric model to generate an optimal combination of ground delay and route choice to hedge against weather risk. The geometric recourse model (GRM) is a strategic Probabilistic Air Traffic Management (PATM) model that generates optimal route choice, incorporating route hedging and en-route recourse to respond to weather change: hedged routes are routes other than the nominal or the detour one, and recourse occurs when the weather restricted airspace becomes flyable and aircraft are re-routed to fly direct to the destination. Among several variations of the GRM, we focus on the hybrid <b>Dual</b> <b>Recourse</b> Model (DRM), which allows ground delay as well as route hedging and recourses, when the weather clearance time follows a uniform distribution. The formulation of the hybrid DRM involves two decision variables – ground delay and route choice – and four parameters: storm location, storm size, maximum storm duration time, and ground-airborne cost ratio. The objective function has two components: expected total ground delay cost and expected total airborne cost. We propose a solution algorithm that guarantees to find the global optimum of the hybrid-DRM. Based on the numerical analysis, we find that ground-holding is effective only when combined with the nominal route. Otherwise, it is optimal to fly on the route determined by the DRM without ground delay. We also find the formula of the threshold ground-airborne cost ratio, which we call the Critical Cost Ratio (CCR), that determines the efficacy of ground delay: the higher the CCR, the more effective the strategies involving ground delay. We conclude that both ground delay and route hedging should be considered together to produce the best ATM decisions...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in air transportation community to develop a routing decision model based on probabilistic characterization of severe weather. In the probabilistic air traffic management (PATM), decisions are made based on the stochastic weather information in the expected total cost sense. Probabilistic approach aims to enhance routing flexibility and reduce {{the risks associated with}} uncertainty of the future weather. In this research, a geometric model is adopted to generate optimal route choice when the future weather is stochastic. The geometric recourse model (GRM) is a strategic PATM model that incorporates route hedging and en-route recourse options to respond to weather change. Hedged routes are routes other than the nominal or detour route, and aircraft is re-routed to fly direct to the destination, which is called recourse, when the weather restricted airspace become flyable. Aircraft takes either the first recourse or the second recourse: The first recourse occurs when weather clears before aircraft reaches it flying on the initial route. The second recourse occurs when the aircraft is at the weather region. There are two variations of GRM: Single Recourse Model (SRM) with first <b>recourse</b> only and <b>Dual</b> <b>Recourse</b> Model (DRM) with both the first and second recourse options. When the weather clearance time follows a uniform distribution, SRM becomes convex with optimal route being either the detour or a hedged route. The DRM has a special property when the maximum storm duration time is less than the flight time to the tip of the storm on the detour route: it is always optimal to take the nominal route. The performance study is conducted by measuring the cost saving from either SRM or DRM. The result shows that there are cases with substantial cost saving, reaching nearly 30 % with DRM. The ground-airborne hybrid model is an extension of the GRM, where both ground holding as well as route hedging are considered. The optimal combination of ground delay and route choice is determined by weather characteristics as well as the ground-airborne cost ratio. The numerical analysis reveals that whenever ground delay is required, the optimal route choice is the nominal one, while a non-nominal route is optimal when the ground delay is zero. There exists a unique critical cost ratio associated with given weather condition, which determines whether ground holding is optimal or not...|$|R

Dilution is modeled as a linear function of time and outcome of accessing memories by their temporal organization.

40|$|Much of {{the natural}} {{resources}} in Latin America can be found in lands inhabited by the Indigenous peoples. Exploration and extraction of these resources {{have a significant impact on}} the lives of these peoples. Yet, despite the presence of international covenants such as International Labor Organization’s Convention 169 on free, prior and informed consent or consultation, the opinions and views of the Indigenous peoples are often ignored by the Latin American States in decisions regarding the exploitation of natural resources. This deliberate neglect has had serious negative consequences for the Indigenous populations. The purpose of this research paper is to analyse the differential experiences of consultations among Indigenous groups, the State and extractive industries in three Latin American countries – Bolivia, Peru and Guatemala. The specific research question it seeks to answer is: What lessons can we learn from previous consultation experiences and other alternative models and literature on negotiations that can be used by the Indigenous peoples in Bolivia, Peru and Guatemala to ensure that the extractive processes result in benefits for them? These alternative models included the Canadian Indigenous community experiences, the deliberative democracy theory, the principles in business negotiations and negotiating guidelines for multinational corporations and international organizations in dealing with Indigenous peoples. An analysis of sample consultation experiences in extractive industries in the three countries suggest that the practices that produced a positive outcome for the Indigenous groups are those that allowed the Indigenous groups to exercise the right of self-determination, afforded them decision making powers, and ensured that their voices were heard. However, in contrast to the Canadian experience, the Latin American situation was marked by a more unequal power relationship between the Indigenous groups and the governments. Achieving the Canadian model of legislated mandates and legally binding <b>recourse</b> <b>mechanisms</b> would be a long-term aspirational endeavour for the Indigenous populations in Latin America. In the meanwhile, these Indigenous groups could better their negotiating positions and make their voices count by finding influential allies that can sway governments and public sentiment including international and domestic civil society organizations as well as environmental groups. Involving the media in order to create a transparent consultation process can also push extractive industries and government departments to respect Indigenous rights and customs.

The prescription involves only minor modifications of typical meson-exchange models, so that coupling constants and cut-off masses in the models are not greatly affected. Calculations of s-wave ππ scattering amplitudes in nuclear matter for two models are compared with those for similar models which violate the chiral constraint. While the prescription tends to suppress the accumulation of the near sub-threshold strength of the ππ interaction, an earlier conjecture that amplitudes which satisfy chiral constraints will not exhibit an instability towards ππ s−wave pair condensation appears to be incorrect.

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of crystallinity on the ductile–brittle transition in a bulk lanthanum-based metallic glass was investigated. The degree of crystallization in the metallic glass, which was processed through the arc-melting and water-quenching route, was systematically altered by varying the annealing time above the glass transition temperature. The resulting amorphous/crystalline microstructures {{were characterized by}} XRD, DSC, and TEM techniques. Instrumented impact test results show a significant decrease, by 090 %, in impact toughness {{with the introduction of}} a small percentage of crystallinity. This decrease in toughness was also associated with a distinct change in fracture morphology, from a ductile vein-type fracture in the bulk glass to intergranular cleavage fracture in the crystalline material. The observed fracture transition was rationalized by <b>recourse</b> to the <b>mechanism</b> of stress relaxation due to viscous flow. For this purpose, variations in elastic modulus and dynamic viscosity with respect to the crystallinity were measured using a dynamic mechanical analyzer.

40|$|Inconsistencies in the {{empirical}} support for balance theory are often explained by <b>recourse</b> to competing <b>mechanisms</b> that reduce the total degree of balance in the network. These mechanisms (such as differential popularity and subgroup hostility) may depend on exogenous properties of the nodes. This paper offers an alternative explanation for the departure of networks from global balance, according to which the myopic nature of sign adjustment in accordance with a pressure for local balance may reduce the global degree of balance and impede the formation of groups, whereas competing mechanisms that rely on exogenous node properties (e. g., homophily) facilitate these processes. The paper describes a set of simulations designed to study the evolution of complete signed networks under a local sign-change regime, induced by structural balance, homophily and heterophobia. Tolerance for local violation of balance and homophily is allowed to vary with a consequent impact upon the global degree of balance and group formation processes. We find {{the conditions under which}} the pressure towards local homophily and balance operate against each other culminating in a (locally) dynamic yet (globally) stationary state in which homophily adjusts towards group formation and balance undermines this process...|$|R

Optical Burst Switching is a {{promising}} bufferless DWDM switching technology that can potentially provide high wavelength utilization. Quality of Service support {{has become an}} important issue in OBS networks. There are two models to guarantee QoS in OBS networks. Those are relative QoS guarantee and absolute QoS guarantee. Most existing schemes are based on relative QoS model and in those models the service levels can be defined relative to the service requirements of another class of traffic. In absolute QoS model it provides a bound for loss probability of the guaranteed traffic. This kind of hard guarantee is essential to support applications with bandwidth constraints. Further efficient admission control and <b>recourse</b> provisioning <b>mechanisms</b> will enhance the service of absolute QoS model to guarantee the service requirements in the OBS networks. Early dropping mechanism is proposed to maintain the dropping probability in Absolute QoS model in OBS networks. Due to the bufferless nature of the OBS core nodes, the early dropping mechanism computes the intentional dropping probability based on measured, online loss probability. In early dropping mechanism it can be simply implemented by using a threshold value which is responsible to maintain the maximum acceptable loss probability. But in this mechanism the lower priority class of traffic suffers from high loss probability when higher priority Glasses exceed its threshold vales of loss probability. Early dropping by Span mechanism introduces a span of acceptable loss probabilities rather than using one threshold value andthis mechanism has improved QoS guarantee in higher priority classes of traffic while reducing the loss probability of lower priority classes as well. Further the performance of this mechanism can be applied in a dynamic wave length assigning network in order to guarantee the absolute QoS with efficient recourse provisionin...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{rational}} for selfish {{individuals to}} cooperate? The conventional answer based on analysis of games {{such as the}} Prisoners Dilemma (PD) {{is that it is}} not, even though mutual cooperation results in a better outcome for all. This incompatibility between individual rationality and collective benefit {{lies at the heart of}} questions about the evolution of cooperation, as illustrated by PD and similar games. Here, we argue that this apparent incompatibility is due to an inconsistency in the standard Nash framework for analyzing non-cooperative games and propose a new paradigm, that of the co-action equilibrium. As in the Nash solution, agents know that others are just as rational as them and taking this into account leads them to realize that others will independently adopt the same strategy, in contrast to the idea of unilateral deviation central to Nash equilibrium thinking. Co-action equilibrium results in better collective outcomes for games representing social dilemmas, with relatively "nicer" strategies being chosen by rational selfish individuals. In particular, the dilemma of PD gets resolved within this framework, suggesting that cooperation can evolve in nature as the rational outcome even for selfish agents, without having to take <b>recourse</b> to additional <b>mechanisms</b> for promoting it.

40|$|The {{critical}} importance {{of controlling the}} size and number of intracellular organelles {{has led to a}} variety of mechanisms for regulating the formation and growth of cellular structures. In this review, we explore a class of mechanisms for organelle growth control that rely primarily on the cytoplasm as a ‘limiting pool’ of available material. These mechanisms are based on the idea that, as organelles grow, they incorporate subunits from the cytoplasm. If this subunit pool is limited, organelle growth will lead to depletion of subunits from the cytoplasm. Free subunit concentration therefore provides a measure of the number of incorporated subunits and thus the current size of the organelle. Because organelle growth rates are typically a function of subunit concentration, cytoplasmic depletion links organelle size, free subunit concentration, and growth rates, ensuring that as the organelle grows, its rate of growth slows. Thus, a limiting cytoplasmic pool provides a powerful mechanism for size-dependent regulation of growth without <b>recourse</b> to active <b>mechanisms</b> to measure size or modulate growth rates. Variations of this general idea allow not only for size control, but also cell-size-dependent scaling of cellular structures, coordination of growth between similar structures within a cell, and the enforcement of singularity in structure formation, when only a single copy of a structure is desired. Here, we review several examples of such mechanisms in cellular processes as diverse as centriole duplication, centrosome and nuclear size control, cell polarity, and growth of flagella...|$|R

40|$|The term “polycentric {{political}} system ” {{was introduced to}} the literature on governance systems in a classic article by Ostrom, Tiebout, and Warren (1961 : 831). They use this term to describe “the traditional pattern of government in a metropolitan area with its multiplicity of political jurisdictions. ” They further elaborate as follows: “Polycentric ” connotes many centers of decision making that are formally independent of each other. … To the extent that they take each other into account in competitive relationships, enter into various contractual and cooperative undertakings or have <b>recourse</b> to central <b>mechanisms</b> to resolve conflicts, the various political jurisdictions in a metropolitan area may function in a coherent manner with consistent and predictable patterns of interacting behavior. To the extent that this is so, they may be said to function as a “system. ” (Ostrom, Tiebout, and Warren 1961 : 831). The basic idea is that any group of individuals facing some collective problem should be able to address that problem in whatever way they best see fit. To do so they might work through the existing system of public authorities, or they may establish a new governance unit that would impose taxes on members of that group in order to achieve some common purpose, including monitoring and sanctioning of individual contributions. Many problems may not warrant establishment of a formal organization, but the basic idea is that the governance system in place should facilitate the problem-solving process, for any group facing any particular problem.

On the one hand, it is not obvious that it encompasses treaties, or licenses presidential authority beyond the capacity to ensure compliance within the executive branch; on the other hand, it smacks of unbridled executive power. These objections can be met. As the Article explains, the Take Care Clause includes treaties, including - critically - some treaties conventionally labeled as non-self-executing, and permits presidential authority beyond self-regulation. The text, case law, and practice further support the idea that this authority may be divested by the Constitution, by treaty, or by statute, and must satisfy additional criteria that guard against vesting the president with plenary lawmaking authority. The Article explains how this theory applies to potential controversies involving compliance with the decisions of international tribunals (like those of the International Court of Justice, or arising under the WTO or the Law of the Sea Convention), legislative decisions by institutions like the Security Council (such as a resolution enabling war crime proceedings against former U. S. officials), and finally treaties that afford no <b>recourse</b> to international <b>mechanisms.</b> The result is a theory that reinforces congressional supremacy without requiring that treaty obligations founder upon it...|$|R
40|$|The central {{claim of}} this thesis {{is that the}} agent {{responsible}} {{for a variety of}} phenomena surrounding wh-operators is not those operators themselves, but rather a distinct element that we label a 'Q(uestion) -particle'. In many languages, the Q-particle is phonologically empty, and so its role in various phenomena has not yet been recognized. Most importantly, careful study of these Q-particles reveals that the phenomenon known as 'pied-piping' does not exist, and that all putative examples of it are actually instances of normal phrasal movement of the Q-particle. This thesis starts from the demonstration that wh-fronting in Tlingit (Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon) does not involve a syntactic relationship between the interrogative C and the wh-word. Rather, it involves a probe/Agree relation between C and an overt Q-particle c-commanding the wh-word. Fronting of the wh-word in Tlingit wh-questions is a mere by-product of fronting the projection of the Q-particle. From this core observation, a syntax and semantics for Tlingit wh-questions is developed. Given the strong similarity between the wh-constructions of Tlingit and those of more widely studied languages, the analysis developed for Tlingit is then applied to a range of other languages. It is found that such a 'Q-based' theory of wh-constructions holds a variety of analytic consequences. Regarding so-called 'pied-piping structures', the Q-based theory provides an analysis of such structures where the very concept of 'pied-piping' is eliminated from the theory of grammar. Furthermore, the Q-based theory provides a semantics for wh-questions that correctly interprets pied-piping structures without <b>recourse</b> to any <b>mechanisms</b> beyond those needed for wh-questions without pied-piping. (cont.) Finally, the Q-based theory accounts for various constraints on pied-piping, and correctly predicts the scope and limits of its variation across languages. Beyond its treatment of pied-piping, the Q-based theory also provides a novel syntax and semantics for multiple wh-questions, which successfully ties the presence of Superiority Effects to the absence of Intervention Effects, and which correctly predicts a previously unnoticed Intervention Effect in English. Moreover, it provides a novel, unified account of the ill-formedness of left branch extractions, as well as of preposition stranding. by Seth Cable. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This thesis has set out {{to explore}} the topical issue of the role and {{function}} of violence for a young male. The task has also been to illustrate those factors that have impinged upon this latency boy's emotional development and search {{for a sense of}} self in light of early traumatic experiences with a violent father. The thesis discusses in detail, through the analysis of clinical material, the extent to which an aggressive, violent paternal object has been internalised, as well as the external forces that have re-enforced such a personification. The study charts the progress of the therapeutic treatment revealing the gradual development of the child's reflective capacity. This facilitated an exploration and modification of existing states of mind, which were clearly obstacles to his ongoing emotional development. Careful use of transference and counter-transference material within the clinical sessions was the key to this progress and development taking place. Analysis, coding and sampling of the clinical data was undertaken using a grounded theory, qualitative research methodology. Application of grounded theory allowed for the generation of themes which emerged from the clinical data, themes which were then organised and presented using an adaptation of Meltzer's (1976) philosophy around the use of "temperature" and "distance" as a means of regulating emotional undulations in the therapeutic setting. In this way, it is hoped that this thesis will contribute to and extend ideas for those child psychotherapists working with violent or severely deprived children. The impact of the boy's exposure to domestic violence and the complex internal landscape that had arisen {{as a result of this}} early traumatic experience, are explored in great detail. Despite emphasis being placed on the boy's search for an alternative father figure through the therapeutic relationship with a male therapist, the ongoing enmeshed relationship with the maternal figure is also explored with reference to the degree to which this served to re-enforce the child's image of himself as a violent male inextricably linked to a violent father. Linking to relevant psychoanalytic literature, one of the tasks of this study has been to highlight the role of the father in early child development, and the complex nature of how parental figures are internalised. The complexity of this process is captured via the research participant's ongoing internal conflict of enacting a violent male figure from his past, while attempting to integrate what was to become an emerging reflective capacity. This investigation highlights the great difficulties involved when working with violent and severely deprived children, but also emphasises what a rich and rewarding experience this can be for both the clinician and the patient. This thesis is therefore aimed at those child psychotherapists engaged in work with such challenging children in the hope that this research will contribute to further thinking about and understanding of the complex processes involved in work in this field. In this vein, Meltzer's (1976) ideas on "temperature and distance" are adapted to incorporate the dimensions of "time" and "space". This is partly as a means of structuring and organising the themes which emerged from the clinical data, but is also a useful aide-memoir tor clinicians to follow in structuring their thinking and practice when working with those children in particular, who present with violent and aggressive behaviours. I believe that fundamentally, the psychoanalytic psychotherapy undertaken with the research participant was very successful in allowing important issues to be addressed and in modifying existing states of mind. It presented him with an alternative experience of a paternal figure, which allowed for some separation from a rather entangled relationship with the maternal figure. At the conclusion of the work, although aggressive and violent impulses were still being externalised, there was substantial evidence of a growing interest in his mind and with it, a capacity for symbolic functioning. The end of our work together, demonstrated this emergent capacity to think about difficult feelings,especially feelings of separation and loss without <b>recourse</b> to <b>mechanisms</b> of avoidance or expulsion...|$|R
