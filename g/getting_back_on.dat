25|$|By early 1986 {{while the}} ABA was slowly <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> its feet financially the USBA was {{starting}} to sink under the financial weight of poorly attended nationals {{and the loss of}} the core of their original management. Still, Mr. Hall approached the ABA with a plan to buy the ABA from the new owners Anderson and Vargas. This was quite strange since as mentioned the USBA was in worse shape financially than the ABA. On several occasions Mr. Hall approached Mr. Vargas and Mr. Anderson with buyout proposals. The talks came to naught.|$|E

25|$|For his 2013 season, Vickers {{performed}} well at Bristol. His second {{ride in the}} No. 55 at Martinsville was unlucky. He had crashed in the early laps and after repairing his car, got back on the lead lap and then spun around. After again <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> to the lead lap, on the final lap of the race he passed Danica Patrick for 11th place. Seconds later he was intentionally spun by Kevin Harvick who was angry with Vickers for prior contact. In reply Vickers bumped Harvick when entering pit road after the race was over; he climbed out and the two briefly argued. Vickers ran the No. 11 FedEx Toyota at Texas, Kansas and Richmond for an injured Denny Hamlin. Though Hamlin returned at Talladega for the Aaron's 499, Vickers substituted for him on lap 23, though he was eventually collected in The Big One less than 15 laps after the switch.|$|E

The album was originally planned around a loose conceptual theme, about which authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write in their book Eight Arms to Hold You: [...] "The idea was to have a theme of a working band, <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the road... or 'back to the egg' (or protective shell) of touring."

He wrote, [...] "Veronica Mars seems to slowly be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> track. There are still some problems to be sure, but this week's episode was a good one, and most notably, built towards some very strong scenes in the second half." [...] Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, was also positive towards the episode, writing [...] "This was good! I liked all of the scenes of Piz sleeping on the floor. And as much as it freaks me out to see Veronica in harm's way (I shouldn't be watching TV, apparently), I appreciated the forward momentum in this plotline." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A".|$|E

She also struggled {{to deal with her}} [...] "physical and emotional scars" [...] and soon developed agoraphobia. Toyah found support from her mother and neighbour Charlie Ramsden (Clare McGlinn), who revealed that she had once been raped. Taylor told Inside Soap's Allison Maund that Charlie's advice really helped Toyah to start <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her feet. However, the process was hampered when Toyah received an anonymous phone call, which left her feeling [...] "extremely frightened". The phone call sparked [...] "a terrifying event" [...] in which Toyah's rapist was finally revealed to be her friend Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). When Phil came round to comfort Toyah, she recognised his voice as he called out her name and realised that he was her rapist. While Toyah tried to escape, Phil grabbed her and held her hostage. Toyah's screams were heard by Peter, who broke the door down and knocked Phil unconscious. A show spokesperson commented that Toyah would be left to worry about whether Phil would deny the rape and be convicted.|$|E
