50|$|Fault {{management}} systems may use complex filtering systems to assign alarms to severity levels. These can range in severity from <b>debug</b> <b>to</b> emergency, {{as in the}} syslog protocol. Alternatively, they could use the ITU X.733 Alarm Reporting Function's perceived severity field. This takes on values of cleared, indeterminate, critical, major, minor or warning. Note that {{the latest version of}} the syslog protocol draft under development within the IETF includes a mapping between these two different sets of severities. It is considered good practice to send a notification not only when a problem has occurred, but also when it has been resolved. The latter notification would have a severity of clear.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{benefits}} of metaprogramming is that it increases the productivity of developers once they get past the convention over configuration phase in the learning phase. Some argue that there is a sharp learning curve to make complete use of the metaprogramming features and to take of advantage of it.Since metaprogramming gives more flexibility and configurability at runtime, misuse or wrong use of the metaprogramming can result in unwarranted and unexpected errors that can be extremely difficult to <b>debug</b> <b>to</b> an average developer. It can introduce risks in the system and make it more vulnerable if not used with care. Some of the common problems which can occur due to wrong use of metaprogramming are inability of the compiler to identify missing configuration parameters, invalid or incorrect data can result in unknown exception or different results. Due to this, some critics believe that only high-skilled developers should work on developing features to support metaprogramming in a language or platform and an average developer must learn how to use these features as part of convention.|$|E

We checked expressive heap properties in various scenarios and found the runtime support to be valuable for debugging and program understanding. Further, our experimental results on DaCapo and other benchmarks indicate that evaluating heap queries using parallel algorithms can lead to significant performance improvements, often resulting in linear speedups as the number of cores increases. To encourage adoption by programmers, we extended an existing JML compiler to translate expressive JML assertions about the heap into their efficient implementation provided by PHALANX. To debug her program, a programmer can annotate it with expressive heap assertions in JML, that are efficiently checked by PHALANX...|$|E

40|$|As {{networks}} {{become more}} versatile, the computational requirement for supporting additional functionality increases. The increasing demands of these networks {{can be met}} by Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), which are an increasingly popular technology for implementing packet processing systems. The fine-grained parallelism and density of these devices can be exploited to meet the computational requirements and implement complex systems on a single chip. However, the increasing complexity of FPGA-based systems makes them susceptible to errors and difficult to test and <b>debug.</b> <b>To</b> tackle the complexity of modern designs, system-level languages {{have been developed to}} provide abstractions suited to the domain of the target system. Unfortunately, the lack of formality in these languages can give rise to errors that are not caught until late in the design cycle. This thesis presents three techniques for verifying and validating FPGA-based packet processing systems described in a system-level description language. First, a type system is applied to the system description language to detect errors before implementation. Second, system-level transaction monitoring is used to observe high-level events on-chip following implementation. Third, the high-level information embodied in the system description language is exploited to allow the system to be automatically instrumented for on-chip monitoring. This thesis demonstrates that these techniques catch errors which are undetected by traditional verification and validation tools. The locations of faults are specified and errors are caught earlier in the design flow, which saves time by reducing synthesis iterations.

40|$|When a {{concurrent}} shared-memory program {{written with}} a sequential consistency (SC) model is {{run on a}} machine implemented with a relaxed consistency (RC) model, it could cause SC violations that are very hard to <b>debug.</b> <b>To</b> avoid such violations, programmers need to provide explicit synchronizations or insert fence instructions. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and eliminate potential SC violations by combining Shasha/Snir’s conflict graph and delay set theory with existing data race detection techniques. For each execution, we generate a race graph, which contains the improperly synchronized conflict accesses, called race accesses, and race cycles formed with those accesses. As a race cycle would probably lead to a non-sequential-consistent execution, {{we call it a}} potential violation of sequential consistency (PVSC) bug. We then compute the race delays of race cycles, and suggest programmers to insert fences into source code to eliminate PVSC bugs. We further convert a race graph into a PC race graph, and improves cycle detection and race delay computation to O(n 2), where n is the number of race access instructions. We evaluate our approach with the SPLASH- 2 benchmarks, two large real-world applications (MySQL and Apache), and several multi-threaded Cilk programs. The results show that (1) the proposed approach could effectively detect PVSC bugs in real-world applications with good scalability; (2) it retains most of the performance of the concurrent program after inserting required fence instructions, with less than 6. 3 % performance loss; and (3) the additional cost of our approach over traditional race detection techniques is quite low, with 3. 3 % on average...|$|E
40|$|Verifying {{whether a}} circuit meets its {{intended}} specifications, {{as well as}} diagnosing the circuits that do not, is indispensable at every stage of integrated circuit design. Otherwise, {{a significant portion of}} fabricated circuits could fail or behave correctly only under certain conditions. Shrinking process technologies and increased integration has further complicated this task. This is especially true of mixed-signal circuits, where a slight parametric shift in an analog component can change the output significantly. We are thus rapidly approaching a proverbial wall, where migrating existing circuits to advanced technology nodes and/or designing the next generation circuits may not be possible without suitable verification and debug strategies. Traditional approaches target accuracy and not scalability, limiting their use to high-dimensional systems. Relaxing the accuracy requirement mitigates the computational cost. Simultaneously, quantifying the level of inaccuracy retains the effectiveness of these metrics. We exercise this accuracy vs. turn-around-time trade-off to deal with multiple mixed-signal problems across both the pre- and post-silicon domains. We first obtain approximate failure probability estimates along with their confidence bands using limited simulation budgets. We then generate ?failure regions? that naturally explain the parametric interactions resulting in predicted failures. These two pre-silicon contributions together enable us to estimate and reduce the failure probability, which we demonstrate on a high-dimensional phase-locked loop test-case. We leverage this pre-silicon knowledge towards test-set selection and post-silicon <b>debug</b> <b>to</b> alleviate the limited controllability and observability in the post-silicon domain. We select a set of test-points that maximizes the probability of observing failures. We then use post-silicon measurements at these test-points to identify systematic deviations from pre-silicon belief. This is demonstrated using the phase-locked loop test-case, where we boost the number of failures to observable levels and use the obtained measurements to root-cause underlying parametric shifts. The pre-silicon contributions can also be extended to perform equivalence checking and to help diagnose detected model-mismatches. The resultant calibrated model allows us to apply our work to the system level as well. The equivalence checking and model-mismatch diagnosis is successfully demonstrated using a high-level abstraction model for the phase-locked loop test-case...|$|E

Visualization as a discipline spans many research areas from computer science, cognitive psychology and even art.

Visualization is used to explore, to <b>debug,</b> <b>to</b> gain understanding, and as an analysis tool. Visualization is literally everywhere [...] images are present in this report, on television, on the web, in books and magazines [...] the common theme is the ability to present information visually that is rapidly assimilated by human observers, and transformed into understanding or insight. As an indispensable part a modern science laboratory, visualization is akin to the biologist's microscope or the electrical engineer's oscilloscope. Whereas the microscope is limited to small specimens or use of optics to focus light, the power of scientific visualization is virtually limitless: visualization provides the means to examine data that can be at galactic or atomic scales, or at any size in between. Unlike the traditional scientific tools for visual inspection, visualization offers the means to ''see the unseeable. '' Trends in demographics or changes in levels of atmospheric CO{sub 2 } as a function of greenhouse gas emissions are familiar examples of such unseeable phenomena. Over time, visualization techniques evolve in response to scientific need. Each scientific discipline has its ''own language,'' verbal and visual, used for communication. The visual language for depicting electrical circuits is much different than the visual language for depicting theoretical molecules or trends in the stock market. There is no ''one visualization too'' that can serve as a panacea for all science disciplines.

Third, we characterise the programs stable from a weak architecture to SC. Fi-nally, we present our offence tool which places either lock-based or lock-free synchronisation in a x 86 or Power program to ensure its stability. Concurrent programs running on modern multiprocessors exhibit subtle behaviours, making them hard to understand and to debug: modern architectures (e. g. x 86 or Power) provide weak memory models, allowing optimisations such as instruction reordering, store buffering or write atomicity relaxation [2]. Thus an execution of a program may not be an interleaving of its instructions, as it would be on a Sequentially Consistent (SC) architecture [18]. Hence standard analyses for concurrent programs might be un-sound, as noted by M. Rinard in [25]. Memory model aware verification tools exist, e. g. [24, 11, 15, 30], but they often focus on one model at a time, or cannot handle the write atomicity relaxation exhibited e. g. by Power: generality remains a challenge. Fortunately, we can force a program running on a weak architecture to behave as if it were running on a stronger one (e. g. SC) by using synchronisation primitives; this underlies the data race free guarantee (DRF guarantee) of S. Adve and M. Hill [3]. Hence, as observed e. g. by S. Burckhart and M. Musuvathi in [12], "we can sensi-bly verify the relaxed executions [...] by solving the following two verification problems separately: 1. Use standard verification methodology for concurrent programs to show that the [SC] executions [...] are correct. 2. Use specialized methodology for memory model safety verification". Here, memory model safety means checking that the execu-tions of a program, although running on a weak architecture, are actually SC. To apply standard verification techniques to concurrent programs running on weak memory mod-els, we thus first need to ensure that our programs have a SC behaviour. S. Burckhart and M. Musuvathi focus in [12] on the Total Store Order (TSO) [28] memory model. We generalise their idea to a wider class of models (defined in [5], and recalled in Sec. 1) : we examine how to force a program running on a weak architecture A 1 to behave as if running on a stronger one A 2, a property that we call stability from A 1 to A 2. To ensure stability to a program, we examine the problem of placing lock-based or lock-free synchronisation primitives in a program. We call synchronisation mapping a...|$|E
