40|$|Donovanosis is {{a chronic}} {{indolent}} sexually transmitted <b>granulomatous</b> <b>ulceration</b> of genito-inguinal region, caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. It became uncommon due to indiscriminate use of broad spectrum antibiotics. In recent years, much interest is being {{focused on this}} condition because genital ulcers facilitate HIV infection. We report an interesting episode of genital donovanosis complicated with squamous cell carcinoma in a middle aged female for its rarity and clinical interest...|$|E
40|$|Granuloma inguinale (GI) is an {{acquired}} chronic, slowly progressive, mildly contagious disease of venereal origin, characterized by <b>granulomatous</b> <b>ulceration</b> of the genitalia and neighboring sites, {{with little or}} no tendency to spontaneous healing caused by Klebsiella (Calymmatobacterium) granulomatis. A 55 -year-old male presented with fissured, foul smelling, fungating growth over prepuce with phimosis mimicking squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) without lymphadenopathy. It started with painless papulonodular showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, infiltration in dermis, acanthosis and vacuolated macrophages suggestive of GI and not showing any histopathological features of SCC. Patient was successfully treated by giving cotrimoxazole twice a day for 21 days. Here, we presented a case of GI mimicking SCC of penis, which was diagnosed on basis of histopathology and treated with excision followed by medical therapy with cotrimoxazole...|$|E
40|$|Superficial granulomatous pyoderma, {{recently}} {{described as}} a variant of pyoderma gangrenosum, would be better termed pathergic <b>granulomatous</b> cutaneous <b>ulceration</b> as the seven previously described cases, {{as well as our}} own two cases, have significant dermal involvement histologically and heal with scarring. In contrast to pyoderma gangrenosum, lesions of superficial granulomatous pyoderma respond to less toxic anti-inflammatory agents...|$|R
40|$|A case of <b>granulomatous</b> penile <b>ulceration</b> {{associated}} with generalised lymphadenopathy in a homosexual man aged 43 is presented. His serum gave positive results to tests for syphilis, but was negative for antibody to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). His condition responded briskly to treatment with procaine penicillin, and we conclude that the clinical features were attributable to infection with Treponema pallidum...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSymptomatic oral Crohn's {{disease is}} {{comparatively}} rare. The relationship between orofacial granulomatosis, (where there is <b>granulomatous</b> inflammation and <b>ulceration</b> {{of the mouth}} {{in the absence of}} gastrointestinal disease) and true oral Crohn's disease is discussed along with the plethora of clinical oral disease presentations associated with both disorders and the differential diagnosis of oral ulceration in patients presenting to a gastroenterological clinic. Specific oral syndromes are outlined including the association between oral manifestations in Crohn's disease and the pattern of intestinal disease and their relationship to other recorded extraintestinal manifestations. The histological and immunological features of oral biopsies are considered as well as the principles of management of symptomatic oral disease. At present, it is suggested that both orofacial granulomatosis and oral Crohn's disease appear to be distinct clinical disorders...|$|R
40|$|São descritos três casos de leishmaniose cutânea em cobaias (Cavia porcellus) machos de dois anos de idade que eram criadas como animais de estimação. As lesões macroscópicas eram semelhantes em duas cobaias e consistiam de nódulos cutâneos ulcerados no aspecto dorsal do pavilhão {{auricular}} de ambas as orelhas. Na outra cobaia, a lesão consistia de engrossamentos irregulares na pele do escroto que apareceram após uma orquiectomia realizada dois meses antes. A histopatologia era semelhante nos três casos e consistia de acentuada dermatite granulomatosa, com ulceração e numerosas formas protozoárias amastigotas no citoplasma de macrófagos, sugestivas de Leishmania sp. A microscopia eletrônica confirmou o diagnóstico de leishmaniose. Three {{cases of}} cutaneous leishmaniasis in three two-year-old male guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) raised as pets are described. Gross lesions {{were similar in}} two of the guinea pigs and consisted of raised and ulcerated cutaneous nodules in the dorsal aspect of the pinna of both ears. In another guinea pig the lesion consisted of irregular thickenning in the skin of the scrotum which followed an orchiectomy performed two months before. Histopathology was similar in the three cases and consisted of severe diffuse <b>granulomatous</b> dermatitis with <b>ulceration</b> and numerous intrahistiocytic protozoal amastigotes resembling Leishmania sp. Electron microscopy confirmed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} {{skin disorder}} characterised by painful and rapidly progressing skin ulceration. PG can be extremely difficult to treat and patients often require systemic immunosuppression. Recurrent lesions of PG are common, but the relative rarity of this condition {{means that there is}} a lack of published evidence regarding its treatment. A systematic review published in 2005 found no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) relating to the treatment of PG. Since this time, one small RCT has been published comparing infliximab to placebo, but none of the commonly used systemic treatments for PG have been formally assessed. The UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network’s STOP GAP Trial has been designed to address this lack of trial evidence. Methods The objective is to assess whether oral ciclosporin is more effective than oral prednisolone for the treatment of PG. The trial design is a two-arm, observer-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial comparing ciclosporin (4 [*]mg/kg/day) to prednisolone (0. 75 [*]mg/kg/day). A total of 140 participants are to be recruited over a period of 4 [*]years, from up to 50 hospitals in the UK and Eire. Primary outcome of velocity of healing at 6 [*]weeks is assessed blinded to treatment allocation (using digital images of the ulcers). Secondary outcomes include: (i) time to healing; (ii) global assessment of improvement; (iii) PG inflammation assessment scale score; (iv) self-reported pain; (v) health-related quality of life; (vi) time to recurrence; (vii) treatment failures; (viii) adverse reactions to study medications; and (ix) cost effectiveness/utility. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PG (excluding <b>granulomatous</b> PG); measurable <b>ulceration</b> (that is, not pustular PG); and patients aged over 18 [*]years old who are able to give informed consent are included in the trial. Randomisation is by computer generated code using permuted blocks of randomly varying size, stratified by lesion size, and presence or absence of underlying systemic disease (for example, rheumatoid arthritis). Patients who require topical therapy are asked to enter a parallel observational study (case series). If topical therapy fails and systemic therapy is required, participants are then considered for inclusion in the randomised trial. Trial registration Current controlled trials: ISRCTN 35898459.
