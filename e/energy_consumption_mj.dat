Unfortunately, the action leads to significant increment in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission that causing the global warming. The most promising mitigation strategy is by deploying Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology where mineral carbonation was identified as the safest method for permanent storage and does not require continuous monitoring. Accordingly, National Green Technology was launched in 2009 to support the growth of green technology development in Malaysia as a carbon mitigation strategy. Thus, this paper aims to propose {{the development of a}} conceptual eco-design for Low Energy Mechanical Milling (LEMM). The concept was proposed by using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool with combination of sustainability determinants (DFS) namely economic, environmental and social which evaluated using Solidworks 2015 sustainability assessment.

The tuning mechanism adjusts the harvester’s spring stiffness by varying the axial tensile force between two permanent magnets. The system can adjust the resonant frequency of the harvester from 64 to 78 Hz, increasing the operational bandwidth of the harvester from 0. 26 to 14 Hz, using a single structure. A closed loop control measures the ambient frequency using the phase difference between the harvester output voltage and an accelerometer to adjust the tuning mechanism.

In this study, energy impact on the ventilation systems was examined against certain IAQ objectives for indoor airborne bacteria exposure risk in air-conditioned offices of Hong Kong. The relationship between thermal <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> and indoor airborne bacteria exposure levels based on regional surveys was investigated. The thermal <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> of ventilation systems operating for carbon dioxide (CO 2) exposure concentrations between 800 and 1200 ppmv for typical office buildings and the corresponding failure probability against some target bacteria exposure levels were evaluated. The results showed that, for a reference indoor environment at a CO 2 exposure concentration of 1000 ppmv, the predicted average thermal energy saving of ventilation system for a unit increment of the expected risk of unsatisfactory IAQ of 1 % was 55 MJ m - 2 yr - 1 and for a unit decrement of 1 %, the predicted additional thermal <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> was 58 <b>MJ</b> m - 2 yr - 1 respectively.

This study was undertaken {{in order to determine the}} direct and indirect <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of field operations in a lowland rice production system of Malaysia. Field time, fuel and other energy requirements were measured for the tillage, planting, fertilizing, spraying and harvesting operations performed. Energy analysis carried out revealed the highest average operational <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> was for tillage (1747. 33 MJ ha- 1) which accounted for about 48. 6 % of the total operational <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> (3595. 87 <b>MJ</b> ha- 1), followed by harvesting (1171. 44 MJ ha- 1, 32. 6 %) and planting (562. 91 MJ ha- 1, 15. 7 %).

40|$|Treatment {{of fresh}} air in {{ventilation}} systems for the air-conditioning consumes {{a considerable amount of}} energy and affects the indoor air quality (IAQ). The ventilation demand is primarily related to the occupant load. In this study, the ventilation demands due to occupant load variations and occupant acceptability were examined against certain IAQ objectives using the mass balance of carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations in an air-conditioned office. In particular, this study proposed a ventilation model for the consideration of the occupant load variations and occupant acceptability based on the regional survey of typical offices (422 samples) in Hong Kong. The model was applied to evaluate the relative energy performance of different IAQ objectives in ventilation systems for typical office buildings in Hong Kong. The results showed that the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of a ventilation system would be correlated with the occupant load and acceptability in the air-conditioned office. Indicative CO 2 levels of 800 ppmv, 1000 ppmv and 1200 ppmv corresponding to 83 %, 97 % and 99. 7 % survey samples were shown, corresponding to the thermal <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> of 1500 <b>MJ</b> m - 2 yr - 1, 960 MJ m - 2 yr - 1 and 670 MJ m - 2 yr - 1, respectively.

To achieve an excellent IAQ following the existing design standard, i. e. to decrease the CO 2 level from 1000 ppmv to 800 ppmv, 56 % additional energy would be consumed, corresponding to an annual value of HK$ 1, 419 million, even though the occupant acceptability is only improved from 81 % to 86 %.

Moreover, prediction of temporal <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> enables building managers to plan out the energy usage over time, shift energy usage to off-peak periods, and make more effective energy purchase plans. This paper proposes a novel model for predicting heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> {{in commercial}} buildings. The model simulates energy behaviors of HVAC systems in commercial buildings, and interacts with a multiagent systems (MAS) based framework for <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> prediction. Prediction is done on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Ground truth <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> data is collected from a test bed office building over 267 consecutive days, and is compared to predicted <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> for the same period. Results show that the prediction can match 92. 6 to 98. 2 % of total HVAC <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> with coefficient of variation of the {{root mean square error}} (CV-RMSE) values of 7. 8 to 22. 2 %. Ventilation <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> can be predicted at hig...|$|R
40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to test the}} causal relationship between nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and real GDP for nine developed countries for the period 1971 - 2005 by including capital and labour as additional variables. Using {{a modified version of}} the Granger causality test developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), we found a unidirectional causality running from nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> to economic growth in Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland; the opposite uni-directional causality running from economic growth to nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> in Canada and Sweden; and a bi-directional causality running between economic growth and nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. In Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA, increases in nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> caused increases in economic growth implying that conservation measures taken that reduce nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> may negatively affect economic growth. In France, Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland increases in nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> caused decreases in economic growth, suggesting that energy conservation measure taken that reduce nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> may help to mitigate the adverse effects of nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> on economic growth. In Canada and Sweden energy conservation measures affecting nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> may not harm economic growth.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a national statistical system for <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> data for public buildings in China, in order to provide data support for building energy efficiency work. The framework for a national statistical system of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> for public buildings is presented in this paper. The statistical index system of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> constitutes three aspects: general characteristics of public buildings, opposition and utilization of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> equipment, and <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> quantities. On this basis, a set of statistical reports is derived to measure the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of cities, provinces and the country...|$|R
