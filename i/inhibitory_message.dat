40|$|The daily {{rhythm of}} {{melatonin}} synthesis in the rat pineal gland {{is controlled by}} the central biological clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via a multisynaptic pathway involving, successively, neurones of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), sympathetic preganglionic neurones of the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord, and norepinephrine containing sympathetic neurones of the superior cervical ganglion. Recently, we showed that, in the rat, the SCN uses a combination of daytime inhibitory and nighttime stimulatory signals toward the PVN-pineal pathway in order to control the daily rhythm of melatonin synthesis, GABA being responsible for the daytime <b>inhibitory</b> <b>message</b> and glutamate for the nighttime stimulation. The present study was initiated to further check this concept, and to investigate the involvement of the inhibitory SCN output in the early morning circadian decline of melatonin release, with the hypothesis that, at dawn, the increased release of GABA onto pre-autonomic PVN neurones results in a diminished norepinephrine stimulation of the pineal, and ultimately an arrest of melatonin release. First, we established that prolonged norepinephrine stimulation of the pineal gland was indeed sufficient to prevent the early morning decline of melatonin release. Blockade of GABAergic signaling in the PVN at dawn could not prevent the early morning decline of melatonin completely. Therefore, these results show that an increased GABAergic inhibition of the PVN neurones that control the sympathetic innervation of the pineal gland, at dawn, is not sufficient to explain the early morning decline of melatonin release.

50|$|Another direct pathway {{from the}} basal ganglia sends GABA <b>inhibitory</b> <b>messages</b> to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, which then send GABA to the thalamus. In the {{indirect}} pathway, the basal ganglia send GABA to the globus pallidus which then sends {{it to the}} subthalamic nucleus, which then disinhibited sends glutamate to the output structures of the basal ganglia. Inhibition of GABA release could disrupt the feedback loop to the basal ganglia and produce hypokinesic movements.|$|R
50|$|In the cerebellum, the multipolar basket {{cells have}} {{branching}} dendrites, which are dilated and knotty. Basket cells synapse {{on the cell}} bodies of Purkinje cells and make inhibitory synapses with Purkinje cells. Cerebellar basket cell axons fire inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA to Purkinje cell axons, and inhibits the Purkinje cell. Purkinje cells send <b>inhibitory</b> <b>messages</b> to the deep cerebellar nuclei and {{are responsible for the}} sole output of motor coordination from the cerebellar cortex. With the work of the basket cell, Purkinje cells do not send the inhibitory response for motor coordination and motor movement occurs.|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{have used}} mRNA {{injection}} to study the action of mutants of XrelA, a Xenopus homolog of the RelA (p 65) component of NF-kappa B, on the induction of mesoderm in Xenopus embryos. A region of the res homology domain of XrelA was deleted to create XrelA Delta SP, which retains the dimerization and activation domains, but no longer binds to DNA, We also made an analogous derivative of mammalian NF-kappa B 1 (p 50), We show that both constructs have dominant <b>inhibitory</b> activity. When <b>message</b> encoding ei;ther is injected into eggs or oocytes, DNA binding of rel family members is suppressed, as is transactivation of a kappa B-dependent promoter in embryos. Expression of XrelA Delta SP in animal caps blocks the induction of mesoderm by bFGF. In addition, this mutant prevents elongation movements generated by activin, but has little effect on posterior dorsal cytodifferentiation, which in marked contrast is blocked by inhibition of the FGF signal transduction pathway between the receptor and MAP kinase, The specificity of the XrelA Delta SP effect on FGF signaling is shown by rescue of mesodermal marker expression when XrelA Delta SP is coexpressed with a specific rel inhibitor. The target of these dominant negative constructs seems to be neither XrelA itself, nor p 50, but rather some other molecule with which XrelA, rather than NF-kappa B 1, heterodimerizes. We show that XrelA Delta SP blocks FGF induction of mesoderm downstream of MAP kinase and Xbra expression. Thus it prevents the maintenance of Xbra expression by inhibiting its autoregulation by embryonic FGF (eFGF). We suggest that XrelA Delta SP differs from other reported inhibitors of FGF signaling because it inhibits only gastrula stage FGF signaling and not the maternally programmed signaling at the blastula stage, Our results therefore suggest that zygotic FGF action is required for cell movements rather than dorsal differentiation...|$|R
