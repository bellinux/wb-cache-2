30|$|Prognostics {{tools are}} used for RUL {{prediction}} starting from the crack initiation time. However there is uncertainty in CIT due to the limited capability of existing fault detection tools, and such uncertainty has not been explicitly considered in the literature for integrated prognosis. A shock causes a sudden damage increase and creates a jump in the degradation path, which shortens the total lifetime, {{and it has not}} been considered before either in the integrated prognostics framework. This paper proposes an integrated prognostics method considering these two important factors, the uncertainty in CIT and the shock in equipment degradation. In the proposed integrated prognostics method, CIT is considered as an uncertain parameter, which is updated using CM data. To deal with the sudden damage <b>increase</b> <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> of total lifetime, a virtual gradual degradation path with an earlier CIT is utilized, and the effect of shock is captured through identifying an appropriate CIT. Examples demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting RUL considering shock and uncertainty in CIT.|$|E

Aim: To report the results of laparoscopic esophagomyotomy in patients with achalasia. Patients and methods: Nineteen patients with achalasia, nine women, aged 9 to 66 years old, operated between 1996 and 2001 are reported. Results: There was no surgical mortality. One patient had a subphrenic abscess due to an unnoticed tear of the esophageal mucosa. During surgery, esophageal mucosa was perforated in 4 patients, that was sutured in three. One patient with an extensive tear of the mucosa required conversion to classical surgery. Patients were followed for 2 to 48 months.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{previously}} reported that gap junction–mediated inter-cellular communication (GJIC) can be restored in junctionally deficient human prostate epithelial cells, also suggesting that GJIC activity is regulated by estrogen. In the present work, we report studies on sex steroid regulation of GJIC and proliferative activity in both nontumoral (Chang liver, CL) and malignant (HepG 2, Huh 7) human liver cells. Junctional activity and liver cell growth were measured using the scrape-loading/dye-transfer (SL/DT) and the MTS assay, respectively. Using the SL/DT, only Huh 7 cells exhibited a moderate degree of junctional activity in basic conditions, while neither CL nor HepG 2 cells showed functional GJIC. Under {{exactly the same}} experimental approach used for prostate studies, we observed that, once again, both estrogen (either estradiol or estrone) and FK induce a significant increase of GJIC in Huh 7 cells, while exposure of HepG 2 cells to FK produces only a limited rise of junc-tional activity in this cell line. However, estrogen induced a significant <b>increase</b> <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> of the proliferative activity of CL and Huh 7 cells, respectively...|$|E

Under greenhouses, several factors such as non-uniform irrigation and localized soil compaction can severely affect yield and quality.

In this experiment 2 D-Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used as an exploratory tool to characterize greenhouse soil variability and its relations to wild rocket yield. Soil resistivity well matched biomass variation (R 2 = 0. 70), and was linked to differences in soil bulk density (R 2 = 0. 90) and clay content (R 2 = 0. 77).
