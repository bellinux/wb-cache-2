This organization was the successor organization to the Rocky <b>Flats</b> Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky <b>Flats</b> and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings.|$|E

5|$|Hunslet Grange <b>Flats</b> (more {{commonly}} known as the Leek Street <b>Flats)</b> displayed brutalism. They replaced run down back to back houses. It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets, including longer streets such as Alton Street. The <b>flats</b> were popular at first; however, they were so poorly designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed. Smaller shops on the site had been demolished even earlier.|$|E

5|$|Most of NY13 between Caton and Big <b>Flats</b> was county-maintained {{as part of}} CR120 in Steuben County and as CR7 in Chemung County. East of the Fitch Bridge, {{however, the}} road had been state-maintained since 1912 as part of SH946. In the early 1940s, NY13 was {{truncated}} on its southern end to downtown Elmira, leaving the Caton–Big <b>Flats</b> highway without a signed state route designation. The county-maintained parts of the road remained designated as CR120 in Steuben County and CR7 in Chemung County, while the short state-owned segment in Big <b>Flats</b> eventually became part of an unsigned reference route extending from Golden Glow Heights Drive to Water Street (modern NY352).|$|E
5|$|The Rocky <b>Flats</b> Plant was {{a former}} U.S. nuclear weapons {{production}} facility about 15 miles northwest of Denver, Colorado, which caused radioactive contamination, primarily plutonium, americium, and uranium, within and outside its boundaries. The facility was dismantled and removed, and the central industrial area of the property became a Superfund site, surrounded by the Rocky <b>Flats</b> National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical <b>flats</b> spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the <b>flats</b> are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired <b>flats</b> were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired <b>flats,</b> all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired <b>flats,</b> it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the <b>flats.</b> If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} Yukon <b>Flats</b> National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon <b>Flats</b> National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the Yukon <b>Flats,</b> a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E

Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the <b>Flats</b> and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments has been on the increase since 2000. Recent developments include the revival of the <b>Flats,</b> the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.|$|E

5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference <b>flats</b> being used to check two test <b>flats</b> {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference <b>flats</b> are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test <b>flats,</b> and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the <b>flats</b> are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference <b>flats</b> allows the two <b>flats</b> to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two <b>flats</b> and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
