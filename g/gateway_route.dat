50|$|A {{wireless}} <b>gateway</b> <b>routes</b> packets from {{a wireless}} LAN to another network, wired or wireless WAN. It may be implemented as software or hardware or combination of both. Wireless gateways combine {{the functions of}} a wireless access point, a router, and often provide firewall functions as well. They provide network address translation (NAT) functionality, so multiple user can use the internet with a single public IP. It also acts like a {{dynamic host configuration protocol}} (DHCP) to assign IPs automatically to devices connected to the network.|$|R

50|$|The Northern Gateway for antebellum {{trade was}} the primary trade route {{connecting}} the Midwestern United States with the Northeast and the Atlantic Ocean. The gateway's canals, rivers, and railroads drastically altered the makeup of America's economy, culture, and population distribution. As rail and waterway technology improved, the Northern Gateway became the preeminent trade conduit in the nation. It helped spur the growth of both eastern and western cities. Settlers rapidly began to settle in the burgeoning towns of the many trade points all along the <b>gateway's</b> <b>route.</b> It allowed goods and information to travel at unprecedented rates, which, in turn, completely re-vamped the style and processes of American culture and economics.|$|R

50|$|As the Northern Gateway {{increased}} {{the size and}} profits of previously untapped western markets, people began flooding westward along the <b>gateway's</b> <b>routes</b> in search of similar windfalls. The population density of the area along the western section of the Erie Canal increased five-fold between 1817 and 1835. As capital was consistently being allocated westward, new cities shot up between New York City and Lake Erie. Rochester's population increased almost 25 times between 1820 and 1850, Syracuse saw a 13-fold enhancement, and Buffalo's population grew by about 21 times its original size {{during the same time}} period. Foreign immigrants contributed substantially to the increased population of western cities. For example, between 1840 arid 1845, 300,000 immigrants landed in New York City. However the population only increased by 80,000, which means that the majority of immigrants travelled up the Hudson River to Albany or westward along the Erie Canal.|$|R

40|$|A hybrid Mobile AdHoc Network (MANET) is {{provided}} by gateways (GWs), which connect the MANET to the Internet. Hybrid MANETs are vulnerable to more security threats while routing through the gateways. To guarantee secure hence efficient data routing and transmission, In this paper, we propose to design a data aware secure gateway selection technique for hybrid MANET. In our technique, gateway is classified into two categories as public gateway and protected gateway. Protected <b>gateway</b> can <b>route</b> both public and protected data. Conversely, public <b>gateway</b> can only <b>route</b> public data. Among multiple gateways, a gateway is elected using multi criteria gateway selection strategy. Protected gateway and mobile nodes are authenticated using Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). By simulation results, we prove the performance of our technique. This gateway authentication technique improves the routing performance o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} anycast routing for multi-gateway wireless mesh networks {{to maximize the}} overall quality of communications. For such networks, anycasting provides an effective mechanism to reduce problems due to congestion and interfence by appropriate selection of gateways, particularly at heavy traffic con-ditions. However, as proved in this paper, the optimal gateway selection problem is NP-hard. Hence, we propose a heuristic for route selection that tries to perform <b>gateway</b> and <b>route</b> selection to minimize interference. Simulation re-sults show that our proposed anycasting scheme performs better than other well known anycasting protocols...|$|R

30|$|The first representative, EC 2 {{provides}} minimal network virtualization {{using either}} {{a software or hardware}} gateway {{to facilitate the}} communication between VPCs or virtual machines. A software <b>gateway</b> uses <b>route</b> tables as software virtual router while hardware gateway uses hardware router. Cisco integrated service routers and Juniper J-series are examples of software virtual routers. RTX 3000 is an example of hardware router. The EC 2 uses security groups to provide the basic security services among the users. A security group acts as a virtual firewall to control the traffic allowed that is allowed into a group of virtual machines instances.|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the applications of sensor networks. Since sensors are generally constrained in on-board energy supply, efficient management of the network is crucial in extending the life of the sensor. In this paper, we present a novel approach for energy-aware and context-aware routing of sensor data. The approach calls for network clustering and assigns a less-energy-constrained gateway node that acts as a centralized network manager. Based on energy usage at every sensor node and changes in the mission and the environment, the <b>gateway</b> sets <b>routes</b> for sensor data, monitors latency throughout the cluster, and arbitrates medium access among sensors. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve substantial energy saving. 1...|$|R
