A major drawback are large keys in the range between 50 kByte to several MByte that prevented real-world applications of code-based cryptosystems so far. A recent proposal by Misoczki et al. showed that quasi-cyclic moderate density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes can be used in McEliece en-cryption – reducing the public key to just 0. 6 kByte to achieve a 80 -bit security level. Despite of reasonably small key sizes that could also enable small designs, previous work only report high-performance implementations with high resource consumptions of more than 13, 000 slices on a large Xilinx Virtex- 6 FPGA for a combined en-/decryption unit.
