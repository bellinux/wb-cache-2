5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{shows up}} in Scranton after Robert California (James Spader) allows her {{to have a job}} there. She is invited to take an open desk, and she takes Andy's manager desk, as he is absent. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) says she cannot take Andy's job, but Robert is {{interested}} in her spontaneous behavior. As acting manager, Nellie decides to give everyone performance reviews. Both Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) refuse to let her proceed, as she is unfamiliar with the other employees. To counter this, Nellie offers Dwight a raise on the spot, and eventually, he and the other employees relent, except <b>for</b> <b>Jim.</b> When it is Jim's turn, Jim still refuses. Everyone in the office, except <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> and his wife, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), applaud her. Nellie promptly begins rearranging the office.|$|E

In the episode, Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) tasks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) with finding a part-time replacement <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> Halpert (John Krasinski), and Dwight must choose among Clark (Clark Duke) and several of his close friends, including his cousin Mose (Schur).|$|E
5|$|Before the {{understudy}} rehearsal, Jim's fiancée Laura (the understudy for Lady Macbeth) {{helps him}} learn lines in Tony's dressing room. Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop of blood on the floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone.|$|E
5|$|In any event, {{gold was}} present {{along the river}} in huge quantities. Carmack {{measured}} out four claims, strips of ground that could later be legally mined by the owner, along the river; these including two for himself—one as his normal claim, the second {{as a reward for}} having discovered the gold—and one each <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> and Charlie. The claims were registered next day at the police post {{at the mouth of the}} Fortymile River and news spread rapidly from there to other mining camps in the Yukon River valley.|$|E
60|$|During {{this last}} operation, the {{prisoner}} struggled most desperately, <b>for</b> <b>Jim's</b> revolver had been lowered {{in order that}} he might assist his companion, and before the boys finally got him under subjection they were reeking with perspiration, {{in addition to being}} nearly tired out.|$|R

5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick {{the lock on}} his parents' home to obtain a van <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E
5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment {{would have gone to}} Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E

5|$|Black {{remained}} in the starting rotation {{at the beginning of}} the 1944 Philadelphia Athletics season, despite possibility of him being drafted into the United States Army for World War II. He was rejected for military service after a physical examination on June 22, and remained with the team throughout the season. His win total improved from last season; however, he went a span of about a month, from June 28 until late July, without a victory. He finished the season with a 1012 record, a 4.06 ERA, and 27 games started, second highest on the team behind Bobo Newsom. At the end of the season, there were rumors that manager Connie Mack was planning to trade Black and Frankie Hayes to Cleveland <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> Bagby, Jr. and Jeff Heath, though Mack stated that there was no substance to the rumors.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers {{returned}} to ROH at the Fourth Anniversary Show in 2006, forcibly including {{themselves in a}} match that was at first between the teams of Tony Mamaluke and Sal Rinauro and Jason Blade and Kid Mikaze. They won in their re-debut. They then feuded for the tag team championship again, but much as they had against Styles and Red three years earlier, they lost in three shots against the champions at the time, Austin Aries and Roderick Strong, at Ring of Homicide, Destiny, and Unified. As before, the storyline was that this cost them any chance at the belts {{for as long as}} those champs held them. It was around this time that the Brothers became enforcers <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> Cornette's heel character as ROH Commissioner, fighting battles against his enemies, most notably Homicide and his partner Samoa Joe at Glory By Honor V: Night Two and in anything goes, falls count anywhere, elimination match at Dethroned. During this time, they also feuded with Kenta and his partners Davey Richards and Naomichi Marufuji, facing Kenta and Richards at Time to Man Up and Kenta and Marufuji at Glory By Honor V: Night One.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers had no {{selection}} {{in the first}} round, that pick having been traded to the Chicago Bears for defensive end Wally Chambers (the Bears used the pick to select Dan Hampton). The Buccaneers had extra picks {{in the second and}} third rounds in return for trading nose tackle Dave Pear to the Oakland Raiders. They also had extra third and fifth round picks from the Houston Oilers, as part of the 1978 trade for the Buccaneers' first overall pick. They received a third-round pick from the Baltimore Colts in return for running back Dan Hardeman. The Buccaneers' own third-round pick went to the Miami Dolphins as NFL-ordered compensation for signing Randy Crowder. Defensive end Council Rudolph was traded to the Dolphins in return for an eighth-round pick. Other picks were traded as follows: round 4 to the Detroit Lions for Rockne Freitas, round 5 to the Seattle Seahawks, round six to Oakland for Rik Bonness, round seven to the Washington Redskins for Frank Grant, round eight to the New York Jets for Darrell Austin, and round ten to the San Francisco 49ers <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> Obradovich.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{selected}} eighteen unprotected players, {{two from}} each of the nine other NBA teams. On {{the first day of the}} draft, they selected players from the Eastern Division teams; on the second day, they picked from the Western Division teams. The Bulls' selections included former first overall pick Bob Boozer, three-time All-Star Johnny Kerr and one-time All-Star Len Chappell. Kerr retired from playing prior to the start of the season, and was later named the franchise's first head coach. Another expansion draft pick, Al Bianchi, also retired as a player and was later named the team's assistant coach. Dick Klein had been planning to hire Kerr and Bianchi as coaches before the draft even took place, but because they were still under playing contracts with other teams, Klein needed to draft them instead of hiring them outright. Ten players from the expansion draft joined the Bulls for their inaugural season, but only six played more than one season for the team. Guy Rodgers—whom the Bulls acquired in exchange <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> King and Jeff Mullins—and Jerry Sloan were named to the 1967 All-Star Game, becoming the franchise's first All-Stars.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care <b>for</b> <b>Jim</b> and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
