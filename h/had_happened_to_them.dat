Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} about them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them?</b> Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Herg√© to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} {{morning at the}} brothel, {{photographs}} of Ruff-O'Herne {{and the others were}} taken and placed on the veranda which was used as a reception area for the Japanese personnel who would choose from these photographs. Over the following four months the girls were raped and beaten day and night, with those who became pregnant forced to have abortions. After four harrowing months, the girls were moved to a camp at Bogor, in West Java, where they were reunited with their families. This camp was exclusively for women who had been put into military brothels, and the Japanese warned the inmates that if anyone told what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> they and their family members would be killed. Several months later the O'Hernes were transferred to a camp at Batavia, which was liberated on August 15, 1945.|$|E

500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though most}} of their {{original}} land was taken over, {{this was the first}} turning point for the Pomo people. They had finally escaped the harsh road they were once a part of, and even though they had to settle on poor, isolated land, they finally got to make a stride towards tradition and basket weaving. [...] From 1852-1878, many Pomo Indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time, where they could have visions and see what the future would have in store. It was a time to build, a time to connect, a time of hope, and a time of change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{search for}} Kilroy {{initially}} {{began as a}} routine missing persons investigation. Students that were reported missing in Matamoros in the past would often turn up in the following days with a hangover and blurry memory of what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Kilroy {{was one of the}} 60 people who had disappeared in Matamoros {{in the first three months}} of 1989. However, his case drew more attention in the U.S. because his uncle, Ken Kilroy, worked at the United States Customs Service in Los Angeles. When the news reached his uncle, a police task force was created in Brownsville to search for Kilroy. Alarmed with the bad publicity of his disappearance and the potential effects of tourism in Matamoros, local police officers tried to shift the blame and suggested that Kilroy had disappeared in Brownsville. Kilroy's friends denied such claims. The Mexican federal police force vowed to work on the case and help U.S. investigators. One of the commanders assigned Mexican agents to U.S. officials to accompany them in Matamoros. Together they questioned informants, potential witnesses, and worked on tips provided by their sources.|$|E

2500|$|Whenever {{the persons}} in the masks gave a signal, {{the people who were}} in the queues were taken away from the queue to a side. [...] When this {{operation}} was completed, 158 persons who were pulled out from the queues were taken away by the Army despite the protests by their kith and kin. [...] There was evidence to show that the arrests were done by the Kommathurai Army camp with the assistance of personnel from other army camps as well and that the following Army officers were directing the operations as Capt. Munas, Capt. Palitha, Capt. Gunarathna, Major. Majeed, and [...] Major. Monan. Some of these names were alias. There was also evidence to show that one Gerry de Silva had visited the refugee camp on [...] 8 September. 1990 and had told the officers responsible for the administration of the refugee camp that all 158 persons who were taken into custody on 5 September 1990 were found guilty. [...] However he had declined to say what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> after they were found guilty. There was further evidence to say that one of the officers who were in charge of the refugee camp made a request to the army personnel in charge of the operations, to give a list of persons arrested for which there was no response.|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} the first to feature Campbell's hero Aarn Munro.

6000|$|But English {{people do}} not {{understand}} these things. Their Empire is an accident. It was made for them by their exceptional and outcast men, {{and in the end}} it will be lost, I fear, by the intellectual inertness of their commonplace and dull-minded leaders. Empire <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and civilisation <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as fresh lettuces come to tame rabbits. They do not understand how they got, and they will not understand how to keep. Art, thought, literature, all indeed that raises men above locality and habit, all that can justify and consolidate the Empire, is nothing <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> They are provincials mocked by a world-wide opportunity, the stupid legatees of a great generation of exiles. They go out of town for the [...] "shootin'," [...] and come back for the fooleries of Parliament, and to see what the Censor has left of our playwrights and Sir Jesse Boot of our writers, and to dine in restaurants and wear clothes.|$|R

50|$|Disabled {{people are}} more {{vulnerable}} to sexual abuse {{than the general population}} for numerous reasons.

Victims often not taken seriously due to ableism which intersects with societal myths about sexual violence, for example, that 'ugly' people aren't raped, since society's beauty standard devalues disability.|$|R
