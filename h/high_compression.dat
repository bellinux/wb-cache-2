5|$|Through an as yet {{unspecified}} channel, {{he obtained}} <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> pistons {{used in the}} latest Hispano-Suiza 8 or V8 engine and fitted them to his power plant. It delivered revolutions at a much faster rate on the test bench. He removed any excess weight by shortening the exhaust pipes by several feet. He also added a spinner from a captured enemy aircraft which he believed added an extra 3mph to his speed while also reducing the wing dihedral to increase agility.|$|E

50|$|The <b>higher</b> <b>compression</b> {{ratio in}} diesels means they {{are harder to}} start, but once they are running the energy {{expended}} in compressing air is regained during the expansion stroke when the compressed air is allowed to 'spring' back, so the <b>higher</b> <b>compression</b> ratio doesn't cause any engine braking.|$|R

25|$|Their main {{drawback}} {{is that they}} cannot achieve the <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> ratio of reciprocating compressors without multiple stages. There are few one-stage centrifugal compressors capable of pressure ratios over 10:1, due to stress considerations which severely limit the compressor's safety, durability and life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|There were low- and high-compression {{versions}} of the 327 starting in 1960. Prior to 1960 all 327s were <b>high</b> <b>compression.</b> All low compression models used a two-barrel carburetor and all high-compression models received a four-barrel carb. Low-compression is 8.7:1, high 9.7:1, effected by a difference in pistons.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia is {{sometimes}} proposed {{as a practical}} alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines. Its high octane rating of 120 and low flame temperature allows the use of <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> ratios without a penalty of high NOx production. Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.|$|E
25|$|Three prototypes were ordered, {{the only}} twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{to be built}} by Sopwith. The first prototype was completed in December 1918, but no Dragonfly engines were available, so it was fitted with 240hp (179kW) Siddeley Puma engines to allow flight testing, making its maiden flight in April 1919. It was later re-engined with more-powerful, <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> Pumas, rated at 290hp (220kW), being tested at RAF Martlesham Heath in March 1920.|$|E
25|$|The -A, -C and -E {{variants}} of the carbureted O-320, {{but none of}} the <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> or fuel-injected versions, have available STCs that allow the use of automotive fuel as a replacement for more expensive avgas. However, in some cases the D series engine, with a fuel-pump modification, is allowed to use minimum 91 octane automotive gas as part of an STC for the Piper aircraft to which it is attached.|$|E
50|$|All {{compression}} {{is based}} on an integer reversible wavelet compression kernel, with non-linear quantizer to achieve <b>higher</b> <b>compression.</b> Compression data-rates typically range from 10:1 to 3.5:1, based on quality settings.

25|$|Only a minor {{facelift}} with revised grille and taillight trim {{marked the}} 1970 Electra 225. The big news {{was under the}} hood, where a new 370-horsepower 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This was the final year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum brake drums and <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> engines. New this year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield.|$|E
25|$|Mazda has {{undertaken}} research on HCCI ignition for its SkyActiv-R rotary engine project, using research from its SkyActiv Generation 2 program. A constraint of rotary engines {{is the need}} to locate the spark plug outside the combustion chamber to enable the rotor to sweep past. Mazda confirmed that the problem had been solved in the SkyActiv-R project. Rotaries generally have <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> ratios, making them particularly suitable for the use of HCCI.|$|E
25|$|The Pawnee C was an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} 'B' model and was available with a 235hp or a 260hp <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> version of the O-540 engine and either a fixed pitch or constant speed propeller. The fuselage of the Pawnee C featured a quickly detachable 'turtledeck' panel to ease the rinsing out of spilt corrosive agents from the fuselage structure and to facilitate servicing and inspection of components housed in the rear section of the fuselage.|$|E

25|$|ED95 designates a {{blend of}} 95% ethanol and 5% {{ignition}} improver; it is used in modified diesel engines where <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> is used to ignite the fuel, {{as opposed to the}} operation of gasoline engines, where spark plugs are used. This fuel was developed by Swedish ethanol producer SEKAB. Because of the high ignition temperatures of pure ethanol, the addition of ignition improver is necessary for successful diesel engine operation. A diesel engine running on ethanol also has a higher compression ratio and an adapted fuel system.|$|E
25|$|There {{is thus a}} filesize {{trade-off}} {{between high}} color depth, maximal metadata (including color space information, together with information that does not affect display), interlacing, and speed of compression, which all yield large files, with lower color depth, fewer or no ancillary chunks, no interlacing, and tuned but computationally intensive filtering and compression. For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file may be best for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file may be best for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.|$|E
25|$|JPEG {{compression}} artifacts blend {{well into}} photographs with detailed non-uniform textures, allowing higher compression ratios. Notice how a higher compression ratio first affects the high-frequency textures in the upper-left {{corner of the}} image, and how the contrasting lines become more fuzzy. The very <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> ratio severely affects {{the quality of the}} image, although the overall colors and image form are still recognizable. However, the precision of colors suffer less (for a human eye) than the precision of contours (based on luminance). This justifies the fact that images should be first transformed in a color model separating the luminance from the chromatic information, before subsampling the chromatic planes (which may also use lower quality quantization) in order to preserve the precision of the luminance plane with more information bits.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} Jupiter Fighter was {{evaluated}} at Martlesham Heath and found wanting, being lost on 23 November 1923 when the engine seized at high altitude, {{the second was}} sent to Sweden for evaluation, where it coped excellently with the extreme cold of the Swedish winter, with the Jupiter, using normal fuels and winter motor oil, operating without trouble in temperatures which normally caused engine oil to freeze in hours. The second Type 76 was therefore purchased by the Swedish Air Force, who operated it from May 1924 until 1935, when it was sold to a private buyer, finally being written off in 1936. The final Type 76 {{was used as a}} testbed for a <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> version of the Jupiter intended for use at high altitudes, which was fitted with a bi-fuel system to allow use of alcohol at low altitudes, then switching to normal petrol once the aircraft had reached sufficient altitude to prevent premature detonation (Engine knocking). This system was rejected in favour of supercharging.|$|E
25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{the model}} was not free from shortcomings. Since 1973, the growing problem of air {{pollution}} (specially in Mexico City) forced the Mexican government to schedule the beginning of emission certification to all engines produced in the country, which would take effect in 1974. This would affect all <b>high</b> <b>compression</b> engines of all marques. For this reason, the 258 cu in six cylinder had dropped from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1 compression ratio in the change between 1973 and 1974. However, this change {{was not enough to}} comply with the government standards and VAM was forced to decrease compression even more in mid 1974. This meant a final 7.6:1 compression ratio for the 258 cu in six engine for {{the second half of the}} year production of the 1974 Rambler American Rally. For this reason, the aforementioned model along with the 1975 American Rally became the lowest performing examples of VAM's original compact sporty model, ending even below the stock 155hp 232 cu in six cylinder of the 1969 Rambler American Rally and the stock 232 1970-1972 Rambler American two-door sedans. The improvements in the form of the four-speed transmission and electronic ignition were insufficient to overcome the problem.|$|E
