5000|$|By 2 September, William Couch, a {{civilian}} flying instructor, and Scott Field Commander, Major George E. A. Reinburg, {{made the first}} flight from Scott Field in a Standard J-1 two-seater biplane. At least seven J-1s were already on Scott; {{by the time the}} first Curtiss JN-4D [...] "Jenny" [...] arrived. Operable from the front or rear seat, the 8-cylinder, 90- horsepower, Jenny would become the primary trainer used on Scott Field. [...] Everything moved fast in a wartime environment, including the dangerous act of learning to fly airplanes. A judgment error or weather shift could produce severe accidents in the fragile aircraft of the day, so it soon became apparent that Scott Field needed a medical air evacuation capability.Determined to improve the recovery of Scott's downed pilots, Captains Charles Bayless (post surgeon), Early Hoag (officer-in-charge of flying) and A.J. Etheridge (post engineer), along with Second Lieutenant Seth Thomas, designed two air ambulances, or hospital planes—using a configuration likely modeled after one in use at Gerstner Field, Louisiana. By the summer of 1918, Scott <b>Field's</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department</b> had completed the rear cockpit modifications needed to convert two Jennies. Not long thereafter, on 24 August 1918, as aviator with a broken leg became Scott's first air evacuated patient.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} which makes the wavelet-Galerkin method {{unsuitable}} for solving general electromagnetic problems {{is a lack of}} exact representations of the connection coefficients. This paper presents the mathematical formulae and computer procedures for computing some common connection coefficients. The characteristic of the present formulae and procedures is that the arbitrary point values of the connection coefficients, rather than the dyadic point values, can be determined. A numerical example is also given to demonstrate the feasibility of using the wavelet-Galerkin method to solve <b>engineering</b> <b>field</b> problems. <b>Department</b> of Electrical EngineeringIndustrial CentreAuthor name used in this publication: S.

40|$|Abstract- In {{response}} to current and future demands upon the Navy for technical expertise in the power and power electronics <b>fields,</b> the Electrical <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> at the United States Naval Academy has launched an initiative to develop a power engineering concentration within the EE major. To formulate and develop this concentration, priorities for student learning have been established within a twofold mission statement: to develop and equip future Naval Officers and to produce competent and qualified future civilian engineers. From this perspective, course content, sequencing, laboratory experiments, classroom demonstrations, and student research and design projects have been proposed. Along the way, attention was given to structuring the class material {{within the framework of}} learning objectives and outcome assessments necessary for meeting ABET accreditation. This paper will present a detailed discussion on this process highlighting the selections made, emphasizing the goals and objectives for student learning, and presenting a status update on the implementation of this effort...|$|R
