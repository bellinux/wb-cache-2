40|$|Copyright @ 2011 ElsevierThe sudden rupture of a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>piping</b> {{system is}} a safety-related issue and {{has been the subject}} of {{extensive}} study and discussed in several industrial reports (e. g. [2], [3] and [4]). The dynamic plastic response of the deforming pipe segment under the blow-down force of the escaping liquid is termed pipe whip. Because of the potential damage that such an event could cause, various geometric and kinematic features of this phenomenon have been modelled from the point of view of dynamic structural plasticity. After a comprehensive summary of the behaviour of in-plane deformation of pipe runs [9] and [10] that deform in 2 D in a plane, the more complicated case of 3 D out-of-plane deformation is discussed. Both experimental studies and modelling using analytical and FE methods have been carried out and they show that, for a good estimate of the “hazard zone” when unconstrained pipe whip motion could occur, a large displacement analysis is essential. The classical, rigid plastic, small deflection analysis (e. g. see [2] and [8]), is valid for estimating the initial failure mechanisms, however it is insufficient for describing the details and consequences of large deflection behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The Tokamak Cooling Water System {{of nuclear}} {{facility}} has the function {{to remove heat}} from plasma facing components maintaining coolant temperatures, pressures and flow rates as required and, depending on thermal-hydraulic requirements, its systems are defined as <b>High</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Piping</b> (HEP) because they contain fluids, such as water or steam, at a pressure {{greater than or equal}} to 2. 0 MPa and/or at a temperature {{greater than or equal to}} 100 °C, or even gas at pressure above the atmospheric one. The French standards contemplate the need to consider the whipping effect on HEP design. This effect happens when, after a double ended guillotine break, the reaction force could create a displacement of the piping which might affect adjacent components. A research campaign has been performed, in cooperation by ITER Organization and University of Palermo, to outline the procedure to check whether whipping effect might occur and assess its potential damage effects so to allow their mitigation. This procedure is based on the guidelines issued by U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The proposed procedure has been applied to the analysis of the whipping effect of divertor primary heat transfer system HEP, using a theoretical-computational approach based on the finite element method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Type IV {{creep damage}} in welded <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>piping</b> {{has been an}} {{industry}} problem over the years. Ultrasonic examination is one technique that helps detect creep damage at early stages. Current ultrasonic methods range from traditional pulse echo techniques, that requires a traditional raster scan, {{to the time of}} flight Diffraction (TOFD) technique, that requires a traditional pulse echo technique performing traditional raster scans. Although generally viewed as a higher-cost inspection method, ultrasonic imaging methods continue to improve, both in terms of cost and the amount of quality information they provide. With recent technological improvements, an advanced phased array system has been developed for detection of cracking occurred in the heat affected zone (HAZ), outside of the weld metal. This paper will discuss the investigation of TOFD and phase array techniques for the inspection of type IV cracking, and the development of advanced seam weld inspection system. Introduction: Although the safety and remaining life of high energy steam piping in fossil power plants has been a concern, the frequency of leaks and catastrophic failures of main steam and hot reheat piping systems in United States[1, 2] continue to support the need for developing improved methods of evaluating and monitoring the condition of these piping systems. With the increasing nuclear base load capacity, older fossil plants have been relegated to peaking or cycling duty, raising even more the concern by utilities for the acceleration of degradatio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{remaining}} life {{assessment of}} components in a {{thermal power plant}} operating in the creep regime has drawn considerable attention. The structural integrity of such critical components is essential for operational safety, reliability and economic plant operation. Boiler headers and <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>pipings</b> operating at <b>high</b> temperatures and pressure are subjected to different degradation mechanisms synergistically. A finite-element analysis based real-time monitoring system for four 210 MW units of a power station of NTPC Ltd. is evaluating creep and fatigue usage factors being accrued in the components. The candidate components under 24 x 7 assessments are super-heater-outlet-header, re-heater outlet and inlet headers, and the piping bends before the control valves of intermediate pressure turbine of each unit. The cyclic stresses with a mean stress at an elevated temperature lead to a damage mechanism due to creep, fatigue and creep fatigue interaction. The process data i. e., steam pressure, steam temperature and steam flows of the components are made available through a local plant information server on a real-time basis. The system evaluates the material temperature, stress and usage factors due to creep, fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction and computes the remaining life fraction in all the components. The application of a real-time monitoring system thus enables the on-line damage assessments followed by surveillance inspection of critical components of a station comprehensively...|$|R
40|$|Over {{recent years}} the concept of leak-before-break (LBB) has been {{considered}} in establishing safety cases for piping particularly for the nuclear industry. The LBB concept {{is viewed as a}} more realistic design criterion in the design of <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> fluid <b>piping</b> as compared with the double-ended guillotine break as a design criterion, which gives rise to many problems. The concept of LBB aims at the application of fracture mechanics to demonstrate that pipes are very unlikely to experience sudden, catastrophic break without prior indication of detectable leakage. This report is intended to give a review of LBB research activities that have been or are being conducted throughout the world on the basis of literature published up to 1990. Its introduction deals with the background, approach and limitations of LBB. A review of research work related to LBB gives details of nuclear piping studies carried out in different countries.

40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of seamed fossil <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>piping</b> {{has become a}} major safety and O&M issue again with eight recent failures of seam-welded piping since 1992. These include failure of six superheat link piping segments, two of them catastrophic, and the failures of two long-seamed bends in hot reheat lines. Advanced methods of inspecting piping welds with ultrasonic techniques, such as Time Of Flight Diffraction and Focused/Phased Arrays, is pushing back the envelop of detection to earlier stages of creep damage. But these are still very expensive and involve considerable logistics planning and downtime to perform. EPRI has sponsored development activities since 1986 to mature the utilization of a real-time online evaluation method for seam-welded piping: Acoustic Emission (AE) Guidelines were published in 1995, and over 90 full-scale tests have been performed from 1996 - 2003 to develop a database and correlate results with other established evaluation methods. Tests to date have shown high sensitivity to early stage creep damage, which is evidenced by development of cavities (cavitation) around nonmetallic inclusions and carbides in the grain boundaries of the weld heat affected zone and fusion zone. Successful double-blind testing with advanced ultrasonsic inspection methods, and additional confirmation with advanced cryo-cracking metallography, have proven both the reliability and sensitivity of the AE technique. The economics of the method are highly favorable. Only small areas of insulation need to be removed every 4. 6 - 6. 1 m (15 - 20 ft) to weld “waveguides” to the piping surface. These form a linear location array along the length of piping, providing global coverage of the piping system. Testing is performed online with normal peak loading and load cycling.

40|$|Repair {{rather than}} {{replacement}} of pressure vessel components operating at elevated temperatures {{is becoming a}} far more viable option, with welding being used increasingly for repair, replacement, retrofits and modifications. However, the considerable cost and time involved in performing conventional post weld heattreatment (PWHT) is increasingly forcing utility owners to turn toward other alternatives, such as cold weld repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs to achieve tempering of the HAZ. One such cold weld repair was applied to a prematurely failed reheater outlet header (RHOH) in an emergency situation, enabling its return to service until a replacement component was available. Investigation of this particular repair constitutes a core component of this thesis. Much of the research that has been conducted to justify cold repair techniques has used accelerated high temperature creep testing to demonstrate their integrity. How well this testing reflects real-life performance of repaired components remains uncertain. However, the present study provided {{a rare opportunity to}} evaluate the effects of service exposure on the performance of an emergency cold weld repair, as well as to examine the effectiveness of accelerated laboratory creep testing on creep life predictions for the repair weld, the original fabrication welds and the service exposed parent metal. The metallurgical and mechanical properties of the service-exposed non-PWHT temper bead (TB) repair weld were analysed and characterised systematically relative to both the service-exposed original fabrication weld and parent metal. All test specimens were machined transverse to the welding direction, from 20 mm thick slices taken from both the TB repair and original fabrication weldments. The mechanical property characterisation involved hot tensile (miniature sample), Charpy V-notch impact, hardness and accelerated creep-rupture testing. The microstructural characterisation consisted of compositional analysis, surface replication and conventional metallography, post-test fractography, high-resolution microscopy (SEM, TEM and EBSD), EDS and dilatometry. The microstructural studies were successful in characterising the service-exposed TB repair weld metal both in the as-received and post-test conditions. The findings generally showed the TB repair weld metal microstructure was significantly {{different from those of the}} parent and fabrication weld metals. This was established by the TEM and EBSD studies which showed finer carbides, higher dislocation density and limited subgrain formation, features which are consistent with structure of high stored strain energy. The finer carbides, significant Fe content of some carbides and the presence of Mo-rich carbides are also consistent with a relatively early stage in the carbide evolution sequence for this steel. Additionally, the non-metallic inclusions, which are generally considered to be deleterious to properties, were fine scale and uniform in size distribution. These microstructural characteristics were reflected in superior mechanical properties for all tests, with the notable exception of creep performance. In terms of creep resistance, weld repairs of this kind install a high energy microstructure (finer carbides, higher dislocation density, fine grain structure and subgrain / cell structure) into significantly creep degraded material and generate sharp gradients in microstructure and properties. Overall, the microstructural observations in the service-aged condition and the mechanical properties determined by the experimental work were found to support the conclusion that the ex-service material had clearly not exhausted its creep service-life. This was proven by simulating further service life using accelerated creep testing. During these experiments, the creep failure mode was found to be ductile fracture induced by micro-void coalescence. The tests indicated that although the predicted creep life of the TB repair weldment was inferior to the aged parent metal, it was slightly higher than that of the service-exposed fabrication weldment. It is therefore concluded that the TB repair weld and its associated HAZ did not compromise the overall weldment integrity. This conclusion is drawn despite the finding that the accelerated creep test data for the repair weld showed sub-normal creep performance relative to NT samples and even the aged parent metal. This outcome is probably due to the “accelerated” test conditions which induced structural changes that are unlikely to occur under the actual service conditions. Therefore, accelerated creep test data should be treated with circumspection, particularly for structures such as cold repair weld metal which are characterised by high stored strain energy. The instability of this kind of structure in relation to restoration processes (at the “accelerated” temperatures used for testing) is likely to produce premature creep failure and result in a highly conservative creep life assessment. The perceived danger of cold repair welding is that the vessel integrity will be impaired by the absence of a PWHT to reduce internal stresses, liberate hydrogen and improve mechanical properties. However, the evidence obtained in this study indicates that this need not be the case. Therefore, it is concluded that the TB weld technique can be successfully applied to <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>piping</b> (HEP) components without the need for PWHT. The results of the investigation provide new insights into the microstructure and properties, particularly the creep performance, of service-aged cold repair welds. The research has also revealed a serious limitation of accelerated creep testing of weld repair structures of this kind, in that dynamic restoration processes can be induced that are unlikely to occur at the lower service operating temperatures and stresses...|$|E
