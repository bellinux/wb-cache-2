5|$|Mon thong is {{the most}} commercially sought after for its thick, {{full-bodied}} creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> terms of its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. There are more than 100 registered cultivars since the 1920s in Malaysia and up to 193 cultivars by 1992, and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been achieved through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute. A recently popular variety is, Cat Mountain King or Musang King.|$|E

25|$|Authentic human {{happiness}} for Plotinus {{consists of}} the true human identifying with that which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> the universe.

500|$|During {{the time}} Hoffman held the career record for saves, many still {{considered}} Rivera the best closer of all time. Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman {{was compared to}} Rivera and his success in the playoffs. While Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, [...] "Not everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times." [...] His last postseason save was in 2006, which was also his first postseason save in eight years. [...] Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single lead. Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs. John Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight years, believes the Yankees {{would have been just}} as successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera. David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, said, [...] " [...] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities there. The way they go about it, they're the best in the game. Trevor's the best in the West and [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> the East." [...] Rivera, however, broke Hoffman's career save record in 2011.|$|E
