50|$|Version 1.0.3 {{improved}} the multiplayer experience {{and increased the}} stability and performance. Also, new features were added like an anti-join lag feature. Much to {{the pleasure of the}} community, <b>flatspotting</b> was also reintroduced to the simulation. Version 1.0.3 was positively received by the simracing community.|$|E
5000|$|Backtrack {{began in}} 2008 {{with the release}} of a demo titled The '08 Demo via <b>Flatspot</b> Records. They {{released}} an EP in 2009 via 6131 Records titled Deal With The Devil.|$|R
5000|$|... rFactor 2 is {{the first}} {{consumer}} simulation featuring a thermomechanical physically-based tire model, based on first principles, simulating the entire carcass, thread, and contact patch, with proper heat transfer, accurate tire wear, <b>flatspots,</b> and visual deformation. It's also the first to feature truly dynamic track conditions.|$|R
50|$|After several {{attempts}} {{to regain the}} lead, Alesi decided to conserve his tires, and let Senna go. Meanwhile, Nelson Piquet had progressed from sixth on the grid to third by lap 17. Brake trouble caused him to <b>flatspot</b> his tires, however, and on lap 28 he pitted for new ones. This allowed Thierry Boutsen's Williams through, and though he battled a problem with his engine intermittently cutting out, he maintained third place to the flag. Piquet {{had to settle for}} fourth in his first drive for Benetton.|$|R
50|$|In Malaysia he was penalised five {{places for}} {{blocking}} Nick Heidfeld's BMW Sauber {{in the latter}} stages of qualifying, dropping to eighth. Kovalainen finished the race third as Hamilton faced problems in the pits, and Ferrari's Felipe Massa retired due to a spin. In Bahrain he <b>flatspotted</b> a tyre on the first lap and was consequently well off {{the pace of the}} Ferraris and the BMW Saubers. Towards the end he improved and recorded the fastest lap of the race again, coming home fifth.|$|R
5000|$|... rFactor 2 also {{features}} realistic tire wear and damage. This punishes the player for locking up the brakes because a <b>flatspot</b> will occur with force feedback vibrations (tire suddenly has edges {{instead of being}} perfectly round) and a car imbalance (due to the lost weight of the burnt off tire). Until the tires are changed during a pit stop, the car will feel imbalanced and uncomfortable to drive. Using bad driving techniques will also punish the player with tires overheating and wearing unevenly. Tire punctures are also featured though not visually represented in-game.|$|R
3000|$|In 1992, acomprehensive three-component ocean bottom {{seismic survey}} was {{performed}} in the central and northern area of the Vøring Basin, offshore mid-Norway, NE Atlantic. An {{important part of the}} data acquisition program consisted of a local survey with 20 Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBS) dropped at approximately 200 m interval in 1300 m water depth. The main purpose of the local survey was to acquire densely sampled P- and S-wave reflection data above a seismic <b>flatspot</b> anomaly observed earlier, in order to more accurately predict if hydrocarbons could be related to it. The conventional reflection data processing methods applied to the vertical components included predictive deconvolution in order to attenuate low frequency ringing, near offset mute and a series of constant velocity stacks in order to obtain the optimal velocity function. The final result is a “trouser” shaped, high resolution VZ stacked section with minor influence of water multiples. The inline (Vx [...]) component contains no strong multiples, and extensive near trace muting was hence not necessary to apply for this component. Velocity analysis together with ray-tracing modelling indicate that P-S-converted shear waves (reflections) represent the dominant mode. The results of the interpretation and modelling indicated a Vp/Vs-ratio of approximately 2.6 in the overburden, which suggests domination of partly unconsolidated shale, while the Vp/Vs-ratio in the assumed reservoir was approximately 1.8, which indicates a more sand dominated facies. Outside the <b>flatspot</b> area a higher Vp/Vs-ratio ratio (approximately 2.0) was estimated, indicating that hydrocarbons could be present in the assumed reservoir.|$|R
50|$|On lap 20, Alonso {{decided to}} make an early second pitstop for new tyres. Sutil and Vettel came in a lap later, but the lap on fresh tyres was enough for the Spanish driver to jump both Germans. Massa stayed out for too long and dropped {{to the back of}} the group. Räikkönen, Hamilton and Rosberg now held the top three places, all three of them {{attempting}} two-stop strategies. Alonso was fourth, Vettel fifth having passed Sutil and Massa dropped to seventh. The two Mercedes started to experience a drop-off in their lap times but Räikkönen was still able to drive at a consistent speed despite having pitted for the tyres four laps before the Mercedes drivers. The tyre issue became academic for Rosberg when he retired close to half-distance with an electrical failure. Hamilton was now vulnerable to the drivers with newer tyres. Alonso attacked and passed Hamilton on lap 32 despite his best efforts to defend. The Briton <b>flatspotted</b> his tyre and had to pit immediately and rejoined in sixth place just ahead of di Resta and Webber.|$|R
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created <b>flatspots</b> on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|R

Among the aspects of daily life represented on the walls of private tombs during the Old Kingdom in Egypt are reliefs depicting the construction of boat hulls. Examination of the twenty known reliefs and relief fragments which date to this period provides numerous insights into the technology and methodology of wooden hull construction. These reliefs were created to be blueprints of boat construction procedures but rather to ensure that the owner of the tomb would have boats in his afterlife. The majority of the procedures relate to the final stages of constru ction prior to the hull being launched. The depiction of the tools necessary for hull construction and how they we,-e used is of great relevance. Hull symmetry was checked {{with the aid of a}} plumb bob while adzes were kept ready to remove <b>flatspots.</b> The procedure of joining planks edge-to-edge with mortise-and-tencn joints is representcd with great detail in the Ty relief. Joining planks in this manner required a team of men working together while being supervised. Reliefs which show hulls with a rope truss stretching from end to end were used to tighten internal traverse lashed joinery and are not the hogging trusses seen on seagoing ships and cargo vessels. Depictions of various steps required for this procedure in most reliefs suggests thats its employment was pervasive...|$|R
40|$|The North Gjallar Ridge is a {{structural}} {{high in the}} deepwater Cretaceous Vøring Basin in the Norwegian Sea. The high {{is characterized by the}} NE-SW striking fault complex defined at Base Tertiary level. The North Gjallar Ridge displays a number of structural closures, and three of these closures are identified as prospects and is the target of prospectivity evaluations in the presented Master Thesis. Concerning the petroleum system, an effective source rock is not yet proven in the Vøring Basin. Both a Late Jurassic and a Late Cretaceous source rock have been theorized by researchers. Maturity and timing of hydrocarbon expulsion are associated with significant risk since a possible source rock in the basin will be deeply buried and the reservoir sections on the North Gjallar Ridge have experienced Late Cenomanian to Early Paleocene rifting. The reservoir sequences are of the Late Cretaceous Springar Formation and are documented by studies based on the interpretation of core samples and paleo-reconstructions. The sandstones are deposited in a sub-marine deepwater fan system sourced from East Greenland. The trap/seal combination is that of rotated fault blocks sealed by an intra Springar Formation shale layer. Hydrocarbon accumulations on the North Gjallar Ridge will most likely be in gas phase. This assumption is based on the depth at which a possible source rock is buried in the Vøring Basinand adjacent gas discoveries. The identified prospects on the North Gjallar Ridge have been informally named; the Kliningen Prospect, Merraskaret Prospect and the Hårskallen Prospect. Recoverable resources have been calculated to 5. 42 x 109 Sm 3 of gas/ 2. 62 x 109 Sm 3 of gas/ 0. 68 x 109 Sm 3 of gas, respectively. The volumes are relatively modest, but could be of interest if nearby discoveries are developed, allowing prospects on the North Gjallar Ridge tobe tied back to existing installations. The probabilities for technical discoveries for the Kliningen Prospect, Merraskaret Prospect and the Hårskallen Prospect are calculated to be 0. 43 / 0. 08 / 0. 08, respectively. The high probability of discovery of the Kliningen Prospect is due to the assumption that an observed seismic <b>flatspot</b> in the prospect is regarded as an actual direct hydrocarbon indicator. Issues regarding retention and petroleum charge are reflected in the low probabilities of discovery of the Merraskaret and the Hårskallen prospects. </p...|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the race on Sunday, Hamilton got away slowly but was able to keep both Pérez and Räikkönen behind him while Rosberg {{retained}} the lead. Further back, Fernando Alonso made contact with Felipe Nasr and then crashed into Pastor Maldonado, who was forced to retire. Alonso needed to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive-through penalty, dropping him {{to the end of the}} field. Meanwhile, Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel made up places, sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after the first lap. Valtteri Bottas on the other hand lost positions, finding himself in tenth. Rosberg soon built a lead of over one second, giving Hamilton no chance to deploy DRS for an overtake manoeuvre. By lap 5, both Kvyat and Nasr had come into the pits for the harder compound tyre, followed by Ricciardo, Massa and Pérez one lap later. On lap seven, both Hülkenberg and Sainz Jr. made pit stops. While Hülkenberg was able to stay ahead of Massa, Sainz's stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to a problem with the tyre change. Another two laps later, Valtteri Bottas pitted and was sent out into the path of Button, damaging his front wing, which he needed to replace the following lap. He also received a five-second penalty to be served at his next scheduled stop. The leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven, with the order now being Rosberg ahead of Vettel, who was yet to stop, Hamilton, and Räikkönen. Romain Grosjean, who started on the harder tyres just as Vettel, was up to sixth.On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth place and one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second position. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg had built up a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created <b>flatspots</b> on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29.
