However, this would suffer from the further problem of abandoning b − τ Yukawa coupling unification except possibly in the case of high tanβ [1].

40|$|We study a new {{mechanism}} {{for the production of}} dark matter in the universe which does not rely on thermal equilibrium. Dark matter is populated from the thermal bath subsequent to inflationary reheating via a massive mediator whose mass is above the reheating scale, T_R. To this end, we consider models with an extra U(1) gauge symmetry broken at some intermediate scale M, of the order of 10 ^ 10 [...] 10 ^ 12 GeV. We show that not only does the model allow for gauge coupling unification (at a higher scale associated with grand unification) but can naturally provide a dark matter candidate which is a Standard Model singlet but charged under the extra U(1). The <b>intermediate</b> scale <b>gauge</b> boson(s) which are predicted in several E 6 /SO(10) constructions can be a natural mediator between dark matter and the thermal bath.

40|$|Vacuum {{stability}} in the Standard Model is problematic as the Higgs quartic self-coupling runs negative at a renormalization scale of about 10 ^ 10 GeV.

G_int is broken by the vacuum expectation value of a 126 of SO(10) which not only provides for neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism but also preserves a discrete Z_ 2 that can account for the stability of a dark matter candidate, here taken to be the Standard Model singlet component of a bosonic 16. We show {{that in addition to}} these features the model insures the positivity of the Higgs quartic coupling through its interactions to the dark matter multiplet and 126. We also show that the Higgs mass squared runs negative triggering electroweak symmetry breaking. Thus, the vacuum stability is achieved along with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and captures two more important elements of supersymmetric models without low-energy supersymmetry. The conditions for perturbativity of quartic couplings and for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking lead to tight upper and lower limits on the dark matter mass, respectively, and this dark matter mass region (1. 35 - 2 TeV) can be probed in future direct detection experiments.
