25|$|Unlike the chant-like verses, the antiphon <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> short hymn-verse in {{a regular}} metre. The tempo of the antiphon is {{directly}} related to that of the verse: the one-beat-in-the-bar verse equals the beat unit, typically crotchet (quarter note) or dotted crotchet, of the antiphon. There should be no break between psalm and antiphon: each should follow the other without interruption.|$|E

25|$|The rest of Buxtehude's {{keyboard}} music {{does not}} employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas {{are the only}} strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude's oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind. There are also three pieces labelled fugues: only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 {{is more of a}} canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> typical Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.|$|E
25|$|The {{recombinant}} {{building is}} a lesson in engineering and architecture. Thirty thousand square feet of studios and seminar spaces, a workshop, a thesis pit and a bridge to the library have been stacked, cantilevered and suspended to form an open-ended, permissive, flexible space. It seems that anything can happen within these walls. Enter a studio through its doorway (which has no door), and you are standing on what <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stage, looking out through a proscenium framed by new steel posts and girders set parallel to and {{in tandem with the}} old concrete columns and beams.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} {{at that time}} went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three-toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes {{could be explained by}} a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bush than a straight line.|$|E

25|$|Outside Western cultures, male {{clothing}} includes {{skirts and}} skirt-like garments. One common form {{is a single}} sheet of fabric folded and wrapped around the waist, such as the dhoti/veshti or lungi in India, and sarong in South and Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka. In Myanmar {{both women and men}} wear a longyi, a wraparound tubular skirt like a sarong that reaches to the ankles for women and to mid-calf for men. There are different varieties and names of sarong depending on whether the ends are sewn together or simply tied. There is a difference in the way a dhoti and lungi is worn. While a lungi <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wrap around, wearing the dhoti involves the creation of pleats by folding it. A dhoti also passes between the legs making it more like a folded loose trouser rather than a skirt.|$|E
25|$|Berlin is {{situated}} in northeastern Germany, {{in an area of}} low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The Berliner Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow Plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets {{at the end of the}} last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.|$|E

Overall Mars-Jones thought that [...] "James Bond <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> low-tar cigarette than anything else – less stimulating than the throat-curdling gaspers of yesteryear, but still naggingly implicated in unhealthiness, a feeble bad habit without the kick of a vice." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't understand when people say the first half lacked pace. A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E

A critic from Stereo Review {{was pleased with}} Streisand's Funny Lady, stating that it [...] "will surely bring out the ravening glutton I suspect is lurking in all who are her fondest fans". However, the reviewer did warn that soundtrack did not contain anything for those of a [...] "dispassionate and temperate nature". Also positive was a critic from Film, who called the album [...] "more satisfying than the film". Initially, AllMusic's William Ruhlmann awarded the album 2 out of 5 stars. He was critical of Caan's singing abilities, finding it hard [...] "to endure the singing of James Caan". In his review of the 1998 reissued CD, Ruhlmann listed [...] "Am I Blue" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album; he called it the [...] "chief virtue of the soundtrack , even if she sometimes camped [...] up". Allison J. Waldman, author of The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook, was disappointed by the soundtrack, claiming that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hodgepodge of a soundtrack". She also stated that it was [...] "not nearly as well-produced" [...] as the soundtrack for the predecessor, Funny Girl (1968).|$|E
500|$|X Japan are {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan [...] "Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock". In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement's development, saying [...] "when we started the band, the problem was we didn’t belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make-up and crazy outfits. So we couldn’t belong anywhere", [...] " [...] that eventually became visual kei." [...] He added [...] "But visual kei <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spirit, it’s not a music style or, you know... I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that’s what I believe visual kei is." [...] Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboards Steve McClure declared it [...] "the end of an era", explaining [...] "X were the first generation of visual kei bands For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it.

500|$|In a mixed review, Edge {{felt that}} the {{gameplay}} [...] "takes {{the best and worst}} of Resident Evils past and present, and spot welds them together unevenly. If the designers had committed wholeheartedly to either polarity of action or horror, Revelations may have been a headshot, but what we're left with <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> glancing blow." [...] GameSpot praised the gameplay for its stop-and-shoot action and use of the Genesis scanner, saying that it [...] "nicely complements the resource scavenging that underpins your survival." [...] Game Informer {{felt that the}} weapon customization allows for different playstyles, but also criticized the game's lack of enemy variety in comparison to other games in the series. Jonathan Deesing of G4 praised the exploration of the cruise ship setting, comparing it favorably to Super Metroid. However, he criticized the controls for being frustrating and the AI-controlled companions for being useless. Similarly, IGN remarked that the fact that the player is accompanied by a partner makes the game less scary. The Raid Mode was seen as a valuable addition to the game. Eurogamer stated that the mode [...] "is a great concept for 3DS" [...] and the game [...] "executes it with conviction" [...] due to its unlockable features, challenge, and replayability.|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time magazine, {{considered}} the film a [...] "by the numbers adaptation," [...] criticising {{the pace and}} the [...] "charisma-free" [...] lead actors. CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves [...] "are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jamboree inside Rowling's head." [...] Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: [...] "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is as bland as movies can get." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography [...] "bland and muggy," [...] {{and the majority of}} the film a [...] "solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying [...] " [...] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve." [...] He also said it suffered from [...] "a lack of imagination" [...] and wooden characters, adding, [...] "The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Carpenter pleaded to the {{producers}} {{to let her}} cut her hair in the second season of Angel, but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a [...] "dark edge of Cordelia" [...] which wasn't as [...] "warm and effervescent as she usually is", so for the third season they wanted her to [...] "go shorter and blonder". Angels third season demonstrates Cordelia's development into a fully-fledged heroine. The episode [...] "Birthday" [...] saw her being offered the chance {{to live a life}} where she never met Angel, but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half-demon who can better withstand the visions she carries. In [...] "Billy", Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly. Carpenter began to train extensively with the show's stunt co-ordinators both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry. In the episode [...] "Waiting in the Wings", both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become, with Cordelia noting she <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale. Also in this episode, she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another, but their love goes unconsummated. Critically, Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia's ascension to the heavens at the end of season three to be the [...] "point that the Mutant Enemy Productions writers evidently lost their minds". She goes on to describe how Cordelia's compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character. Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when [...] "the character who embraces her privilege (Cordelia) gets to become a higher being and exit Angel, and as an overwhelmingly positive force" [...] where later Fred (Amy Acker), [...] "the character who is conflicted about her privilege" [...] in season five [...] "ends up being possessed by a millennia-old demon".|$|E
