25|$|The precise balls {{chosen by}} the bowler during an over {{will depend on the}} {{situation}} of the match, the skill of the batsman and how settled the batsman is at the crease. It is common to attack batsmen who have recently come to the wicket with successive short-pitched balls or bouncers with the dual aim of getting them out and stopping them from settling into an attacking mode of play for as long as possible. Short balls are more risky against batsmen who have settled at the crease since they make easy boundaries, but most bowlers will still mix a few in during a spell, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> batsman guessing.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
500|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4 in 1925, their financial status was a different story. The players' salaries were so low {{that they could not}} fully dedicate themselves to the game as most of them had to work other jobs. The team's abbreviated practices, held at 4:30 PM each day so as not to conflict with work schedules, also allowed for little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. Mara had to spend $25,000 of his own money during the season <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> franchise alive. [...] This struggle continued until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting more than 73,000 fans—a pro football record. The game attracted such attention that 20,000 fans were turned away at the gates. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered the history of the franchise.|$|E

Mara had to spend $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> franchise alive, and close friend and future New York state Governor Al Smith even implored him to sell the team. Mara needed $4,000 a game to cover his own outlays and $2,000 to $6,000, depending on the team, to pay the visitors to break even. He slashed ticket prices, and gave out over 5,000 free tickets a week. Although he used some moderately successful promotional gimmicks, such as having several players from the visiting Kansas City Cowboys dress up in his cowboy outfits and ride horses around New York City to promote that weeks game, his struggle continued until the eleventh game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town attracting over 73,000 fans—setting a pro football record.

2500|$|The [...] "bass line" [...] is {{a unique}} musical {{ensemble}} consisting of graduated pitch marching bass drums commonly found in marching bands and drum and bugle corps. Each drum plays a different note, and this gives the bass line a unique task in a musical ensemble. Skilled lines execute complex linear passages split among the drums to add an additional melodic element to the percussion section. This is characteristic of the marching bass drum—its purpose is to convey complex rhythmic and melodic content, not <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> beat. The line provides impact, melody, and tempo {{due to the nature}} of the sound of the instruments. The bass line usually has from as many as seven bass drums to as few as two. But most high school drumlines consist of between 3 and 5. Bass drums used in such ensembles are usually those that use 2 mallets (formerly scorch bass drums, to distinguish them from those bass drums that formerly used one mallet, known in the 1930s as standard bass drums).|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, in his {{capacity}} as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. When a general said in a meeting, [...] "I think {{it might be a good}} idea to throw in a nuke now and then, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> other side guessing..." [...] Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia, published by the Institute for Defense Analyses, was obtained, with some redactions, by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability under the Freedom of Information act in 2002.) It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the Dick Cavett show that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because [...] "our targets were large and theirs were small." [...] (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.) ...|$|E
