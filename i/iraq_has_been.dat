25|$|The {{legality}} of the invasion of <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> challenged since its inception {{on a number of}} fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading nations have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality. It has been argued that the invasion was fully legal because authorization was implied by the United Nations Security Council. International legal experts, including the International Commission of Jurists, a group of 31 leading Canadian law professors, and the U.S.-based Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, have denounced both of these rationales.|$|E
2500|$|For decades, the LGBT {{community}} in <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{one of the}} most invisible communities in the world facing all kinds of discrimination, with barely any activism or advocacy in favor of this group.

2500|$|When {{you ask the}} question, [...] "Does Iraq possess militarily viable {{biological}} or chemical weapons?" [...] the answer is [...] "NO!" [...] It is a resounding [...] "NO". Can Iraq produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is [...] "no" [...] across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> disarmed. Iraq today possesses no meaningful {{weapons of mass destruction}} capability.|$|E
2500|$|General Petraeus's {{critical}} role in <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely acknowledged by commands of the coalition forces. In her introduction of Petraeus at the Baccalaureate ceremony for the Class of 2009, Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman described his accomplishments. While acknowledging that {{much remains to be}} accomplished in Iraq, Tilghman paid tribute to Petraeus's [...] "leadership in rethinking American military strategy through his principles of counterinsurgency", which are, she said, [...] "eliminating 'simplistic definitions of victory and defeat in favor of incremental and nuanced progress'".|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2009, General Stanley McChrystal, the {{commander}} of NATO forces in Afghanistan, planned to request an increase in teams of CIA operatives, including their elite paramilitary officers, to join with U.S. military special operations forces. This combination worked well in Iraq and is largely credited {{with the success of}} that surge. [...] There have been basically three options described in the media: McChrystal's increased counterinsurgency campaign; a counter-terror campaign using special operations raids and drone strikes; and withdrawal. The most successful combination in both the wars in Afghanistan and <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the linking up of SAD and military special forces to fight alongside highly trained indigenous units. One thing all of these options have in common is a requirement for greater CIA participation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{listed as}} a State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> also <b>been</b> on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime <b>had</b> proven to <b>be</b> {{a problem for the}} UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s.|$|R
2500|$|There's {{no doubt}} Iraq hasn't fully {{complied}} with its disarmament obligations {{as set forth}} by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capacity has been verifiably eliminated... We have to remember that this missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't amount to much, but which is still prohibited... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war. (page 28) ...|$|E

The Venezuelan immigration department, SAIME, confirmed the sold passports' genuineness as each passport came with an assigned national identification number, although the names of these individuals were altered when checking against the national database. At least one individual's place of birth was also changed from Iraq to Venezuela. The Venezuelan foreign minister, Delcy Rodriguez, denied the government's involvement when questioned by the reporters during the Seventy-first session of the United Nations General Assembly and accused [...] the network of performing what she described as an [...] "imperialistic media operation" [...] against Venezuela for airing the year-long fraud investigation.
