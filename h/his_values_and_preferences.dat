40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} developmental patterns of virtual {{groups in the}} e-learning environment. Our findings suggest that for virtual groups formed {{for the purpose of}} e-learning, dependency and inclusion characterize the initial stage of group development, as such characteristics reinforce cooperative relationships and help to build a stronger social bond among group members. This is followed by the second stage, swift work, which enables participants to labor as a team and facilitates continual collaboration among members. However, the third stage, conflict, is inevitable, as conflicts provide important diagnostic evidence for each member to assess and adjust <b>his</b> or her <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preference.</b> Finally, by overcoming conflicts, partners build strong bonding, which fosters intimate communication and provides many opportunities for frequent interactions that demonstrate concern and desire to satisfy the needs and wishes of one another. Our finding suggests that initial active dependency interactions in the first period provide a sense of coherence. Accordingly, the instructor of a virtual learning system should encourage learners to express their concern for one another in order quickly to build strong norms. In addition, as work intensifies, the instructor could aim to support both the effective interaction channels of groups as well as their task-focused activities. Finally, to improve members’ involvement and information sharing, the instructor could provide feedback to groups regarding their level of interactivity and encourage members to remind each other about {{the quality and quantity of}} individual contribution...|$|R

However, understanding social data, including people 2 ̆ 7 s <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences,</b> is critical to both effective planning and management and long-term MPA success. Having these social data in a spatial form is essential, given that MPA planning and management increasingly uses marine spatial planning (MSP) approaches to carefully locate and mediate among potentially competing uses in both space and time. An online Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was used to collect spatially explicit information on stakeholder <b>values</b> <b>and</b> management <b>preferences</b> for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s remote Kimberley region. The Kimberley coast and marine environment is characterised by a multiplicity of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences.</b> Key <b>values</b> included biological conservation, aesthetics, recreational fishing, Aboriginal culture and heritage, and nature based tourism. Management preferences were dominated by the desire to increase conservation/protection, exclude oil/gas development and commercial fishing, and to increase Aboriginal management.

The analyses of American (General Social Surveys) and British (British Cohort Study) data are consistent with this hypothesis. Additional analyses suggest that the effect of intelligence on musical preference is not a function of the cognitive complexity of music.

40|$|Background: The shared {{decision}} making (SDM) model states that patients' <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences</b> should be clarified to choose a strategy that best fits the patient. This study aimed to assess whether <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences</b> of rectal cancer patients are voiced and considered in deciding about preoperative radiotherapy (PRT), and whether this makes patients feel more involved in treatment {{decision making}}. Methods: Pre-treatment consultations of radiation oncologists and patients eligible for PRT were audio taped (N= 90). Tapes were transcribed and coded to identify patients' <b>values</b> <b>and</b> treatment <b>preferences.</b> Patients filled in a post-consultation questionnaire on their perceived involvement in decision making (N= 60). Results: Patients' values were voiced for 62 / 611 of benefits harms addressed (10 %), in 38 / 90 consultations (42 %; maximum 4 <b>values</b> per consultation), <b>and</b> most often related to major long-term treatment outcomes. Patients' treatment preferences were discussed in 20 / 90 consultations (22 %). In 16 / 90 consultations (18 %), the oncologists explicitly indicated to consider patients' values or preferences. Patients perceived a significantly {{more active role in}} decision making if their values or preferences had been voiced or considered. Conclusions: Patients' <b>values</b> <b>and</b> treatment <b>preferences</b> are voiced or considered in a minority of consultations. If they are, this increases patients' perceived involvement in the decision making process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

One of such approaches, developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group, offers systematic and transparent guidance in moving from evidence to recommendations. The GRADE strategy concentrates on four factors: the balance between benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences,</b> <b>and</b> resource considerations. However, it also considers issues around feasibility, equity, and acceptability of recommendations. GRADE distinguishes two types of recommendations: strong and weak.

Weak recommendations are appropriate when there is a close balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, uncertainty regarding the effects of the alternatives, uncertainty or variability in patients' <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>preferences,</b> or questionable cost-effectiveness. Weak recommendations usually require accessing the underlying evidence and a shared decision-making approach.

They prefer self-reliance, to make their own decisions without worrying about what others think, and enjoy competition. It seems people can be both allocentric and idiocentric, but how much they are either is dependent on the situation and how the individual defines that situation. Certain situations encourage more allocentric behavior. These are found more in some cultures than others. These situations include when people are rewarded by the social context for being group orientated, when cultural norms encourage conformity which leads to success, when goals are easier achieved through group action, and when there are not many options for acting independently.|$|R
