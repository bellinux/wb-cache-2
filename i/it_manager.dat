The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E

In 1998, Iwata helped his colleague and personal friend Shigesato Itoi establish Hobonichi by working as the company's <b>IT</b> <b>Manager.</b> He acquired this position after being asked by Itoi one month prior to the June 6 launch date to arrange a website and the company's technical systems, to which Iwata complied. Iwata personally enjoyed the role and even still held the position in 2007, despite running Nintendo full-time by this point. Soon after his promotion to president of Nintendo, Iwata assigned himself to a development team at HAL Laboratory working on Super Smash Bros. Melee, for the GameCube, to continue his programming passion. Stemming from his work with the Brain Age series, Iwata {{assisted in}} producing educational titles such as Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten DS, , and Imasara Hito ni Kikenai Otona no Joushikiryoku Training DS. He also worked on Animal Crossing, Mario, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda series of games, among other titles. He also had a cameo in [...] Iwata partook {{in the development of}} Pokémon GO, an augmented reality mobile game, starting in 2013.

40|$|Abstract—The {{evolution}} of IT management towards a more customer–centric approach has shifted <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> perspective from the IT department’s traditional {{point of view}} to the final user perception. We can state that IT department horizon line has been shifted from the business border to the end user frontier. Therefore <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> {{are more and more}} focused on services seen in the end-to-end perspective. In order to support <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> in designing services that can be guaranteed at the end users, we propose SARA, a tool for mapping contracts over end-to-end service chains. SARA aims to support <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> for assessing the actual coverage of obligations with respect to the service they must provide to final users. In this way <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> are allowed to calculate SLAs they can guarantee, given a set of already signed service contracts, and to evaluate the impact of contract variations on the service levels deployed to the final users.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} has identified many communication and leadership inadequacies amongst senior <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> and consequent breakdowns in the IT/business relationship. This paper {{goes beyond the}} largely anecdotally based evidence presented to date; it uses psychometric testing to investigate the personal and behavioural characteristics of <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> and compare these with reported characteristics of business managers. The results indicate significant differences related to issues of control and consequent leadership behaviour and task/relationship orientation. It is speculated that <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> with the personality characteristics identified in this study may tend to position IT in a service rather than a strategic role and experience greater difficulties in negotiating the IT/business relationship...|$|R

2500|$|In July 2015, the Tor Project {{announced}} {{an alliance with}} the Library Freedom Project to establish exit nodes in public libraries. The pilot program, which established a middle relay running on the excess bandwidth afforded by the Kilton Library in Lebanon, New Hampshire, making it the first library in the U.S. to host a Tor node, was briefly put on hold when the local city manager and deputy sheriff voiced concerns over the cost of defending search warrants for information passed through the Tor exit node. Although the DHS had alerted New Hampshire authorities {{to the fact that}} Tor is sometimes used by criminals, the Lebanon Deputy Police Chief and the Deputy City Manager averred that no pressure to strong arm the library was applied, and the service was re-established on 15 September 2015. U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif) released a letter on 10 December 2015, in which she asked the DHS to clarify its procedures, stating that “While the Kilton Public Library’s board ultimately voted to restore their Tor relay, I am no less disturbed by the possibility that DHS employees are pressuring or persuading public and private entities to discontinue or degrade services that protect the privacy and anonymity of U.S. citizens.” In a 2016 interview, Kilton Library <b>IT</b> <b>Manager</b> Chuck McAndrew stressed the importance of getting libraries involved with Tor: [...] "Librarians have always cared deeply about protecting privacy, intellectual freedom, and access to information (the freedom to read).Surveillance has a very well-documented chilling effect on intellectual freedom. It is the job of librarians to remove barriers to information." [...] The second library to host a Tor node was the Las Naves Public Library in Valencia, Spain, implemented in the first months of 2016.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS: A GOAL SETTING THEORY PERSPECTIVE BY VIJAY KASI Aug 30, 2007 Committee Chair: Dr. Mark Keil Major Academic Unit: Center for Process Innovation Information {{technology}} (IT) {{projects are}} prone to failure. One explanation for the high failure rate among IT projects is that managers overly commit to a failing course of action, a phenomenon referred as escalation of commitment. While the notion of goals and commitment {{are central to the}} phenomenon of escalation, very few prior studies have investigated their impact on escalation. In this study, a research model rooted in goal setting theory is advanced to better understand escalation of commitment of <b>IT</b> project <b>managers.</b> A role-playing experiment with 350 <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> was used to test the proposed research model. The results of the study suggest that <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> are more willing to escalate their commitment under the influence of easy and vague goals compared to difficult and specific goals. Initial goal commitment of <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> and the level of project completion were found to {{have a significant effect on}} <b>IT</b> <b>manager’s</b> willingness to continue. Initial goal commitment of <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> was also found to moderate the relationship between goal difficulty and willingness to continue. In other words, when there is a higher level of goal commitment, an easy goal will have a greater effect in terms of promoting an individual’s willingness to continue...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a gender {{analysis of the}} IT managerial career progression process. The research includes case studies conducted within the IT division of four companies and survey results of <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> {{carried out in the}} U K. The case studies include the collection of documentary evidence, observation and a total of fifty interviews conducted with <b>IT</b> <b>managers</b> and Personnel representatives. The case companies comprise the financial services, utility, retail and IT manufacturing sectors. This study builds on and extends existing knowledge within three areas of literature - women in management, gender and IT and career progression. Despite arguments within and between these fields of literature this study demonstrates how, due to gaps and weaknesses within each of the areas, it is necessary for them to be brought together under a single theoretical framework. Additionally, on an organisational level, by seeking out and analysing both formal and informal factors that influence the career progression of <b>IT</b> <b>managers,</b> aspects of this process that may inhibit women's IT managerial career progression are identified. This study concludes that there are aspects of both the IT management role and the associated career progression process that may be identified as gendered. Such aspects influence the career choices made by <b>IT</b> <b>managers,</b> leading to some identifiable differences i n the approaches men and women adopt in progressing their careers. In addition, it is suggested that the gendered aspects have greater negative influence on the career progression opportunities and potential of women than men <b>IT</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R
