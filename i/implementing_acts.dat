The EU agency ACER has been tasked with the supervision and regulation of energy markets in accordance with REMIT.|$|E

The Constitution then follows and after that are international law obligations, according to Article 149 of the Constitution.

5000|$|... some <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> {{required}} for the law to enter into force {{have yet to be}} passed, requiring the support of a majority of MPs. The conservative Pro Patria and Res Publica Union (IRL), which joined the government after the March 2015 elections, said that these acts should be passed in parliament rather than by the government, creating a dispute with the Reform Party and Social Democrats. On November 25, 2015, Parliament rejected a motion to kill the implementing bill at its first reading, in a 41-42 vote. On December 10, the chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee announced that the committee would not finish work on the bill and ask Parliament to begin the second reading before December 17, when Parliament adjourned until January 11. This meant that the Cohabitation Act would take effect without implementing measures, causing a number of legal loopholes and problems. Further readings were scheduled for the end of January 2016. In August 2016, a same-sex couple filed a lawsuit before the Administrative Court of Estonia for the right to enter into a cohabitation agreement. As of October 2016, the implementing measures have yet to be passed by Parliament.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{power of}} the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> including {{the debate on the}} delimitation of the scope of these acts, has dominated the debate on the scheme of non-legislative acts introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This chapter argues that approaching decision-making procedures of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> only from an institutional lens is normatively insufficient, in two respects. First, it is incongruous with the Treaty provisions on democracy: not only an inter-institutional perspective is insufficient to ensure the democratic legitimacy of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> but also it ignores the relationships between the makers of legal acts and the outer sphere composed of citizens and legally affected persons. Secondly, it also overlooks core functions of procedures that are relevant to ensure the legitimacy of public acts. Procedures are a means to rationalise public action, by channeling information, weighing competing interests, and allowing scrutiny of the choices made. If designed accordingly, procedures could concretise democracy as a Union founding principle also in the making of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} non-legislative acts {{introduced}} by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union {{was guided by}} concerns regarding the democratic legitimacy of (lato sensu) <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> of the Union. However, it has ignored the centrality of transparency in the Union's democracy {{and the role of}} participation as a complementary source of democracy. This article argues that the procedures leading to the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> are subject to the treaties' provisions on transparency and participation, and should be shaped by them. It analyses the constitutional choices underlying Articles 290 and 291, with a view to assessing whether and to what extent the material, organic and functional profiles of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> condition procedural rules on transparency and participation to be followed in their adoption...|$|E

40|$|The {{procedures}} {{guiding the}} making of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> have been conceived from a predominantly inter-institutional perspective and have not taken account of the participative democracy dimension. The system for delegation of powers set out in Articles 290 and 291 TFEU does not envisage, let alone structure, the relationships between decision-makers and the ‘outer’ sphere: those legally affected by the legal acts of the Union and the public. This dimension should not be ignored in the current constitutional framework, given that Articles 9, 10 (3), and 11 TEU establish normative parameters that should shape {{the relationships between the}} institutions and citizens, and in {{the making of}} delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts.</b> Therefore, since Articles 290 and 291 TFEU do not exhaust the constitutional framing of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> the EU legislature should provide a remedy by adopting procedural rules aimed at securing participation and transparency within the process...|$|E
40|$|The {{comitology}} regime, the committee-based system {{developed as}} a mechanism for controlling the Commission’s exercise of its powers to implement EU measures, has been subject to severe criticism on grounds of lack of accountability and transparency.

40|$|The non-representative {{character}} of the Commission’s powers {{has been used to}} level criticism at Commission acts. I review the Commission’s power to adopt {{some of the most important}} and numerous EU acts, namely delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts.</b> These acts often take direct effect on the persons within the Member States. The question I ask is how the Commission’s power to adopt acts that legally bind the persons within the Member States can be justified normatively? I explain the most pervasive characteristics of the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> as well as their conceptual categorisation. I argue that delegated and implementing rule-making should be understood in the framework of institutional trust. The relation of institutional trust can in legal terms best be depicted under the framework of fiduciary law. The Commission here takes the role of fiduciary to the persons subject to delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> as beneficiaries. As a result, the Commission is under a duty of loyalty towards these persons. I argue that for this, the EU duty of loyalty should be expanded to include a Commission duty of disinterestedness and fairness. These should be operationalised through giving an account of its motives, and through greater transparency regarding the participation of interested groups in the adoption procedure. These procedures are only a small extension of already existing Commission obligations. However, reforming them as an expression of loyalty is able to re-invent the relation between the Commission and the persons subject to its acts...|$|E

There are a total of six annexes that compose Marpol. Annex IV deals with the pollution of sewage by ships.

40|$|The {{entry into}} force of the Lisbon Treaty has {{presented}} the three EU institutions with {{a rare opportunity to}} completely re-design the system of control of the Commission’s delegated powers. Hitherto, the Commission’s ability to adopt implementing measures was controlled via the by now well-known comitology system, that has undergone only minor changes since it was introduced in the early 1960 s. Since the new Treaty distinguishes between delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> and also specifies that {{the rules of the game}} for <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> have to be decided via a co-decision regulation, all institutions attempted to secure strong control positions in the newly emerging system. Now that the new system has been finally agreed upon, this paper asks the qui bono question: Who benefits from the new system, and how did those actors get what they wanted? In our analysis we treat the negotiations on the new system as a game of structural choice, and trace back the course of the negotiations through a close analysis of formal and informal documents and interviews. Although in the end we find much support for our hypotheses, we find that the course of events in some respects has gone further than we theoretically expected...|$|E
