Every floor is also equipped with a smoke <b>exhaust</b> <b>louver</b> system which automatically activates in case of fire. Also, the building is also crowned with a helipad.|$|E
50|$|The Sholef's chassis, {{aside from}} a few minor modifications, is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Merkava Mk.III. The glacis plate is unchanged, except for the addition of a support bracket for the gun tube, which is folded down when not in use. As such, the Sholef and Merkava series share a large percentage of common components. The front-left side of the chassis has a prominent <b>exhaust</b> <b>louver,</b> along with a much smaller port just in front of it; the exact function of this port is uncertain, though the soot seen around it in photos of the Sholef suggests it may be a new or additional exhaust port, or perhaps an outlet for a smoke generator.|$|E

40|$|Potential {{bioaerosol}} infection risk {{associated with}} toilet flushing has not been sufficiently addressed {{in the design of}} residential washroom exhaust system. This study evaluates the performance of exhaust ventilation for residential washrooms in terms of air change rate, washroom size, washroom geometry, and locations of door <b>louver,</b> <b>exhaust</b> and water closet. Three bioaerosol species namely Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536), Serratia marcescens (ATCC 6911), and Cladosporium cladosporioides (ATCC 16022) are included in the simulations. By shortening the distance between the locations of exhaust and emission source (i. e. water closet), the fractional counts of bioaerosol particles exhausted can be increased. An increased air change rate and a louvered door can also improve the exhaust ventilation performance, yet with a longer time to steady state. This study should provide a useful source of reference for washroom exhaust designers to minimize bioaerosol infection risk. Practical application: This paper shows for residential washroom with an exhaust fan installed, the ventilation performance can be improved by an increased air change rate, and by shortening the distance between the locations of exhaust and emission source.
