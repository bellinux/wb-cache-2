25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Humphrey, {{that is what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not even}} {{know if there is}} such a thing as spirit. Our god was Fate; Bastin's god is a spirit, and I think yours also." ...|$|E
60|$|DICK. But I {{shall be}} {{of age in}} a year; my money's my own, it's not as if I had to ask any one's leave; and <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know my own mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was {{a little}} matter I didn't tell you just now, Miss Garland,' he said. 'About that harp thing, <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> make it, certainly, but it was my brother John who {{asked me to do}} it, just before he went away. John is very musical, as you know, and he said it would {{interest}} you; but as he didn't ask me to tell, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not. Perhaps <b>I</b> ought to have, and not have taken the credit to myself.' ...|$|R
5|$|Yeah, <b>I</b> don't know. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> still, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{the same things that}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before … <b>I</b> think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> didn’t know I was," [...] he replied, [...] "more than usual, <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> always <b>do</b> look fairly cheerful—at least, <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There’s {{nothing to}} make me look the opposite." ...|$|R
60|$|Object. 2. When I say I only seek myself, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not find}} that I do design God's glory in mine own {{salvation}} by Christ, {{and that makes}} me fear I do not come aright.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> come up." [...] She hadn't {{meanwhile}} a bit {{believed in}} his answer, convinced {{as she was}} {{that if she had}} been difficult it would be the last thing he would have told her. [...] "I'm doing," [...] she said, [...] "as I like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} understand," [...] she cried wildly, {{beginning}} to lose self-control--"It's {{not that way}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> like you; the more I've known you the more I've liked you. And {{at the same time}} the more I've known you the less would I care to marry you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, ZTT's Paul Morley {{designed}} {{a series of}} [...] "FRANKIE SAY..." [...] T-shirts to promote the record label's chart act Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH). Morley has stated that these designs were consciously based on Hamnett's slogan T-shirts: [...] "What persuaded me was reading Katharine Hamnett saying she wanted the T-shirts ripped off, which reminded me of Mark P, saying he wanted Sniffin' Glue to be ripped off. And <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a fanzine, so when I read that I thought, great, fanzine T-shirts!" [...] The official FGTH designs were particularly successful, and spawned many imitations of their own.|$|R
5000|$|Despite calling Whenever We Wanted one of {{the best}} records he had ever made during his 1991 promotional radio tour to support the album, Mellencamp's opinion of Whenever We Wanted has since diminished. He told Alan Sculley of Call Newspapers in 2005: [...] "There were some records that I really wasn't there for. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a record called Whenever We Wanted, which really isn't a very good record. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> was there, but I was painting. I'd be hours late for {{sessions}} just because I {{was in the middle of}} a painting. That's not good doing that kind of thing. Human Wheels turned out pretty good, but I kind of was doing the same thing during Human Wheels." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Edwards' signing was {{announced}}, it {{was also}} announced that Callaham's first draft would be rewritten by another writer. In July 2011, David S. Goyer was attached to rewrite the script. Goyer only worked a few weeks on the script and did not get any credit, stating, [...] " [...] a little bit. [...] <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{three or four weeks}} of work on Godzilla, it wasn’t a page-one rewrite or anything like that. [...] The term is ‘script doctoring,’ is what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on it." [...] In November 2011, Max Borenstein was hired to continue work on the script. In October 2012, Legendary announced that writer Drew Pearce would polish the script, making the principal characters older to suit the actors that Legendary had intended to cast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Eda, we must send to England {{for a lot}} of {{fairy tales}} to teach you what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but jest when I speak of spirits living there. But many books, have been written about pretended spirits and fairies, which tell us of their {{wonderful}} adventures, and what they said and did long ago. I shall tell you some of these stories one of these days. But I daresay there are no spirits in this spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have never}} seen {{anything}} about myself in print which has much correctness in it--any biographical account of myself <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not supply such particulars when I am asked for them by editors and compilers, simply because I am asked for them every day. If you want to prime Forgues, you may tell him without fear of anything wrong, that I was born at Portsmouth on the 7th of February, 1812; that my father was in the Navy Pay Office; that I was taken by him to Chatham when I was very young, and lived and was educated there till I was twelve or thirteen, I suppose; that I was then put to a school near London, where (as at other places) I distinguished myself like a brick; that I was put in the office of a solicitor, a friend of my father's, and didn't much like it; and {{after a couple of years}} (as well as I can remember) applied myself with a celestial or diabolical energy to the study of such things as would qualify me to be a first-rate parliamentary reporter--at that time a calling pursued by many clever men who were young at the Bar; that I made my début in the gallery (at about eighteen, I suppose), engaged on a voluminous publication no longer in existence, called The Mirror of Parliament; that when The Morning Chronicle was purchased by Sir John Easthope and acquired a large circulation, I was engaged there, and that I remained there until I had begun to publish [...] "Pickwick," [...] when I found myself in a condition to relinquish that part of my labours; that I left the reputation behind me of being the best and most rapid reporter ever known, and that I could do anything in that way under any sort of circumstances, and often did. (I daresay I am at this present writing the best shorthand writer in the world.) ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have asked}} Colvin {{to send you}} a copy of CATRIONA, which I am {{sometimes}} tempted to think is about my best work. I hear word occasionally of the AMAZING MARRIAGE. It will be a brave day for me when I get hold of it. Gower Woodseer is now an ancient, lean, grim, exiled Scot, living and labouring as for a wager in the tropics; still active, still with lots of fire in him, but the youth - ah, the youth where is it? For years after I came here, the critics (those genial gentlemen) used to deplore the relaxation of my fibre and the idleness to which I had succumbed. I hear less of this now; the next thing is they will tell me I am writing myself out! and that my unconscientious conduct is bringing their grey hairs with sorrow to the dust. I do not know - <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know one thing. For fourteen years I have not had a day's real health; I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary; and I have done my work unflinchingly. I have written in bed, and written out of it, written in hemorrhages, written in sickness, written torn by coughing, written when my head swam for weakness; and for so long, it seems to me I have won my wager and recovered my glove. I am better now, have been rightly speaking since first I came to the Pacific; and still, few are the days when I am not in some physical distress. And the battle goes on - ill or well, is a trifle; so as it goes. I was made for a contest, and the Powers have so willed that my battlefield should be this dingy, inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle. At least I have not failed, but I would have preferred a place of trumpetings and the open air over my head.|$|E
30|$|But if I’m angry towards {{somebody}} I don’t {{know how}} to deal with that. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about it? <b>I</b> can’t go up and biff ‘em.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but what's the procedure? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> That's what I'm after. I've got to buy {{something}} at Beale's this afternoon. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> set about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyway, {{that is what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> have no use for a man {{who sells}} my {{property}} to his friends. You'll get out of this place to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|I return Mr. Chorley's[106] note, my dear cousin, with thankful {{thoughts}} of him--as of you. I wish I could persuade {{you of the}} rightness of my view about 'Essays on Mind' and such things, and how the difference between them and my present poems is not merely the difference between two schools, as you seemed to intimate yesterday, nor even the difference between immaturity and maturity; {{but that it is}} the difference between the dead and the living, between a copy and an individuality, between what is myself and what is not myself. To you who have a personal interest and--may I say? affection for me, the girl's exercise assumes a factitious value, but to the public the matter is otherwise and ought to be otherwise. And for the 'psychological' side of the question, do observe that I have not reputation enough to suggest a curiosity about my legends. Instead of your 'legendary lore,' it would be just a legendary bore. Now you understand what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not underrate Pope nor his school, but I do disesteem everything which, bearing the shape of a book, is not the true expression of a mind, and I know and feel (and so do you) that a girl's exercise written when all the experience lay in books, and the mind was suited rather for intelligence than production, lying like an infant's face with an undeveloped expression, must be valueless in itself, and if offered to the public directly or indirectly as a work of mine, highly injurious to me. Why, of the 'Prometheus' volume, even, you know what I think and desire. 'The Seraphim,' with all its feebleness and shortcomings and obscurities, yet is the first utterance of my own individuality, and therefore the only volume except the last which is not a disadvantage to me to have thought of, and happily for me, the early books, never having been advertised, nor reviewed, except by accident, once or twice, are as safe from the public as manuscript.|$|E

5000|$|Moliner {{said one}} of her most famous quotes that have been repeated: Yes, my {{biography}} is very short due to my only achievement which is my dictionary. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not have any works which can be added to that long list that gives me credit to be admitted at the Academy (...) My work is clearly the dictionary. Of course, the fact that a philosopher - referring to Emilio Alarcos- enters at the Academy and not me, but if that dictionary would have been written by a man, I would say: <<How this man can not be at the Academy!>> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But really, Felix, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> it. <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> all Redstone does, except lifting {{some of the}} weights; and I am as old as {{you when}} you began.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it in {{one better}} than even the finest player is {{supposed}} to do it. It's a mashie-shot, you know. You mustn't play too light, or you fall in the lake; and you mustn't play it too hard, or you go past the hole into the woods. It requires the nicest delicacy and judgment, such as I gave it. You might have to wait a year before seeing anyone do it in two again. I doubt if the 'pro.' often does it in two. Now, directly we came to this hole today, I made up my mind {{that there was going to}} be no mistake. The great secret of any shot at golf is ease, elegance, and the ability to relax. The majority of men, you will find, think it important that their address should be good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let you go unharmed? Why, {{who would}} hurt you, my dove?" [...] {{answered}} the satyr. [...] "Yes, {{that is what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> will let {{you go to a}} husband." ...|$|R
5000|$|Oldman {{was almost}} {{immediately}} typecast {{as a criminal}} in his film career. The necessity to express villainous characters in an overtly physical manner led to the cultivation of his 'big' acting style, which hearkened back to his classical theatre training and would become his trademark; this encompassed [...] "playing everything" [...] via layered performances that vividly express each character's emotions and internal conflicts. Oldman has conceded that he often overacts on screen, and said: [...] "It's my influence on those roles that probably they feel bigger than life and a little over-the-top. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> go for it a bit as an actor, I must admit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Overacting {{may be used}} {{to portray}} an outlandish character, or to stress the evil {{characteristics}} of a villain. Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman was almost immediately typecast as a criminal in his film career, and the necessity to express villainous characters in an overtly physical manner led to the cultivation of his 'big' acting style, which hearkened back to his classical theatre training and would become his trademark.

5000|$|It’s {{funny to}} be making this show right now where I’m {{supposed}} to be Erin Markey the whole time because I feel like I work best when I’m in character. That’s when I’m most honest. So that’s not {{difficult for me to}} go back and forth between characters either, because you know different situations call for different folks. Not that that’s made so explicit in my life, in my practical life <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think we’re going through this time where identity is not as … people aren’t as interested in being one singular thing anymore. I just had trouble writing a bio recently because I was like, “I don’t want to be called a performance artist. I don’t wanna be called a comedian, I don’t want to be called an actor, or a singer or a cabaret artist,” because none of those things seem to really describe who I am.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 and 2013 Tinning {{was again}} denied parole. At the 2011 appearance, Tinning {{said that she}} killed Tami Lynne because she thought the child would die like her other {{children}} anyway. In 2011, Tinning was supported by people from Georgetown University Law Center and people she worked with in prison, describing her as the [...] "most loving, most generous, caring person that they have ever met." [...] When questioned about the murder during her 2013 appearance, she said, [...] "It’s just — <b>I</b> can’t remember. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, but <b>I</b> can’t tell you why.
