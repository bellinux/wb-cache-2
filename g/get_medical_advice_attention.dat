40|$|Abstract — Various newsworthy {{incidents}} typically include breaches of security, {{invasion of}} privacy, and harm caused by false information. In the e-health domain, {{there has been}} a lot of focus on ethical issues when dealing with electronic health records (EHRs) and patient medical records (PMRs). However, equally important are the myriad of health information websites that are being used to formally or informally <b>get</b> <b>medical</b> <b>advice</b> online. This study surveys related work on three popular and pertinent issues in health information websites: privacy, security, and trust. Our contributions include a succinct survey of different categories of popular health information websites (WebMD. com, MayoClinic. com, KidsHealth. org, PatientsLikeMe. com) to gauge existing methods for handling these issues. Moreover, an agenda is proposed for understanding the three issues orthogonally via access control. Other outcomes of the study include recommendations for open problems identified in health websites, including the need for fine-grained privacy, security and trust controls. I...|$|R

40|$|Insect sting allergy – {{the facts}} Anyone who is stung by a bee or wasp {{is likely to}} suffer a painful {{swelling}} {{at the site of}} the sting. For most people, the sting is not dangerous. Some people also experience an allergic reaction to the venom. For most of these people, the reaction is mild resulting in swelling {{at the site of the}} sting. But for a small minority, an allergic reaction to an insect sting can be systemic – that is, affecting parts of the body away from the site of the sting. Systemic reactions are sometimes severe and potentially life-threatening – this is known as anaphylaxis. If you are in that category, you may find the prospect of being stung very frightening, but be assured that there are steps you can take to reduce the risk to yourself. This involves <b>getting</b> <b>medical</b> <b>advice,</b> carrying prescribed medication at all times, and taking precautions to avoid being stung. Anyone can become allergic to an insect sting – not only people who already have allergies such as hayfever or food allergies. The first sting is not the one that causes the problem, but it may cause sensitisation – the stage at which the person becomes allergic. If sensitisation occurs, it is a later sting that will provoke the symptoms. Being stung by one type of insect will not make you allergic to the venom of another...|$|R

The pain may radiate throughout the foot. Tenderness may be elicited over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle and an antalgic gait may be observed. The pain may be observed in a controlled environment by standing on the toes or rolling the arches of the foot, as these motions tend to exercise the foot's calcaneocuboid joint and ligament, which are characteristically strained in a patient suffering from cuboid syndrome. Also, the pain may come on suddenly or it may develop gradually and persist over time.Sometimes the pain is intermittent, subsiding partially or completely {{for a period of time}} before returning again.|$|R
40|$|Background: Needle-stick and sharps {{injuries}} {{carry the}} risk of infection and are occupational hazards for all health care professionals involved in clinical care. Objective: To determine the frequency and factors contributing to needle-stick injury (NSI) among health care workers of dialysis units in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods: Data were obtained by anonymous, self-reporting questionnaire from staff of 4 hemodialysis units between October and December 2011. Information on demographics, job category and duration, details of NSI in the past, kind of activity and procedure under which the NSI occurred, if injury was reported, vaccination status of staff, and post-exposure treatment received were obtained. Results: The study population included 38 (37. 3 %) doctors, 42 nurses (41. 2 %), 14 (13. 7 %) dialysis technicians and 8 (7. 8 %) ancillary staff. There were 39 (38. 2 %) males. The mean±SD age of the study population was 34. 4 ± 8. 3 years. 25 (24. 5 %) staff had suffered NSI in the last 12 months and 41 (40. 2 %) in their entire working career. The most common activity leading to NSI was recapping of needles (45 %), improper disposal of needles (30 %), and venous cannulation and setting of drips (27. 5 %). NSI was significantly (p= 0. 016) higher among those with work experience between 6 and 10 years than others. Hollow bore needles were responsible for 82. 9 % of the NSIs. Only 15 (37 %) respondents reported their NSI to their unit head or designated officer in order to <b>get</b> <b>medical</b> <b>advice.</b> Conclusion: In Lagos, Nigeria, NSI is common among hemodialysis staff and is under-reported. Many NSIs can be prevented by adhering {{to the practice of}} universal precautions as well as education of staff on such precautionary methods...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{gastroenteritis}} (AG) {{is frequently}} caused by infectious intestinal diseases (IID) including food- and waterborne pathogens {{of public health}} importance. Among these pathogens, Campylobacter spp. plays a major role. Many European countries monitor selected IIDs within disease surveillance systems. In Switzerland, the information on IIDs is restricted to limited surveillance data, while no data is available for AG. We conducted a qualitative study among Swiss general practitioners (GPs) to investigate the case management of AG and campylobacteriosis patients, the associated disease burden and the determinants leading to registration in the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases (NNSID). Interviews were conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire and underwent inductive content analysis based on Grounded Theory. The questionnaire was repeatedly adapted to capture emerging themes until the point of theoretical saturation. GPs perceived AG and campylobacteriosis of little relevance to their daily work and public health in general. According to GP self-estimates each consults about two cases of AG per week and diagnoses a median of five campylobacteriosis cases per year. A large proportion of AG cases receives telephone consultations only and <b>gets</b> <b>medical</b> <b>advice</b> from the practice nurse. Antibiotic therapy is considered useful and stool diagnostics are performed for {{about a fifth of}} consulting AG patients. Stool diagnostics ("test") and antibiotic therapy ("treat") are interrelated and follow four strategies: "Wait & See", "Treat & See", "Treat & Test", and "Test & See". AG case management is diverse and includes different triage steps. A small proportion of AG patients have stool diagnostics performed and only positive tested patients are reported to the NNSID. As a result severe cases and cases with a history of travel abroad are overrepresented in the NNSID. The use of multiplex PCR panels in routine diagnostics likely leads to improved case management and higher case numbers in surveillance systems...|$|R

40|$|Background: Discharge against <b>medical</b> <b>advices</b> {{is leaving}} {{hospital}} despite <b>medical</b> <b>advice,</b> {{which can be}} a sign of the patient's dissatisfaction and a significant challenge for health system managers. This study examined the reasons for discharge against <b>medical</b> <b>advices</b> and compared the results with the control group (discharge with the doctor's opinion). Methods: The present study is a case-control study in which 280 samples were selected randomly in two groups of patients discharged against <b>medical</b> <b>advices</b> and those who discharged with doctor's opinion. Data were collected through  the questionnaire measuring patient-companion satisfaction in different wards of the hospital. Data were then analyzed using Chi-square and linear regression tests by SPSS 16 software. Results: Results showed that patient's age, having basic and complementary insurance, day of referring to hospital, education, and occupation made {{significant differences between the two}} groups. Among these factors, the most effective ones for discharge against <b>medical</b> <b>advice</b> were basic insurance (p = 0. 020), age (p = 0. 020), and occupation (p = 0. 030). The most important reasons for discharge against <b>medical</b> <b>advice</b> from patients' viewpoints were failure to determine the patient's status, personal problems, feeling relative relief and partial recovery, as well as lack of physicians' considerations in that hospital. Conclusion: It seems that patients decide to discharge against <b>medical</b> <b>advices</b> due to lack of necessary supervision over the performance of medical and nursing services, and also lack of motivation in personnel to prevent from this event. In order to earn patients' satisfaction, managers are required to improve the hospital's services...|$|R
