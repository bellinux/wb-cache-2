5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing clindamycin <b>hydrochloride)</b> and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate <b>hydrochloride).</b> Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin <b>hydrochloride)</b> and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E

The European Pharmacopoeia lists more than 200 <b>hydrochlorides</b> as active ingredients in medications.

Attempts to prepare the {{corresponding}} bis(5 -aryl- 3 -oxo- 4 -pentenyl) ethylamine <b>hydrochlorides</b> 2 and bis(3 -aryl- 3 -oxopropyl) ethylamine <b>hydrochlorides</b> 5 led to the formation {{of a series}} of 4 -(beta-arylvinyl) - 3 -(beta-arylvinylketo) - 1 -ethyl- 4 -piperidi nol <b>hydrochlorides</b> 9 and 4 -aryl- 3 -arylketo- 1 -ethyl- 4 -piperidinol <b>hydrochlorides</b> 11, most of which were converted subsequently into the corresponding quaternary ammonium salts 10 and 12, respectively. The structures of these compounds were determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by X-ray crystallography of representative molecules. Most compounds displayed significant cytotoxicity toward murine P 388 and L 1210 cells as well as human tumors. In general, Mannich bases containing olefinic bonds were more cytotoxic than the analogues without this functional group, while the piperidines 9 and 11 were more potent than the acyclic analogues 1 and 4, respectively. Correlations were noted between various physicochemical constants in the aryl rings and cytotoxicity. Compound 9 d displayed promising in vivo activity against colon cancers. This study has revealed that the piperidines 9 and 11 constitute new classses of cytotoxic agents. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the <b>hydrochloride</b> salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine <b>hydrochloride</b> is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine <b>hydrochloride</b> and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone <b>hydrochloride.</b> This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an efficient method for the synthesis of primary arylamines from aryl halides using amidine <b>hydrochlorides</b> as the ammonia surrogates. The protocol uses 10 mol % CuI as the catalyst, 20 mol % L-proline as the ligand, CS(2) CO(3) as the base, and DMF as the solvent and proceeds the sequential coupling of aryl halides with amidine <b>hydrochlorides</b> and hydrolysis of intermediates to give the target products.

40|$|Natural-abundance ^(15) N NMR {{chemical}} {{shifts of}} saturated aliphatic primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and their <b>hydrochlorides</b> have been measured in different solvents. Good linear correlations of these ^(15) N shifts with the ^(13) C shifts of carbons {{in the same}} positions in the corresponding hydrocarbon analogues were only found for the primary compounds. The degree of correlation between ^(l 5) N and ^(13) C shifts decreased successively with secondary to tertiary amines and their <b>hydrochlorides.</b> Despite this, sets of solvent-dependent additive shift parameters were derived which give reasonably satisfactory agreement between calculated and experimental shifts {{of all of the}} amines and <b>hydrochlorides.</b> Some of the substituent-induced shifts appear to be conformational effects and can be compared with substituent effects observed previously for cyclic amines. The generally downfield protonation shifts could also be correlated with empirical substituent parameters...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Thermal {{analysis}} {{techniques have}} been used to study the thermal behavior of dapoxetine and vardenafil <b>hydrochlorides</b> and confirmed using semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations. Methods: Thermogravimetric analysis, derivative thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to determine the thermal behavior and purity of the drugs under investigation. Thermodynamic parameters such as activation energy, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were calculated. Results: Thermal behavior of DAP and VAR were confirmed using by semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations. The purity values were found to be 99. 97 % and 99. 95 % for dapoxetine and vardenafil <b>hydrochlorides,</b> respectively. The purity of dapoxetine and vardenafil <b>hydrochlorides</b> is similar to that found by reported methods according to DSC data. Conclusion: Thermal analysis justifies its application in quality control of pharmaceutical compounds due to its simplicity, sensitivity and low operational costs...|$|R

5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone.

40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{undesired}} deprotonation during {{the addition of}} organolithium and organomagnesium reagents to ketones, the thioiminium salts, easily prepared from lactams and amides are converted into 2, 2 -disubstituted and 2 -monosubstituted amines by reaction with simple nucleophiles such as organocerium and organocopper reagents. The reaction of thioiminium iodides with organocerium reagents derived by transmetalation of corresponding lithium reagents with anhydrous cerium(III) chloride has been investigated. These thioiminium iodides act as good electrophiles and accept alkylceriums towards bisaddition. The newly synthesized amines have been characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR, IR and mass spectra. The amines have been converted into their <b>hydrochlorides</b> and characterized by COSY.

40|$|Resistance to {{benznidazole}} {{in certain}} strains of Trypanosoma cruzi {{may be caused}} by the increased production of enzymes that act on the oxidative metabolism, such as mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase which catalyses the reduction of peroxides. This work presents cytotoxicity assays performed with ferrocenyl diamine <b>hydrochlorides</b> in six different strains of T. cruzi epimastigote forms (Y, Bolivia, SI 1, SI 8, QMII, and SIGR 3). The last four strains have been recently isolated from triatominae and mammalian host (domestic cat). The expression of mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase was analyzed by the Western blotting technique using polyclonal antibody anti mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase obtained from a rabbit immunized with the mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase recombinant protein. All the tested ferrocenyl diamine <b>hydrochlorides</b> were more cytotoxic than benznidazole. The expression of the 25. 5  kDa polypeptide of mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase did not increase in strains that were more resistant to the ferrocenyl compounds (SI 8 and SIGR 3). In addition, a 58  kDa polypeptide was also recognized in all strains. Ferrocenyl diamine <b>hydrochlorides</b> showed trypanocidal activity and the expression of 25. 5  kDa mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase is not necessarily increased in some T. cruzi strains. Most likely, other mechanisms, in addition to the over expression of this antioxidative enzyme, should be involved in the escape of parasites from cytotoxic oxidant agents...|$|R
