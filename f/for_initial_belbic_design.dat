40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC) scheme for speed control of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive {{over a wide}} speed range. The speed control of IPMSM becomes a complex issue due to the nonlinear nature as well as coupling among its winding currents and the rotor speed particularly at high speeds. Therefore, in this paper a <b>BELBIC</b> is <b>designed</b> for simplicity and insensitivity to disturbances and ability to control the IPMSM in the whole speed range. The proposed <b>BELBIC</b> is <b>designed</b> based on maximum torques per ampere operation below the rated speed and the field weakening operation above the rated speed, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed BELBIC is investigated for a 40 kW IPMSM and simulated using MatLab/Simulink. The simulation results are compared to those obtained from the conventional PI controller based drive at various conditions such as: step change of command speed and load torque, the disconnection of one phase and parameter variations. Simulation results demonstrate the appropriate dynamic response, robustness again changes, capability in removing load disturbances, without overshoot and undershoot, minimum settling time and lowest steady-state error of the proposed controller over a wide speed range...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} analysis of identification and an online intelligent adaptive position tracking control {{based on an}} emotional learning model {{of the human brain}} (BELBIC) for an electrohydraulic servo (EHS) system is presented. A mathematical model of the system is derived and the parameters of the model are identified. The <b>BELBIC</b> is <b>designed</b> based upon this dynamic model and utilized to control the real laboratorial EHS system. The experimental results are compared to those obtained from an optimal PID controller to prove that classic linear controllers fail to achieve good tracking of the desired output, especially when the hydraulic actuator operates at various frequencies and pressures. The results demonstrate an excellent improvement in control action, without any increase in control effort, for the proposed approach. Finally, it can be concluded from the experimental results that the BELBIC is able to respond quickly to any disturbance and variation in the system parameters, showing a high degree of adaptability and robustness due to its online learning ability...|$|R

This tells we can understand which dynamic pricing rules better for consumers as both calculation results of MWTP show the same ranking. However, consumers might not clarify well the difference between initial cost and monthly fee.|$|R
