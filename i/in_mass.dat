5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement {{of the mass of}} the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Loss of {{body mass}} during a 24 -h run was {{considered}} to be a result of dehydration. AIMS: We intended to quantify the decrease <b>in</b> body <b>mass</b> as a loss <b>in</b> fat <b>mass</b> or skeletal muscle mass and to quantify the change in hydration status. METHODS: Body mass, fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, haematocrit, plasma sodium and urinary specific gravity were measured in 15 ultra-marathoners in a 24 -h run. RESULTS: Body mass decreased by 2. 2 kg (p = 0. 0009) and fat mass decreased by 0. 5 kg (p = 0. 0084). The decrease <b>in</b> body <b>mass</b> correlated to the decrease <b>in</b> fat <b>mass</b> (r = 0. 72, p = 0. 0024). Urinary specific gravity increased from 1. 012 to 1. 022 g/mL (p = 0. 0005). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease <b>in</b> body <b>mass</b> and the increase in urinary specific gravity indicate dehydration. The decrease <b>in</b> body <b>mass</b> was correlated to the decrease <b>in</b> fat <b>mass</b> and therefore not only due to dehydration...|$|R
