25|$|Opinions have {{differed}} as to {{the precise}} mechanism by which water had built up in such quantity and then had suddenly been released with such devastating consequences. For many years the accepted explanation was that proposed by Joseph Vallot. It was believed that meltwater had drained through the glacier and become trapped as an intraglacial cavity, i.e. as an underground lake within a crevasse which itself had then become enlarged and widened by the water. However, recent re-analysis of historic photographs, accounts and contemporary meteorological precipitation data and <b>field</b> <b>measurements,</b> including radar analysis and magnetic resonance imaging, has presented an alternative and more plausible mechanism in which meltwater collected {{much closer to the}} surface (as a supraglacial lake) in a period when the glacier had a negative mass balance (i.e. was experiencing year-on-year melting and retreat). Prior to 1878 the glacier would not have been well-visited, so any surface lake could have gone unnoticed, and after 1878 the glacier experienced a positive mass balance (i.e. year-on-year accumulation of snow and ice) which would have hidden the lake from view until the eventual outburst flood in 1892.|$|E
