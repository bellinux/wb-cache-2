5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an <b>environment</b> <b>by</b> maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response to a change in the <b>environment.</b> <b>By</b> preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien (JTWC designation: 08S) was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that caused minor damage in Madagascar.

Later that day the storm made landfall in Morombe, at a weaker intensity, and dissipated early on January3. Throughout the affected areas, Cyprien destroyed 957 structures, leaving 1.16billion Malagasy franc (2002 MGF; US$181,000) in damages. No fatalities were reported; however two people were listed as missing.|$|E

Climate change affects the floral <b>environment</b> <b>by</b> stunting flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen and sustain themselves.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level <b>environment.</b> <b>By</b> early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry <b>environment,</b> <b>by</b> adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E
