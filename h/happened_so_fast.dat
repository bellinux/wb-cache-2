25|$|The album's success {{significantly}} transformed both Colón's and Lavoe's lives. Colón's band {{featured a}} raw, aggressive, all-trombone sound that was well received by salsa fans, and Lavoe complemented the style with his articulate voice, talent for improvisation, {{and sense of}} humor. The album was a massive multimillion-dollar success in France, Panama, Colombia and other countries. Héctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle. According to Lavoe, it <b>happened</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> {{he did not know}} how to cope with his sudden success. With the sudden fame came love and lust and experimentation with marijuana, heroin, and cocaine.|$|E

25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything <b>happened</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast.</b> But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that they wanted it to work so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all <b>happened</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast.</b> They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I was {{supposed}} to be in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

[...] "Your reflexes take over", Goodburn said after the game. [...] "It <b>happened</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> that you just react. Fortunately, I got them off. I was a shortstop in high school. That might have helped." [...] The play {{turned out to be}} crucial, as Washington's defense forced the Falcons to go three-and-out on their next possession. Then Brian Mitchell returned Scott Fulhage's 34-yard punt 26 yards to the Atlanta 18-yard line. The Redskins only managed to move the ball 11 yards, but this time Lohmiller cashed in with a 24-yard field goal, giving Washington a 17-7 lead.|$|E

I think maybe Babe had unrealistic expectations hoping, 'Oh, with time he'll let me in.' Well, it's their second marriage {{and they have}} a child together and it still has not changed. That wall is not budging." [...] Havins continued, [...] "Babe can only take so much. Plus, her husband tried to kill her. I honestly think, in a way, this is a hint of a delayed reaction, emotionally, to that." [...] Havins felt that JR's murder attempt on Babe seemingly came out of nowhere: It <b>happened</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast,</b> and the resolve was {{in the blink of an}} eye. I would walk away for a lot less! I think she was so wanting to get that family unit back on track that she didn't allow herself the proper time to heal. Then, on top of it, here's Josh. Everything she wants to feel with her husband she's feeling with Josh, and that's what's missing, because JR doesn't talk.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{afterward}} {{about his}} one-day presidency, Carmona told The Miami Herald {{that he had}} been [...] "misunderstood because ... the opposition wasted too much time forming a cabinet and naming the high military command," [...] whereas if the coup had [...] "been hatched in advance, those key decisions would have already been made." [...] He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint [...] "a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation" [...] and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly [...] "because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party." [...] He also denied any link to Carlos Andrés Pérez. [...] "There is no connection between me and him," [...] Carmona said. [...] "I did not receive one cent from him. I am not manipulated." [...] "There was no rebellion or coup" [...] Carmona told The New York Times after the counter-coup. [...] "There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president." [...] Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. [...] "I was called by them to fill that role," [...] he said. [...] "I was called by officers and others to take over. And I had the courage to take that step." [...] He told The Guardian that he took [...] "full responsibility" [...] for the actions he made, emphasizing that [...] "there was no premeditation, no conspiracy" [...] behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. [...] "Everything <b>happened</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> that mistakes were made," [...] Carmona said. [...] "If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick." [...] When asked if he had been [...] "used by the military," [...] he replied: [...] "There might have been people who used me, you never {{know what is going on}} underground," [...] but he insisted that he [...] "acted purely in the higher interests of the country." [...] One Western diplomat told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency [...] "everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical" [...] but that after his ouster [...] "everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope." [...] Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a [...] "civic activist" [...] but would leave politics: [...] "I have never been a politician; that is not my world," [...] Carmona said. [...] "As for Venezuela, we will continue the struggle." ...|$|E

50|$|The lack of real {{government}} {{funding for the}} tech hub is mainly {{due to lack of}} long-term planning strategy to foster the technological sector of the region. A program similar to Ohio’s Third Frontier could not only benefit the region but the whole country.

The public sector dollars are very important in creating momentum in a very short amount of time, which would not necessarily <b>happen</b> <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> with exclusive private sector rounds of investment. Two key aspects of the Third Frontier program are the outside match requirement (government funds must be matched by another funding source).
