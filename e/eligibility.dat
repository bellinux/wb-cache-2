5|$|Emanuel's <b>eligibility</b> {{for office}} was {{challenged}} {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his <b>eligibility.</b> A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's <b>eligibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table, the years {{are listed as}} per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held {{the following}} year. For the first five ceremonies, the <b>eligibility</b> period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31. For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the <b>eligibility</b> period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933. Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of <b>eligibility</b> became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} which <b>eligibility</b> requirements {{participation in a}} program requires, the recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group <b>eligibility</b> was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance, such as maintaining documentation in participant files (e.g., copies of HIV/Aids diagnosis, copies of federal income tax returns, etc.). Furthermore, the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non-eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance.|$|E
5|$|Because {{athletes in}} Ivy League {{competition}} only have {{four years of}} athletic <b>eligibility,</b> Cabral could not participate in NCAA competition for Princeton to use his final year of cross country <b>eligibility.</b> As a result, he intended to enroll in business school at the University of Colorado, where he would continue training with Billy Nelson coach Mark Wetmore. He opted to turn pro rather than attend Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1980 the <b>eligibility</b> {{year for}} {{nominations}} {{was set to}} the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books {{as the beginning of}} their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling <b>eligibility,</b> the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling <b>eligibility</b> system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.|$|E

5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's <b>eligibility</b> under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's <b>eligibility</b> under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional <b>eligibility,</b> then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|Homesick for Florida, Valencia {{sought to}} {{transfer}} to the University of Miami after his freshman year, even though it only offered him a modest scholarship.
