Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E

25|$|This, in {{the hands}} of Fairfax and Cromwell, was likely to be effective. While the King and Rupert, with the remnant of their cavalry, <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> South Wales to join Sir Charles Gerard's troops, and to raise fresh infantry, Fairfax decided that Goring's was the most {{important}} Royalist army in the field. He turned to the west, reaching Lechlade on the 26th, less than a fortnight after the battle of Naseby. Westminster made one last attempt to dictate the plan of campaign, but the Committee refused to pass-on the directions of the Houses, and Fairfax remained free to deal with Goring, as he desired.|$|E
500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I must tell you that it is now un guerre à mort and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
500|$|While the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, again vainly {{attacked}} Hill 570 on September 11, North Korean soldiers {{seized the}} crest of Hill 314 [...] southeast of it and that much closer to Taegu. Actually, the two hill masses are adjacent and their lower slopes within small arms range of each other. The North Koreans drove the 16th Reconnaissance Company from the hill and only the ROK 5th Training Battalion, previously <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> the line from Taegu in a supporting position, prevented the North Koreans from gaining complete control of this terrain feature. This ROK battalion still held part of the reverse slope of Hill 314 when the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, hurried to the scene from its attacks on Hill 570 and tried to retake the position. The ROK battalion twice had attacked and reached the crest but could not hold it, and had dug in on the lower southern slopes. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, command post had to fight off infiltrating North Koreans on September 12 as it issued its attack order and prepared to attack through the 8th Cavalry lines against Hill 314.|$|E

500|$|In October 1861, Foraker {{left his}} parents' home {{to go to}} the county seat of Hillsboro where he was to live with his uncle, James Reece, auditor of Highland County, and work as a clerk in his office. [...] He was sent to replace his older brother, Burch, by then enlisted in the Union Army as the American Civil War was raging. [...] Foraker noted in his memoirs that while his time as auditor's clerk greatly {{improved}} his penmanship, it also brought him into contact with many county officials, teaching him how a government worked. [...] The young clerk was impressed by his brother's letters home, and was anxious to join the army despite his youth. [...] Soon after his 16th birthday, Joseph Foraker learned that a family friend was organizing a volunteer company, and sought to enlist. [...] His uncle gave reluctant consent, and on July 14, 1862, Foraker was mustered in Company [...] "A", 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry; in late August, after training, he became second sergeant. [...] With Confederate forces moving through Kentucky and threatening Cincinnati, the 89th was <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> defenses set up across the Ohio River in Newport, Kentucky. [...] The Confederates did not reach the Ohio, having been forced back well to the south, and the 89th moved to Fort Shaler, near Newport. [...] While Foraker was at Fort Shaler, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation; Foraker recounted in his memoirs that he and his comrades felt that the proclamation meant that they were fighting for the end of slavery, not just to preserve the Union.|$|E
500|$|The first {{reconstruction}} {{was given}} by Buckland himself. He considered Megalosaurus to be a quadruped. He {{thought it was an}} [...] "amphibian", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind Megalosaurus resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that Megalosaurus would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to Iguanodon, or at least some iguanodontid, but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to Megalosaurus also. Even taking into account the effects of allometry, heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of Megalosaurus at sixty to seventy feet. The existence of Megalosaurus posed some problems for christian orthodoxy, which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through Original Sin, which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a pre-Adamitic phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the Bridgewater Treatises that Megalosaurus had played a beneficial rôle in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, [...] "to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering".|$|E

2500|$|In early 1918, the Germans {{launched}} a major offensive on the Western Front {{after the collapse}} of Tsarist Russia allowed them to concentrate their forces in the west. In late March, as the Allies were pushed back towards the vital Amiens railhead and the situation became desperate, the 40th Battalion was <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> a defensive position between the Ancre river and the Somme. The battalion subsequently fought during the Battle of the Somme, where they helped hold back the German offensive at Morlancourt. During a three-day battle, the battalion took heavy casualties, losing 225 men, but it struck a significant blow, advancing over [...] and securing a vital position overlooking Amiens. A series of minor actions– dubbed [...] "peaceful penetrations"– followed as the German advance was blunted. [...] In August and September, after the Allies launched their own offensive, which ultimately ended the war, the battalion helped to drive the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line. Sergeant Percy Statton was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions near Proyart in mid-August, leading a small group of men forward to destroy four German positions that were holding up the Australians' advance, before carrying out two wounded men, while under fire.|$|E
2500|$|The Pope Sixtus V had {{appointed}} the 3rd committee of scholars {{to continue the}} work. The committee was under the presidency of Cardinal Carafa. The work was prepared {{on the basis of}} the edition of Robertus Stephanus from Louvain (1583) and good manuscripts were used as authorities, including notably Codex Amiatinus. Carafa presented the result of their work, in the beginning of 1589, but Sixtus rejected their work and in 18 months prepared another text he corrected to agree with the Greek and Hebrew, He used Codex Carafianus, but it was <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> print and suffered from many printing errors, as well as serious problems reflecting the inability of the headstrong Sixtus as a Bible scholar. Three whole verses were dropped from the Book of Numbers; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing, or a 'wild' editorial choice by Sixtus himself. In May 1590 the completed work was issued from the press in three volumes;, but even after printing, Sixtus continued to tinker with the text, sending out revised readings on gummed strips to be pasted over the printed pages. After his death Robert Bellarmine warned that this work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church. [...] Sixtus death before Vulgata Sixtina was taken into use is concidered by apologists as an example of papal infallibility.|$|E
2500|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed by}} Pope Pius IV in 1561 to undertake the task, but it worked slowly and ineffectively. A second {{committee was}} appointed by Pope Pius V in 1569. Pope Sixtus V appointed a third committee, who took as their base text the Louvain Vulgate edition of 1583 (based on the edition of Hentenius), recording variant readings from authoritative manuscripts in the margin. A recommended text was presented in 1589. Sixtus was dissatisfied with the result, judging {{that it was too}} far from the familiar printed editions. He had substantial changes made to the text, using the Vulgate edition of Robertus Stephanus corrected to agree with the Greek; and introducing personal changes, including an entirely new system of verse divisions. This revised version was <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> print; and suffered from misprints in the Old Testament. In addition, three whole verses were found to have been dropped from the Book of Numbers; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing or a 'wild' editorial choice. [...] The Bible appeared in 1590 and is known as Sistine Vulgate. Sixtus immediately issued corrigenda as pasted slips to be inserted into copies. After the Pope's sudden death, Robert Bellarmine warned that the work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church. The College of Cardinals stopped all further sales, and bought and destroyed as many copies as possible.|$|E
