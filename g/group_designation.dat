One of three apprentice devices may be worn above the rank insignia, which denotes the sailor is an apprentice in a particular field and is {{in search of a}} rating to join. Sailors who have gone directly to a base, station, or ship without any specialized training are eligible to select a career field, and through correspondence courses and extensive on-the-job training, may qualify for a rating. This process is called [...] "striking for a rate". If an enlisted member has qualified for a rate, but has not yet become a petty officer, he is called a designated striker, and is identified by a striker's badge that displays the sailor's rating, along with his group rate marks. The serviceperson is addressed by one's <b>group</b> <b>designation,</b> if known (e.g., Fireman Jones, Constructionman Apprentice Smith); by the generic appellation [...] "seaman"; or by one's striker designation (Boatswain's Mate Seaman Watson, Culinary Specialist Seaman Recruit Johnson).Those that have completed the [...] "A" [...] school for Hospital Corpsman wear their caduceus above their stripes and substitute the word [...] "Hospitalman" [...] for [...] "Seaman" [...] in their rating titles.|$|E

The Air Group served aboard nine different carriers, including the first [...] "Super Carrier", USS Forrestal, during the 1956-57 Suez Crisis. On 20 December 1963 all Carrier Air Groups were redesignated Carrier Air Wings and CVG-1 became Carrier Air Wing ONE (CVW-1). Between June 1966 and February 1967, CVW-1 conducted combat operations off the coast of Vietnam aboard USS Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1975 onboard USS John F.

It became an entirely Minnesotan division. The division was again reorganized in 1963, this time according to the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) structure. Battle <b>group</b> <b>designations</b> were dropped and substituted by battalions assigned flexibly to brigades. Several other significant redesignations and changes were also made.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} group {{returned}} from this deployment, the Navy changed its system of air <b>group</b> <b>designations</b> to one designating {{the type of}} carrier the group was assigned to and thus its general complement of aircraft types. In line with this, CVG-81 was re-designated Attack Carrier Air Group Thirteen (CVAG-13) on 15 November 1946. As an attack carrier air group, the unit was composed of two fighter squadrons (VF-13A and VF-14A) and two attack squadrons (VA-13A and VA-14A).

50|$|Originally {{established}} as Carrier Air Group Five (CVG-5) in 1943, the new air group rapidly became embroiled {{in the war}} in the Pacific.

The Air Group quickly recorded a number of firsts, including the first squadron to land a jet aircraft aboard a carrier (1948), the first jet aircraft in the Navy to shoot down enemy aircraft when two F9F-3 Panthers from VF-51 shot down two Korean People's Air Force Yak-9 fighters on 3 July 1950, the first to arrive in Yellow Sea, the first to launch jet aircraft against enemy, and the first to include both jet squadrons VF-51, VF-52 with F9F-2 Panther jets, VF-53 with F4U Corsairs, VA-54 and VA-55 with AD-1 Skyraiders.|$|E
