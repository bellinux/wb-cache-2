Two simplified FSA models of satellite constellations with one ground control station (GCS) are developed. The first model is of a single spacecraft and the second includes two spacecraft. Based upon the language, states, and state transitions of each model, the author transforms the FA into a network and enumerates the shortest paths for <b>indicative</b> <b>lists</b> of meta-tasks from each model. The first model is provisionally implemented in MATLAB. The author finds two separate optimal target selection sequences for randomly generated sample target sets using commercial off-the-shelf optimization software. Although stochastically fabricated, the sample target sets reflect valid scenarios for a satellite imagery mission. The first sequence, a traveling salesman problem, minimizes the time required for processing all targets given a multiple orbit mission. For a representative sample target set, this is 2. 34 orbits. The second sequence, a prize collecting traveling salesman problem, maximizes the number of targets processed given a dual orbit mission. For the same sample target set, two orbits permit the processing of seven targets. Outstanding ThesisAustralian Army author...|$|R
40|$|As the <b>indicative</b> <b>lists</b> in the {{paragraph}} above suggest, {{the book is}} indeed com-prehensive. The individual chapters offer decent reviews of their subject but inev-itably each attempts to cover {{a lot of ground}} in a short space. The sections on values and ethics, research, and the future challenges are given as much space as those on perspectives and practice, giving the book a slightly lopsided bias towards social work’s more political and philosophical concerns. In the sense that a handbook is a guide, manual or book that contains concise information on a particular subject, then the current volume does its job well. The reader wanting a quick, competent review and digest of, say strengths-based prac-tice or qualitative research methods, will find good summaries written by leading authorities. In other words, The handbook is a source book, to be accessed when-ever the social worker needs to brush up on, learn about, or find a good data base for a particular branch of the social work endeavour. Given its current hefty price, the book is unlikely to be bought by individuals for their personal use.

40|$|Comprehensive data on {{contaminated}} sites across Australia is not available. The {{two most}} populated states (New South Wales and Victoria) each {{have at least}} 30 000 contaminated sites. Many regulatory agencies have tried to assess the risk of land contamination by reference to <b>indicative</b> <b>lists</b> {{of the types of}} land uses likely to cause soil or land contamination. Australia has a federal system with 9 jurisdictions and each have different regimes relating to contaminated land. There is only one jurisdiction (Queensland) where there has been any attempt at a comprehensive identification of potentially contaminated and contaminated sites. The Commonwealth Government provides guidelines and standards but primary regulatory authority remains with state and territory governments. This paper considers the scope of liability {{and the role of the}} Commonwealth Government. Most parties with an interest in potentially contaminated land are forced to rely on risk assessment processes. For high risk properties, this usually involves a site audit. This is most likely to eventuate if there is a contamination incident, on or near the land or in the groundwater, an intensification or change in use or a transaction involving the land. The legal framework relating to these issues is reviewed in the context of the New South Wales (State) land contamination regime. The provisions to pierce the corporate veil, in relation to remediation orders, are very important. New South Wales has unusually strong legislative provisions for attributing personal environmental liability to directors and managers. The overall situation is far from satisfactory, but is indicative of the peculiarly Australian approach. The government pass huge numbers of statutes and they grow complex administrative systems under them. However, when it comes to compliance and enforcement, there is a strong preference for informal approaches. This makes it extremely difficult to study these aspects in any reliable way. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Article draft. Author <b>list</b> <b>indicative</b> {{and roughly}} {{corresponds}} to amount of {{contribution to the}} article to date. Abstract. Ps 6 magnetic disturbances and associated optical forms known as omega bands are usually associated with the morning sector. Some evidence for similar phenomenology in the evening sector has been presented by Solovyev et al. (1999). We confirm and extend those results with high time resolution magnetic and imaging observations from Athabasca University Geophysical Observatory for an event that took place on July 27, 2003, along with conjugate hemisphere imaging from the Polar spacecraft. The observed signatures indicate sunward drift (westward in the evening sector). Magnetic perturbations feature negative Y and transitional Z indicating westward passage of poleward equivalent currents overhead. As has been suggested by Connors et al. (2003) to be often the case for morning sector Ps 6 /omega bands, initiation of the evening sector event coincided with substorm onset. From optical and magnetic data we obtain consistent results for the drift rate of the forms, which changed during the event. An inner magnetospheric source is suggested, with triggering of the onset {{by an increase in}} solar wind speed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of the most appropriate model is essential to predict the potential species richness of a site or landscape. Species accumulation curves {{have been used as}} a basic tool for comparing richness when different sampling protocols have been applied. Among the parameters generated by these models the slope has been cited as an indicator of completeness without regard to a defined cut-off value. In this work, we fit 12 field data sets of aquatic Coleoptera (Hidalgo) and Odonata larvae (Michoacán) to 2 asymptotic models (Clench and Linear Dependence) in order to calculate the slopes at the maximum effort and relate them with efficiency. Then, the theoretical effort needed to achieve the 95 % of the lists was calculated for each data set {{in order to get the}} theoretical slopes. The average slope value found was 0. 01 with a variance of < 0. 001, so we propose this value as <b>indicative</b> of a <b>list</b> reaching 95 % of completeness for data obtained from similar sampling protocols. Additionally, we propose the use of number of rare species as an additional criterion to evaluate the inventories completeness. The effect of different sampling intensity on fitted models and estimation of parameters and the importance of a cut-off slope value in asymptotic models as a criterion to evaluate completeness of biological inventories are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{description of the}} research conducted {{in a number of}} JISC funded projects in the past few years. The authors were involved in the development of educational planning tools supporting the direct comparison of course data. One of the main challenges in today's higher education is the lack of a consistent approach in the design and development of curriculum information. Although several quality assurance agencies exist world wide and ensure that there are certain criteria that must be adhered to when a new course is designed, there is still no widely acceptable format for documenting course data. This has allowed institutions to introduce their own templates, structures and techniques when producing information describing their courses. Furthermore, there are several terms that are frequently used interchangeably, causing confusion to the reader of course brochures (e. g. course, programme, class, module, lesson, learning experience). Typically, such readers involve several stakeholders of higher and further education courses such as applicants, students, parents and even academics. The paper describes the creation of a toolkit allowing the comparison of course data from different institutions based on semantic analysis of course description documents. The paper also discusses several contributions to research from the educational toolkit allowing the matching of user provided keywords to course content. Emphasis is given on explaining how the toolkit allows users to search course content by using several criteria including learning outcomes, <b>indicative</b> content, reading <b>lists,</b> etc. The paper also discusses how the project led to the enervation of a course data feed that can be used by any aggregator service allowing the creation of a national or even international repository of course data. Potentially the impact of the developed toolkit (that is based on the XCRI-CAP 1. 2 standard) would support the harmonisation of course data representations and the exchange of course related data...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

Esta pesquisa trata do estudo de grupos criativos em organizações no Brasil e busca elementos sobre sua atuação com vistas a um melhor desempenho e melhores resultados econômicos, que possam ser disseminados não só nas organizações, como também servir de referência para outros grupos que pretendam ser criativos. Considerando que o futebol é o {{principal}} esporte no Brasil; sendo uma paixão para os brasileiros, que se referem frequentemente ao país como "país do futebol" ou a "pátria de chuteiras"; escolheu-se como grupo criativo a Seleção Brasileira de Futebol, que representa o Brasil em competições internacionais entre países e jogos amistosos. A Seleção Brasileira de Futebol é, atualmente, a maior vencedora da Copa do Mundo FIFA com cinco títulos. O estudo foca a Seleção Brasileira em duas Copas consecutivas: 1966 e 1970, nas quais os grupos que representaram o Brasil tiveram desempenhos diametralmente opostos. O estudo verifica as ligações existentes entre esses dois grupos criativos e busca saber se a organização, que convoca a Seleção, aprendeu com o insucesso e/ou com o sucesso, com vistas a preservar o que deu certo e a evitar a repetição dos erros cometidos. A Seleção de 1966 é lembrada, até hoje, como a Seleção Brasileira que teve o segundo pior desempenho em todas as Copas do Mundo. Por sua vez, depois de quatro anos, a Seleção de 1970 tem sido citada como uma das melhores Seleções Brasileiras de todos os tempos, senão a melhor. No estudo são abordados diversos conceitos, tais como emoção, pensamento divergente, criatividade, grupos criativos, ambiente/clima de trabalho, master mind, liderança, organização, planejamento, esquema de jogo e soberba. São apresentados, igualmente, argumentos que mostram a sua aderência com a área de Gestão do Conhecimento do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia e Gestão do Conhecimento - PPGEGC e com a linha de pesquisa Teoria e Prática em Gestão do Conhecimento. Inicialmente foi realizada a compilação de dados. Em seguida, foi efetuada a transformação desses dados em informações através da agregação de valor pela contextualização e categorização, significados pela relevância e propósitos, quando então foram elaboradas listagens de categorias e subcategorias relacionadas tanto ao insucesso na Copa de 1966 como ao sucesso na Copa de 1970. Ao final, são apresentados dois quadros como conhecimento resultante de todo o processo: os "Achados da Investigação (Findings) " e "Pontos a considerar na análise de grupos criativos", ou seja, os possíveis conceitos e/ou indicativos relacionados ao desempenho de grupos criativos, o objetivo deste estudo. Abstract : This research it´s {{study of}} creative groups in organizations in Brazil and looks for elements on his acting {{in order to}} achieve a better performance and better economical results, which could be disseminated not only in organizations, and also to serve as reference for other groups that intend to be creative. Considering that soccer is the principal sport in Brazil; being a passion for the Brazilians people, that´s why Brazil is frequently known as " country of the football " or the " homeland of football boots "; the Brazilian Football Team there was chosen like creative group which represents Brazil in international competitions between countries and friendly. The Brazilian Football Team is, at present, the biggest winner of the FIFA World Cup Trophy, with five titles. The study focuses the Brazilian Selection in two consecutive Cups: 1966 and 1970, in which the groups that represented Brazil had diametrically opposite performances. The study checks the existent connections between these two creative groups and looks for knowledge if the organization, that summon the Selection, learnt with the failure and /or with the success, with sights to preserve of what it gave right and to avoid the repetition of the committed mistakes. The Team of 1966 is remembered, till now, as the Brazilian Selection that had the worst performance in all the Cups of the World. By his time, after four years, the Team of 1970 has been quoted {{as one of the best}} Brazilian Selections till now, or maybe the best.

40|$|In this research, {{we discuss}} {{promoting}} and rewarding of civil servants. These methods represent system stimulants {{that affect the}} needs and interests of the public civil servant in order to induce him to conscientiously carrying out their duties. It is concluded that awarding and promotion are important parts of the incentive scheme for civil servants, because they show how faithfully and efficiently citizens do their job, and these methods {{pave the way for}} this fellow citizen doing their job perfectly. We must mention the material benefits obtained by a civil servant usually in the form of encouragement. It should be noted that in recent years actively updated current legislation has been promoting and rewarding measures that are established by different public authorities, which gives law enforcers more options in choosing the measures of rewarding and encouraging, relevant to labor achievements of citizens.
