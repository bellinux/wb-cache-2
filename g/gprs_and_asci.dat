Current studies, mostly in humans and rodents, have revealed that SCFAs acted as endogenous ligands for G protein-coupled receptor <b>GPR</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>GPR</b> 43. Whether proteins similar to human <b>GPR</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>GPR</b> 43 mediate the regulatory effects of SCFAs in swine remains unclear to date.

The alignment results showed that pig chromosome 6 contained <b>GPR</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>GPR</b> 43 genes. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that <b>GPR</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>GPR</b> 43 were expressed in porcine various tissues. The 2218 bp and 1908 bp nucleotide sequence representing the full-length cDNA sequence of porcine <b>GPR</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>GPR</b> 43 was obtained from the ileum and spleen using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), which were capable of encoding 335 and 329 amino acid sequences, respectively.

40|$|Soil {{and climate}} are {{acknowledged}} to greatly affect vine growth and grape berry composition through their strong influence on vine water status. Over a limited area, climatic factors {{may be considered}} as rather homogeneous for a given vintage while soil characteristics may vary strongly over short distances. Therefore, detailed characterization of soil hydrogeophysical properties is of prime importance for the definition of optimal vineyard practices. In that respect, ground penetrating radar (<b>GPR)</b> <b>and</b> electromagnetic induction (EMI) are effective geophysical techniques for fast and non-invasive determination of shallow subsurface properties through the measurement of soil dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. Given contrasted sensitivities of <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI to soil electrical properties, combining measurements from both techniques allows to merge complementary information, thereby leading to more accurate quantitative characterisation of soil. Classical <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI data processing techniques for soil properties characterisation rely on strongly simplifying assumptions in the modelling of electromagnetic phenomena, leading to significant errors on the estimates and accounting for {{only a part of}} the data information content. We developed generalized multi-offset full-waveform approaches for modelling off-ground <b>and</b> on-ground <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI signals. <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI systems are modelled using sets of infinitesimal electric and magnetic dipoles, allowing us to properly describe the distribution of the scattered field when the subsurface is located in the near-field of the antenna. The antenna model is coupled with a three-dimensional Green’s function, corresponding to a specific solution of the Maxwell’s equations for wave propagation or diffusion in multilayered media. The approaches were applied in a vineyard in south of France (Saint-Emilion) over a 30 -ha area characterized by strong spatial variations of soil types.

Resorting to plane wave decomposition, the antennas {{operating on the}} ground or in near-field conditions are modeled using a set of infinitesimal dipoles and characteristic, frequency-dependent, global reflection and transmission coefficients. Wave propagation and diffusion in the medium are described using a set of three-dimensional planar layered media Green’s functions. Both <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI antennas were calibrated using measurements collected at different heights, ranging from near-field to far-field conditions, over a perfect electrical conductor. The <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI models were then validated for measurements collected over water subject to different salinity levels. The models showed a high degree of accuracy for reproducing the observed data and model inversion provided good estimates of the medium electrical properties.

Technical possibilities for increasing the sensitivity of the EMI system are currently under examination. In addition, in order to further improve the model performances for EMI, we also investigate different configurations for the set of infinitesimal dipoles used to model the EMI antenna. The proposed approach is applicable to any <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> EMI system, either prototypes or commercially available sensors and operating either in the time domain or in the frequency domain.

The GPR E 108 Q and BPR E 110 Q variants, however, behave more similarly to their bacteriorhodopsin analogue, D 96 N, with diffraction arising from the PR M-state (strongly enhanced in both GPR E 108 Q and BPR E 110 Q). Of the four proteins evaluated, wild type (WT) <b>GPR</b> <b>and</b> <b>GPR</b> E 108 Q produce the highest diffraction efficiencies, Łmax, at 1 % for a 1. 7 OD sample.
