5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating <b>duty</b> <b>officer</b> about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E

In July, Marshal Budenny received orders {{to combine the}} Southern Front and North Caucasian Front into a single formation retaining the title of North Caucasian Front, and 51st Army joined the 'Don group' of that front under General Lieutenant Rodion Malinovsky, along with the 12th Army and the 37th Army. On 22 July, army commander Major general Nikolai Trufanov was relieved of command. As part of the Stalingrad Front (from 1–5 August), then briefly with the Southeast Front (from 6 August until 27 September), and then back with the Stalingrad Front it {{took part in the}} Battle of Stalingrad. On 31 July when it came under Stalingrad Front control it was so worn down by its previous rough handling that it was only 3,000 men strong. It was attacked on the same day by the 4th Panzer Army, which was able to break through. During Operation Uranus, the counterattack from Stalingrad, the 4th Mechanized Corps began its attack from the 51st Army's sector. In early December, 51st Army was deployed to cover the Kotelnikovo approaches against German relief attempts by the LVII. Panzerkorps. On 24–25 December 1942, the commander of 51st Army, Major-General N.I. Trufanov, organized a local offensive operation on the right flank with the forces of three rifle divisions, and moved to the north bank of the Aksav River, {{on the eve of the}} Kotelnikovo offensive operation, which eventually defeated the German efforts made as part of Operation Winter Storm to relieve the Sixth Army in Stalingrad. On 30 January 1943, the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 51 destroyed the 51st Army's Headquarters, near Salsk. Dropping 100– 250kg bombs, a wave of Junkers Ju 88s and Heinkel He 111s destroyed the communications center, working offices of the chief-of-staff, the operational headquarters and the offices of the operational <b>duty</b> <b>officer.</b> Up to 20 buildings and personnel billets were also destroyed.

The methods used involved distributing a selfadministered questionnaire to a sample of permanent beat <b>officers</b> and general <b>duty</b> <b>officers</b> in thirtynine of the forty-three forces. The research found that the proportion of all uniform patrol officers allocated to beat duties varied widely among police force areas, ranging from over 50 per cent to fewer than 10 per cent. Community constables were less frequently female and more frequently aged over 30 years than general <b>duty</b> <b>officers.</b> Beat officers spent about 20 per cent of their working time withdrawn from beat duties to conduct other unrelated <b>duties.</b> Overall, beat <b>officers</b> were generally satisfied with their job and believed that community constable work was important. Forces in which beat officers reported that they were relatively less satisfied with their job tended to be those forces in which general <b>duty</b> <b>officers</b> also reported that they were relatively less satisfied with their job. The paper concludes by drawing attention to some of the features of the use of community constables which are of current concern and which might generate problems in the future...|$|R
