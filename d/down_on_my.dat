25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat <b>down.</b> <b>On</b> <b>my</b> left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the lyrics}} of the song like [...] "Do {{you want to see}} me <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees?" [...] portray female helplessness, the video {{performance}} acts as a counter-text to it. When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling on the road in front of the advancing car, then turns her head back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's further {{inspiration}} for the track came from the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. She introduced liturgical words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning. With superficial pop lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface, the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners. Leonard {{explained that he was}} not comfortable with the lyrics and the sexual innuendos present in it. He gave the example of the first verse for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] which goes [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer, I'm <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees, I wanna take you there." [...] Leonard understood that the dual meaning referred to someone performing fellatio. Being aghast he requested that Madonna change the line, but she was adamant about keeping it.|$|E
500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1936, the Spanish Civil War {{started after}} an {{attempted}} coup d'état by {{parts of the}} Spanish Army against {{the government of the}} Second Spanish Republic. At the same time, the Spanish anarchists, fighting against the Nationalist forces, started an anarchist revolution. Goldman was invited to Barcelona and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, [...] "the crushing weight that was pressing <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart since Sasha's death left me as by magic". She was welcomed by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) organizations, {{and for the first time}} in her life lived in a community run by and for anarchists, according to true anarchist principles. [...] "In all my life", she wrote later, [...] "I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity." [...] After touring a series of collectives in the province of Huesca, she told a group of workers: [...] "Your revolution will destroy forever [...] that anarchism stands for chaos." [...] She began editing the weekly CNT-FAI Information Bulletin and responded to English-language mail.|$|E

2500|$|Not suspecting {{anything}} untoward, I continued my level climb. All of {{a sudden}} there was a loud noise in my cockpit— I'd taken cannon [...] fire.

2500|$|Blue Horse came to Burbank's studio one hot day, fanning {{himself with}} a big turkey wing.

To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with his other hand, and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|E

I just buried myself in the last 500 meters. I {{knew it was going to}} hurt, but it hurts for everyone. With 100 meters to go I wanted to quit, but I did one more click <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> gears and I just counted the pedal strokes to get me to the finish. This hurt worse than I’ve ever hurt before." [...] She also felt sorry for Evelyn Stevens who missed a place on the podium by 0.04 seconds. [...] "It's a very bittersweet feeling for me. Evelyn is a good friend, a teammate and a fellow countryman. We've spent a lot of time together this season and it's hard to have been beaten and have it be so close".|$|E

[...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head.
