40|$|Preparation of the {{basal area}} in {{acrylate}} <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> {{is a very}} important factor in the quality of a dental prosthesis. It refers to the link between <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> and acrylic denture base made of heat polymerized acrylic. The most common reason for failure of mobile prosthetic works is falling <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> acrylate prosthetic base. The failure is due to the manner of connection between the base and <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth.</b> As the main factor which affects the level of retention is mechanical preparation of the basal area in acrylate teeth. For the realization of the set targets were tested 10 acrylic models. The theme was designed to show the justification for the mechanical preparation of the basal area in acrylate <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth,</b> then using a light microscope to measure the size of the crack between acrylic <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> and acrylic denture base. The paper described two techniques, without preparation and separation technique, which justify the best technique of preparation. The results can be analyzed that the maximum distance to the interspace occurs models from the A group.

30|$|Full arch {{prosthesis}} is one {{alternative to}} rehabilitate edentulous patients. This prosthesis consists of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> {{mounted on a}} mucus supported acrylic resin base with the purpose to restore aesthetics, phonetics and mastication [1]. During chewing, the stresses induced in the denture may cause injury to the support tissue, if equilibrium conditions suitable for occlusal adjustment are not created [2].

Furthermore, there is a chemical interaction between the resin base and <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> [3]. Regarding disadvantages, acrylic resin <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> exhibit often-occlusal wear, which leads to decreased masticatory efficiency and loss of vertical dimension [5].They also present clinical problems, as they suffer remolding of worn occlusal surfaces in denture teeth [5, 6], and fractures or debonding from the prosthesis base [7].|$|R

This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using <b>artificial</b> primary <b>teeth</b> for conducting laboratory research through an experiment related to canal length determination, comparing <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> with natural teeth. Methods Thirty anterior and 21 posterior <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth,</b> and the same number of natural primary teeth were selected. After preparing the access cavity, the root canal length was determined by two examiners twice using three different methods: radiography and two electronic apex locators. Then, the actual root canal length was measured by inserting a K-file up to the apical foramen (reference standard). Accuracy was calculated using Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The inter- and intra-examiner reproducibility was also calculated using the ICC. Results The methods using the electronic apex locators showed better accuracy in both <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>teeth.</b> Trends observed with <b>artificial</b> primary <b>teeth</b> were similar to those observed with natural teeth, except for the results in <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Conclusions The model of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> might be a good alternative for educational purposes; however, improvements are necessary to employ these teeth for research purposes when considering experiments for canal length determination.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this paper}} was to present methods of {{placement}} of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth</b> in edentulous individuals. The following review takes account of the majority of papers published during the last 100 years. The review has been divided into sections regarding the method used to determine the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Geometric aspect Gysi (1895 - 1920) produced the first scientific theory about the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Physiognomic theory The {{aim of this}} theory is to find the most natural position for <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth</b> for each individual. Camper's "face angle" as a physiognomic criterion, has been introduced in papers of Wehrli (1961), Marxhors (1966), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973). Esthetic aspect Important names in the field of dental esthetics are: Schön and Singer (1961), Arnheim (1965), Krajiček (1969), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973), Goldstein (1976). They have introduced principles of visual aspects for selection of contours, dimension and position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Constitution aspect Flagg (1880), Williams (1913) and Hrauf (1957, 1958), have considered body constitution and individual characteristics regarding position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Physiological theory In 1971, Marxhors pointed {{to the fact that the}} position of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> corresponds with the function of the surrounding soft tissue and from the aspect of physiognomy as well. Phonetic aspect According to Silverman (1962) <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth</b> are nearest when we pronounce the sound "S". Cephalometrical research Rayson (1970), Watson (1989), Strajnić Lj. (1999), Bassi F. (2001) have presented cephalometric radiographic analyses of natural anterior teeth compared with cephalometric radiographic analyses of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> A review of dental literature shows several factors suggesting modalities which should determine the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Numerous methods have been designed for evaluation of the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> However, there is no universally reliable method regarding determination of the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Failure of bonding between <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> and {{denture base}} {{material}} {{is a considerable}} problem for patients who wear dentures. According to the different impact of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> and different information about resistance force of mastication and also with deficiency in researchs, {{this study was designed}} to compare the bond strength of composite and acrylic <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> to auto-polymerized denture base resins with and without cyclic loading.   Materials and Methods: In this experimental and in vitro study, an acrylic resin auto-polymerized (Rapid Repair, Dentsply) and four <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> (Acrylic Marjan new, Composite Glamour teeth and Ivoclar acrylic and composite teeth) were used. Therefore, 8 groups of 10 specimens each were evaluated. All specimens were thermocycled for 5000 cycles, in water baths between 5 and 55 ◦ C. Half the specimens in each group were treated with cyclic loading at 50 N for 14, 400 cycles at 1. 2 Hz. The shear bond strengths were measured using a Universal Testing Machine. Data were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA test.   Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant effect of cyclic loading on the shear bond strength, but the type of <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> affected the shear bond strength (P= 0. 006). Also, the interaction between Cyclic loading and the type of <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> showed no significant difference (P= 0. 98). Tukey test showed that acrylic teeth (Ivoclar) had statistically higher bond strength values than that of other teeth (PGlamour= 0. 02), (PComposite ivoclar= 0. 01) and (PMarjan new= 0. 02).   Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, the predominant type of fracture in all groups was cohesive, therefore the bond strength was adequate in all teeth and the type of <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> may influence the bond strength of denture teeth to denture base resin. Cyclic loading had no significant effect on the bond strength of denture teeth to the auto-polymerized acrylic resin...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{investigate}} the influence of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength of two different type of <b>artificial</b> resin <b>teeth</b> repaired with composite resin. Fifteen (15) <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> of each material (CR-composite resin and AR-acrylic resin) were divided into four parts and then embedded in acrylic resin. After, the teeth were separated into eight groups according to the surface treatments prior to the repair: control group (c), adhesive application (a), sandblasting (S) and sandblasting followed by adhesive application (Sa). Next, a composite resin cylinder (Ø[*]=[*] 0.95  mm e h[*]=[*] 2  mm) simulating a repair was built onto each surface. The specimens were submitted to a microshear bond test after 24  h, using a universal testing machine (1  mm/min, 50 kgf) until fracture. The data was subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test, with a significance level of 5 %. ANOVA showed statistical difference for the interaction <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> material* surface treatment (p[*]=[*] 0.001). CR teeth (29.79 [*]±[*] 11.54  MPa) showed higher bond strength mean values than AR (18.48 [*]±[*] 9.73  MPa). Regardless the <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> material, Sa (36.92 [*]±[*] 6.16  MPa) treatment showed the higher bond strength values. The highest bond strength value was found in CRSa (45.93 [*]±[*] 7.13  MPa) and the lowest was found in ARc (5.38 [*]±[*] 0.90  MPa). Based on the results, tooth material should be taken in account in order to choose the best surface treatment and achieve suitable bond strength values when a repair is necessary. For <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> in acrylic resin, applying an adhesive system is the best procedure, with or without sandblasting the alumina particles. However, for <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> in composite resin, an association of sandblasting followed by applying an adhesive system showed more promising bond strength values.|$|R

PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify wear of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> in vivo and to relate it to subject and tooth variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects treated with complete dentures received 2 <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> materials (polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) /double-cross linked PMMA fillers; 35 %/ 59 % (SR Antaris DCL, SR Postaris DCL); experimental 48 %/ 46 %). At baseline and after 12 months, impressions of the dentures were poured with improved stone. After laser scanning, the casts were superimposed and matched. Maximal vertical loss (mm) and volumetric loss (mm(3)) were calculated for each tooth and log-transformed to reduce variability. Volumetric loss was related to the occlusally active surface area. Linear mixed models were used to study the influence of the factors jaw, tooth, and material on adjusted (residual) wear values (alpha=. 05). RESULTS: Due to drop outs (n= 5) and unmatchable casts (n= 3), 69 % of all teeth were analyzed. Volumetric loss had a strong linear relationship to surface area (P<. 001); this was less pronounced for vertical loss (P=. 004). The factor showing the highest influence was the subject. Wear was tooth dependent (increasing from incisors to molars). However, these differences diminished once the wear rates were adjusted for occlusal area, and only a few remained significant (anterior versus posterior maxillary teeth). Another influencing factor was the age of the subject. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical wear of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> is higher than previously measured or expected.

A ran-dom sample of female residents aged 18 years old and above in Jeddah were surveyed by written questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were used. More than half of the subjects (59 %) believed that <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> are not as good as natural teeth. The majority of them (86 %) were aware that it is better to replace missing teeth, and (83 %) knew that not replacing missing teeth has bad consequences. Thirty-four percent (34 %) thought it is important to replace missing teeth for only chewing food properly. There were no sig-nificant differences among different levels of education. The distribution of missing <b>teeth,</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> and type of prosthesis were significantly affected by age distribution and educational level. More than half of the respondents (64 %) lost their teeth due to caries. Most of the subjects (87 %) brush their ar-tificial teeth daily and 7. 9 % wash them with water and soap. In conclusion, different levels of education had no significant effect regarding knowledge concerning <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth,</b> and teeth replacement. Education and age have a significant effect towards missing teeth and type of prosthesis. Income was not a significant factor in relation to missing and <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth,</b> and type of prosthesis in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Caries followed by periodontal disease were the main reasons for losing teeth...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare proportion of mesiodistal width of central incisors in the maxilla to those in the mandible in students and products of Idealmako Company. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 93 students of Isfahan Faculty of Dentistry in the age range of 20 - 30 were selected randomly. Mesiodistal widths of left and right upper and lower centrals were recorded by two methods: directly, using an intraoral caliper, and indirectly, using subjects’ casts and a caliper with an accuracy of 0. 01 mm at height of counter of the teeth three times. The sizes of Idealmako products were measured by the same caliper. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, t-test and post hoc Scheffé’s test using SPSS software (α = 0. 05). Results: Proportion of upper-to-lower mesiodistal width of centrals was 1. 55 ± 0. 13 in students and 1. 68 ± 0. 17 in Idealmako products. Conclusion: Mean proportion of mesiodistal width of upper centrals to lower centrals in natural teeth is less than that in <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth.</b> A similarity between the width of upper centrals in the natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> (the numerator of the fraction) accounts for this significant difference between the proportion of the two groups, leading to the very small size of lower centrals (denominator of the fraction) in Idealmako <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth.</b> Key words: <b>Artificial</b> <b>teeth,</b> Dental esthetics...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> for endodontic teaching. A questionnaire was prepared and submitted to 18 professors of Endodontics from different Brazilian universities to evaluate the following features of five cloudy resin artificial teeth: internal and external anatomy; coronal chambers regarding their size, shape and canal path; root canal regarding their size, shape and position; fulfillment of the pulp chamber and root canals by considering the texture, quantity, color, and ease of handling; resin hardness and visualization of the radiographic image. The results presented favorable opinions, in terms of internal and external anatomy, coronal pulp chambers and root canal and handling and radiographic imaging. The contents of the pulp space and hardness of the teeth were considered satisfactory. The average grade assigned to the <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> quality was 8. 4, in a 0 - 10 scale. In conclusion, the <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> have potential to replace the natural teeth in endodontic teaching; however, improvements are still necessary to reach a better quality model...|$|R
40|$|Denture {{stability}} is of primary {{importance for the}} suc-cessful result of the prosthetic treatment of totally edentu-lous patients. The authors aim was to present their methods for selecting posterior <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> form by patients with compromised stability of the full dentures. After a profile teleroentgenography and measuring the condylar pathways and its angle to the Camper’s line, different sets of posteri-or <b>tooth</b> form of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> were chosen- Orthocal, Ar-tic (20 ?) or Basic (30 ?), Heraeus Kulzer, Gmbh&Co. KG. The new prosthetic treatment showed very good stability of the full dentures at function assessed by the patients them-selves and checked by the clinical tests.

40|$|The {{presence}} of proportionate teeth size in either arch {{is a must}} to obtain an ideal occlusion with good alignment, ideal overjet, ideal overbite and Class I molar relationship. The above facts made us think and to know if this proportion between maxillary and mandibular <b>teeth</b> existed in <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> also? Hence, a survey is undertaken to study the tooth size relation in commercially available <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth.</b> From {{the results of the}} present study it was concluded that the anterior and the overall ratios are slightly varied when compared to the standard Bolton’s ratios. On comparison the difference between the study ratios and the standard Bolton’s ratios were not statistically significant...|$|R
