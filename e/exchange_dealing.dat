40|$|This paper {{provides}} a microstructural {{explanation for the}} success of two familiar predictions from technical analysis: 1) trends tend to be reversed at predictable support and resistance levels, and 2) trends gain momentum once predictable support and resistance levels are crossed.; The explanation is based on a close examination of stop-loss and take-profit orders at a large foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>dealing</b> bank. Take-profit orders tend to reflect price trends, and stop-loss orders tend to intensify trends. The requested execution rates of these orders are strongly clustered at round numbers, which are often used as support and resistance levels. Significantly, there are marked differences between the clustering patterns of stop-loss and take-profit orders, and between the patterns of stop-loss buy and stop-loss sell orders. These differences explain the success of the two predictions. Financial markets; International finance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Launching new {{contracts}} for trading in the futures markets {{is an expensive}} and risky business. The literature about the derivative markets has discussed this topic from a financial view point. This article uses the economic history approach and methods to analyze {{the development of a}} futures contract for cotton by the São Paulo Commodities Exchange. The main conclusion is that in a developing country, in addition to all relevant factors applying to advanced countries, it is necessary to organize the production chain of the business. For this organization, BMSP engaged in the areas of learning, innovation, technology and institutional development. 1 – GENERAL OBJECTIVES The derivatives markets (forward, futures, option and swaps) are gaining a growing importance in the Brazilian economy, repeating a phenomenon which happened {{in some of the most}} important market economies of the world.

40|$|What {{triggers}} extreme exchange-rate returns? Though news is {{the source}} of volatility in standard theoretical models, in reality volatility is often unrelated to news. This paper shows that extreme exchange-rate returns – and, more generally, high kurtosis of returns – are statistically inevitable {{even in the absence of}} news. We identify four microstructural sources of return kurtosis in price-contingent order flow: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of price-contingent order sizes; (2) clustering of price-contingent order executions at certain times of day; (3) clustering of order executions at certain price levels; and (4) the tendency of positive-feedback trading to propagate trends. Using simulations calibrated to price-contingent orders placed at a major foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>dealing</b> bank we show that when each factor operates in isolation, the one that contributes most to kurtosis in returns is kurtosis in the order-size distribution. When the factors operate simultaneously, however, their interactions prove far more important. Extreme returns in the absence of news should be viewed as natural rather than anomalous.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the High Court's {{rejection}} of claims made against a UK bank by a US-based customer in relation to foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>dealing</b> it carried out as agent for its US affiliate based on common law and breaches of COBS Rules (BankLeumi (UK) plc v. Wachner, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court; Mr Justice Faux). Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses this action and counterclaim by the defendant. Findings – The Judge did not find any of the three causes of action underlying the counterclaim to have any foundation, and he found the defendant liable for the full amount of the claim. Originality/value – This paper draws attention to investors' attempts to shift trading losses onto the counterparties with or through whom they dealt through the use of common law, fiduciary principles or statutory tort claims. Such claims have no chance of succeeding unless the claimants can establish that they were incorrectly classified as an expert customer. Another point of interest to draw from this decision is to recall that product design and pre-emptive restrictions on product innovation are once again a prominent feature of current debates on regulatory reform.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{about the}} origins and characteristics of the Coup of 64. In order to do so, we use the interdisciplinary bibliographic research. On the first topic {{the origins of the}} coup of 64 are analyzed, highlighting the role played by political, economic and social factors that were its tangential. Then, our research comments the characteristics of the coup of 64, especially the bureaucratic authoritarian character; consensual legitimacy of civil society; the extension of the central military power; State terrorism implemented through the institutionalization of enforcement agencies to commit serious human rights violations and the authoritarian legality. By the end, it is concluded that the coup of 64 is headquartered in factual and symbolic legacy of Vargas, represented in the imaginary of elites, mainly by the figure of the former president João Goulart, coupled to polarization between capitalism and communism at the global level and at economic struggles on opening markets, remittance of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>dealing</b> abroad and increased investment from the state to the private sector. In the same way, it verifies that Brazil singled out for its bureaucratic authoritarianism, by legitimacy - of origin - consented by the sophistication of its state terrorism, as well as, the exacerbation of its authoritarian legality. Furthermore, it stresses the nature of the coup of 64, and not “revolution” and its hybridity, due to the support of civil seizure to the achievement of power by the military segments...|$|E
40|$|Summary. In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} the interbank <b>exchange</b> <b>dealing,</b> which {{incorporates}} the following three variables, dealing time intervals and spreads between offer and bid prices, and price movements, in order to discuss complex behavior of price movements observed in real markets and its mechanism. For discussing the plausibility of our model, we compare outputs from the proposed model with the real data by reconstructing a state space with the three variables, observing ensemble behavior in each day and estimating statistical properties, such as power spectra and cumulative distribution functions. We show the possibility to explain the complex mechanism of the foreign exchange market with the proposed model. It is widely acknowledged that the market price data, e. g., stock prices and foreign exchange rates, often exhibit very complex behavior and that {{it is very difficult to}} predict their movement accurately. Its difficulty might come from the fact that several variables in the system are related each other. Then, it is simple but very natural to consider that, if we make a prediction model with all these variables, we can expect improvement of prediction accuracy. However, all variables in real financial systems could not be essential factors on dynamics of the systems. Namely, using unsuitable variables may lead to the reduction of prediction accuracy. Thus, it is an essential problem to identify which variables give an essential effect to the higher predictability...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{revised version of}} chapter two of my Ph. D. {{dissertation}} at New York University. I wish to thank members of my dissertation committee, Joel Hasbrouck (co-chair) and Richard Levich (co-chair) and Matthew Richardson for encouragement and suggestions. I am grateful to Heinz Riehl, David Buchen and a major commercial bank in New York City for providing the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>dealing</b> data used in this study. All errors are entirely my own. This paper studies dealer trading profits, spread components and implications for market making costs for a representative dealer in the foreign exchange market. Though accounting for only about 14 % of total trade volume, customer trades generate about 75 % of the dealer’s gross trading profits. Inter-dealer trades have negligible profit implications for the dealer who maintains his function as a liquidity provider by taking inter-dealer trades and subsequently offsetting the trades at other dealers ’ quotes. The FX dealer engages in very limited speculation (less than 5 % of total volume) and seems to profit from his brief informational advantage upon observing order flows. This contradicts with the popular conjecture that attributes high inter-dealer volume and short term market volatility to FX dealers ’ excessive speculation. Dealer trading profits are analyzed from another perspective by decomposing the spread components as in Glosten and Harris (1988). This study extends the existing approach to account for lagged quote adjustments to order flows facilitated by the low market transparency of FX markets. The FX dealer is found to bear only {{about one-third of the}} adverse selection costs as a result of risk sharing among market participants arising from the existing FX market structure. Moreover, inventory control costs are estimated to account for at least 70 % of the profits that the dealer would have made in a naive model where a dealer collects half of the quoted spread on each trade. 11...|$|E
