In 1966, {{there was an}} {{accelerated}} growth pattern of the Foreign Ministry {{particularly with regard to}} the personnel and the financial allocation for its activities. That year also witnessed a change in the designation of MEA to the preferred terminology of [...] "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" [...] and also saw the physical relocation and consolidation of the Ministry. From its original premises at the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, the Ministry moved to Wisma Putra. The Wisma Putra Complex is based on a combination of both traditional and modern architecture.|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} player {{behind the}} Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement, as regards patents, was {{a handful of}} American pharmaceutical transnational corporations ('big pharma'). Given that TRIPs was exceptionally controversial, how was US big pharma uniquely enabled to command the entire trade <b>diplomatic</b> <b>machinery</b> of the US and, through that, enact global law in its favour? This paper explores one crucial factor in the enacting of TRIPs, namely the prior pursuit of domestic US patent reform, from which a highly integrated and powerful single-issue political coalition between US big pharma, the new biotechnology sector and academic life science departments was formed. This created the political context in the US in which patent issues, particularly those affecting the pharmaceuticals industry, came to be considered matters of state. But explaining both {{the success of this}} patent coalition and the subsequent success of the US-led international demands for TRIPs in turn demands appeal to analysis {{of the structure of the}} global economy and its transformation to one of neoliberal financialisation, from a watershed of 1980. The paper explores how the critical histories of each of the three sectors of the patent coalition are illuminated by analysis in the context of this structural change and the underlying connections between apparently disparate issues it reveals...|$|E
40|$|The Peace Policy of Spain, 1596 - 16 CU. is an {{examination}} of the motives of the government of Philip II and of Philip III in bringing to an end a long and exhausting war with three enemies - France, England and the United Provinces. It is based almost entirely upon original manuscript sources, most of which have not previously been studied in depth or for the period as a whole. The intellectual climate in which decisions were made, the political state of the Court, the efficiency of the handling of foreign affairs, the dramatis personae and their attitude towards Spain and her resources are first described by way of introduction. Relations with the Low Countries are then examined so as to provide the back-cloth {{to the rest of the}} foreign policy, and the war against the Dutch is shown as being Spain's true priority. The chapters on the negotiations that led up to the Treaty of Vervins (1598), on the Saluzzo crisis (1600) and on the cold war that culminated in the Biron conspiracy (l 602) shew the working-out of a new policy towards France. Anglo-Spanish affairs occupy the chapters on the failure to find a naval or, in the English succession question, a diplomatic solution to the problem of England's hostility, and those on the preliminaries and course of the Treaty of London (1604.). New light is thrown on to the efficiency and range of Spain's governmental and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>machinery,</b> as on to her sense of imperial mission; some of the customary strictures upon the government's vapidity and indifference are strongly criticized; and Spain's great reluctance to face the economic and military fact that she had outgrown her strength emerges with clarity...|$|E
40|$|The central {{question}} posed by {{this study is}} why Indonesian foreign policy during Yudhoyono administration, compared to the previous ones, came to embrace policy of active engagement with the issues of Muslim concerns? Using state level analysis that rests on the proposition that foreign policy begins at domestic situation and that external posture of state is determined mainly by the internal factor, this qualitative study attempted {{to search for the}} possible answer through dynamic relations between state and political Islam in Indonesia as the prime mover. Drawn mainly from library research and interview, it revealed that both Soekarno and Soeharto have sidelined political Islam from the central discourse of domestic politics. Parallel to that, Indonesian foreign policy has been neutralized from Islamic influence, blocking Islamist groups from advancing their political standing at the international forum. Yudhoyono administration, however, showed significant shift by adopting series of foreign policies that show significant interest in Muslim concerns. It was first time that Islamic glossaries entered foreign policy speeches, and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>machinery</b> often cited jargons such as moderate Muslim, rahmatan lil ālamīn, and ummatan wasaṭan. The fact that Indonesia is a country with Muslim majority has been transformed to be the source of Indonesia’s international identity, which consequently infused Indonesia to be involved in addressing various contemporary ummatic challenges, forging closer and strategic relations with the Middle East countries, mainly Saudi, as the cradle of Muslim civilization, and collaborating with Muslim organizations and intellectuals in formulating and implementing some of foreign policies. In doing so, Yudhoyono has made Islam, rather than being a liability, as foreign policy asset. Further, this study reveals that Yudhoyono’s resort to Islam due to two interrelated matters: the increasing importance of Islam in domestic politics in Indonesia, and the increasing level of state’s confidence towards Islam, both of which consequently permit the Islamic nuance to be present in Indonesian foreign policy. The gradual proximity between state and Islam created harmonious and constructive relations, enabling Islam to make inroads in informing foreign policy, either dialectically through the Muslim pressure to the government, or peacefully by voluntary state’s reception to incorporate Muslim aspirations...|$|E
