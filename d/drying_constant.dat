40|$|ABSTRACT Jabuticaba is a fruit {{native of}} Brazil and, besides {{containing}} many nutritional qualities, {{it also has}} a good field for use in products such as flour for cakes and biscuits, juice, liqueur, jelly and others. This study aimed to model the drying kinetics and determine the thermodynamic properties of jabuticaba peel at different drying air temperatures.

Drying was carried out in a forced-air circulation oven with a flow of 5. 6 m s- 1 at temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C. Six mathematical models commonly used to represent the drying process of agricultural products were fitted to the experimental data.

40|$|Two {{years of}} field drying data on unconditioned, {{mechanically}} conditioned, chemically conditioned and mechanical-cum-chemically conditioned hay {{were used to}} develop lucerne hay drying models for predicting day-time moisture loss and overnight moisture uptake. Two types of moisture loss models were developed, one predicting the thin-layer <b>drying</b> <b>constant</b> ("k-model") and the other predicting drying rate directly ("DR-model"). The moisture uptake model predicted change in moisture content due to overnight dew. The "DR-model" provided a better prediction than the "k-model", reflected in R~ values of 0. 85 and 0. 65 respectively. The <b>drying</b> <b>constant</b> (k) and the drying rate (DR) were greatly influenced by solar radiation but use of potential evaporation as a lumped weather factor did not improve the prediction. Regression values indicated that rain and dew absorbed by the lucerne plant evaporated significantly faster than moisture from within the plant. The mechanical and chemical conditioning treatments resulted in higher values of k and DR, particularly during early stages of drying under favorable weather conditions. Overnight moisture content increase was largely influenced by the moisture content at sunset, but it decreased as vapor pressure deficit and swath/windrow density increased.

Temperature dependence of mass transfer coefficients is established in terms of Arrhenius type of relation. <b>Drying</b> <b>constant</b> and shrinkage constant of different shaped samples are also studied. Simple mathematical expressions are developed relating volumetric shrinkage constant with <b>drying</b> <b>constant.</b> Dimensionless groups viz. Reynolds number, Schmidt number, and Sherwood number are determined at different drying conditions. With the knowledge of diffusivity and dimensionless groups, mass transfer coefficients are determined. The physical properties of samples are also analyzed at different levels of moisture contents. The performance of fluidized bed dryer measured in terms of its efficiency is investigated by using different samples. The effects of different system parameters (viz. temperature, time, and density of material and fluid velocity) on the drying performances i. e. on moisture content, diffusivity and efficiency of the samples are also studied through different mathematical expressions. Artificial Neural Network and Taguchi analysis are used to validate the developed correlations for drying characteristics. The chi square (χ 2), correlation coefficient (R 2) and root mean square error (RMSE) findings indicate that ANN and Taguchi analysis optimize the system parameters of the fluidized bed drying more effectively than regression analysis. Thus the developed correlations can be used for parameter-optimizations over a wide range thereby providing a better platform for efficient operations. Again a portable tapered fluidized bed dryer is designed to provide drying in turn storing opportunity to farmers. Thus the present work lays foundation for an efficient dryer to be designed effectively which can further be scaled up suitably for industrial applications. ...|$|E
