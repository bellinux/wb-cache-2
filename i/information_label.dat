40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine how}} weight <b>information</b> <b>labels</b> on {{variously}} sized media models affect (pre) adolescent girls' body perceptions {{and how they}} compare themselves with media models. METHODS: We used a three (body shape: extremely thin vs. thin vs. normal weight) × three (information label: 6 -kg underweight vs. 3 -kg underweight vs. normal weight) experimental design in three age-groups (9 - 10 years, 12 - 13 years, and 15 - 16 years; n = 184). The girls completed questionnaires after exposure to media models. RESULTS: Weight <b>information</b> <b>labels</b> affected girls' body dissatisfaction, social comparison with media figures, and objectified body consciousness. Respondents exposed to an extremely thin body shape labeled to be of "normal weight" were most dissatisfied with their own bodies and showed highest levels of objectified body consciousness and comparison with media figures. An extremely thin body shape combined with a corresponding label (i. e., 6 -kg underweight), however, induced less body dissatisfaction and less comparison with the media model. Age differences were also found to affect body perceptions: adolescent girls showed more negative body perceptions than preadolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Weight <b>information</b> <b>labels</b> may counteract the generally media-induced thin-body ideal. That is, when the weight labels appropriately informed the respondents about the actual thinness of the media model's body shape, girls were less affected. Weight <b>information</b> <b>labels</b> also instigated a normalization effect when a "normal-weight" label was attached to underweight-sized media models. Presenting underweight as a normal body shape, clearly increased body dissatisfaction in girls. Results also suggest age between preadolescence and adolescence as a critical criterion in responding to media models' body shape...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide {{evidence}} {{on the effects of}} two front-of-pack text-based <b>information</b> <b>labels</b> on purchasing of high sugar beverages. Labels advise of increased risk of obesity or diabetes associated with high sugar beverage consumption. METHODS: A postal survey was developed to obtain information on current household beverage purchases, understanding of the proposed <b>information</b> <b>labels,</b> and stated changes in purchasing resulting from the application of the labels. RESULTS: 130 completed surveys were returned (response rate 66 %). In a typical week, 79. 2 % of households purchased at least one of five high sugar beverages. In purchasing households, estimated sugar intake from high sugar beverages alone ranged from 12. 3 g to 2307. 2 g per person per week (equivalent to 30 to 5603 kJ per day), with a median intake of 185. 1 g (450 kJ per day). 41. 7 % (95 %CI 25. 5 to 59. 2) of diabetes label respondents and 35. 3 % (95 %CI 22. 4 to 49. 9) of obesity label respondents stated they would reduce purchasing of at least one labelled high sugar beverage. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Provides preliminary evidence that front-of-pack text-based <b>information</b> <b>labels</b> advising consumers of health risk may be a potentially effective way to reduce purchasing and consumption of high sugar beverages.

40|$|In {{the last}} five years, China's {{refrigerator}} market has grown rapidly, and now urban markets are showing signs of saturation, with ownership rates in urban households reaching 92 %. Rural markets continue to grow from a much lower base. As {{a result of this}} growth, the Chinese government in 2006 decided to revise the refrigerator standards and its associated efficiency grades for the mandatory energy <b>information</b> <b>label.</b> In the Chinese standards process, the efficiency grades for the <b>information</b> <b>label</b> are tied to the minimum standards. Work on the minimum standards revision began in 2006 and continued through the first half of 2007, when the draft standard was completed {{under the direction of the}} China National Institute of Standardization (CNIS). Development of the <b>information</b> <b>label</b> grades required consideration of stakeholder input, continuity with the previous grade classification, ease of implementation, and potential impacts on the market. In this process, CLASP, with the support of METI/IEEJ, collaborated with CNIS to develop the efficiency grades, providing technical input to the process, comment and advice on particular technical issues, and evaluation of the results. After three months of effort and three drafts of the final grade specifications, this work was completed. In addition, in order to effectively evaluate the impact of the label on China's market, CLASP further provided assistance to CNIS to collect data on both the efficiency distribution and product volume distribution of refrigerators on the market. The new <b>information</b> <b>label</b> thresholds to be implemented in 2008 maintain the approach first adopted in 2005 of establishing efficiency levels relative to the minimum standard, but increased the related required efficiency levels by 20 % over those established in 2003 and implemented in 2005. The focus of improvement was on the standard refrigerator/freezer (class 5), which constitutes the bulk of the Chinese market. Indeed, the new requirements to achieve grade 1 on the label are now virtually as stringent as those for US Energy Star-qualified or EU A-grade refrigerators. When the energy <b>information</b> <b>label</b> went into effect in March 2005, refrigerator manufacturers were required to display their declared level of efficiency on the label and report it to the China Energy Label Center (CELC), a newly established unit of CNIS responsible for label program management. Because of the visible nature of the label, it was found, through a METI/IEEJ-supported study, that MEPS non-compliance dropped from 4 % to zero after the label became mandatory, and that the percentage of higher-grade refrigerators increased. This suggests that the label itself does have potential for shifting the market to higher-efficiency models (Lin 2007). One challenge, however, of assessing this potential impact is the lack of a comprehensive baseline of market efficiency and a program to evaluate the market impact on a yearly basis. As a result, the impact evaluation in this study draws upon the market transformation experience of the related EU energy <b>information</b> <b>label,</b> for which quantitative assessments of its market impact exist. By assuming a parallel process unfolding in China, it is possible to look at the potential impact of the label to 2020. The results of the analysis demonstrates that a robust market transformation program in China focused on the energy <b>information</b> <b>label</b> could save substantial amounts of electricity by 2020, totaling 16. 4 TWh annually by that year, compared to a case in which the efficiency distribution of refrigerators was frozen at the 2007 level. Remarkably, the impact of a successful market transformation program with the label would essentially flatten the consumption of electricity for refrigerator use throughout most of the next decade, despite the expectations of continued growth in total stock by nearly 190 million units. At the end of this period, total consumption begins to rise again, as the least efficient of the units have been mostly removed from the market. Such a level of savings would reduce CO{sub 2 }, SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x} and particulate matter as well. Cumulatively to 2020, CO{sub 2 } emissions would decline by 67. 5 million tonnes; SO{sub 2 } by 368, 000 tonnes, NO{sub x} by 263, 000 tonnes, and particulate matter by 1. 6 million tonnes. To ensure that the <b>information</b> <b>label</b> can provide the basis for such a market transformation, additional focus should be paid to regular monitoring and supervision of the label, expansion of market survey and information collection efforts, building recognition and awareness of the benefits of buying higher-ranked models, and development of programs of consumer education and promotion in conjunction with retailers...|$|E

40|$|China has {{developed}} a comprehensive program of energy efficiency standards and labels for household appliances. In 1989, China first launched its minimum energy performance standards (MEPS), which are now applied to an extensive list of products. In 1998, China launched a voluntary energy endorsement label, which has grown to cover both energy-saving and water-saving products. And, in 2005, China launched a mandatory energy <b>information</b> <b>label</b> that initially covered two products. CLASP has assisted China in developing 11 minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for 9 products and endorsement labels for 11 products including: refrigerators; air conditioners; televisions; printers; computers; monitors; fax machines; copiers; DVD/VCD players; external power supplies; and set-top boxes. CLASP has also assisted China {{in the development of}} the mandatory energy <b>information</b> <b>label.</b> Increasingly, attention is being placed on maximum energy savings from China's standards and labeling (S&L) efforts in order to meet the recently announced goal of reducing China's energy intensity by 20 percent by 2010 with an interim objective of 4 percent in 2006. China's mandatory standards system is heavily focused on the technical requirements for efficiency performance, but historically, it has lacked administrative and personnel capacity to undertake monitoring and enforcement of these legally binding standards. Similarly, resources for monitoring and enforcement have been quite limited. As a consequence, compliance to both the mandatory standards and the mandatory energy <b>information</b> <b>label</b> is uneven with the potential and likely result of lost energy savings. Thus, a major area for improvement, which could significantly increase overall energy savings, is the creation and implementation of a regularized monitoring system for tracking the compliance to, and enforcement of, mandatory standards and the energy <b>information</b> <b>label</b> in China. CLASP has been working with the China National Institute of Standardization (CNIS), the China Administration for Quality, Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) and relevant stakeholders in the industry to develop a stronger system of monitoring and enforcement. In November 2005, CNIS and LBNL (a CLASP implementing partner) with funding from the Energy Foundation jointly organized an international workshop to present the international best practices in S&L monitoring and enforcement. Currently, CNIS is developing a guideline for monitoring and enforcement for appliance standards. With support from METI, CLASP has been able to expand the on-going collaboration with CNIS to include enforcement needs for the mandatory energy <b>information</b> <b>label</b> and to accelerate the progress of the project to develop a more robust monitoring and enforcement for S&L programs in China. This expanded effort has included: (1) Holding an enforcement and monitoring roadmap planning workshop with key S&L stakeholders; (2) Interviews with S&L stakeholders on the need and scope of national compliance tests; (3) Research on past enforcement activities; (4) An analysis of compliance data from the mandatory energy information labeling program; (5) Interviews with stakeholders on the need and scope of testing infrastructure; and (6) Development of a roadmap for future activities. This report summarizes the findings of these activities and identifies the progress that China is making, and can make, toward developing a stronger system of monitoring and enforcement (M&E).

40|$|Consumer <b>information</b> <b>labelling</b> is a {{vital part}} of modern {{environmental}} regulation, which has significant advantages over traditional command and control and market mechanism approaches. However, labelling has been accused of distorting competitive conditions by promoting discrimination between imported and domestic like products and by misleading consumers about certain types of products. The problem is qualitatively different from other types of trade dispute because labelling speaks directly to the consumer and her role within freely operating markets. The conflict has become entrenched in textual and ideological disagreements and demands a new approach that acknowledges the importance of providing consumers with information about the environmental implications of their purchasing decisions, while continuing {{to protect the rights of}} exporting WTO Members. This article explores the nature of consumer <b>information</b> <b>labelling</b> in regulatory theory and environmental law and policy, and develops an analytical framework that may help to break the current deadlock.
