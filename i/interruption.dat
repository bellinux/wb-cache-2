In the quantitative analysis, <b>interruptions,</b> reactions to <b>interruptions,</b> and backchannels are identified from the excerpts and categorized.

40|$|<b>Interruptions</b> impair performance, {{but they}} happen {{constantly}} in chaotic environments like Emergency Rooms. Unlike the <b>interruptions</b> {{examined in the}} classic literature, in which <b>interruptions</b> typically distract participants from their primary task, <b>interruptions</b> in more complex, real-world environments are often relevant to suspended actions. Such relevant <b>interruptions</b> may serve to reduce demands on working memory and prospective memory by eliminating the need to monitor multiple aspects of complex situations. We developed computer-based simulation games that required parallel problem solving of multiple crimes (undergraduates) or multiple medical cases (physicians). We then manipulated the presence of <b>interruptions</b> that re-called the player to suspended tasks. Such <b>interruptions</b> led to better overall performance, as measured by total pieces of data collected and other measures of global efficiency.

40|$|How do {{individuals}} {{deal with}} <b>interruptions</b> during tasks with heavy cognitive load? Although <b>interruptions</b> are {{generally regarded as}} disruptive, {{it is possible that}} in some highly complex task circumstances <b>interruptions</b> serve an adaptive function to supplement limited memory stores. To investigate this, we used a simulation game in which participants played detectives investigating a series of complex crime scenes. We manipulated the presence of <b>interruptions</b> to examine circumstances under which <b>interruptions</b> can be beneficial or harmful to task performance. The <b>interruptions</b> were irrelevant to the current case, but vital to the adequate completion of suspended cases. Initial findings show that although <b>interruptions</b> may disrupt local performance on the task being interrupted, global performance, measured by total evidence collected, is aided by <b>interruptions.</b> The results have implications for basic research on prospective memory as well as applied issues of team functioning...|$|R

Most research studies have dealt with <b>interruptions</b> as isolated phenomena, ignoring the simultaneous or sequential occurrence of <b>interruptions</b> common in everyday life.

Furthermore, we explain how cumulative <b>interruptions</b> can lead to qualitatively different effects because of the interaction and joint development of isolated effects, identifying some mediating and moderating factors. In doing so, we disclose the relationships between the effects of single <b>interruptions</b> found in laboratory studies and the impacts on health and well-being of multiple <b>interruptions</b> found in applied research...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interruptions</b> are causal {{factors in}} {{medication}} errors. Although researchers have assessed {{the nature and}} frequency of <b>interruptions</b> during medication administration, {{there has been little}} focus on understanding their effects during medication ordering. The goal of this research was to examine the nature, frequency, and impact of <b>interruptions</b> on oncologists' ordering practices. Direct observations were conducted at a Canadian cancer treatment facility to (1) document the nature, frequency, and timing of <b>interruptions</b> during medication ordering, and (2) quantify the use of coping mechanisms by oncologists. On average, oncologists were interrupted 17 % of their time, and were frequently interrupted during safety-critical stages of medication ordering. When confronted with <b>interruptions,</b> oncologists engaged/multitasked more often than resorting to deferring/blocking. While some <b>interruptions</b> are necessary forms of communication, efforts must be made to reduce unnecessary <b>interruptions</b> during safety-critical tasks, and to develop interventions that increase oncologists' resiliency to inevitable <b>interruptions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Medication {{administration}} {{errors are}} common, costly {{and the cause}} of adverse events in clinical practice. <b>Interruptions</b> during medication administration rounds are thought to be a prominent causative factor of these medication errors. In this observational study, data were collected on the number and duration of several different sources of verbal and non-verbal <b>interruptions</b> using unobtrusive structured observations on 32 medication administration rounds. <b>Interruptions</b> occurred very often (6. 9 times per nurse each hour), differed in frequency among the medication administration rounds and were from a variety of sources. The most frequent <b>interruptions</b> were caused by nursing colleagues (43 %) and non-verbal <b>interruptions</b> from the ward environment (25 %), such as noises from pagers, conversations {{in the vicinity of the}} nurse, the work of cleaners, or stock management by pharmacy staff. The longest durations of <b>interruptions</b> were from nursing colleagues’ verbal interrup- <b>interruptions.</b> When comparing the medication rounds, more and longer <b>interruptions</b> were observed during the morning rounds than those at noon. A comparison between surgical and non-surgical units showed that <b>interruptions</b> occurred more often and lasted longer in non-surgical units than those in surgical units. But the observed differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, <b>interruptions</b> during medication administration rounds are frequent and originated from different human and environmental sources. Interventions should target not only <b>interruptions</b> by colleagues, but should also consider ways to reduce self-initiated <b>interruptions</b> and those arising from the immediate ward environment...|$|R

5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an <b>interruption</b> risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The <b>interruption</b> risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWorkflow <b>interruptions</b> {{during surgery}} may cause {{a threat to}} patient's safety. Workflow <b>interruptions</b> were tested to predict failure in action {{regulation}} that in turn predicts near-accidents in surgery and related health care. MethodsOne-hundred-and-thirty-three theater nurses and physicians from eight Swiss hospitals participated in a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The study participation rate was 43 %. ResultsStructural equation modeling confirmed an indirect path from workflow <b>interruptions</b> through cognitive failure in action regulation on near-accidents (p <  0. 05). The indirect path was stronger for workflow <b>interruptions</b> by malfunctions and task organizational blockages compared with workflow <b>interruptions</b> that were caused by persons. The indirect path remained meaningful when individual differences in conscientiousness and compliance with safety regulations were controlled. ConclusionTask <b>interruptions</b> caused by malfunction and organizational constraints are likely to trigger errors in surgery. Work redesign is recommended to reduce workflow <b>interruptions</b> by malfunction and regulatory constraints...|$|R

Historically, {{the number of}} actual <b>interruptions</b> has been very small -many interruptible consumers have never been required to curtail their usage, and may be assuming that <b>interruptions</b> will never occur.
