25|$|Flashed {{headlamps}} {{can have}} ambiguous or contradictory meanings, {{with no way}} for the observing driver to tell for sure what the flashing driver is trying to say. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean,</b> for example, that the flashing driver intends to yield the right of way, or instead {{that he intends to}} take it. Misinterpretation of the flashing driver's intent can cause crashes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} some {{theoretical}} circumstances where {{the end result is}} infinity. One example is the singularity in the description of black holes. Some solutions of the equations of the general theory of relativity allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a mathematical singularity, or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} physical infinities exist; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of Newtonian gravity and Coulomb's law of electrostatics. Atr=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in regions}} where certain classes of workers are {{restricted}} {{to this type of}} work or there are contributing regional conditions - for example, high unemployment, adjacent to regions with high poverty, or the recipient of driven labor migration - there will be workers willing to accept lower than equilibrium wages and then these jobs are not well paid. Large scale international labor migration, from developing to developed countries since the late 19th century and early 20th century has provided a pool of migrants willing to undertake employment for lower wages than native residents. Higher wages in developed countries are a strong 'pull' factor in international migration, and thus while a migrant worker is willing to accept a comparatively low-wage for a 3D job in a developed country <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> a significant increase in wages compared to their originating country.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E

500|$|The {{toponymy}} of Oldham {{seems to}} imply [...] "old village or place" [...] from Eald (Saxon) signifying oldness or antiquity, and Ham (Saxon) a house, farm or hamlet. Oldham is however {{known to be}} a derivative of Aldehulme, undoubtedly an Old Norse name. It is believed to be derived from the Old English ald combined with the Old Norse holmi or holmr, meaning [...] "promontory or outcrop", possibly describing the town's hilltop position. It has alternatively been suggested that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "holm or hulme of a farmer named Alda". The name is understood to date from 865, during the period of the Danelaw.|$|E
2500|$|In the Yucatec Maya language, {{the name}} [...] "Oxkintok" [...] can be parsed as [...] "Ox" [...] (three) and [...] "Kin" [...] (day/sun), {{but there are}} {{multiple}} possibilities for [...] "Tok" [...] (if the final letter is a soft /K/ then <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "snatch away / defend, lean, fall, or burn", but if the final letter is truly a glottalized /K’/ then <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "puncture, let blood, or chert / flint / hard stone").

2500|$|The name 'Wyangala' (pronounced [...] ) {{originates}} from a Wiradjuri word {{of unknown}} meaning. However, similar sounding {{words in the}} Wiradjuri language indicate <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> troublesome or bad (wanggun) white (ngalar).

[...] For example, Arkansas bars civilian possession of blue lights on or in a vehicle unless sealed in the manufacturer’s original package.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} by John Spottiswood that his surname was [...] "Dermoch", {{but that is}} not corroborated by {{contemporary}} sources and is probably a mistake. His last name appears in contemporary Latin sources as Colini, representing MacCailein, meaning [...] "son of Cailean"; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> that Cailean was the name of his father, but if it was a surname it probably means he was a Campbell, a family also known at the time as MacCailein, believing as they did that they were descended from one Cailean Mór.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an ancient}} myth, when the gods created the first man, they took him from the waters of Lake Texcoco and placed him alone in Acolman. The arm of this man, ringed by drops {{of water from the}} lake is the Aztec glyph for the site. The glyph can also be seen on the monastery which dominates the {{landscape}} here. Acolman is derived from a Nahuatl phrase which has been interpreted in various ways. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "man with hand or arm" [...] or [...] "where man is made." [...] Acolman is the modern name but the settlement has been referred to as Oculma, Axuruman and Aculma in colonial era documents.|$|E
5000|$|Noent, the {{original}} name for Newent, <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "new place" [...] in Celtic. <b>It</b> also <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "new inn" [...] to reference lodging for travellers to Wales, according to John Leland (c. 1503 - 1552).

50|$|The word 'Girka' in Hausa <b>may</b> {{literally}} <b>mean</b> 'to base (something in).' <b>It</b> <b>may</b> also <b>mean</b> 'the spiritual {{activities of}} Bori.' The latter meaning {{has nothing to}} do with Girka village etymologically nor historically. 'Sauri' is the title of Maigari (the Village Head). This title is derived from a Hausa word 'hasten' (to move or travel hurriedly).|$|R
2500|$|Elisabeth enters, {{alarmed at}} the {{apparent}} theft of her jewel casket. However, the King produces it {{and points to}} the portrait of Don Carlos which it contains, accusing her of adultery. She protests her innocence but, when the King threatens her, she faints. In response to his calls for help, into the chamber come Eboli and Posa. Their laments of suspicion cause the King to realize that he has been wrong to suspect his wife ("Maudit soit le soupçon infâme" [...] / [...] "Ah, sii maledetto, sospetto fatale"). Aside, Posa resolves to save Carlos, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> his own death. Eboli feels remorse for betraying Elisabeth; the latter, recovering, expresses her despair.|$|E
2500|$|The word Grianán means sunny place. It was {{appropriated}} {{by the early}} Irish to mean a place with a view. This is probably {{the sense in which}} the word was used to describe the Grianán under discussion. An earlier theory was that the word meant [...] "temple of the sun". This theory has not been substantiated. There is much evidence that the word was constantly used in a figurative sense to signify a distinguished residence or palace. [...] Perhaps, if interpreted in this sense <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> that if one is {{in the presence of a}} king, one will always be in a sunny place. The best summary one can contrive from the etymological breakdown of the name is that it means [...] "The Stone Palace of the Sunny View".|$|E
2500|$|The National {{journalist}} Julie McDowall {{selected the}} documentary as [...] "TV Pick of the Day". McDowall commented, [...] "maybe {{we are about}} to see a US president, {{the most powerful man in}} the world, who could be cowed and ordered about by an aggressive Russia just because it apparently has a sex tape on him." [...] Regarding the quality of Trump-Putin interactions, McDowall wrote, that the documentary [...] "examines the relationship and asks if it is better for all if the two are buddies. If they fall out it could produce fall-out." [...] Times Union contributor Lawrence White wrote, [...] "John Sweeney investigates the Trump-Putin connection and what <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>mean</b> for the world's collective well being." [...] White commented, [...] "The details in the investigative report are shocking and alarming." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{source is}} 1 Timothy 6:10 (St Jerome's Vulgate translation). The word cupiditas is ambiguous, as <b>it</b> <b>may</b> also <b>mean</b> cupidity, or strong desire.

5000|$|Fruit tree pruning is {{the cutting}} and {{removing}} of selected {{parts of a}} fruit tree. It spans a number of horticultural techniques.
