METHODS: Study data (n = 34 788, N = 6 109 572) were obtained from nationally representative Global Youth Tobacco Surveys in 17 Arab countries.

40|$|Life {{scientists}} have increasingly {{been asked to}} incorporate a <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> responsibility in their research conduct. In this thesis, different aspects {{of what constitutes a}} reasonable responsibility in terms of avoiding harmful misuse of research for biological weapon purposes have been explored. The first study investigated the claim that {{scientists have}} a <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> responsibility, and also outlined some of its possible content. Criteria for what may constitute preventable harm were used to analyze some proposed obligations in the field, and it was concluded that reasonable obligations include: e. g. considering the potential negative implications of one’s research and reporting activities of concern. In the second study, the conditions for a Precautionary Principle (PP) were explored and applied to the <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> research context. The study found that the main conditions of the PP frequently appear in present discussions and formulations of life scientists’ responsibility. It was also concluded that the PP is applicable to the <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> field and that it is meaningful and useful as a normatively guiding principle. The third study suggested an ethics of dissemination, {{based on the assumption that}} scientists have a responsibility to occasionally constrain the dispersion of their research findings. Three core aspects were proposed for an ethics of <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> dissemination. Additionally, to help scientists understand when constraints may be justified, three corresponding conditions for their application were suggested. In the fourth study, the concept of ethical competence was introduced and explored within a <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> context. It was concluded that competence-building is important in the nurturing of individual responsibility and, subsequently, in achieving a culture of <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> responsibility in the life sciences. Finally, the discussion on ethical competence was included in a proposed ethic of deliberation, in which various stakeholders in the <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> debate are conceived to participate in communicative processes. It was argued that spaces for deliberative activities should be institutionalized by the scientific community to ensure structural opportunities for individuals to both assume responsibility and share it. Moreover, it was argued that deliberation can constitute a cornerstone of responsible <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> governance...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Inadequate {{prescription}} therapy pain management, lack of doctor-patient communication about over-the-counter (OTC) medications, {{and easy}} accessibility of OTC medications {{may contribute to}} patients using more than 1 medication to manage pain. It is well established that taking multiple nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can lead to serious gastrointestinal problems. Little is known about whether use of more than 1 NSAID (i. e., <b>dual</b> <b>use)</b> is related to patient self-reported outcomes, specifically health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We hypothesized that <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> of NSAIDs {{would be associated with}} reduced HRQOL. METHODS: Patients from a managed care organization who filled 3 ̆e or = 1 NSAID prescription over a 6 -month period were eligible for a telephone interview focusing on NSAID use, which included the Short Form 12 (SF- 12) Health Survey. <b>Dual</b> <b>use</b> was defined as taking 2 NSAIDs, either prescription or OTC, at least twice weekly during the past month. A multivariable linear regression model examined the association between <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> and the Physical Component Summary score (PCS- 12) from the SF- 12. RESULTS: <b>Dual</b> <b>use</b> was associated with lower PCS- 12 scores indicating poorer HRQOL, after controlling for clinical and demographic factors. CONCLUSION: Patients may self-manage their pain to improve their daily activities by taking more than 1 NSAID. However, by attempting to obtain symptom relief, patients may be putting themselves at risk for complications. Providers are likely unaware of patients 2 ̆ 7 risk. Future research should evaluate the causal factors contributing to <b>dual</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Older {{veterans}} may {{use both}} the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Medicare, but {{the association of}} <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> with health outcomes is unclear. We examined the association of indirect measures of <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> with mortality. Methods Our secondary analysis used survey, claims, and National Death Index data from the Survey on Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old. The analytic sample included 1, 521 men who were Medicare beneficiaries. Veterans were classified as dual users when their self-reported number of hospital episodes or physician visits exceeded that in their Medicare claims. Veterans reporting inpatient or outpatient visits but having no Medicare claims were classified as VHA-only users. Proportional hazards regression was used. Results 897 (59 %) {{of the men were}} veterans, of whom 134 (15 %) were dual users. Among dual users, 60 (45 %) met the criterion based on inpatient services, 54 (40 %) based on outpatient services, and 20 (15 %) based on both. 766 men (50 %) died. Adjusting for covariates, the independent effect of any <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> was a 38 % increased mortality risk (AHR = 1. 38; p =. 02). <b>Dual</b> <b>use</b> based on outpatient services marginally increased mortality risk by 45 % (AHR = 1. 45; p =. 06), and <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> based on both inpatient and outpatient services increased the risk by 98 % (AHR = 1. 98; p =. 02). Conclusion Indirect measures of <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> were associated with increased mortality risk.

We examined the association between sports activity (intensity and type of sport) and the current use of snus (Swedish snuff), cigarette smoking, and the combined use of cigarettes and snus (<b>dual</b> <b>use)</b> among young males in Finland. Methods Data were collected from 16, 746 male conscripts who completed a survey during the first days of their conscription during the years 1999 - 2010 (median age 19 years, response rate 95 %). Main outcome measures were self-reported daily/occasional use of snus, cigarette smoking, and <b>dual</b> <b>use.</b> The association between sports activity, type of sport, and several sociodemographic background variables was assessed using logistic regression analysis.

40|$|Socioeconomic {{differences}} in tobacco use have been reported, {{but there is}} a lack of evidence on how they vary according to types of tobacco use. This study explored socioeconomic differences associated with cigarette, bidi, smokeless tobacco (SLT), and <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> (smoking and smokeless tobacco use) in India and tested whether these differences vary by gender and residential area. Secondary analysis of Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2009 - 10 (69, 296) was conducted. The primary outcomes were self-reported cigarette, bidi smoking, SLT, and <b>dual</b> <b>use.</b> The main explanatory variables were wealth, education, and occupation. Associations were assessed using multinomial logistic regressions. 69, 030 adults participated in the study. Positive association was observed between wealth and prevalence of cigarette smoking while inverse associations were observed for bidi smoking, SLT, and <b>dual</b> <b>use</b> after adjustment for potential confounders. Inverse associations with education were observed for all four types after adjusting for confounders.
