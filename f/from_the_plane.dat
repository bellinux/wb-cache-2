5|$|Events in {{the capital}} began when Reagan's casket arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. It was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> driven by hearse in a {{procession}} through the Maryland and Virginia suburbs and the nation's capital, across the Memorial Bridge, and onto Constitution Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 a Farman {{aeroplane}} crash-landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction. The {{pilot was}} able to jump <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> before it crashed, and ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway embankment.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Southwest Airlines Flight 31, a Boeing 737-300, from Houston, Texas, {{exited the}} taxiway and rolled {{into a ditch}} shortly after {{arriving}} into Nashville as the airplane was entering the terminal ramp. All 138 passengers and crew were safely evacuated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and bussed into the airport.|$|E
50|$|Programming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> {{was always}} pre-recorded; program slates, taped {{classroom}} instruction and test patterns with canned music {{were all that}} was aired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> MPATI <b>planes.</b> Frequently snowy pictures were what students saw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> low power transmitters of KS2XGA or KS2XGD channels 72 and 76 UHF respectively.|$|R
5|$|An {{aircraft}} flight {{into the}} storm experienced severe turbulence, and wind driven rain reportedly stripped paint <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> surfaces.|$|R
50|$|In Spring 2002, the {{magazine}} was banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of <b>the</b> Swiss International Air Lines following the publication of an article criticizing the company.|$|R
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|Clear Rivers is {{introduced}} in the 2000 film Final Destination {{as one of the}} seniors from the fictional Mt. Abraham High School boarding Volée Airlines Flight 180 heading to Paris on May 13, 2000. On board, Alex Browning warns the passengers about his vision of the airliner exploding in mid-air, gaining no support except for Clear. She along with Alex and their classmates Tod Waggner, Terry Chaney, Carter Horton, Billy Hitchcok and teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> before it explodes in midair minutes after take off, killing the other 286 passengers. Thirty nine days later, while at the memorial for the victims, she presents Alex a white rose as gratitude for saving her life.|$|E

50|$|Most outsiders {{have the}} extraplanar subtype, but those that don't {{always have the}} native subtype and live on <b>the</b> Material <b>Plane.</b> Most extraplanar outsiders are <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Outer <b>Planes,</b> but some come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Inner <b>Planes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The right upper {{quadrant}} (RUQ) extends <b>from</b> <b>the</b> median <b>plane</b> to <b>the</b> {{right of}} <b>the</b> patient, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> umbilical <b>plane</b> to <b>the</b> right ribcage. The equivalent term for animals is right anterior quadrant.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to {{receive much attention}} is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested}} that the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first {{high-resolution}} {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of {{the atmosphere of the}} moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Memory of General Sikorski {{was also}} {{preserved}} both in Poland and abroad, by {{organizations like the}} Sikorski Institute in London. In the UK, Sikorski received honoris causa degrees from the University of Liverpool and University of St Andrews. In 1981, a commemorative plaque was revealed at Hotel Rubens in London, where during the war Polish Military Headquarters, including Sikorski's office, were located. He is commemorated in London's Portland Place, near the Embassy of Poland, with a larger than life statue, unveiled in 2000. A propeller <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> in which he died is the centrepiece of a new memorial to Sikorski at Europa Point, Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|The {{sequence}} at Miami International Airport {{was partly}} {{shot at the}} Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show Top Gear, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards {{at the moment of}} full extension away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Mulder and Scully {{survey the}} crash site, {{they realize that}} there is a nine-minute {{disparity}} between the crash and the time on the victims' wristwatches, indicating missing time. Mulder believes that Max was abducted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> and that his body will not be found. Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who sat next to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Back in Seattle, Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) surprises his fiancée Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) with a visit. The couple reunites with {{constant}} sexual activity, {{for which the}} interns tease Bailey. Meanwhile, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) allows Shepherd to operate on a spinal cord, despite his hand being broken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crash. Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised appendectomy, a procedure historically used {{as a reward for}} interns. The hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), introduces the new pediatric surgery attending, Dr. Mel Barnett (Philip Casnoff), to Torres and Karev. Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program (a function to treat ill children from Third World countries), something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery, Robbins. Karev becomes upset about this, and asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program, though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev.|$|E
50|$|Officials said {{investigators}} were {{focusing on the}} possibility of a technical malfunction as an eyewitness reported seeing smoke coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> engines as it came down. The aircraft's flight data recorder was recovered in good condition.|$|R
50|$|On July 12, 1998, a {{twin-engine}} seaplane {{flipped over}} after landing near East 29th Street and became submerged in the river. The pilot and two passengers escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> emergency windows and were rescued by the police.|$|R
25|$|Notice {{that this}} cut is {{slightly}} different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> branch cut we've already encountered, because it actually excludes the negative real axis <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cut <b>plane.</b> <b>The</b> branch cut left the real axis connected with <b>the</b> cut <b>plane</b> {{on one side}} (0 ≤ θ), but severed it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cut <b>plane</b> along <b>the</b> other side (θ < 2π).|$|R
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex {{had something to do}} with the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Several years prior, one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} men in the small island nation of Horai, Tenro Horai, discovered an incredible magical power deep within the ground that gave him god-like strength, the Ubusunagami Okinokai. Tenro and his followers used this power to conquer other nations. A rebel federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge the Horai. They fought to free the world of Horai's conquests, but lost battle after battle. Eventually they were almost completely wiped out, except one young man survived named Shinra. Shinra set off to battle Horai again, but he was shot down and crashed in a remote village called Ikaruga. The village was inhabited by people exiled due to the Horai expansion.The village inhabitants saved Shinra <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> wreckage and nursed him back to health. After healing, Shinra stated that he was still determined to continue the battle against Horai. The villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane they had built themselves called the Ikaruga. The ship was specially designed and hidden away in a secret underground location beneath the village. It was the first ship built to utilize and switch between two energy polarities, black and white.|$|E
5000|$|A fatal {{incident}} marred the carrier's shakedown. On 9 July, {{one of her}} Vought SB2U-2 Vindicator dive bombers crashed [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship. Wasp bent on flank {{speed to}} close, as did the plane-guarding destroyer Morris. The latter's boats recovered items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane's</b> baggage compartment, but <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> itself had gone down with its crew of two.|$|R
50|$|Charlie D'Antoine—an Aboriginal {{flying boat}} refueller—helped two {{passengers}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> to reach <b>the</b> shore, swimming through burning fuel and wreckage.

5|$|The scene then flashes {{forward to}} a plane {{returning}} Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
5|$|Valmont {{has one of}} his henchmen kidnap Eva. To rescue her, Diabolik boards Valmont's {{airplane}} {{with the}} ten million dollars and the emerald necklace to trade for Eva. He is ejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> but manages to grab Valmont just before a bomb he had placed earlier explodes. Diabolik rescues Eva as the police close in on them. Eva makes her escape while Diabolik battles and kills Valmont. Diabolik takes a capsule and appears to have died while being {{taken to the hospital}} by the police. As police hold a press conference about Diabolik's death, he is about to be autopsied when he returns to life. Diabolik reveals that he has faked his death using a technique taught him by Tibetan lamas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E
