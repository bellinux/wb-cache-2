5|$|A {{complete}} {{remake of}} the original arcade game on the Game Boy, named <b>Donkey</b> Kong or <b>Donkey</b> Kong '94 contains levels from both the original <b>Donkey</b> Kong and <b>Donkey</b> Kong Jr. arcades. It starts with the same damsel-in-distress premise and four basic locations as the arcade game and then progresses to 97 additional puzzle-based levels. It is the first game to have built-in enhancement for the Super Game Boy accessory. The arcade version makes an appearance in <b>Donkey</b> Kong 64 in the Frantic Factory level.|$|E
5|$|By late June , <b>Donkey</b> Kongs success had {{prompted}} {{more than}} 50 {{parties in the}} U.S. and Japan to license the game's characters. Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and manga. In 1983, the animation studio Ruby-Spears produced a <b>Donkey</b> Kong cartoon (as well as <b>Donkey</b> Kong Jr.) for the Saturday Supercade program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots {{in the mode of}} Scooby-Doo are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing <b>Donkey</b> Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Donkey</b> Kong Country is {{the first}} <b>Donkey</b> Kong game that was not {{produced}} or directed by Shigeru Miyamoto, the character's original creator. It was directed by Tim Stamper instead, although Miyamoto was still involved with the project. Following an intense marketing campaign, <b>Donkey</b> Kong Country received critical acclaim and more than nine million copies were sold worldwide, making it the third-best-selling SNES game.|$|E

Diddy's Kong Quest was later released for the Game Boy Advance on 15 November 2004 and on the Wii's Virtual Console on 21 May 2007.

40|$|Abstract Background The Brazilian Semiarid is {{the home}} of the largest herd of <b>donkeys</b> in South America and of {{outbreaks}} of Trypanosoma vivax infection of high mortality in dairy cattle and sheep. For a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these outbreaks and epidemiological role of <b>donkeys,</b> we surveyed for T. vivax in wandering <b>donkeys</b> and follow the experimental infection of <b>donkeys</b> and sheep with a highly virulent isolate from the Semiarid. Methods Blood samples from 180 randomly selected wandering <b>donkeys</b> from the Brazilian Semiarid region were employed for PCV and parasitemia assessments and tested using the T. vivax-specific TviCATL-PCR assay. PCR-amplifed Cathepsin L (CATL) sequences were employed for genotyping and phylogenetic analysis. Four wandering <b>donkeys</b> were experimentally infected with a T. vivax isolate obtained during an outbreak of high mortality in the Semiarid; the control group consisted of two non-inoculated <b>donkeys.</b> Results We detected T. vivax in 30 of 180 wandering <b>donkeys</b> (16. 6  %) using TviCATL-PCR. The prevalence was higher during the dry (15. 5  %) than the wet season (1. 1  %) and more females (23. 1  %) than males (8. 9  %) were infected. All the PCR-positive <b>donkeys</b> lacked patent parasitemia and showed normal values of body condition score (BCS) and packed cell volume (PCV). To evaluate the probable tolerance of <b>donkeys</b> to T. vivax, we inoculated five <b>donkeys</b> with a highly virulent isolate (TviBrRp) from the Semiarid. All inoculated <b>donkeys</b> became PCR-positive, but their parasitemia was always subpatent. A control goat inoculated with TviBrRp showed increasing parasitemia concurrently with fever, declining PCV, tachycardia, mucous membrane pallor, enlarged lymph nodes and anorexia. None of these signs were observed in <b>donkeys.</b> However, T. vivax from wandering <b>donkeys</b> shared identical or highly similar genotypes (identified by Cathepsin L sequences) with isolates from cattle and sheep outbreaks of acute disease in the Semiarid. Conclusions This is the first report of T. vivax in <b>donkeys</b> in Brazil and, to our knowledge, the first experimental infection of <b>donkeys</b> with T. vivax. The symptomless field and experimental infections corroborated that <b>donkeys</b> are more tolerant to T. vivax than other livestock species as shown in African countries. Therefore, farmers, veterinaries and control programmes should be aware of healthy carrier <b>donkeys</b> as a possible source of T. vivax for susceptible livestock species in the Brazilian Semiarid...|$|R
