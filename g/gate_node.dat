To estimate time to detect, six programs ranging in complexity from 6 to 147 instructions, were emulated. Each program was executed repetitively {{in the presence of}} a single stuck at fault at a <b>gate</b> <b>node</b> or device pin. Detection was assumed to occur whenever the computed outputs differed from the corresponding outputs of the same program executed in a nonfaulted processor. Histograms of faults detected versus number of repetitions to detection were tabulated. Using a simple model of fault detection, which was based in an analog with the selection of balls in an urn, distributions of time to detect were computed and compared with those obtained empirically. A self test program of 2, 000 executable instructions was designed expressly for the study. The only requirement imposed on the design was that it should achieve 95 % coverage.

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is composed of many sensor nodes that have been given out in a specific zone {{and each of them}} had an ability of collecting information from the environment and sending collected data to the sink. The most significant issues in {{wireless sensor network}}s despite the recent progress is the trouble of the severe limitations of energy resources. Since that in different applications of sensor nets we could throw a static or mobile sink then all aspects of such networks should be planned with an awareness of energy. One of the most significant topics related to these networks is routing. One of the most widely used and efficient methods of routing is a hierarchy (based on clustering) method. In The present study with the objective of cutting down energy consumption and persistence of network coverage we have offered a novel algorithm based on clustering algorithms and multi hop routing. To achieve this goal first we layer the network environment based {{on the size of the}} network. We will identify the optimal number of cluster heads and every cluster head based on the mechanism of topology control will start to accept members. Likewise we set the first layer as gate layer and subsequently identifying the <b>gate</b> <b>nodes</b> we would turn away half of the sensors and then stop using energy and the remaining nodes in this layer will join the <b>gate</b> <b>nodes</b> because they hold a critical part in bettering the functioning of the system. Cluster heads off following layers send the information to cluster heads in the above layer until sent data will be sent to <b>gate</b> <b>nodes</b> and finally will be sent to sink.

This is the first use of this technique for adaptation in a nonlinear circuit. The AFGC computes appropriate voltages for locally adapting the input floating <b>gate</b> <b>nodes</b> to cancel offsets.

We consider both static and dynamic adaptation and demonstrate that the the accuracy of dynamic offset cancellation is approximately two orders of magnitude better than static adaptation. In the presence of observed 8 % injection mismatch, the AFGC robustly converges to within 728 µVofthe desired input offset (mean offset − 109 µV, standard deviation 379 µV).

40|$|In this {{stimulating}} paper, {{the authors}} have successfully exploited Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to explore the space of graphs for CART-like trees in which the terminal nodes represent generalized linear models (GLMs). Integration over {{the parameters of the}} terminal GLMs, in order to compute the marginal likelihood (probability of data given the model) for the MCMC search, is accomplished using the Laplace approximation. Hyper-parameters (such as those governing the GLM parameters) are either set by hand or fixed after a brief empirical search. The underlying CART model on which this approach is based, however, suffers from some significant limitations, namely (i) the splits are axis-aligned, i. e. dependent on only one of the input variables at a time (this limitation is removed in some other variants of CART), (ii) the splits are binary, (iii) the splits are hard, so that each region of input space is associated with one, and only one, leaf node.

40|$|CMOS {{technology}} is scaling down {{to meet the}} performance, production cost, and power requirements of the microelectronics industry. The increase in the transistor leakage current {{is one of the}} most important negative side effects of technology scaling. Leakage affects not only the standby and active power consumption, but also the circuit reliability, since it is strongly correlated to the process variations. Leakage current influences circuit performance differently depending on: operating conditions (e. g., standby, active, burn in test), circuit family (e. g., logic or memory), and environmental conditions (e. g., temperature, supply voltage). Until the introduction of high-K gate dielectrics in the lower nanometer technology <b>nodes,</b> <b>gate</b> leakage will remain the dominant leakage component after subthreshold leakage. Since the way designers control subthreshold and gate leakage can change from one technology to another, it is crucial for them to be aware of the impact of the total leakage on the operation of circuits and the techniques that mitigate it. Consequently, techniques that reduce total leakage in circuits operating in the active mode at different temperature conditions are examined. Also, the implications of technology scaling on the choice of techniques to mitigate total leakage are investigated. This work resulted in guidelines for the design of low-leakage circuits in nanometer technologies. Logic gates in the 65 nm, 45 nm, and 32 nm nodes are simulated and analyzed. The techniques that are adopted for comparison in this work affect both gate and subthreshold leakage, namely, stack forcing, pin reordering, reverse body biasing, and high threshold voltage transistors. Aside from leakage, our analysis also highlights the impact of these techniques on the circuit's performance and noise margins. The reverse body biasing scheme tends to be less effective as the technology scales since this scheme increases the band to band tunneling current. Employing high threshold voltage transistors seems to be one of the most effective techniques for reducing leakage with minor performance degradation. Pin reordering and natural stacks are techniques that do not affect the performance of the device, yet they reduce leakage. However, it is demonstrated that they are not as effective in all types of logic since the input values might switch only between the highly leaky states. Therefore, depending on the design requirements of the circuit, a combination, or hybrid of techniques which can result in better performance and leakage savings, is chosen. Power sensitive technology mapping tools can use the guidelines found as a result of the research in the low power design flow to meet the required maximum leakage current in a circuit. These guidelines are presented in general terms so that they can be adopted for any application and process technology...|$|R
40|$|Fault {{tree and}} digraph models are {{frequently}} used for system failure analysis. Both types of models represent a failure space {{view of the}} system using AND and OR nodes in a directed graph structure. Each model has its advantages. While digraphs can be derived in a fairly straightforward manner from system schematics and knowledge about component failure modes and system design, fault tree structure allows for fast processing using efficient techniques developed for tree data structures. The similarities between digraphs and fault trees permits the information encoded in the digraph to be translated into a logically equivalent fault tree. The DG TO FT translation tool will automatically translate digraph models, including those with loops or cycles, into fault tree models that have the same minimum cut set solutions as the input digraph. This tool could be useful, for example, if some parts of a system have been modeled using digraphs and others using fault trees. The digraphs could be translated and incorporated into the fault trees, allowing them to be analyzed using a number of powerful fault tree processing codes, such as cut set and quantitative solution codes. A cut set for a given node {{is a group of}} failure events that will cause the failure of the node. A minimum cut set for a node is any cut set that, if any of the failures in the set were to be removed, the occurrence of the other failures in the set will not cause the failure of the event represented by the node. Cut sets calculations can be used to find dependencies, weak links, and vital system components whose failures would cause serious systems failure. The DG TO FT translation system reads in a digraph with each node listed as a separate object in the input file. The user specifies a terminal node for the digraph that will be used as the top node of the resulting fault tree. A fault tree basic event node representing the failure of that digraph node is created and becomes a child of the terminal root node. A subtree is created for each of the inputs to the digraph terminal node and the root of those subtrees are added as children of the top node of the fault tree. Every node in the digraph upstream of the terminal node will be visited and converted. During the conversion process, the algorithm keeps track of the path from the digraph terminal node to the current digraph node. If a node is visited twice, then the program has found a cycle in the digraph. This cycle is broken by finding the minimal cut sets of the twice visited digraph node and forming those cut sets into subtrees. Another implementation of the algorithm resolves loops by building a subtree based on the digraph minimal cut sets calculation. It does not reduce the subtree to minimal cut set form. This second implementation produces larger fault trees, but runs much faster than the version using minimal cut sets since it does not spend time reducing the subtrees to minimal cut sets. The fault trees produced by DG TO FT will contain OR gates, AND <b>gates,</b> Basic Event <b>nodes,</b> and NOP <b>gates.</b> The results of a translation can be output as a text object description of the fault tree similar to the text digraph input format. The translator can also output a LISP language formatted file and an augmented LISP file which can be used by the FTDS (ARC- 13019) diagnosis system, available from COSMIC, which performs diagnostic reasoning using the fault tree as a knowledge base. DG TO FT is written in C-language to be machine independent. It has been successfully implemented on a Sun running SunOS, a DECstation running ULTRIX, a Macintosh running System 7, and a DEC VAX running VMS. The RAM requirement varies with the size of the models. DG TO FT is available in UNIX tar format on a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge (standard distribution) or on a 3. 5 inch diskette. It is also available on a 3. 5 inch Macintosh format diskette or on a 9 -track 1600 BPI magnetic tape in DEC VAX FILES- 11 format. Sample input and sample output are provided on the distribution medium. An electronic copy of the documentation in Macintosh Microsoft Word format is provided on the distribution medium.
