5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer,</b> keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E

The results for the n-channel <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> of III-V, ternary and quaternary materials form a special case of our generalized analysis. The DMR for n-channel <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> of II-VI, IV-VI and stressed materials has been investigated by formulating the respective 2 D electron dispersion laws.

The well-known expression of the DMR for wide gap materials has been obtained as a special case under certain limiting conditions and this compatibility is an indirect test for our generalized formalism.

25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an <b>inversion</b> <b>layer.</b> If the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops {{in the form of}} turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level), altocumulus (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|E
25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction band edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E

We have derived an analytical expression of the surface electron concentration in low electric field limit {{in the presence of a}} quantizing magnetic field. We have then formulated a model expression of the magneto-gate capacitance with the proper use of the electron concentration. For the purpose of relative comparison, we have also derived the same capacitance by including the broadening effects and without any approximations of low or high electric field lim-its. It has been observed that the gate capacitance of p-channel <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> on tellurium exhibits spiky oscillations with changing magnetic field.

25|$|Simply put, {{using an}} nMOS example, the gate-to-body bias VGB {{positions}} the conduction-band energy levels, while the source-to-body bias VSB positions the electron Fermi level near the interface, deciding occupancy of these levels near the interface, {{and hence the}} strength of the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> or channel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original {{investigation of the}} motion at the band crossing points in the energy dispersion of either bulk crystals or <b>inversion</b> <b>layers.</b> In particular, by using a formalism based on the time dependent Schrödinger equation, we address the quite elusive topic of the belonging of the carriers to the bands that are degenerate at the crossing point. This problem is relevant and delicate for the semiclassical transport modeling in numerically calculated band structures; however, its clariﬁcation demands a full-quantum transport treatment. We here propose analytical derivations and numerical calculations clearly demonstrating that, in a given band structure, {{the motion of the}} carriers at the band crossing points is entirely governed by the overlap integrals between the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that has produced the same band structure. Our formulation of the problem is quite general and we apply it to the silicon conduction band calculated by means of the nonlocal pseudopotential method, to the hole <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> described by a quantized k·p approach, and to the electron <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> described by the effective mass approximation method. In all the physical systems, our results underline the crucial role played by the abovementioned overlap integrals...|$|R
25|$|Temperature effect: A fog can {{be caused}} by a {{temperature}} inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog, while warmer air sits above it. The inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground, allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface. A temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel, by reflecting the sound between the ground and the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E

The city enjoys a tropical climate encompassing warm winters and hot summers.

50|$|The 4/3 Earth radius rule {{of thumb}} is an average for the Earth's {{atmosphere}} assuming it is reasonably homogenised, absent of temperature <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> or unusual meteorological conditions.

25|$|Sudden {{changes in}} the atmosphere's {{vertical}} moisture content and temperature profiles can on random occasions make UHF, VHF and microwave signals propagate hundreds of kilometers up to about 2,000 kilometers (1,300mi)and for ducting mode even fartherbeyond the normal radio-horizon. The <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> is mostly observed over high pressure regions, but there are several tropospheric weather conditions which create these randomly occurring propagation modes. Inversion layer's altitude for non-ducting is typically found between 100 meters (300ft) to about 1 kilometer (3,000ft) and for ducting about 500 meters to 3 kilometers (1,600 to 10,000ft), and {{the duration of the}} events are typically from several hours up to several days. Higher frequencies experience the most dramatic increase of signal strengths, while on low-VHF and HF the effect is negligible. Propagation path attenuation may be below free-space loss. Some of the lesser inversion types related to warm ground and cooler air moisture content occur regularly at certain times of the year and time of day. A typical example could be the late summer, early morning tropospheric enhancements that bring in signals from distances up to few hundred kilometers for a couple of hours, until undone by the Sun's warming effect.|$|E
25|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of ice cores from continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers {{have been developed}} as temperature proxies since the 1950s. Samuel Epstein {{was one of the}} first to demonstrate the applicability of this proxy by measuring oxygen isotopes in Antarctic snow, and also pointed out complications in the stable isotope-temperature correlation caused by the history of the air masses from which the snow formed. Ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica can be thousands of meters thick and record snow {{isotopic composition}} of the past few glacial-interglacial cycles. Ice cores can be dated by layer counting on the top and ice flow modeling at depth, with additional age constraints from volcanic ash. Cores from Greenland and Antarctica can be aligned in age at high-resolution by comparing globally well-mixed trace gas (e.g. CH4) concentrations in the air bubbles trapped in the cores. Some of the first ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica with age estimates go back to the last 100,000 years, and showed a depletion in δD and δ18O in the last ice age. The ice core record has since been extended to the last 800,000 years in Antarctica, and at least 250,000 years in Greenland. One of the best δD-based ice core temperature records is from the Vostok ice core in Antarctica, which goes back to 420,000 years. The δD-temperature (of the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> where snow forms) conversion in east Antarctica based on modern spatial gradient of δD (9‰/°C) is ΔTI=(ΔδDice-8Δδ18Osw)/9, which takes into account variations in seawater isotopic composition caused by global ice volume changes. It should be noted that many local effects can influence ice δD in addition to temperature. These effects include moisture origin and transport pathways, evaporation conditions and precipitation seasonality, which can be accounted for in more complicated models. Nevertheless, the Vostok ice core record shows some very important results: (1) A consistent δD depletion of ~70‰ during the last four glacial periods compared to interglacial times, corresponding to a cooling of 8°C in Antarctica; (2) A consistent drop of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 100 ppmv and CH4 drop by ~300 ppbv during glacial times relative to interglacials, suggesting a role of greenhouse gases in regulating global climate; (3) Antarctic air temperature and greenhouse gas concentration changes precede global ice volume and Greenland air temperature changes during glacial terminations, and greenhouse gases may be an amplifier of insolation forcing during glacial-interglacial cycles. Greenland ice core isotope records, in addition to showing glacial-interglacial cycles, also shows millennial-scale climate oscillations that may reflect reorganization in ocean circulation caused by ice melt charges. There have also been ice core records generated in alpine glacials on different continents. A record from the Andes Mountains in Peru shows a temperature decrease of 5-6°C in the tropics during the last ice age. A record from the Tibetan plateau shows a similar isotope shift and cooling during the last ice age. Other existing alpine glacial isotope records include Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Altai and West Belukha Plateau in Russia, Mount Logan in Canada, the Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, USA, and the Illimani Ice Core in Bolivia, most of which cover an interval of the Holocene epoch.|$|E
