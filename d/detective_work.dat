5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five {{works from the}} 1660s have a, {{partially}} obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> and speculation.|$|E
5|$|Alfe (pronounced Alfé) is a large, fluffy, man–dog–anteater {{found and}} raised by Horace when both were young. He loves devouring large {{quantities}} of food, especially pizza, and acts impulsively during missions. Roba, Horace's twin brother and cyborg, is the smartest member of the group, but he suffers from insecurity and anxiety. Horace is the calm and collected leader of the team, usually applying common sense with his <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> and caring after Alfe.|$|E
5|$|The {{case had}} all the {{elements}} to ignite a fervent popular interest: the wicked squire and the poor girl, the iconic murder scene, the supernatural element of the stepmother's prophetic dreams, the <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> by Ayres and Lea (who later became detective Pharos Lee in stage versions of the events), and Corder's new life which {{was the result of}} a lonely hearts advertisement. As a consequence, the case created its own small industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Wong's {{father died}} in Los Angeles {{at the age of}} 91. After a six-year absence, Wong {{returned}} to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called Impact. From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the DuMont Television Network series The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, in which she played the title role which used her birth name. Wong's character was a dealer in Chinese art whose career involved her in <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> and international intrigue. The ten half-hour episodes aired during prime time, from 9:00 to 9:30p.m. Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist. After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an internal hemorrhage, which her brother attributed to the onset of menopause, her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to <b>detective</b> <b>work,</b> and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|Veronica shows one of {{the rape}} victims (Krista Kalmus) the photo of a suspect, but she doesn’t {{recognize}} him. In criminology class, Veronica does {{a case study of}} Weevil (Francis Capra), and the class enjoys it. After the study, Veronica tells Weevil that she’s dating Logan (Jason Dohring), and he reacts negatively. Veronica then walks into Mars Investigations and finds Cyrus O’Dell and his wife (Jaime Ray Newman) talking with Keith, while Veronica herself does some <b>detective</b> <b>work.</b> Keith informs Veronica that Dean O’Dell’s stepson is dying and that he wants Keith to find the boy’s biological father. At Mercer's (Ryan Devlin) party, two masked men enter and steal everyone’s valuables, including the necklace that Lilly gave Veronica. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is failing his mechanical engineering class, a subject in which he wanted to major. Meanwhile, Keith tracks down the husband, and Veronica accuses Weevil of robbing the party.|$|E

5|$|Veronica {{watches a}} {{football}} practice before she expresses her frustration with Logan (Jason Dohring). Later, she meets Weevil (Francis Capra), {{who is working}} at a car wash. Veronica is called into the Dean O'Dell's office, and he threatens her with expulsion if she does not give up some names {{in relation to the}} sorority marijuana scandal. Piz calls Veronica in to help a football player, Kurt Fenstermacher, retrieve his playbook, with Kurt's girlfriend, Trish (Lindsey McKeon) paying for the investigation. Veronica's only suggestion is that he gets a new one. Veronica convinces her father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), to hire Weevil as his new assistant at Mars Investigations. In an attempt to print a playbook for Kurt, Veronica disguises herself as a cheerleader, but fails to print one. After being called back into the Dean's office, Veronica is in the room during a debate between fraternity boys and feminists. Veronica goes back to the football player, and she hypothesizes that his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend stole it. Weevil helps Keith at <b>detective</b> <b>work,</b> succeeding beyond Keith's expectations.|$|E
25|$|Law & Order episodes are {{typically}} segmented into two parts, roughly at the halfway point; {{the first part}} follows police and <b>detective</b> <b>work,</b> and the second follows the legal and courtroom proceedings of the case. The show dwells little on the characters' back-stories or social lives, focusing mainly on their lives at work.|$|E
25|$|Though {{initially}} wanted by the police, The Shadow {{also works}} with and through them, notably gleaning information from his many chats with Police Commissioners Ralph Weston and Wainwright Barth {{while at the}} Cobalt Club; the latter is also Cranston's uncle. (Jonathan Winters portrayed him in the 1994 film.) Weston believes that Cranston is merely a rich playboy who dabbles in <b>detective</b> <b>work.</b> Another police contact is Detective (later Inspector) Joseph Cardona, a key character in many Shadow novels.|$|E

25|$|An {{upper limit}} {{to the number of}} {{considered}} candidate models is typically set by the substantial effort required to define the models and to choose between many alternative options. There is no commonly accepted ABC-specific procedure for model construction, so experience and prior knowledge are used instead. Although more robust procedures for a priori model choice and formulation would be beneficial, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for model development in statistics: sensible characterization of complex systems will always necessitate a great deal of <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> and use of expert knowledge from the problem domain.|$|E
25|$|McNulty unsuccessfully {{searches}} for {{the identity of the}} floater. He also finds himself under pressure from Bunk to find Omar, since Bird is about to go on trial. McNulty coerces Bubbles into tracking down Omar, who testifies against Bird.

He resolves to give up alcohol and <b>detective</b> <b>work,</b> two of the main reasons for the breakup of his marriage. When Elena confirms the marriage is over, he grows despondent and relapses.|$|E
25|$|Blade Runners {{main focus}} is <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> rather than puzzles or combat, and the {{majority}} of gameplay consists of searching for evidence, questioning suspects and analyzing clues. Occasionally, the player must solve compulsory puzzles, and often, to progress the story, certain clues must be located. Clues are found by searching crime scenes, and {{come in the form of}} items, photographs, interviews, or unusual markings. When analyzing photographs, the player must use the ESPER system, a high-density computer with a powerful three-dimensional resolution capacity which allows for the enhancement of photos and enables the player to find details within the picture. Combat is occasionally available in the game, but is rarely compulsory. The only weapon available to the player is McCoy's standard issue police pistol, which may be loaded with various types of ammunition.|$|E

25|$|Warren's biggest {{difficulty}} was the Jack the Ripper case. He was criticised {{for failing}} {{to track down the}} killer and faced press accusations that were frequently baseless. He was accused of failing to offer a reward for information, although in fact he supported the idea and it was blocked by the Home Office. He was accused of not putting enough police officers on the ground, whereas in fact Whitechapel was swamped with them.. He was accused of being more interested in uniformed policing than <b>detective</b> <b>work,</b> which was true, but failed to take into consideration the fact that he allowed his experienced detective officers to conduct their own affairs and rarely interfered in their operations. He was accused of not using bloodhounds, and when he did eventually bring them in, he was accused of being obsessed with them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{of the show is}} the depiction of police procedure, which some consider to be decidedly lacking in realism. For instance, the show's characters not only investigate ("process") crime scenes, but they also conduct raids, engage in suspect pursuit and arrest, interrogate suspects, and solve cases, all of which falls under the responsibility of uniformed officers and detectives, not CSI personnel. Although 'some' detectives are also registered CSIs, this is exceedingly rare in actual life. It is considered an inappropriate and improbable practice to allow CSI personnel to be involved in <b>detective</b> <b>work,</b> as it would compromise the impartiality of scientific evidence and would be impracticably time-consuming. Additionally, it is inappropriate for the CSIs who process a crime scene {{to be involved in the}} examination and testing of any evidence collected from that scene. CSI shares this characteristic with similar British drama series Silent Witness.|$|E

500|$|The coroner {{recorded}} a verdict of unlawful killing, superseding the open verdict recorded in 1879. The cause of Thomas's death was given as asphyxiation {{and a head}} injury.

500|$|During [...] "Night of the Dead Living", Crosetti {{displays}} {{an overriding}} {{concern for the}} safety and welfare of his daughter Beatrice. After Crosetti was revealed to have killed himself in the [...] episode [...] "Crosetti", many viewers claimed suicide was unrealistic for his character based on his feelings about his daughter displayed in this episode. Beatrice is referred to only by name in [...] "Night of the Dead Living", and would not appear onscreen until she grieved over her father's death in [...] "Crosetti". While discussing the mysterious candle with Lewis in the episode, Felton said he generally solves cases with physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives. This insight into <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> {{is consistent with the}} conclusions Simon drew in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, [...] and reviewers have praised Homicide for its realism in portraying <b>detective</b> <b>work</b> from this perspective, which is in stark contrast to other typical police dramas.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of {{publication}} the authorship of the articles was a closely guarded secret, though astute observers discerned the identities of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay.
