5|$|Marlborough now {{requested}} Eugene {{to release}} Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating the high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> and mutual co-operation {{between the two}} generals. Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry. Fugger's cuirassiers charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder. With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim {{so that they could}} not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Generic {{algorithms}} for automatic {{object recognition}} and/or scene classification are unfortunately not producing reliable and robust results. A common approach {{to cope with}} this, still unresolved, issue is to restrict the problem at hand to a specific domain. In this paper we propose an algorithm to improve the results of image analysis, based on the contextual information we have, which relates the detected concepts to any given domain. Initial results produced by the image analysis module are domain-specific semantic concepts and are being re-adjusted appropriately by the suggested algorithm, by means <b>of</b> fine-tuning the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> each detected concept. The novelty of the presented work is twofold: i) the knowledge-assisted image analysis algorithm, that utilizes an ontology infrastructure to handle the knowledge and MPEG- 7 visual descriptors for the region labeling and ii) the contextdriven re-adjustment <b>of</b> the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> the detected labels. ...|$|R

Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} potential relationships between master's level counseling students' levels of ego development and their identified orientations {{to one of}} six guiding theories of counseling; students' theoretical orientation classifications when classified according to the theory's domain of emphasis: affective, behavioral, or cognitive; students' <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in identifying their theoretical orientations; and students' <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> comfort in applying their theories in clinical practice. Seventy participants enrolled in a master's level practicum course completed the Washington University Sentence Completion Test, a measure of ego development, and the Counseling Theory Survey, a survey developed by the researcher, {{in order to identify}} students' identified theoretical orientations, students' <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in identifying their theoretical orientations, and students' <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> comfort in applying their theories in clinical practice. Ego development level was operationalized as a dichotomous variable consisting of level E 5 and below and E 6 and above, based on the developmental task attained at E 6 : a shift from emphasis on in-group identity to self-evaluated standards. To determine potential relationships between the students' ego development levels and their theoretical orientations and their orientations when classified by domain of emphasis, 2 x 4 and 2 x 3 Chi-square analyses were used. Independent t-tests were conducted to determine if the students' <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in identifying their theoretical orientation and their <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> comfort in applying their orientation varied across the two groups. No statistically significant results were found. Alternative explanations for the identification of theoretical orientation, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are discussed with emphasis on the need for greater integration of current theories related to the identification of theoretical orientation...|$|R

40|$|Shape {{tracking}} {{with low}} level features (e. g., edge points) often fails in complex environments (e. g., {{in the presence}} of clutter, inner edges, or multiple objects). Two alternative methods are discussed in this paper. Both methods use middle level features (data centroids, strokes) which are more informative and reliable than edge transitions used in most tracking algorithms. Furthermore, it is assumed in this paper that each feature can be either a valid measurement or an outlier. A confidence degree is assigned to each feature or to a given interpretation of all visual features. Features/ interpretations with high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> have large influence on the shape estimates while features/interpretations with low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> have negligible influence on the shape estimates. It is shown in this paper that both items (middle level features and confidence degrees) lead to a significant improvement of the tracker robustness and performance {{in the presence of}} clutter and abrupt shape and motion changes...|$|R
25|$|A print also {{apparently}} reached Georg August Goldfuss, as in 1831 {{he included}} a similar drawing, clearly influenced by De la Beche's work, {{of a scene}} out of the Jurassic based on fossils from the Jura Mountains in the latest chapter of the serial publication of his Fossils of Germany. Buckland wrote to De la Beche urging him to create more scenes before the Germans used up all the best ideas. De la Beche didn't produce any other scenes on such a scale, but he did include several much smaller and simpler scenes of prehistoric life in the second edition of his Geological Manual (1832). Such scenes didn't remain confined to scientific circles. In 1833 the geologist John Phillips produced a wood cut of an elaborate prehistoric scene, that was obviously influenced by both Duria Antiquior and Goldfuss's Jurassic scene, for publication in the popular Penny Magazine, and another illustration which borrowed elements from Duria Antiquior appeared in a French illustrated dictionary {{of natural history in}} 1834.

500|$|Previously, {{leadership}} of the 261st Battalion alternated between Hoang, a South Vietnamese revolutionary who had returned from North Vietnam after 1954, and Tu Khue, who {{was a native of}} North Vietnam.

In contrast, Hoang was far more relaxed and commanded a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> from the soldiers of the 261st Battalion. Thus, due to his strong leadership skills and popularity, Hoang was selected to take command of Viet Cong forces for operations in Ap Bac. Most of the soldiers under Hoang's command were equipped with captured US weaponry, such as the M1 carbine, BAR light machine guns, [...]30 caliber machine guns, and a single 60mm mortar.|$|E

500|$|The {{implications}} of extraterrestrial contact {{depend on the}} method of discovery, {{the nature of the}} extraterrestrial beings, and their location relative to the Earth. Considering these factors, the Rio Scale has been devised in order to provide a more quantitative picture of the results of extraterrestrial contact. More specifically, the scale gauges whether communication was conducted through radio, the information content of any messages, and whether discovery arose from a deliberately beamed message (and if so, whether the detection {{was the result of a}} specialized SETI effort or through general astronomical observations) or by the detection of occurrences such as radiation leakage from astroengineering installations. The question of whether or not a purported extraterrestrial signal has been confirmed as authentic, and with what <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> will also influence the impact of the contact. The Rio Scale was modified in 2011 to include a consideration of whether contact was achieved through an interstellar message or through a physical extraterrestrial artifact, with a suggestion that the definition of artifact be expanded to include [...] "technosignatures", including all indications of intelligent extraterrestrial life other than the interstellar radio messages sought by traditional SETI programs.|$|E

Longstreet argued {{that this was the}} entire point of the Gettysburg campaign, to move strategically into enemy territory but fight only defensive battles there. Lee rejected this argument because he was concerned about the morale of his soldiers having to give up the ground for which they fought so hard the day before. He wanted to retain the initiative and had a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the ability of his army to succeed in any endeavor, an opinion bolstered by their spectacular victories the previous day and at Chancellorsville.
