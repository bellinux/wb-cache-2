5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, <b>inlay</b> <b>work</b> in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E

50|$|A unique art {{tradition}} on wood inlay {{is preserved}} at CAVA. The craft was slowly starting to fade {{away by the}} start of the century. However, in 1913, the art form had a revival when Alderson, the superintendent of the Chamarajendra Technical Institute, experimented with introducing ivory in wood <b>inlay</b> <b>works.</b> Later a noted sculptor and wood-carver, Parameshwara, introduced mythological and Persian motifs.|$|R

2500|$|Saddles from East Asia {{differ from}} Central Asian saddles by their high pommel and cantle {{and lack of}} a horn. East Asian saddles {{can be divided into}} several types that are {{associated}} with certain nationalities and ethnic groups. Saddles used by the Han Chinese are noted by their use of <b>inlay</b> <b>work</b> for ornamentation. Tibetan saddles typically employ iron covers inlaid with precious metals on the pommel and cantle and universally come with padding. [...] Mongolian saddles are similar to the Tibetan style except that they are typically smaller and the seat has a high ridge. Saddles from ethnic minority groups in China’s southwest, such as in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, have colorful lacquer work over a leather covering.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hierarchical}} {{ordering of}} the entire complex reaches its crescendo in the chamber. Mumtaz's cenotaph sits at the geometric centre of the building; Jahan was buried {{at a later date}} by her side to the west— an arrangement seen in other Mughal tombs of the period such as Itmad-Ud-Daulah. Marble is used exclusively as the base material for increasingly dense, expensive and complex parchin kari floral decoration as one approaches the screen and cenotaphs which are inlaid with semi-precious stones. The use of such <b>inlay</b> <b>work</b> is often reserved in Shah Jahani architecture for spaces associated with the emperor or his immediate family. The ordering of this decoration simultaneously emphasises the cardinal points and the centre of the chamber with dissipating concentric octagons. Such hierarchies appear in both Muslim and Indian culture as important spiritual and atrological themes. The chamber is an abundant evocation of the garden of paradise with representations of flowers, plants and arabesques and the calligraphic inscriptions in both the thuluth and the less formal naskh script, ...|$|E
2500|$|Tile {{is a thin}} modular stone unit, {{commonly}} 12 in. square (30.5cm) and 3/8 in. (10mm) deep. [...] Other popular {{sizes are}} 15 in. square (38cm), 18 in. square (46cm), and 24 in. square (61cm); these will usually be deeper than the 12 in. square. The majority of tile has a polished finish, but other finishes such as honed are becoming more common. Almost all stone tile is mass-produced by automated tile lines to identical size, finish, and close tolerances. Exceptions include slate flooring tile and special orders: tile with odd sizes or shapes, unusual finishes, or <b>inlay</b> <b>work.</b> [...] In summary, the automated tile line is a complicated complex of cutting and calibrating machines, honing-polishing machines, edging machines that put on flat or rounded edges, and interconnecting conveyors to move the stone from the slab input to the final tile product. The stone for tiles is most commonly marble, but often is granite, and sometimes limestone, slate, or quartz-based stone. [...] Common colors are white and light earth colors. Much of the stone for this application is produced in Italy and China.|$|E
50|$|The wood has {{a musical}} quality {{and has been}} {{traditionally}} used {{in the making of}} cuatros, a type of lute. Fine boxes, furniture, <b>inlay</b> <b>works,</b> floors, details, turned pieces, exquisite jewelleries, sculptures, and ancient board games, have been, and demand to be transformed from the mahoe.

It is the city of Mysore that {{is best known for}} its royal palaces, earning it the nickname [...] "City of Palaces". The city's main palace, the Mysore Palace, was designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The palace's exterior is Indo-Saracenic in style but the wealth of detail inside is distinctly of Hoysala.

2500|$|Completed in 1653, the Tāj Mahal {{was built}} by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtāz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is perhaps India's most {{beautiful}} monument and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ustād 'Īsā, the Tāj Mahal is on the south bank of the Yamuna River. It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Shāh Jahān gazed at it {{for the last eight}} years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are twenty-two small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Tāj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Tāj Mahal has a diameter of , and rises to a height of directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtāz Mahal.

There he held great festivals and shows. There was bull-fighting, singularly like the bull-fighting that {93} still survives in Spain; there was resemblance even in the costumes of the bull-fighters; and there were gymnastic displays.

The whole was about three inches square and in the ordinary course of events would never be looked at. The screens hid a cupboard {{in which all the}} lamps and candlesticks and pillows and sleeping-bags of the household seemed to be stored. An Oriental nation that can fill a cupboard tidily is a nation to bow down to. Upstairs I went by a staircase of grained wood and lacquer, into rooms of rarest device with circular windows that opened on nothing, and so were filled with bamboo tracery for the delight of the eye. The passages floored with dark wood shone like ice, and I was ashamed.|$|E
