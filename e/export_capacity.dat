CNLs are arguably imposed on super competitive GSP beneficiaries and aim to limit their <b>exporting</b> <b>capacity.</b> We exploit the variation in the timing of the implementation of the CNLs across countries to identify the impact.

Contrary to the policy objectives of CNLs, the excluded countries {{do not appear to be}} super competitive. In addition, we find some evidence of exporters increasing their exports of related products to the US after the CNL exclusion applies. Finally, our findings suggest that much of the benefits of CNLs accrue to non-GSP countries, rather than other GSP beneficiaries.

40|$|Globalization is everywhere. At least, that’s the {{impression}} that it gives: more and more countries are opening up to international trade and fewer and fewer sectors seem {{to be protected from}} international competition. This impression correctly matches traditional analyses, which consider that international trade is a matter of specialisation between sectors and mainly focus on barriers such as customs duties and transport costs. But access to fine grain data, at the level of each exporting firm, reveals a quite different landscape and enables us to paint a more accurate and more finely shaded picture of globalization. Analysis of the Custom and Excise and INSEE databases shows that the proportion of French firms that have a direct export activity is astonishingly low and that these businesses are clearly distinguished from the others: they are larger, more productive and pay their employees higher wages. In order to understand the real extent of the internationalisation of markets and better identify the barriers that really {{stand in the way of}} the <b>export</b> <b>capacities</b> of a country like France, we need to turn the spotlight on these "stars", which are the driving forces of globalization.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of developing countries}} into the world trading system is an important development mechanism to reduce poverty in these countries. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) have recently spread in terms of quantity and type. Some of these, like the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) differ from previous RTAs as they explicitly support <b>export</b> <b>capacities</b> of developing countries. Therefore, it is particularly relevant to investigate the effect of eligibility for various types of RTAs first on exports and second on rejections at EU borders. Empirical analysis is carried out on 52 African countries' exports of fruits, nuts and vegetables and fish to the EU- 27 from 2008 to 2013. Adopting the gravity framework we find that only EBA eligibility has induced significantly exports of fruits, nuts and vegetables from Africa to the EU- 27. Estimating different count models using border rejection data from the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed database, we also find other trade enhancing effects of RTAs that go beyond tariff reductions, as all EU-Africa RTAs have negative effects on border rejections. The effects nevertheless differ across agreements and products. Specifically, EPA eligibility decreases rejections on both products, GSP decreases rejections on fish and fish products and FTA (TDCA and Euro-Med) decreases rejections on fruits, nuts and vegetables...|$|R
