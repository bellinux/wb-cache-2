5|$|John Cleese as Nearly <b>Headless</b> Nick, {{the ghost}} of Hogwarts' Gryffindor House.|$|E
5|$|The American painter John Quidor based {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on scenes from the works of Irving about Dutch New York, including such paintings as Ichabod Crane Flying from the <b>Headless</b> Horseman (1828), The Return of Rip Van Winkle (1849), and The <b>Headless</b> Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane (1858).|$|E
5|$|The <b>headless</b> {{male figure}} symbolizes the {{anonymous}} sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and <b>headless</b> or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted <b>headless</b> {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variations}} on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, <b>headless</b> potbellies, {{some of which may}} be deliberately <b>headless,</b> and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style even though they have no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.|$|E
5|$|The rediscovery in 2008 of the <b>Headless</b> Pyramid in Saqqara and its {{subsequent}} attribution to Menkauhor Kaiu by the excavators {{under the direction}} of Zahi Hawass confirms Verner's attribution of the unfinished pyramid of Abusir to Shepseskare.|$|E
5|$|Although all but Jonny {{had left}} Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, On a Friday {{continued}} to rehearse {{on weekends and}} holidays. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band <b>Headless</b> Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material, and met artist Stanley Donwood, who would later create artwork for the band. In 1991, On a Friday regrouped, sharing {{a house on the}} corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled <b>headless</b> shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
5|$|Experiments on decapitated {{specimens}} of {{several species of}} cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained, including shock avoidance and escape behavior, although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation, and popular claims of the longevity of <b>headless</b> cockroaches {{do not appear to}} be based on published research. The severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours, or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to class, {{death and}} its impacts, {{experiencing}} adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant {{themes of the}} series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly <b>Headless</b> Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were <b>headless</b> when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.|$|E
5|$|The first Burgess Shale fossils {{were found}} on Mount Stephen in Canada's Rocky Mountains by a {{construction}} worker, whose reports of them reached Richard McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada. McConnell found trilobite beds there in 1886, and some unusual fossils that he reported to his superior. These were misdiagnosed as <b>headless</b> shrimps with unjointed appendages, and were named Anomalocaris because of their unusual appendages– but {{turned out to be}} pieces of a puzzle that took 90years to solve.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be <b>headless</b> while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E
5|$|A {{council is}} held in the church. The Horseman {{seemingly}} kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, and heads off to the church to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter the church due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in the church resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the <b>Headless</b> Horsemen.|$|E
5|$|Crane {{begins his}} investigation, {{remaining}} {{skeptical about the}} paranormal elements until he actually encounters the <b>Headless</b> Horseman, who kills the town magistrate, Samuel Phillipse (Richard Griffiths). Boarding {{at the home of}} the town's richest family, the Van Tassels, Crane is taken with their daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci). Crane and Young Masbath, the son of one of the Horseman's victims, go to the cave dwelling of a reclusive witch. She reveals the location of the Tree of the Dead, which marks the Horseman's grave, as well as his portal into the natural, living world.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is {{deployed}} to the Westchester County hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, New York, {{which has been}} plagued by a series of brutal slayings in which the victims are found decapitated: Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau), a wealthy farmer; his son Dirk; and the widow Emily Winship. Crane learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a <b>headless</b> Hessian mercenary (Christopher Walken) from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.|$|E
5|$|In Pittsburgh, Leonard Betts (Paul McCrane), an EMT paramedic, is decapitated {{when his}} {{ambulance}} collides with a truck. Later, at the morgue, his <b>headless</b> body leaves its cold chamber, knocks out the attendant, steals his clothes, and escapes. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit the morgue, where they find Betts's {{head in a}} medical waste dumpster. Scully attempts a cranial examination, but the head's eyes and mouth both suddenly open when she begins the procedure. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to Betts's apartment, where he finds the attendant's discarded clothes. When Mulder leaves, Betts—who has regrown his head—rises out of his iodine-filled bathtub.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a <b>headless</b> corpse.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part {{a reaction to the}} computer-generated effects in Mars Attacks!, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the <b>Headless</b> Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on Vincent—such as forced perspective sets.|$|E
5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} <b>Headless</b> Cross US tour {{began in}} May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come and Silent Rage, {{but because of}} poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows. The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool. Black Sabbath {{was one of the}} first bands to tour Russia, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the single}} {{was never a}} {{physical}} CD release, artwork was created for it. The artwork featured the <b>headless</b> man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, however on this cover, the area where his head would be is a fireball, and {{he appears to be}} holding a briefcase while walking down the hallway of a hotel, another common theme throughout the artwork for the album. Unlike the last two singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, the artwork doesn't follow the picture-in-picture theme.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident on the news, Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now <b>headless.</b> Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie to admit that he's taking out his own guilt {{about not being able}} to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The Buddha statues are in niches at the Rupadhatu level, {{arranged}} in rows {{on the outer}} sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha statues at the Rupadhatu level. At the Arupadhatu level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated stupas. The first circular platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, which adds up to 72 stupas. Of the original 504 Buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly <b>headless),</b> and 43 are missing. Since the monument's discovery, heads have been acquired as collector's items, mostly by Western museums. Some of these Buddha heads are now displayed in numbers of museums, such as the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and The British Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|The niches in {{the lowest}} zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell {{identifies}} Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with the Virgin Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and the Virgin Mary are also represented by now <b>headless</b> figures in a Coronation of the Virgin in a niche above the central portal. A damaged figure of the Virgin and Christ Child occupies a quatrefoil in the spandrel of the door.|$|E
5|$|Word of {{the attack}} at Spafford's farm spread quickly to Fort Defiance, about five miles {{southeast}} of Mineral Point. A small volunteer force of 13 men was assembled at Fort Defiance and they set off to hunt down the band of Native Americans responsible for the massacre. The group reached Fort Hamilton at around midnight on June 15. On the morning of June 15, survivor Bennett Million guided the militia volunteers back {{to the site of}} the massacre. One of the volunteers was Alexander Higgenbotham, a survivor of the St. Vrain massacre. The bodies of the dead were badly mutilated and Spafford's corpse was <b>headless.</b> His head was found scalped and tossed into the grass along the river bank. The volunteers buried the mangled bodies of the fallen and searched in vain for Spencer, whom they also assumed dead.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the <b>headless</b> corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1909 that an Apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would {{become known as the}} Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The skull was found a short {{distance}} from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species Apatosaurus louisae, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of Diplodocus. Another smaller skeleton of A.louisae was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was accepted as belonging to the Apatosaurus specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount <b>headless.</b> While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a Camarasaurus skull on the mount.|$|E
5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her <b>headless</b> body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E

25|$|The {{body of the}} <b>headless</b> {{woman was}} of deep concern to La Porte residents. C. Christofferson, a {{neighboring}} farmer, {{took one look at}} the charred remains of this body and said that it was not the remains of Belle Gunness. So did another farmer, L. Nicholson, and so did Mrs. Austin Cutler, an old friend of Gunness. More of Gunness' old friends, Mrs. May Olander and Mr. Sigward Olsen, arrived from Chicago. They examined the remains of the <b>headless</b> woman and said it was not Gunness.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1940s, the <b>headless</b> {{remains of}} {{prospector}} James A. Cravey were reportedly {{discovered in the}} Superstition Mountains. He'd allegedly disappeared after setting out to find the Lost Dutchman's mine.|$|E
25|$|The {{handyman}} {{cleared up}} {{the question of the}} <b>headless</b> female corpse found in the ruins of Gunness' home. Gunness had lured this woman from Chicago on the pretense of hiring her as a housekeeper days before she decided to make her permanent escape from La Porte. According to Lamphere, Gunness had drugged the woman, then bashed in her head and decapitated the body, taking the head, which had weights tied to it, to a swamp where she threw it into deep water. Then she chloroformed her children, smothered them to death, and dragged their bodies, along with the <b>headless</b> corpse, to the basement.|$|E
