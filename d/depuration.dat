50|$|Rotating Cell Biofilm Reactor (RCBR) is a {{new type}} of {{biological}} process based on biofilm active sludge used in wastewaters treatment. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of Rotating Biological Contactors plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of Rotating Biological Contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using - instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree - many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the <b>depuration</b> process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented {{by the fact that the}} biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.|$|E
50|$|A {{stainless}} steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1-3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, {{where there are}} wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, heterotrophic bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of COD and BOD concentration and then the development of autotrophic bacteria. They belong to the Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter category and {{they are able to}} oxidize ammonium, transforming it into nitrites and nitrates.The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the <b>depuration</b> process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters denitrification. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation - alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere - to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.|$|E
50|$|RCBR {{technology}} is totally a water biological treatment system, {{able to make}} more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the <b>depuration</b> of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium nitrification. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).|$|E

40|$|AbstractFish cultured within water {{recirculating}} aquaculture systems (RAS) {{can acquire}} “earthy” or “musty” off-flavors due to bioaccumulation of the compounds geosmin and 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB), respectively, which {{are produced by}} certain bacterial species present in RAS biosolids and microbial biofilms. Fish cultured in RAS are generally transferred to separate <b>depuration</b> systems that are flushed with water {{in a single pass}} or operated with limited water recirculation (with no biofilter), in order to purge these unpalatable flavors. Technologies and standard operating practices that optimize purging kinetics for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and other species cultured in RAS are needed to improve the consistency and efficacy of <b>depuration.</b> A 2 × 2 factorial trial was conducted to evaluate techniques to mitigate off-flavor from Atlantic salmon cultured to 3 – 5 kg in a semi-commercial scale freshwater RAS. Twelve replicated <b>depuration</b> systems (0. 5 m 3) were used to evaluate four combinations (n= 3) of the following standard operating procedure and system design parameters: (1) disinfection of <b>depuration</b> systems as a 1 h static treatment using 250 mg/L hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) prior to stocking fish, (2) no disinfection prior to stocking fish, (3) presence of water aeration media within gas transfer columns of <b>depuration</b> systems, and (4) absence of water aeration media within gas transfer columns of <b>depuration</b> systems. Food-size Atlantic salmon were stocked within the <b>depuration</b> systems and kept off feed for 10 days. Six salmon were harvested from the original RAS on Day 0 and fileted for baseline assessment of off-flavor concentrations. Thereafter, filet samples (n= 3 – 4) were taken on Days 3, 6, and 10 to evaluate off-flavor kinetics. Hydrogen peroxide disinfection of <b>depuration</b> systems resulted in significantly reduced off-flavor in salmon filets during the <b>depuration</b> period. Results also indicated that the presence of high-surface-area water aeration media shielded biofilms from complete disinfection, resulting in less and slower off-flavor removal from Atlantic salmon filets; while <b>depuration</b> systems void of media resulted in greater and more rapid off-flavor reduction. Thus, water aeration media should not be used in <b>depuration</b> systems because of the challenges posed for effective cleaning, disinfection, and inactivation of off-flavor producing bacteria that may be present, and unit processes and locations that are difficult-to-clean should be excluded. In addition, a wide range of off-flavor concentrations were measured within individual salmon, indicating that one salmon is not a representative sample size to determine market suitability...|$|E

Volumes of the individual shellfish samples were found uniform throughout the experiments when a prior selection for {{the weight of the}} shellfish was made. There was also no significant difference in volumes of the individual samples during the course of <b>depuration</b> (24 to 96 hr). Under controlled hydrographic conditions, however, the uptake of virus in individual shellfish varied considerably. In general, the individual variability reached 10 - to 100 -fold. This wide variation would explain the variability of viral contents obtained in pooled samples during <b>depuration</b> as reported previously. During a later phase of <b>depuration,</b> although a great majority of shellfish were free of the virus, a few still harbored minimal amounts of contaminants.

In this paper, through detaching the two schemes adopted by the <b>Depuration</b> algorithm, two new editing approaches are derived. Moreover, this paper proposes to use neural network ensemble to edit the training data for kNN classifiers. Experiments show that such an approach is better than the approaches derived from <b>Depuration,</b> while these approaches are better than or comparable to <b>Depuration...</b>|$|E
