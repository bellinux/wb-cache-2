500|$|For Rhodes, the {{agreement}} Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time {{that allowed him}} to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests. A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi, but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion. In March 1888, Rhodes bought out the company of his last competitor, the circus showman turned diamond millionaire Barney Barnato, to form De Beers Consolidated Mines, a sprawling national monopoly that controlled 90% of world diamond production. Barnato wanted to limit De Beers to mining diamonds, but Rhodes insisted that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> company to [...] "win the north": to this end, he ensured that the De Beers trust deed enabled activities far removed from mining, including banking and railway-building, the ability to annex and govern land, and the raising of armed forces. All this gave the immensely wealthy company powers not unlike those of the East India Company, which had governed India on Britain's behalf from 1757 to 1857. Through De Beers and Gold Fields of South Africa, the gold-mining firm he had recently started with Charles Rudd, Rhodes had both the capacity and the financial means to make his dream of an African empire a reality, but to make such ambitions practicable, he would first have to acquire a royal charter empowering him to take personal control of the relevant territories on Britain's behalf. To secure this royal charter, he would need to present Whitehall with a concession, signed by a native ruler, granting to Rhodes the exclusive mining rights in the lands he hoped to annex.|$|E

2500|$|While in {{the process}} of {{creating}} Saint Seiya, Masami Kurumada initially gave Seiya the name Rin, intending to title his manga [...] However, as he continued developing the story, he changed the name to Seiya, which he felt was more fitting.

Finally, he changed the title of the manga to Saint Seiya, once the concept of the Saints was fully developed. Kurumada stated that one of the first ideas he had for Saint Seiya was the [...] "Pegasus Meteor Fist".

2500|$|The logo change caused another {{controversy}} in April 2012. The department ordered 1,750 fire-resistive polo shirts {{at a cost}} of $70,000 shortly before Ellerbe took office. On April 12, 2012, DCFEMS issued an order to all personnel stating that the shirts would be given to staff even though it bore the old logo. Less than 30 minutes later, this order was rescinded. D.C. City Council members then inquired about how the department was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> stored shirts. DCFEMS assistant chiefs said the order was issued in error, and department leaders promised to issue an order concerning the shirts {{at some point in the}} future. Compounding the problem, former Fire Chief Rubin claimed that two DCFEMS firefighters were severely burned and two moderately burned in 2012 because the shirts which Ellerbe continued to use were not fire-resistive. Rubin's claims were later more widely reported by national news media. Ellerbe attributed the purchase of the shirt to [...] "trickery" [...] by Rubin, designed to set Ellerbe up for failure.|$|E

The situation of Charlie McCullough {{should have been a}} complete success story, but it took a detour. McCullough was caught in a police sting buying drugs, and entered drug court voluntarily, determined to kick drugs. Everything went fine for 22 months; he never missed a meeting or appointment and passed all his drug tests. Then at a random urine screening, the lab technician told him he tested positive for methamphetamine. McCullough insisted that he was clean and asked to take another test, which he passed. A third test was administered, which he also passed, so McCullough was relieved. At his next court appearance, Judge Williams asked why he failed a drug test. He was surprised, and stated that he passed the second test. The judge told him she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> first test; the second one didn't count. No matter how much he professed his innocence, the judge didn't believe him. The judge refused to bring in the lab technician to testify, but asked McCullough if he would take a polygraph, which he agreed, then she changed her mind and sentenced him to three days in jail for a [...] "bad" [...] test and 14 days for questioning the results of the drug screening. From that point on, his drug court experience went downhill.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kaneda, the {{two teams}} faced a {{delicate}} balancing act when combining the first-person exploration and user-created mapping of dungeons from Etrian Odyssey with the combat and style of the Persona series, as the two were seen as direct opposites. The two teams were fiercely opposed to making compromises on either side, with them eventually settling on choosing the incorporate the closest paralleling elements from both series. When development first started, the team were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> 3D dungeon design and battle system from the Persona series, but as development progressed, it shifted towards the viewpoint and battle system of Etrian Odyssey. An element carried directly from the Etrian Odyssey series was the FOEs, whose behaviors patterns were designed to be unique to each labyrinth's floors and structures. The battle system was based primarily on that used in Etrian Odyssey, with the most recognizable elements from the Persona series added: these included the Persona systems and elements such as [...] "One More Turn" [...] and exploitable weaknesses. The Sub-Persona system {{was based on the}} Etrian Odyssey series' subclass system, some stat-reducing spells were a combination of elements from both Persona and Etrian Odyssey, while the [...] "Boost" [...] feature was an entirely new addition suggested by the staff. Persona Q was the first entry in the Persona series to appear on a Nintendo platform, which offered challenges to both teams. The gameplay systems were ultimately created so that people familiar with both series would find common appeal, and multiple comprehensive tutorials were added so players would not be confused by the new features.|$|E

2500|$|Speculation quickly abounded {{about how}} {{severely}} Goodell, {{who has made}} player safety and the overall integrity of the game a point of emphasis during his six years as commissioner, would punish Williams and the Saints. In his weekly [...] "Monday Morning Quarterback" [...] column on March 5, SIs Peter King wrote that he believed Williams faced at least an eight-game suspension, and that Payton and Loomis would almost certainly be suspended as well. He also argued that Goodell would {{have no choice but}} to come down hard on the Saints, given that the league was facing numerous lawsuits brought by former players who suffered head injuries. Given the circumstances, King said, Goodell had a lot of incentive to [...] "issue a string of suspensions the likes of which the league has never seen." [...] In an article written for the March 12 edition of SI, King wrote that league officials were so outraged that they were likely to hand down penalties similar to the season-long bans Paul Hornung and Alex Karras received in 1963 for gambling. Freeman wrote that his sources in the league office had told him that the players, Williams, Payton and Loomis would all face suspensions of at least six games, as well as heavy fines. Freeman's sources also said that Payton's sanctions were likely to dwarf those handed down to the New England Patriots' Bill Belichick in the wake of the 2007 [...] "Spygate" [...] affair. He also believed that Goodell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> scandal to [...] "end the practice of bounty football forever," [...] much like the penalties imposed against the Patriots after [...] "Spygate" [...] effectively ended the longstanding practice of illicit videotaping.|$|E
2500|$|This law thus {{squarely}} {{shifts the}} onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies {{are yet to}} enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, [...] "I have a few IT clients. When I point {{to the need for}} a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." [...] An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." [...] Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, [...] "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." [...] As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.|$|E
