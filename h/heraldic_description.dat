5000|$|The Lyon Court, whose {{jurisdiction}} is heraldic, {{can confirm}} {{an application for}} the Chief of the Name and Arms of a Scottish family. However, the [...] "Chief of the Name and Arms" [...] is a heraldic term, originating from the French [...] "chef du nom et des armes" [...] and refers {{to the head of}} a heraldic armigerous family. There is no evidence of any practice that would point to the use of chief of clan, or chieftain of branch of clan, as correct <b>heraldic</b> <b>descriptions</b> of headship of an armigerous family. The term chief of clan and principals of branches is not to persons bearing coats of arms; chiefship and chieftainship have no armorial significance. Although the chief of clan and Chief of the Name and Arms may concur in the same person they are not the same term. See Chiefs of Clan Fraser for an example of chief of clan and Chief of the Name and Arms not being held by the same person.|$|R

50|$|German {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the cultural tradition and style of heraldic achievements in modern and historic Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, including national and civic arms, noble and burgher arms, ecclesiastical heraldry, heraldic displays and <b>heraldic</b> <b>descriptions.</b> German <b>heraldic</b> style {{is one of the}} four major broad traditions within European heraldry and stands in contrast to Gallo-British, Latin and Eastern heraldry, and strongly influenced the styles and customs of heraldry in the Nordic countries, which developed comparatively late. Together German and Nordic heraldry are often referred to as German-Nordic heraldry. The German heraldic tradition is noted for its scant use of heraldic furs, multiple crests, inseparability of the crest, and repetition of charges in the shield and the crest. Mullets have six points (rather than five as in Gallo-British heraldry), and beasts may be colored with patterns, (barry, bendy, paly, chequy, etc.). As in other European heraldic traditions, the most prominent among the birds and beasts are the eagle and lion. These two charges in particular had a special significance in Germany, where the eagle became symbolic of the Holy Roman Empire, and the lion came to represent certain feudal lords. As the political divide between these groups grew in the late Middle Ages, the heraldic eagle and lion came to represent two of the foremost political powers in Germany, the house of Hohenzollern and the house of Welf, respectively.|$|R
