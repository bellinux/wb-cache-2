[...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops.

[...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Kinberg, as {{they were}} writing the script, they thought it is {{sensible}} that Wolverine was traveling between time periods, because of his ageless look and ability to heal rapidly. He further stated of making Wolverine the time traveler, [...] "We made the decision <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> ... he's the protagonist of the franchise, and probably the most beloved character to a mass audience". Kinberg and Vaughn considered Bishop and Cable candidates {{for the role of}} time traveler. Kinberg said Rachel Summers was in the first draft of the script; she sent Wolverine back to 1973. The character was later replaced with Kitty Pryde, to whom Kinberg gave a secondary power of sending people's consciousnesses into the past. Juggernaut, Jubilee, Nightcrawler and Psylocke were also considered for the film.|$|E
5000|$|Karras {{spent the}} summer of 1957 with an American track team of Greek descent. He participated in the shot put, {{throwing}} a respectable 52 feet. In his senior season, Alex Karras was the most dominant lineman in the nation, winning the 1957 Outland Trophy. He also was the runner-up in the voting for the Heisman Trophy. Karras and Ohio State tackle John Hicks (in 1973) are two of only three linemen ever finishing so high in the Heisman Trophy voting. In 1949, Leon Hart, a Notre Dame end became the only lineman ever to win the Heisman Trophy. In addition, Karras was a consensus first team All-American in 1957. Hawkeye teammate Randy Duncan said, [...] Karras hated Evashevski, and he still does. I think Karras hated Evy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Evy was on everybody's back, {{and he was on}} Karras' back big time. Karras was a great football player, but he didn't really like offense and, in those days, you had to go both ways. So he didn't block anybody. What {{he wanted to do was}} chase down quarterbacks and play defense.|$|E

Moore noted that M'Baku would not be {{referred}} to by his comics alter ego of [...] "Man-Ape", since there were [...] "a lot of racial implications that don’t sit well" [...] in having a black character dress up as an ape. This aspect of the character was instead reworked to have the tribe M'Baku {{is the leader of}} worship the gorilla gods, with M'Baku still wearing elements of fur on his arms and legs and a chest-plate that hints at the gorilla. Moore continued, [...] "Man-Ape is a problematic character <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> but the idea [...] Man-Ape we thought was really fascinating. … It’s a line I think we’re walking, and hopefully walking successfully." [...] The following month, Forest Whitaker was cast as Zuri and Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi, with Florence Kasumba revealed to be reprising her role as Ayo from Captain America: Civil War. Letitia Wright was also cast in an unspecified role. Angela Bassett was cast as T'Challa's mother, Ramonda, in November, and by January 2017, Sterling K. Brown was cast as N'Jobu. At that time, Marvel received permission from the Oakland-based public transit agency AC Transit to use their logo in the film, for a bus that T'Challa rides in a 1990 flashback to commute to Saint Mary's College High School in Berkeley, California. The setting was chosen due to Coogler's Oakland roots.|$|E

40|$|This {{communication}} {{presents a}} simple algebraic method for {{the extraction of}} independent components in multidimensional data. Since statistical independence is a much stronger property than uncorrelation, it is possible, using higher-order moments, to identify source signatures in array data without any a-priori model for propagation or reception, that is, without directional vector parametrization, provided that the emitting sources be independent with different probability distributions. We propose such a "blind" identification procedure. Source signatures are directly identified as covariance eigenvectors after data have been orthonormalized and non linearily weighted. Potential applications to Array Processing are illustrated by a simulation consisting in a simultaneous range-bearing estimation with a passive array.

From their existence one may, under proper conditions, deduce the bifurcation behavior of periodic orbits or the existence of chaos nearby. In the past 20 years, {{with the aid of}} the variational methods, the existence and multiplicity of homoclinic solutions for system (1.1) have been extensively investigated by many authors; see [3, 4, 6 – 9, 11 – 30] and references therein. Most of them treated the superquadratic case [8, 15, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27 – 29] treated subquadratic case and [9, 21, 30] treated asymptotically quadratic case. Particularly, Yang and Zhang [25] considered a superquadratic case and obtained system (1.1) has infinitely many homoclinic solutions by using the following conditions.|$|E

The Twitter Journal Club (#TJC 15), an open, unstructured, academic reading group found on Twitter, provides meaningful learning experiences while embracing the holistic and messy nature of learning. Within this space, we Laura (the group s creator) and Simon (a frequent participant-observer) have found room to breathe as well as opportunities to care, in terms of emotional and intellectual engrossment, relational and personal interest, and kindness and mutual respect. As such, we find this alternative, digital approach to academic reading one that engages its participants in uniquely creative, playful, and human ways of learning even as it augments and challenges traditional academic practice...|$|E
40|$|Biomass is {{becoming}} an increasingly important alternative resource of energy supply. Bioenergy can replace the fossil fuels <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons,</b> such as economics, renewability, and fewer greenhouse gases. In this study, a mathematical model for the reactions in fast pyrolysis of a single biomass particle is simulated (Heindel, Xue and Fox, 2011). The solid biomass particle is assumed to consist of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and these are converted by rapid heating into active components and then eventually into tar and gas (Heindel, Xue and Fox, 2011). Using existing values for the reaction rates and assuming a constant temperature, the evolution equations for the mass fraction of components are simulated in time. The model is then extended to account for transient heat and mass transfer between the biomass particle and the ambient gas. Finally, a stochastic description {{of the problem is}} presented where a distribution of ambient gas temperature is considered. The effect of the stochastic variability of ambient temperature on the yield of biomass conversion is investigated...|$|E

But another is that the Czech Republic has a widespread repuation in the U. S. (and more generally, I think) as a very liberal, democratic place. Czechs, we think, are different and long have been. In many ways, they are, of course. But as Mary Heimann suggests in her controversial book Czechoslovakia: The State That Failed (Yale UP, 2009; paperback, 2011), the Czechs (and Slovaks) were not as exceptional, historically speaking, as many think, and certainly not as exceptional as some historians have led us to believe. Czechoslovakia was not immune {{to some of the}} more harmful movements of the late nineteenth and twentieth century–strident nationalism, fascism, and communism among them. Sometimes Czech and Slovak leaders acted liberally and democratically; sometimes they did not. In that way, they were like all their European neighbors, that is, not exceptional at all.

40|$|Human {{body tissues}} are {{relatively}} translucent to penetrating light what makes possible {{to perform the}} effective transillumination for noninvasive measurements of some biophysical quantities by utilization of tissue optics. However, light is strongly attenuated by different tissue components and only proper processing of the transmitted fraction of light at the wavelengths included in the transillumination window, allows us to acquire measurable electrical signals. Volumes of living body parts are cyclically modulated according to the individual arterial pulsations. As a result, making transillumination of a sufficiently thin layer enables to observe rhythmical changes in light intensity transmitted by such an object. Optical density of blood and other tissues is very high, and so, values of light intensity components which are very low, cause many problems with reliability, sensitivity, and range of the detected selective changes. In order to choose a particular device and serve it properly, end-users of medical monitors should always know their advantages and limitations which can be of biophysical as well as technical nature. A lot of artifacts, noises, and disturbances affect the processing procedures and cause the decrease in useful output signals to be converted. On the other hand, there are many problems with empirical verification on human subjects. It is important to solve such complex questions because all the erroneOus responses are potentially dangerous. One of the significant diagnostic problems is to detect global {{as well as local}} changes in tissue oxygenation which can appear <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Basing on some novel light on use of the pulse oximetry idea, a model of the living object exposed to noninvasive transillumination can be considered in order to do technical recommendations useftil in practice.
