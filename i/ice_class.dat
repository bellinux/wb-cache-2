25|$|In the 1960s the {{expansion}} of the Finnish icebreaker fleet allowed navigation in more severe ice conditions, and the Finnish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules published in 1965 introduced a new <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1A Super, which was considerably stronger than the existing classes. Since <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 1A was already exempted from the ice fees, the 50% reduction to lighthouse fees was given to ships of the new <b>ice</b> <b>class.</b> However, the additional requirements of the highest <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> were deemed excessive and only three such ships were built.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships are}} {{classified}} by Russian Maritime Register of Shipping with <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> UL, {{equivalent to the}} highest Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1A Super. However, the actual level of ice strengthening far exceeds {{the requirements of the}} <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> notations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{international}} classification societies have incorporated the Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules {{to their own}} rulebooks and offer <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> notations that are recognized by the Finnish and Swedish authorities. These ice classes are, in turn, used by nations such as Estonia and Latvia to assign traffic restrictions. Since the <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules have been revised and amended several times over the years, a list of equivalent <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> notations is used to assign the correct official <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> for older vessels when they visit Finnish and Swedish ports. Although mainly used in the Baltic Sea, the Finnish-Swedish ice classes and the equivalent <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> notations from classification societies are sometimes used when discussing ships operating in other ice-infested seas of the world.|$|E
50|$|The lowest Polar Classes (PC 6 and PC 7) {{are roughly}} {{equivalent}} to the two highest Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>classes</b> (1A Super and 1A, respectively). However, unlike the Baltic <b>ice</b> <b>classes</b> intended for operation only in first-year sea ice, even the lowest Polar Classes consider the possibility of encountering multi-year ice ("old ice inclusions").|$|R

25|$|The {{ships were}} the first freighters in ten years to be built to the highest Soviet <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> {{notation}} available for merchant ships, ULA. Their hulls, rudders and propulsion systems were dimensioned according to the then-latest <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules of the USSR Register of Shipping. When the ships are loaded to a deeper draught, their <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> is reduced to UL which, despite being slightly lower, is still equivalent to the highest Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1A Super.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003 the Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> of Botnica was {{unexpectedly}} downgraded from 1A Super to III, {{the lowest}} possible <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> which is mainly used for barges and other vessels unsuitable for navigation in ice. Since the icebreaker is built to DNV's ICE-10 <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> which far exceeds the requirements for the highest Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> this was not due to any technical or structural issue, but {{a problem with the}} ship's paperwork. Botnica operates at different draughts depending on her mission, and when returning to Finland from abroad her true main dimensions were found out to be different from those stated in the ship's documentation. As a result, the maritime inspector of the Finnish Maritime Administration had no other choice but to downgrade the ship's ice classification to {{the lowest possible}} <b>ice</b> <b>class.</b> The missing documents were delivered and the correct <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> was restored shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Finnish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules {{published}} in 1932 introduced the ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C for ships strengthened for navigation in ice, <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 2 for ships classified for unrestricted service but not strengthened for navigation in ice and <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 3 for other vessels. <b>Ice</b> <b>class</b> 2 was further divided to two subclasses, 2A and 2B, and vessels {{were eligible for}} the former {{if they had a}} radio. Detailed minimum requirements, again as an additional percentage of the open water requirement, were given for the stem, shell plating at the waterline, stiffeners, rudder and rudder bearings, and the propulsion machinery. In the lowest <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1C, the requirements were limited to the bow of the vessel.|$|E

25|$|The Finnish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> {{rules of}} 1960 {{included}} only minor {{modifications to the}} existing rules. The subdivision of <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 2 was abolished as radios had become more common.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 a {{workgroup}} {{consisting of}} the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E
25|$|The current Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> {{rules were}} issued in 2010 and apply for ships {{contracted}} for construction on or after 1 January 2012. The new regulations also include provisions {{to determine which}} <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules apply to a ship built prior to this date {{and when they are}} required to comply with the new rules.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} taken into {{commercial}} operation at the timetable change on 13 December 2015. Scheduled operation initially used ICE T sets, with {{a top speed of}} 230 km/h. These trains were equipped with ETCS for this purpose, with the modification of more <b>ICE</b> <b>classes</b> to follow. <b>ICE</b> 1 sets, which will operate on the Ebensfeld-Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed line would also receive ECTS.|$|R
25|$|Explorer was {{commissioned}} by Lars-Eric Lindblad, the Swedish-American pioneer of exotic expedition tours, and built in 1969 at Uudenkaupungin Telakka shipyard in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The ship was built to stay afloat with two compartments filled with water. Her original Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> was 1C, which is relatively weak. It is not known when the <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> was uprated to 1A.|$|E
25|$|Ships of {{the highest}} Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1A Super, are {{designed}} to operate in difficult ice conditions mainly without icebreaker assistance while ships of lower ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C are assumed to rely on icebreaker assistance. However, even ships {{of the highest}} <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> are assumed to require icebreaker assistance from time to time. In addition there are <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 2 for self-propelled steel-hulled ships with no ice strengthening {{that are capable of}} operating independently in very light ice conditions and class 3 for vessels that do not belong to any other class such as unpropelled barges and ships built of wood. The Finnish-Swedish ice classes are usually spelled with Roman numerals in official context and legislation.|$|E
25|$|John G. Diefenbaker will be {{classified}} by Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Her <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> is Polar Class 2, {{the second highest}} <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> according to the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Polar class rules. Furthermore, the class notation Icebreaker(+) will result in additional structural strengthening based on analysis of the vessel's operational profile potential ice loading scenarios. John G. Diefenbaker {{is one of the}} first vessels to hold this class notation.|$|E
40|$|Statistics of Arctic sea ice surface {{roughness}} {{have been investigated}} {{in order to improve}} classification of ice thickness regimes. The data consist of {{surface roughness}} and thickness profiles, acquired simultaneously by helicopter-borne laser altimetry and electromagnetic induction sounding. Five thickness classes were identified using the modal thickness as a criterion. For each class, the statistical properties of the surface roughness profiles were analysed. A classification algorithm was designed, which assigns profiles to the thickness classes {{on the basis of a}} set of selected statistical roughness parameters. The algorithm was applied to profiles of different lengths. Best results were obtained for 2 km long profiles, for which it was possible to discriminate well between thick first-year and multi-year ice, and to distinguish these <b>classes</b> from thinner <b>ice.</b> The classification rule was tested on data obtained under winter and summer conditions. The results suggest that statistical surface roughness properties are different for thinner and thicker <b>ice</b> <b>classes.</b> However, individual thin <b>ice</b> <b>classes</b> cannot be discriminated on the basis of the selected roughness parameters...|$|R
40|$|Sea-ice {{classification}} {{based on}} scattering mechanisms is investigated using the Unsupervised Wishart Classification with Entropy, Alpha and Anisotropy decomposition parameters. L and C Band JPL AIRSAR fully polarimetric {{data from the}} Beaufort Sea during winter/freeze conditions are used for testing the algorithm. Initial results show that, within specified ranges of incidence angles, there is good discrimination between the major <b>ice</b> <b>classes,</b> with L-Band giving better first year ice discrimination than C band. ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{requirements}} for merchant ships to be escorted by icebreakers {{were set in}} Finland in 1890, after winter traffic to the port of Hanko was started. In the past, different classification organizations had different standards, rules, and <b>ice</b> <b>classes.</b> Converting between the Baltic and Arctic systems is not usually done. Recently, the two different class systems have been defined by the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).|$|R
25|$|Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> is an <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> {{assigned}} to a vessel operating in first-year ice in the Baltic Sea and calling Finnish or Swedish ports. Ships are divided into six ice classes based on requirements for hull structural design, engine output and performance in ice according to the regulations issued by the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi), which overtook {{the responsibilities of the}} Finnish Maritime Administration in 2010, and the Swedish Maritime Administration.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{is built}} {{according}} to Germanischer Lloyd rules for classification with class notation of GL 100 A5, E4, NAV-OC, Tug, Supply Vessel, Marine Pollution Response Vessel, Oil Recovery Vessel, Chemical Recovery Vessel for {{the ship and}} GL MC, E4, AUT, FF1 for the machinery. The vessel is built to the highest Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1A Super, with special consideration for the dimensioning of the propulsion and hull {{to meet the requirements}} for icebreaking capability as the Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules do not extend to icebreaking vessels.|$|E

25|$|The ICE 3 and ICE T {{are similar}} in their {{interior}} design, but the other ICE types differ in their original design. The ICE 1, the ICE 2 and seven-car <b>ICE</b> T (<b>Class</b> 411) are equipped with a full restaurant car. The five-car <b>ICE</b> T (<b>Class</b> 415) and <b>ICE</b> 3 however, have been designed without a restaurant, they feature a bistro coach instead. Since 1 October 2006, smoking is prohibited in the bistro coaches, similar to the restaurant cars, which have always been non-smoking.|$|R
25|$|While the Finnish-Swedish ice classes can be {{assigned}} to icebreakers {{for the purpose of}} collecting fairway fees, the rules are intended primarily for merchant ships operating under icebreaker escort. Because the engine output and the level of ice-strengthening in ships designed to operate independently in ice-infested waters, especially in the presence of multi-year ice, usually exceeds the requirements of the Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> rules, the classification societies use different <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> notations, such as the IACS Polar Class, for icebreakers. The two highest Finnish-Swedish ice classes, 1A and 1A Super, are somewhat equivalent to the two lowest Polar Classes, PC 7 and PC 6, respectively.|$|E
25|$|As built, {{she had a}} {{small car}} deck, with space for 80 {{passenger}} cars and a ramp {{on the port side}} in the rear. Like most cruiseferries in the Baltic Sea, she was built to <b>ice</b> <b>class</b> 1A.|$|E
25|$|Being {{considerably}} less powerful than Rautaruukki and Steel, Herakles received new main engines and propellers in 1995. While the engine output was nearly doubled to 4060kW, she remained underpowered {{in comparison with}} the original Finnpusku pushers. She also had a lower Finnish-Swedish <b>ice</b> <b>class,</b> 1B.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 the DB Class 610 {{were put}} out of service. The DB Class 611 had been partly {{converted}} from ZUB 122 to ZUB 262 but {{they are supposed to}} end their service after 2016. All other tilting trains in Germany are based on ZUB 262 with an Eurobalise antenna. This includes the successor DBAG Class 612 as well as the series of <b>ICE</b> T (<b>Class</b> 411 and 415) and <b>ICE</b> TD (<b>Class</b> 605) trains.

5000|$|Many {{industry}} {{bodies and}} environmental groups termed the final draft Polar code of 2014 as [...] "too weak" [...] and [...] "diluted". The pollution requirements in the arctic waters are even more lax {{than those in the}} Mediterranean sea, allowing ships to throw food waste overboard in arctic waters 12 miles from ice. The structural requirements too were found lax, for instance being <b>ice</b> <b>classed</b> is not a requirements for ships making one arctic passage. Polar Certification does not require a physical separate survey and the polar code allows this to be simply sent by email.|$|R
