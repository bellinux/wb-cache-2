500|$|Lindwall, widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time, bowled with a classical and artistic side-on bowling action. David Frith wrote that [...] "there was a balance, rhythmic run, a build-up" [...] and an [...] "ecstasy" [...] in his smooth delivery action. Richie Benaud said that Lindwall was [...] "technically the best fast bowler" [...] that he ever saw. During the 1950s, Lindwall's action was copied by young children and a number of first-class Australian bowlers, including Ron Gaunt, John Power and Barry Fisher consciously copied his action. Alan Davidson, who succeeded Lindwall as Australia's pace spearhead, labelled him as [...] "the best fast bowler I ever saw". Lindwall's childhood hero Harold Larwood rated Dennis Lillee to be equal to Lindwall [...] "but not ahead of him". Following Lindwall's tour of England in 1953, his English counterpart Alec Bedser said that Lindwall was [...] "the best fast bowler I've seen, because of his variety and control". Lindwall was particularly known for his trademark outswinger, which swung late and at high pace. Fred Trueman believed that Lindwall's ability to simultaneously swing the ball and at such pace and accuracy was matched only by himself and Wes Hall. Frank Tyson wrote that [...] "he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps – until the last couple of strides of his approach, when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride...when he releases the ball, his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round-arm". Lindwall's ability to swing the ball at high pace allowed him to repeatedly breach the defences of his opponents; of his 228 Test wickets, 98 were bowled and another 31 were leg before wicket. Lindwall's repertoire was reinforced with a dangerous yorker and bouncer, and changes of pace. As Tyson said [...] "who is not 'Lindy's bunny' when he slots his yorker in the right spot?". In 1952 he developed an inswinger and then coupled it with his yorker, which <b>homed</b> into the feet of batsmen at high pace. Denis Compton said that Lindwall had the subtleties of a slow bowler, saying that he [...] "raised what is considered to be the labouring force of cricket [...] to an artform with his tactical shrewdness, control and variations".|$|E

2500|$|The St Helens academy has {{produced}} {{some of the}} finest youngsters, potential stars and internationals the world of rugby league has seen. Although initially, players were signed either from other clubs, or would go straight into first team reckoning after being signed from their amateur club at a much later age than today's system; as the game became more widespread in the town, across the North—West and nationally, a system had to be introduced in order to suffice the amount of youth talent that the club <b>homed.</b> More early examples of players that made the grade following on form their stints in the academy and reserves (previously known as the [...] "St Helens Colts") include Steve Prescott, Paul Forber, Gary Connolly, and Chris Arkwright.

Now, however, {{it can be argued that}} Saints look to make them internationals, with no less than five of the current St Helens squad's youth products having gone on to represent either Great Britain or England or both. St Helens youth policy does not operate solely in the borough boundaries of the town. Indeed, many of St Helens current and past squads call areas like Widnes, Wigan, Cumbria and Oldham home.

2500|$|As {{in most of}} France, {{viticulture}} {{is believed}} to have been introduced into Aquitania by the Romans. The earliest evidence of sweet wine production, however, dates only to the 17th century. While the English were Bordeaux's main consumer since the Middle Ages, their primary tastes were for red claret. It was the Dutch traders of the 17th century who first developed an interest in white wine. For years they were active in the trade of German wines but production in Germany began to wane in the 17th century as the popularity of beer increased. The Dutch saw an opportunity for a new production source in Bordeaux and began investing in the planting of white grape varieties. They introduced to the region German white wine making techniques, such as halting fermentation with the use of sulphur in order to maintain residual sugar levels. One of these techniques involved taking a candle (known as a [...] "brimstone candle") with its wick dipped in the sulphur and burned in the barrel that the wine will be fermenting in. This would leave a presence of sulphur in the barrel that the wine would slowly interact with as it was fermenting. Being an anti-microbial agent, sulphur stuns the yeast that stimulates fermentation, eventually bringing it to a halt with high levels of sugars still in the wine. The Dutch began to identify areas that could produce grapes well suited for white wine production and soon <b>homed</b> in on the area of Sauternes. The wine produced from this area was known as vins liquoreux but it is not clear if the Dutch were actively using nobly rotted grapes at this point.|$|E

The column of some 2,000 fighters, several hundred non-combatants and 50 Russian prisoners of war, hit a minefield between the city and the village of Alkhan-Kala. The Russian forces ambushed them as they were crossing a bridge over the Sunzha River. The Russian artillery barrage <b>homed</b> in on their position and the situation became desperate. The Chechens pushed on through the minefield, being unaware of it and lacking engineers. Scores of rebel fighters were killed by the combination of artillery fire and the crossing of the minefield, including several top Chechen commanders: Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov, the city's mayor Lecha Dudayev and Aslambek Ismailov, the mastermind behind the defense of Grozny.
