5|$|In Mexico, Paine {{produced}} rainfall along {{much of the}} coastline, with maxima in inland Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Sonora {{where it}} moved ashore. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the remnants of Paine in the United States, there was an extended period of heavy rainfall, which caused at least 10deaths, forced thousands of people <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> resulted in heavy flooding damage. The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses.|$|E

When Fay flooded {{areas such as}} Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, 100families were {{evacuated}} <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> 120people were stranded in hotels. It is reported that in that town, 10trees fell causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3meters (10ft) above flood stage. It is reported that 300families {{were not able to}} return to their homes for several weeks as a result of the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its arrival, {{flooding}} {{across the}} central United States killed six people, forced {{thousands of people}} <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> left at least $76million in damage (1986USD). Additional flooding from Paine exacerbated the situation; the flooding affected 52 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, {{which resulted in a}} total of $350 million in damage, half of which from agriculture. The remnants of Paine brought {{about the end of the}} extended period of rainfall, which overall had forced 55,000 people from their homes, including 1,200 in East Saint Louis, Illinois where a floodgate broke.

The rainfall collected into streams and rivers, with some officials calling it a 1 in 500year flood. The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide, and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> numerous houses were damaged.

5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from Athens and {{within sight of the}} city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts left 700,000people {{without power}} from Miami to West Palm Beach, {{including}} the National Hurricane Center. The center briefly lost power, but during {{an hour and}} a half delay to reboot the computers, they obtained information from computers in the Mid-West and Washington, D.C. Officials from the Florida Power & Light Company were unable to repair power lines due to strong wind gusts, while Irene's flooding submerged underground lines, preventing repairs until the waters subsided. Five people, including three in one family, were killed when they walked through electrified waters due to downed power lines. The rains from Irene flooded roads and canals, stalling numerous cars. Three people drowned when they drove their vehicles into the canals. The floodwaters persisted for nearly a week in areas, displacing hundreds <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> isolating thousands. Property damage in southeastern Florida totalled to $262million.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E
