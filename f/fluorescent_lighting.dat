5|$|Heavy metals {{are used}} in lighting, lasers, and {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs). Flat panel displays incorporate a thin film of electrically conducting indium tin oxide. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> relies on mercury vapour for its operation. Ruby lasers generate deep red beams by exciting chromium atoms; the lanthanides are also extensively employed in lasers. Gallium, indium, and arsenic; and copper, iridium, and platinum {{are used in}} LEDs (the latter three in organic LEDs).|$|E
5|$|The long, rectilinear, two-storey building, had {{a double}} {{cantilevered}} frame supported {{on a single}} row of concrete columns. These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting,</b> and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> come in many form factors, {{including}} long, thin bulbs {{as well as}} smaller spiral shaped bulbs (compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights).</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> {{are available}} in color temperatures ranging from 2700 K to 10,000 K. The luminous efficacy ranges from 30 lm/W to 90 lm/W. The two main types of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> used for growing plants are the tube-style <b>lights</b> and compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
40|$|Scientific Session VII: Thyroid - no. 29 Background: Because the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> {{intensity}} on an indocyanine green fluorescence angiography {{reflects the}} blood perfusion within a focused area, the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity {{in the remaining}} in situ parathyroid glands may predict postoperative hypocalcemia risk after total thyroidectomy. Methods: Seventy patients underwent intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography after total thyroidectomy. Any parathyroid glands with a vascular pedicle was left in situ while any parathyroid glands without pedicle or inadvertently removed was autotransplanted. After total thyroidectomy, an intravenous 2. 5 mg indocyanine green fluorescence angiography was given and real-time fluorescent images of the thyroid bed were recorded using the SPY imaging system (Novadaq, Ontario, Canada). The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity of each indocyanine green fluorescence angiography {{as well as the}} average and greatest <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity in each patient were calculated. Postoperative hypocalcemia was defined as adjusted calcium 150 % developed postoperative hypocalcemia while 9 (81. 8 %) patients with a greatest <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity ≤ 150 % did. Similarly, no patients with an average <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity > 109 % developed PH while 9 (30 %) with an average <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity ≤ 109 % did. The greatest <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> intensity was more predictive than day- 0 postoperative hypocalcemia (P =. 027) and % PTH drop day- 0 to 1 (P <. 001). Conclusion: Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is a promising operative adjunct in determining residual parathyroid glands function and predicting postoperative hypocalcemia risk after total thyroidectomy...|$|R
25|$|Swallowtail (Papilio) {{butterflies}} have {{complex systems}} for emitting <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> Their wings contain pigment-infused crystals that provide directed <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> These crystals function to produce <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> {{best when they}} absorb radiance from sky-blue light (wavelength about 420nm). The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterfly's wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.|$|R
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E
5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting,</b> and upgraded ventilation.|$|E
50|$|Compact <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> (CFLs) {{are smaller}} {{versions}} of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> that were originally designed as pre-heat lamps, but {{are now available}} in rapid-start form. CFLs have largely replaced incandescent light bulbs in households because they last longer and are much more electrically efficient. In some cases, CFLs are also used as grow <b>lights.</b> Like standard <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> they are useful for propagation and situations where relatively low light levels are needed.|$|R

50|$|Two general {{types of}} {{instruments}} exist: filter fluorometers that use filters to isolate the incident <b>light</b> and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> and spectrofluorometers that use a diffraction grating monochromators to isolate the incident <b>light</b> and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over five weeks, {{on the outskirts of}} Dallas, Texas. The film was produced on a budget of only USD$7,000, and a skeleton crew of five. Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer. He also stars in the film as Aaron, and many of the other characters are played by his friends and family. The small budget required conservative use of the Super 16mm filmstock: the carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low shooting ratio of 2:1. Every shot in the film was meticulously storyboarded on 35mm stills. Carruth created a distinctive flat, overexposed look for the film by using <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting,</b> non-neutral color temperatures, high-speed film stock, and filters.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E
5|$|Skyscraper {{development}} paused {{during the}} years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, usually called the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions. Inside, new technologies such as <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary.|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} concern about food safety, {{environmental}} impact, and efficient energy usage in agricultural production systems. Producing lettuce under artificial lighting {{could be a}} solution addressing these concerns. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) offer the advantages of a narrow light spectrum, low power consumption, and little heat production. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of different light sources on the growth of miniature “Tom Thumb” butterhead lettuce in a non-circulating hydroponic system. Lettuce seedlings, started in Oasis Horticubes, were transferred to net pots in containers with a hydroponic nutrient solution. The lettuce was grown in a lab under three light treatments—blue LEDs, red LEDs, and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b> At the end of the study, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> resulted in greater root dry weight than blue LEDs and red LEDs. Total plant dry weight under <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> was greater than under red LEDs. There were no significant differences in shoot dry weight and plant height among the treatments. Percent partitioning of dry weight to shoots was greatest with red LEDs, followed by blue LEDS, and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b> Percent partitioning of dry weight to roots was greatest with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> followed by blue LEDS, and red LEDs. Leaf chlorophyll content was greater under blue LEDs and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> than red LEDs. The pH of the nutrient solution of the blue LED and the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> treatments were greater than the red LED treatment. Electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> treatment was greater than the blue LED treatment and the red LED treatment. In conclusion, LEDs could provide an alternative lighting source for miniature lettuce production. </p...|$|R
30|$|Second, {{the output}} of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> tube is also not {{constant}} in color but has different colors within the period. Depending on the type of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light,</b> for example, when switching on, the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> is more red and yellow (Period A in Figure 13), while at the peak of its periodic interval it is white (Period B), and at the end (switching off) it turns blue (Period C). This property effectively creates various colors in image parts that are normally colorless.|$|R
5000|$|Photophobia is {{a symptom}} of {{excessive}} sensitivity to light which affects 5 to 20% of the population. No studies have been conducted into the effect of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> on sufferers of photophobia but there is the possibility for compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> to affect sufferers.|$|R
5|$|During her {{shows at}} the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting.</b> Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum statistical {{properties of the}} light emitted by a quantum well interacting with squeezed light from a degenerate subthreshold optical parametric oscillator. We obtain analytical solutions for the pertinent quantum Langevin equations in the strong coupling and low excitation regimes. Using these solutions we calculate the intensity spectrum, autocorrelation function, quadrature squeezing for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> We show that the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> exhibits bunching and quadrature squeezing.

30|$|First, {{measurements}} of intensity errors and color errors {{present in the}} short-exposure image are performed. These errors will show sinusoidal behavior {{in the presence of}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> However, motion in the scene and other light sources can significantly affect the intensity- and color-error measurements. For this reason, we have to perform filtering of these measurements and ensure more accurate and reliable results. After the filtering stage, we detect the frequency, amplitude, and temporal consistency of the error signals. The algorithm for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> detection uses these measurements and makes a decision about the existence of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> in the scene. When <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> is detected, as a second step, we shift the corrupted short-exposure image out of the display range and apply color faders to remove any remaining color errors.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to having engineers and technicians along with facilities for R work on fluorescent lamps, General Electric controlled what it regarded as the key patents covering <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting,</b> including the patents originally issued to Hewitt, Moore, and Küch. More important than these was a patent covering an electrode that did not disintegrate at the gas pressures that ultimately were employed in fluorescent lamps. Albert W. Hull of GE’s Schenectady Research Laboratory filed for a patent on this invention in 1927, which was issued in 1931. General Electric used its control of the patents to prevent competition with its incandescent lights and probably delayed the introduction of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> by 20 years. Eventually, war production required 24-hour factories with economical lighting and fluorescent lights became available.|$|E
25|$|In other countries, {{residential}} use of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> {{varies depending on}} the price of energy, financial and environmental concerns of the local population, and acceptability of the light output.
