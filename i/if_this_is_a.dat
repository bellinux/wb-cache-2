5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> direct result of the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E

30|$|Regarding our {{hypothesis}} of either a significant imitation propensity, or {{the prevalence of}} large common externalities among companies (k[*]>[*] 0) [19, 21], we find a significant marginal effect of k[*]=[*] 0.38. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> only <b>a</b> measure of imitation effect, <b>this</b> effect <b>is</b> smaller than in other recent technological investments - e.g., Leroux et al.

25|$|Infection or {{inflammation}} of the prostate (prostatitis) may increase the chance for prostate cancer while another study shows infection may help prevent prostate cancer by increasing blood to the area.

25|$|Levi {{began writing}} The Truce early in 1961; it was {{published}} in 1963, almost 16 years after his first book. That year it won the first annual Premio Campiello literary award. It is often published in one volume with <b>If</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> Man, as it covers his long return through eastern Europe from Auschwitz. Levi's reputation was growing. He regularly contributed articles to , the Turin newspaper. He worked to gain a reputation as a writer about subjects other than survival of Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Stuart Woolf, {{in close}} {{collaboration}} with Levi, translated <b>If</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> Man into English, {{and it was}} published in the UK in 1959 by Orion Press. Also in 1959 Heinz Riedt, also under close supervision by Levi, translated it into German. As one of Levi's primary reasons for writing the book was to get the German people to realise what had been done in their name, and to accept at least partial responsibility, this translation was perhaps the most significant to him.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>This</b> paper <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{reflexive}} {{analysis of}} the process of making the short experimental film entitled <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> city, which forms part of the practical component of the Masters in Film and Television. The formal, conceptual and aesthetic choices offered in the {{analysis of the}} film aim to explore alternative possibilities of analyzing representations of Joburg. I have positioned my filmic practice as one of the multi entry points to epistemologies that are concerned with the representation of Joburg discursively. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> city <b>is</b> <b>an</b> audio visual enquiry framed around theoretical concerns articulated in the literature about the critical interrogation of urban spaces in general, and Joburg in particular. The film operates as an evaluation of the prevailing theoretical body of work by accentuating the disparities between the theoretical frameworks and the everyday spatial practices of experiencing the city...|$|R

25|$|On 21 January 1946 {{he started}} work at DUCO, a Du Pont Company paint factory outside Turin. Because of the {{extremely}} limited train service, Levi {{stayed in the}} factory dormitory during the week. This gave {{him the opportunity to}} write undisturbed. He started to write the first draft of <b>If</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> Man. Every day he scribbled notes on train tickets and scraps of paper as memories came to him. At the end of February, he had ten pages detailing the last ten days between the German evacuation and the arrival of the Red Army. For the next ten months, the book took shape in his dormitory as he typed up his recollections each night.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> crocodile, {{as it is for}} the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E
