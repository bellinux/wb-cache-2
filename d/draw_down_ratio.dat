40|$|The {{production}} of fine filaments using the melt spinning process needs considerable effort. A thermoplastic melt is stretched from the spinneret under a constant take-up speed. The high performance thermoplastic PEEK is solidified in the melt spinning {{process in a}} small distance and short time. Therefore, the fine PEEK filaments in the fibre formation zone underwent a high deformation and cooling rate. To make the melt spinning process stable and to produce the fine PEEK filaments, material properties and material behaviour are examined using on-line and off-line measurements. The fibre speed measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry and simultaneous temperature measured using infrared thermography enable both the strain rate and consequently the apparent extensional viscosity to be estimated. This provides the apparent extensional viscosity over the spinning line, which can itself show the structural development of PEEK fibres in the fibre formation zone, i. e. necking and solidification phenomena. The one-dimensional fibre formation model must include both procedural and material parameters. The heat transfer coefficient was estimated using the filament temperature measurement and showed a relatively high contribution of radiation and free convection in comparison to forced convection near the spinneret. The improved model of PEEK fibre formation gave a good agreement to both temperature and speed measurements, and also confirmed the high deformation rate effect on the extensional viscosity, which could be simulated with a properly generalised Newtonian constitutive equation. The end properties of the fibres, such as as-spun filament fineness, orientation (expressed using total birefringence) and total crystallisation (examined using DSC) are investigated in relation to different spinning conditions, i. e. take-up speed, throughput and the <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> <b>ratio.</b> The tensile test diagram results, measuring phenomena such as the elongation at break, tenacity, and the Young modulus of elasticity are also analysed in order to complete the correlation of the above-mentioned spinning conditions to the structural properties of as-spun fine PEEK filaments. The melt spinning of fine PEEK fibres under different spinning conditions is examined {{with the purpose of}} finding the optimum take-up speed and throughputs. Other spinning conditions, such as the temperature of melt processing, and the arrangement and diameter of the spinneret holes, are changed {{in order to make the}} process more stable. The recommendations for further study can be used to further examine some aspects of this work; however, this work presents a new concept for fine PEEK melt spinning supported by spinnability examinations under different spinning conditions and the improved model of fibre formation, which is also relevant for typical industrial processing applications...|$|E
40|$|The high cost, narrow {{processing}} window, {{and poor}} mechanical properties of polyhydroxyalkanoates hamper their use as films for food packaging applications. We report the preparation, characterization, and film blowing of polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate (PHBV) /beer spent grain fibers (BSGF) composites. Beer spent grains are by-products {{of the beer}} industry submitted to an acid/caustic treatment and to successive grinding to achieve fibers with typical size of 30 microns. PHBV/BSGF compounds were extruded and successfully subjected to <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> <b>ratios</b> as high as 50. However, processability was lost for BSGF contents above 10 wt%, due to their percolation within the PHBV matrix. Two PHBV/BSGF compounds were processed into blown films. The resulting mechanical, structural, and barrier properties depend on processing parameters and BSGF content. The fully bio-sourced and compostable PHBV based thin films produced under processing conditions scalable to industrial production show gas and water vapor barrier properties attractive for food packaging applications...|$|R
40|$|The high cost, small {{processing}} {{window and}} poor mechanical properties of polyhydroxyalkanoates hamper {{their use in}} demanding packaging applications such as thin films. We report here on the compounding, processability and film blowing of polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate (PHBV) /beer spent grain (BSG) fibers composites. BSG are by-products from the beer industry and were submitted to an acid/caustic treatment followed by successive grinding processes to achieve BSG fibres with mean size {{of the order of}} 20 microns. BSG fibers were compounded with a commercial PHBV (ranging from 1 wt% to 20 wt%) aiming at reducing the final cost of the package and improving the low melt viscosity of PHBV, thus enhancing the processability of the resulting biocomposites. PHBV/BSG fibers compounds were produced using a twin-screw mini-extruder. Processability of the compounds was studied by adding a slit die (to shape the melt into films), a cooling bath and a haul off to the mini-extrusion line (Fig 1, C, D, E, B respectively). An optimum temperature profile was found for extruding the compound, but beyond 10 wt% BSG fibers, the melt could not be further processed as rheological data indicate that a three dimensional network builds up in the PHBV matrix. However, <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> <b>ratios</b> as much as 25 could be achieved. The outputs of the processability study are two formulations which were scaled up for the production of thin films (from 130 to 50 microns) using a lab-scale film blowing line (Fig. 2). Electronic microscopy reveals a poor adhesion between PHBV and BSG fibers. The mechanical, structural and barrier properties of blown films (summarized in Table 1) are discussed in light of the film processing parameters studied, namely the blown up ratio and the take up ratio.
