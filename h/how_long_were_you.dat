6000|$|OCTAVIUS. I think so. We {{came from}} Hyde Park Corner here in {{seventeen}} minutes. [The Chauffeur, furious, kicks {{the car with}} a groan of vexation]. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... [She {{backs away}} {{and sits down}} in the swing. She is just [...] seventeen, light and slim, brown-haired, fresh-coloured, and [...] grey-eyed; her white frock reaches to her ankles, she wears a [...] sunbonnet.] Peachey, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> Mother's governess.|$|E
6000|$|... "So would I. It's rather important," [...] said Jim. [...] "If he {{was hanging}} about and {{came for the}} thing {{as soon as the}} car took the ditch, he {{probably}} saw me under the wheel and meant to leave me there. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> in making the spot after you heard the smash?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind Blanche. Blanche is not business. They both {{begin with}} a B--and that's the only {{connection}} between them. I hear you have {{got one of the}} finest houses in this part of Scotland. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay in Scotland? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay in it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Are you freaking kidding me? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to}} <b>be</b> an apologist for brutal barbarians? Islam is bariariansic medievalism! Wake the f... up! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is rather a {{difficult}} question--one, in fact, that we should gain nothing by going into. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to command the Shasta?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!' she exclaimed. 'Well! {{there is}} a talk about you at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he'd lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure? And <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But you're not so thin--you've not been so poorly, have you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Kennedy," [...] he {{said from}} the depths of his ulster, the collar of which he had turned up over his ears with a {{prudence}} which Kennedy, having come out with only a blazer on over his football clothes, distinctly envied, [...] "I hope your men {{are not going to be}} late. I don't think I ever saw a worse day for football. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> thinking of playing? Two twenty-fives would be enough for a day like this, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|L. And besides, Miss Dora, if {{young ladies}} {{really do not}} want to be seen, they should take care not to let their eyes flash when they dislike what people say: and, more than that, it is all {{nonsense}} from beginning to end, about not wanting to be seen. I don't know any more tiresome flower in the borders than your especially [...] "modest" [...] snowdrop; which one always has to stoop down and take all sorts of tiresome trouble with, and nearly break its poor little head off, before you can see it; and then, half of it is not worth seeing. Girls should be like daisies, nice and white, with an edge of red, if you look close, making the ground bright wherever they are, knowing simply and quietly that they do it, and are meant to do it and that it would be very wrong if they didn't do it. Not want to be seen, indeed! <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> in doing up your back hair, this afternoon Jessie? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, <b>you!</b> <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to}} snooze?" [...] demanded the small youth. [...] "I've been {{ready for an}} hour. Don't {{you know that this}} is the all-important day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, George, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to}} travel in this way?--not long or far, I hope. It's well carried on, but too bold. And this black fellow,--who is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you remember?" [...] {{he said to}} her. [...] "I've {{talked to}} you about him often." [...] And then to me: [...] "But why didn't you let me know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> coming? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> here? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay? Why didn't you come an hour earlier, {{and we would have}} dined together?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, ladies! <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> goin' to <b>be</b> titivatin' yourselves? There ain't {{no company}} comin'. The {{sausages}} {{are on the}} table, and the old 'ooman's gittin' so impatient that she's beginnin' to abuse the cat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, Miss Wetherell?" [...] {{cried the}} young man joyously, while still ten feet away, [...] "I'm awfully glad to see you, upon my word; I <b>am.</b> <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to <b>be</b> in Washington?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tip-top. Glad it's you. Thought Archie {{might have}} turned up again, and he's no fun. Where did you come from? What did <b>you</b> come for? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay? Want a bit? It's jolly good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it really}} is but a shadowy supposition; for {{unfortunately}} I am going to live. I feel myself getting better. Thomasin, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going {{to stay at the}} inn, now that all this money has come to your husband?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{said the}} other dryly. [...] "He does it every time, but the devil himself wouldn't squeeze ten cents out of Harry if he didn't {{want to give it}} him. But <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to <b>be</b> {{stripping}} that fowl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, gentlemen,' {{says the}} cigar man, 'I don't {{blame you for}} not wanting to play. I've {{forgotten}} the fine points of the game, I guess, it's <b>been</b> so <b>long</b> since I indulged. Now, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> gentlemen {{going to be in}} the city?' ...|$|R
6000|$|As we were talking, a knock came to {{the studio}} door, and that summons was {{followed}} by the entrance of the maid, who said to Clive, [...] "If you please, sir, Mrs. Mackenzie says, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> a-going to keep the dinner waiting?" ...|$|R
40|$|Imported {{diseases}} are classified according to risk of exposure, gravity, and prophylaxis. An algorithm is suggested which produces specific suggestions for prevention {{on the basis}} of the answers to three questions: 1) where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going?, 2) <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> staying there? and 3) what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing there...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Carlton," [...] {{she told}} the man, as he {{arranged}} the rugs. [...] "And now," [...] she added, turning to John, [...] "why have you come to London? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to do? And--most important of all--in what spirit have you come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to see clear through all this though," [...] muttered Carter again. [...] "And for <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> leaving us, Captain?" [...] Lingard made no answer. Carter waited awhile. [...] "Come, sir," [...] he urged. [...] "I ought to have some notion. What is it? Two, three days?" [...] Lingard started.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do entirely as {{you think}} best, Cuthbert. Of course, beyond the fact that perhaps {{something}} wrong may have been done, I have not an idea what it can be, and I {{do not want to}} know, unless it must <b>be</b> told me. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> likely to <b>be</b> away and do <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> fit to travel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUDGEON (raising her voice). Let her hear me. People {{who fear}} God don't fear {{to give the}} devil's work its right name. (Christy, soullessly {{indifferent}} to the strife of Good and Evil, stares at the fire, warming himself.) Well, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stare there like a stuck pig? What news have you for me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing down here, Fred?' I said. 'Is this {{caretaker}} your father? Have {{you seen}} the rabbits in the wood? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stop? How's mother? I like the country. Have you {{come all the way}} from the public-house? I'm living here now. Your father gave five shillings for me. That's twice as much as I was worth when I saw you last.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It is a longish story,” Will replied, “too long to tell {{straight}} off. Besides, I want to {{ask some}} questions. When did you come home? Have you come for good? If not, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay? though I am sorry {{to say that the}} length of your visit can affect me comparatively little, for I am appointed second-lieutenant of the Jason, and must join in a few days.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The natives are past {{astonishing}} now," [...] remarked Benjy; [...] "nothing {{short of}} a ten thousand jar battery would astonish Chingatok, and I'm quite sure that you couldn't rouse a sentiment of surprise in Oolichuk, unless you made him swallow a dynamite cartridge, and blew him inside out. But, I say, daddy, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to keep us {{in the dark about}} your plans? Don't you see that we are in agonies of suspense?" ...|$|R

6000|$|KNOX. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> more <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to}} keep me waiting, Amelia? Do you think I'm made of iron? Whats the girl done? What {{are we going to}} do? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what a deal I {{shall have}} to say to you!" [...] she went on. [...] "You'll upset all my other plans. But, Mary, my dear, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to stay here? I go--let me see--I forget when, but it's all put down in a book upstairs. But the next stage is at Mrs. Proudie's. I shan't meet you there, I suppose. And now, Frank, how's the governor?" [...] The gentleman called Frank {{declared}} that the governor was all right--"mad about the hounds, of course, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|If I have <b>been</b> <b>long</b> silent, think <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so and blush, sir, blush.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't <b>you</b> see? Say, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to}} stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times--they don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've got a dog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, {{and all that kind}} of foolishness? You bet I don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. Are you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] he cried. [...] "Why, this is gay. Who {{would ever}} have thought of a {{domestic}} couple like you going on such a lark as this. We just heard about it from old John, and we came down to see what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> up to. You've got everything very nice. I think I'd like this myself. Why, {{you might have a}} rifle-range out here. You could cut down those bushes {{on the other side of}} the creek, and put up your target over there on that hill. Then you could lie down here on the grass and bang away all day. If you'll do that, I'll come down and practice with <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to keep it up?" ...|$|R
