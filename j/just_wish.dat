[...] Similarly, Jessica Winter of The Village Voice criticized the film for [...] "playing as a standard summer action film", despite being released in early November. Her review, titled as [...] "Full Metal Racket," [...] noted that The Incredibles [...] "announces the studio's arrival in the vast yet overcrowded Hollywood lot of eardrum-bashing, metal-crunching action sludge." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Diver of BBC Online {{reviewed}} the show positively and said, [...] "this {{is an entirely}} second-guessable affair, each movement telegraphed and every realigned arrangement (bombast turned down, jazz and funk switched up) meeting the listener's expectations head on." [...] The writer of People magazine described the show as a [...] "magic". Nate Chinen of The New York Times positively noted that I Am... Yours documents a smaller show than the other ones Beyoncé usually makes. A less favorable review came from Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. She writes, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> this special had the balls to call itself 'I Am…Mine' and admit that among the many things we admire about Beyonce is that she's not ours. In fact the opposite's true. We're hers".|$|E

She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get out of, you can't <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> it away—it just disappears when it's had enough. It’s completely independent of whether I’m happy or blue, up or down. It tends to lift as soon as I stop fixating on it—I remember thinking my house was the problem, and I'd {{need to go to}} France in order to write, and I would have been scared without Rex [...] I got through it. You can't chase the muse, or you'll scare it away.|$|E

500|$|In 1945, when he {{was back}} in Montgomery, Williams started to perform again for radio station WSFA. He wrote songs weekly to perform during the shows. As a result of the new variety of his repertoire, Williams {{published}} his first song book, Original Songs of Hank Williams. The book only listed lyrics, since its main purpose was to attract more audience. It included ten songs: [...] "Mother Is Gone", [...] "Won't You Please Come Back", [...] "My Darling Baby Girl" [...] (with Audrey Sheppard), [...] "Grandad's Musket", [...] "I <b>Just</b> <b>Wish</b> I Could Forget", [...] "Let's Turn Back the Years", [...] "Honkey-Tonkey", [...] "I Loved No One But You", [...] "A Tramp on the Street", and [...] "You'll Love Me Again".

Known as a devastating blocker and [...] "lightning fast," [...] he was the first Commodore football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. At his induction Bomar said, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> all the men who played with me at Vanderbilt between 1921 and 1924 could also receive this coveted award. They deserve it more than I do. After all, they made it possible for me to be chosen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{focal point}} of reviewers' {{criticism}} was Dead Head Fred's gameplay, specifically the combat. [...] It was generally considered tedious and repetitive. [...] Australia's PAL Gaming Network described the combat as [...] "one of the poorest elements of the game", and Game Informer called the combat mechanics [...] "awful". [...] The performance of the camera was also criticized, with IGN noting [...] "Considering that the camera will sometimes choose some horrible angles for you in battle or during puzzles, it's annoying to have to fight {{it as well as}} mutants that want you dead." [...] GameZone said [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> the camera wouldn’t be such a hindrance sometimes." [...] Reviewers were also unhappy with Dead Head Fred's loading times; Eurogamer considered them [...] "excessively high", and IGN said [...] "The only downside that crops up {{when it comes to the}} visuals are the continual loading times on just about every single area." ...|$|E

500|$|Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict {{gave the}} episode a grade of A+ and commented that it {{features}} {{one of the}} best musical numbers in the show's [...] "history of great musical numbers". Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the best episode of the season, and added: [...] "I don’t know what it is about this episode — the 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?' song number; James Woods filling in for Apu at the store; or Homer’s wise line 'I’ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> Flanders was dead' — but the entire affair is inspired. [...] It’s in the little details that make this episode the year’s best, and solidifies The Simpsons as the funniest sitcom of all time." [...] AskMen.com ranked [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] as number six on their list of the top ten The Simpsons episodes. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5.|$|E

[...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by.

500|$|Reflecting on {{the film}} a decade after it came out, critic Danny Peary said he found Duvall's {{restrained}} portrayal [...] "extremely irritating" [...] and criticized the entire cast, save for Buckley, for their [...] "subdued, emotions-in-check, phony 'honest' performances. You <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> the whole lot of them would start tickling each other." [...] In his book Alternate Oscars, listing his personal opinions of who should have won the Academy Awards each year, Peary excluded Tender Mercies from all the categories, and chose Michael Caine as deserving of the Best Actor honor for Educating Rita. In June 2009, critic Roger Ebert included Tender Mercies in The Great Movies, his series of reviews celebrating what he considers the most important films of all time. He praised what he called one of Duvall's most understated performances, as well as Foote's minimalist storytelling and the restraint and patience of Beresford's direction. Ebert said of Foote's screenplay, [...] "The down-to-earth quality of his characters drew attention away from his minimalist storytelling; all the frills were stripped away.... Rarely does a movie elaborate less and explain more than Tender Mercies." ...|$|E

500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I wish I had never gone through with it...

500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy {{supported}} the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, {{from the start}} of the campaign. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. [...] In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff John H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963, and said [...] "Emotionally, I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> my brother could have seen it." ...|$|E
