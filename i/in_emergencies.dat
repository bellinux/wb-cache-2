40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a state of}} the art of path choice and traffic {{assignment}} models <b>in</b> road <b>emergency</b> conditions is reported. The approaches proposed in literature are classified, distinguishing two approaches for path choice and three approaches for traffic assignment (static, pseudo dynamic and dynamic). In literature, several applications of models <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions are available: at the beginning models specified in ordinary conditions were applied <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions. Afterwards, a first generation of models specified <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions was proposed. After 9 / 11 and Katrina Hurricane a second generation of emergency conditions models was specified. Evolution of models applied <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions is presented in this paper: first, models in ordinary conditions are treated; second, models <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions are treated. In the last ten years several applications of models <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions have been carried out.

40|$|The {{past three}} years have {{witnessed}} unprecedented growth of user-generated volunteered geographic information (VGI) on the Web. Although scholars, decision makers, and citizens have recognized the potential value of VGI <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> management, there exists no rigorous study on the availability, quality, and feasibility of VGI for applications related to emergency management. This dissertation applies methodologies of GIScience and computer science to present an overview of VGI and explore its value <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> management {{with the goal of}} developing a wiki GIS approach for community emergency preparedness. This dissertation research concludes that VGI and wiki GIS represent new development in public participation in the production and use of geographic information. <b>In</b> <b>emergency</b> management, VGI and wiki GIS suggest a new approach to incorporate the general public <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> response activities. By incorporating VGI <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> management, official agencies and the general public gain better situational awareness <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> management...|$|R

5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E
5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. <b>In</b> <b>emergencies,</b> the mortar could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E

The incidence of oesophageal intubation was reported at 6 % to 16 % <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> conditions [2, 3]. Thus, <b>emergency</b> airway efforts <b>in</b> the <b>emergency</b> department (ED) must concentrate on early detection of unintentional oesophageal intubation.|$|R

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is in character, meaning they are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, meaning they are being themselves.

In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting in character unless otherwise noted, which {{is the opposite of}} normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character knowledge is usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know may be viewed as cheating.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate, {{it appears}} that most recruits, both legionary and auxiliary, were volunteers (voluntarii). Compulsory {{conscription}} (dilectus) was never wholly abandoned, but was generally only used <b>in</b> <b>emergencies</b> or before major campaigns when large numbers of additional troops were required. In marked contrast, the late army relied mainly on compulsion for its recruitment of Roman citizens. Firstly, the sons of serving soldiers or veterans were {{required by law to}} enlist. Secondly, a regular annual levy was held based on the indictio (land tax assessment). Depending on the amount of land tax due on his estates, a landowner (or group of landowners) would be required to provide a commensurate number of recruits to the army. Naturally, landowners had a strong incentive to keep their best young men to work on their estates, sending the less fit or reliable for military service. There is also evidence that they tried to cheat the draft by offering the sons of soldiers (who were liable to serve anyway) and vagrants (vagi) to fulfil their quota.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{primary concern}} was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were {{required}} to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged {{for the next three}} weeks. To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except <b>in</b> <b>emergencies.</b> For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Nursing work <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> {{departments}} is {{tangled with}} unbearable hardship and high working pressure {{as well as}} an increased risk of occupational injuries. Needle stick injury is among such risks. Incidence of these injuries differs in different hospital wards. This study aimed to determine needle stick injury risks <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> ward <b>in</b> comparison with other wards of Qazvin hospitals in 2010. Materials and Methods: This historical cohort study was done on nursing staff working in Qazvin hospitals. Statistical population included nursing staffs at Qazvin hospitals who were responsible for direct patient care. From among nurses working <b>in</b> the <b>emergency</b> wards, 52 were selected. Control group consisted of 258 nurses who had worked in other wards of the same hospitals. The research instrument was a self-administered questionnaire. To determine validity and reliability of the Instrument, content validity and test-retest were performed. The collected data was analyzed using Independent t test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-Square, Fisher Exact Test, and Logistic Regression through SPSS (version 16) at 0. 05. Results: Risk of injury <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> ward was three times more than other wards (p< 0. 01). The average numbers of beds <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> wards and <b>in</b> other wards were 24. 2 ±. 6. 7 and 18. 1 ± 10. 7 respectively. Nonetheless, number of nurses on different shifts <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> wards, especially <b>in</b> the evening shift, was significantly lower (p< 0. 05). However, according to logistic regression analysis, the work <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> ward was an independent risk factor for needle stick injuries (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The risk of needle stick injuries among nurses <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> wards is dramatically higher than other wards. It seems that more beds per nurse affects this increased risk. It is proposed that the number of nurses <b>in</b> <b>emergency</b> departments be increased, especially in the evening shift so that the risk of this serious injury may be reduced...|$|R

5|$|However, {{conscription}} was not {{in practice}} universal. Firstly, a land-based levy meant recruits were exclusively the sons of peasants, as opposed to townspeople. Thus some 20% of the empire's population was excluded. In addition, as during the Principate, slaves were not admissible. Nor were freedmen and persons in certain occupations such as bakers and innkeepers. In addition, provincial officials and curiales (city council members) could not enlist. These rules were relaxed only <b>in</b> <b>emergencies,</b> as during the military crisis of 405–6 (Radagaisus' invasion of Italy and the great barbarian invasion of Gaul). Most importantly, the conscription requirement was often commuted into a cash levy, at a fixed rate per recruit due. This was done for certain provinces, in certain years, although the specific details are largely unknown. It appears from the very slim available evidence that conscription was not applied evenly across provinces but concentrated heavily in the army's traditional recruiting areas of Gaul (including the two Germaniae provinces along the Rhine) and the Danubian provinces, with other regions presumably often commuted. An analysis of the known origins of comitatenses in the period 350–476 shows that in the Western army, the Illyricum and Gaul dioceses together provided 52% of total recruits. Overall, the Danubian regions provided {{nearly half of the}} whole army's recruits, despite containing only three of the 12 dioceses. This picture is much in line with the 2nd-century position.|$|E

Trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to , and stop for about 20 seconds at each station. Automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafés, convenience stores and mobile recharge. Eating, drinking, smoking and chewing of gum are prohibited in the entire system. The Metro also has a sophisticated fire alarm system for advance warning <b>in</b> <b>emergencies,</b> and fire retardant material is used in trains {{as well as on}} the premises of stations.
