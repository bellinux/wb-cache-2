2500|$|An {{official}} {{close to}} the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was [...] "illusory", and described the MDC as merely a [...] "junior partner" [...] whose only role would be [...] "to gain legitimacy and international funds". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, <b>farming,</b> <b>information,</b> and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning {{part of the economy}} given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place so that would trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said [...] "It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless we now have the opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate." [...] A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said {{to be aware of the}} risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, [...] "It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government – in fact, a situation where we would be in but out of government." ...|$|E

Using frequency, cross tabulations and binary logit model in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18, the study made some findings. Grasscutter {{farmers in the}} study area are ageing. They operate on small scale with males dominating the enterprise. The generally literate farmers used production records mostly. Farmers’ use of <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> systems did not show positive association with obtaining credit from formal credit institutions. The use of books and loose sheets to keep records of farm operations is most popular with the farmers. Use of computers is least popular. Too much work, no reasons for non-use, and inadequate time at their disposal to spare some for recording were some of the reasons adduced for not using <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> systems. Age, level of education, farm size, and farmer status, membership of association, sex, experience and income were found to be independent of <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> systems use. Government and non-governmental organisations must encourage young persons especially females to engage in the enterprise. An investigation into the causes of low farm size will unearth the causes and as such provide ways to increase farm size as most of the farmers are into full time grasscutter rearing. Members of grasscutter farmers association need to step up their membership drive to recruit more farmers into the association as associations are better to relate to and reach with extension effort...|$|R

Knowledge to develop this model and a proof of concept is obtained by case study research focusing on the collaborative Business Processes of spraying and crop protection of potatoes against late blight disease. need to collaborate with numerous actors that are part of Agri-Food Supply Chain Networks (AFSCNs) such as governments, advisory services, contractors, processors, input providers and certification bodies. This collaboration is required to produce food in a more sustainable, safe and transparent manner. To collaborate efficiently and effectively, information needs to be shared within collaborative Business Processes. The information sharing within such collaborative Business Processes should be supported by an ICT infrastructure consisting of interoperable ICT Components. Currently, most of the available ICT Components are not interoperable, hindering data exchange between ICT Components of various vendors. Consequently, this situation is hindering optimization of farm production processes and collaboration in AFSCNs. Therefore, a platform, called FIspace, is being established for multiple domains that support the development and configuration of interoperable ICT Components into a system that is able to support collaborative farm Business Processes. To develop interoperable ICT Components and configure these in an easy and flexible manner to support farm enterprises, a <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> model is, amongst other models, required. The presented <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> reference model is able to describe the relations between a farm enterprise and its collaborators, the Business Processes related to the supporting ICT Components and the data messages for data exchange between ICT Components...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} an {{approach}} to spatially allocate <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> to a specific environmental context is presented. At this moment the European wide <b>farm</b> <b>information</b> is only available at a rather aggregated administrative level. The suggested allocation approach adds a spatial dimension to all sample farms {{making it possible to}} aggregate farm types both to natural and to lower scale administrative regions. This spatial flexibility allows providing input data to economic or bio-physical models at their desired resolution. The allocation approach is implemented as a constrained optimization model searching for an optimal match between farm attributes and spatial characteristics subject to consistency constraints. The objective functions are derived from a Bayesian highest posterior density framework. The allocation procedure recovers the spatial farm type distributions satisfactorilly thereby providing information of significant value for further analysis in a multidisciplinary context...|$|R

50|$|Another {{motivation}} for reform {{is the desire}} to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the 20th century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns {{in such areas as}} health, wealth and well-being. For example, in Kerala, India in the 1950s, increases in women's health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In Iran, increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific <b>farming</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
