40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} {{discussion of the}} connections between environmental and human security through the notion of <b>environmental</b> <b>refugees.</b> The concept of <b>environmental</b> <b>refugees</b> appeared in a 1985 paper that argued while the term may be legitimate, such a category of refugees would constitute a minor part of the world’s refugee population, if at all. Later discussions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Norman Meyer contradict this position with estimates of up to 200 million <b>environmental</b> <b>refugees</b> by 2050. These latter predictions are currently endorsed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working {{in the areas of}} <b>refugees</b> and global <b>environmental</b> issues. Of particular interest has been Friends of the Earth’s Climate Justice campaign, and Rising Tide International’s Climate Justice Network. These NGOs and others argue that this humanitarian impact of global climate change presents significant issues for the Asia Pacific region. <b>Environmental</b> <b>refugees</b> are estimated to flow in the millions in Australia’s neighbourhood as a result of global warming. However, <b>environmental</b> <b>refugees</b> do not appear in the 1951 Refugee Convention, which conceives of refugees mainly in terms of political and social rights, particularly as expressed in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Thus, while NGOs present a convincing case for the legitimacy of the rights of <b>environmental</b> <b>refugees,</b> international law does not recognise their plight.

40|$|T he <b>environmental</b> <b>refugee</b> has {{appeared}} in the literature on environment and security, and with it the refugee as both a cause and victim of conflict. Some fear environmental degradation will produce "waves of environmental refugees that spill across borders with destabilizing effects" on both domestic order and international stability (Homer-Dixon 1991 : 77). Others focus on Africa, as the presumably most vulnerable area, arguing that deepening desertification already has displaced millions of people and generated acute as well as long-term structural conflict (Hjort af Omas and Salih 1989, Bennett 1991). This paper attempts to systematize the links between environmental degradation, migration and social conflict that are present in the literature. The starting point is one of skepticism towards the catastrophic notion that environmental degradation will generate massive population displacement which in turn will ignite social conflict. Conflict is obviously not a necessary consequence of migration; nor is it clear that environmental degradation by itself is a magor cause of population movements. To determine under wha...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} and population migration is becoming growing {{concern to the}} international community. An increasing number of environments around the globe are suffering from deterioration and {{an increasing number of}} individuals survive in an environment which can barely support life. As environmental degradation continue, many will have to migrate to a new location. Some will move within their own countries. Others will cross international borders. Those who have the means might leave at an early stage of environmental deterioration. Many, often women and children, will wait until the last possible moment to leave their homes and will feel a sense of desperation {{similar to that of the}} millions of refugees around the world today who flee political and social unrest.

40|$|Currently {{there are}} {{approximately}} 25 million people displaced by environmental conditions, including resource scarcity, natural hazards and ecosystem degradation. By 2050, as many as 200 million people are predicted to be forced from their homes by changing environmental conditions brought about or exacerbated by climate change. Yet despite the scale of this problem, there is no international policy on their status. This thesis aims, first, to investigate some of the challenges to devising international political {{solutions to the problem}} and second, investigate these challenges empirically by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the United Nations' current approach to the problem. Drawing on political ecology, the thesis analyses debates and approaches to the problem of environmental displacement. Part 1 of the thesis investigates academic debates, particularly within International Relations. Part 2 provides a critical evaluation of how the United Nations approaches environmental displacement. Although its main agency responsible for refugees does not recognise environmentally displaced people as refugees there are nevertheless a number of United Nations' bodies concerned with this growing problem. The study argues that the United Nations' main approach, namely sustainable development, has serious limitations because it does not recognise the underlying socio-political causes of environmental displacement, including how the distribution of resources and the socio-environmental costs and benefits of development drive this phenomenon. The thesis concludes that as environmental displacement is likely to increase in the near future, a supplemental category of <b>environmental</b> <b>refugee</b> that recognises these socio-political causes is an important step to establishing coherent international responses to the problem. In this regard, and despite the political difficulties of states accepting a new refugee category, the United Nations can nevertheless play a constructive role in promoting dialogue and establishing a formal operational framework for action on environmental displacement in the international system...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the importance of the environment as a driver of North-South migration in Ghana. Almost one in every five people born in northern Ghana is living in southern Ghana. Interviews with 203 migrant farmers suggest that migration from the North to the South is, to a large extent, environmentally induced. Many Northerners decided to migrate because of poor agro-ecological conditions at home combined with easy access to fertile lands in the more humid destination area. The interviews with migrant farmers yielded several insights that are relevant for the <b>environmental</b> <b>refugee</b> debate. Firstly, environmental pull appears to be at least as important as environmental push. Secondly, scarcity of fertile land was mentioned much more often as a reason to migrate than climate change or erratic rainfall. Thirdly, none of the respondents ascribed the migration decision to sudden-onset environmental stress. If the environment is indeed an important driver of migration, one would expect migration rates to be higher in places with and times of more severe scarcity. A cross-sectional analysis of migration propensities and natural resources scarcity confirms that out-migration rates are significantly higher in poorly endowed districts. A longitudinal analysis of migration and rainfall shows that the period of worst environmental stress [...] during the Sahelian droughts of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s [...] was a time of reduced out-migration from northern Ghana. In this period of northern Ghana’s migration history, economic and political factors weighed heavier than environmental factors. The picture that emerges for northern Ghana is not one of distress migration in the face of environmental disaster but rather of migration as a way of dealing with structural environmental scarcity...|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} climate change are likely to affect the lives of {{millions}} of people around the globe. With the predicted dangers {{of climate change}} displacement, the existing international legal framework and its laws and institutions do not adequately address the emerging crisis. There is no legally binding mechanism of protection or support for persons displaced due to environmental reasons. Even no internationally accepted term exists to date to define this category of people. While some scholars and international organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (“UNEP”), refer to the terms such as <b>environmental</b> <b>refugee</b> and climate change refugee, such groups have no legal basis in international refugee law. There is consensus among concerned intergovernmental agencies not to use these terms following the strong position of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“UNHCR”) and the International Organization for Migration (“IOM”). Instead they suggest terms such as “environmental migrants”, “climate change migrants” or “environmentally displaced persons” as alternatives. Thus disagreements surround the conceptualization of the issue. However, it is important from a legal perspective, because the development of law and policy framework depends on how the issue of climate change displacement is characterized. It has significant governance implications as well as implications for determining the nature and extent of procedural, thematic and institutional frameworks. In this context, this article provides an overview of definitions to describe existing environmental or climate change refugees to show the diversity of opinions regarding the climate change displaced persons. It addresses the lack of consensus among scholars on definitional issues relating to climate change-induced displacement. Based on these analyses, it proposes a working definition of climate change displaced persons to articulate the issue. 52 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} intersections of militarism, climate change, and environmental justice in U. S. literature {{and popular culture}} {{since the end of}} the Cold War. The project identifies different mechanisms enacting environmental military violence through discursive analysis of literary and cultural texts, and considers the ideas, values, and beliefs that support environmental military violence. In each chapter I trace a different dynamic of environmental violence structured through the logics of U. S. counterinsurgency theory by examining what I call “narrative political ecologies”—cultural texts that center concerns of ecology and broadly defined political economy. Chapter I establishes the stakes and questions of the dissertation. The next two chapters investigate the dynamics of environmental violence depicted within narrative political ecologies. Chapter II investigates how eruptive interpersonal violence secures more insidious, hidden forms of slow environmental violence in Héctor Tobar’s The Tattooed Soldier. Chapter III considers the U. S. -Mexico Borderlands and the environmental military violence responsible for the deaths of undocumented migrants by examining Luis Alberto Urrea’s The Devil’s Highway and the Electronic Disturbance Theater’s Transborder Immigrant Tool. Chapter IV turns to potential f wars and conflicts that may be caused by climate change as they have been depicted in speculative fiction. In novels depicting climate migrants, such as Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (2014), I show that even politically progressive, intersectional approaches to environmental endangerment naturalize conflict and occlude dialogic solutions to environmental change. The final chapter traces how the <b>environmental</b> <b>refugee</b> has become a paradigmatic figure in climate change discourse, particularly the aspects of this discourse where issues of national security are articulated. At the center of these texts is the figure of the migrant and narratives of migrations, and I argue that the figure of the environmental migrant offers a privileged vantage on the constitutive forces of the Anthropocene. The dissertation identifies the specific literary and rhetorical techniques that authors use to contest environmental militarization and expand the U. S. public’s capacity to creatively and compassionately reason around increased flows of environmental migrants— issues of vital importance for humane climate change adaptation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis identifies, {{examines}} and problematizes {{some of the}} discourses {{that have}} so far come to light {{on the issue of}} protection for environmental refugees. By analyzing the discourses produced by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and two non-governmental organizations - the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) and Equity and Justice Working Group Bangladesh (EquityBD), I examine the struggling discourses that have emerged about how protection for environmental refugees has been interpreted. To do this, I rely on Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffes theory and method of discourse analysis. The results show that responsibilization is the main point of struggle in the discussions on the protection of environmental refugees. As a floating signifier, it was utilized by the discourses produced by the UNCHR and the selected NGOs in contingent ways and with different political objectives. The UNHCR discourse responsibilized both the environmental refugees for their own protection and the individual states. The EJF and EquityBD, by contrast, allocated responsibility for the protection of environmental refugees to the international community. These contingent understandings of responsibilization necessitated different justifications. While the EJF discourse relied on humanitarianism for the assistance of environmental refugees, the EquityBD discourse constructed a rights based, more permanent solution. The humanitarian based discourse of the EJF was found to be inextricably linked with the neoliberal discourse produced by the UNHCR. Both these discourses encouraged environmental refugees to stay in their homelands, undermining the politics of protection. Another way in which protection was undermined was by UNHCRs discourse on securitization. In this context, climate change induced displacement became threat to developed countries, the global economy and transnational classes. The struggling discourses about who/what has been allocated responsibility for the protection of environmental refugees also meant that identities of the displaced be constructed in specific ways. While the UNHCR discourse constructed as voluntary migrants and predators, the EJF and EquityBD discourses portrayed them as victims. However, even though the EJF discourse constructed them as victims, their reliance on humanitarianism could also be interpreted as a way of giving the <b>environmental</b> <b>refugee</b> a predator like identity. These discourses on responsibilization and identity formation clashed with each other in the aim of achieving a hegemonic position in discussions and debates about the protection of environmental refugees...|$|E
