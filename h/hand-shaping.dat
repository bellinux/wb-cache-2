40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new bimodal {{biometric}} system using feature-level fusion of hand shape and palm texture. The proposed combination is of significance since both the palmprint and <b>hand-shape</b> images are proposed to be {{extracted from the}} single hand image acquired from a digital camera. Several new <b>hand-shape</b> features {{that can be used}} to represent the hand shape and improve the performance are investigated. The new approach for palmprint recognition using discrete cosine transform coeffi-cients, which can be directly obtained from the camera hardware, is demonstrated. None of the prior work on <b>hand-shape</b> or palm-print recognition has given any attention on the critical issue of feature selection. Our experimental results demonstrate that while majority of palmprint or <b>hand-shape</b> features are useful in predicting the subjects identity, only a small subset of these features are necessary in practice for building an accurate model for identification. The comparison and combination of proposed features is evaluated on the diverse classification schemes; naive Bayes (normal, estimated, multinomial), decision trees (4 5, LMT),-NN, SVM, and FFN. Although more work remains to be done, our results to date indicate that the combination of se-lected <b>hand-shape</b> and palmprint features constitutes a promising addition to the biometrics-based personal recognition systems.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{recognizing}} <b>hand-shapes</b> by using multi-viewpoint image sets. The recognition of a <b>hand-shape</b> is a difficult problem, as appearance of the hand changes largely depending on viewpoint, illumination conditions and individual characteristics. To overcome this problem, we apply the Kernel Orthogonal Mutual Subspace Method (KOMSM) to shift-invariance features obtained from multi-viewpoint images of a hand. When applying KOMSM to hand recognition {{with a lot of}} learning images from each class, it is necessary to consider how to run the KOMSM with heavy computational cost due to the kernel trick technique. We propose a new method that can drastically reduce the computational cost of KOMSM by adopting centroids and the number of images belonging to the centroids, which are obtained by using k-means clustering. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluation experiments using multi-viewpoint image sets of 30 classes of <b>hand-shapes...</b>|$|R

The <b>hand-shape</b> is a popular biometric trait with a high convenience of use and non-intrusive acquisition. The proposed algorithm allows to generate realistic images with natural intra-person and inter-person variability. The method is based on the Active Shape Model algorithm which has been modified in order to add the biometric information typical of new synthetic identities. The generated images are evaluated using three public databases and two <b>hand-shape</b> recognition systems. The results show the suitability of the synthetic data for biometric recognition works. In addition, two novel applications have been proposed to provide new insights in <b>hand-shape</b> biometric recognition including: improvement of machine learning classification based on synthetic training sets and scalability analysis of <b>hand-shape</b> biometrics when the population of the database is increased by two orders of magnitude with respect to existing databases.

This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension, which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate {{their understanding of the}} sentence. Each participant was assigned a <b>hand-shape,</b> either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open <b>hand-shapes),</b> there were three different categories relating to hand-shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the <b>hand-shape</b> required to press the response-button was compatible with the <b>hand-shape</b> inferred by the sentence. ERP results provided evidence to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} custom surfboard-making as {{a distinctive}} cultural industry, drawing on archival and ethnographic work with eighteen surfboard workshops and their eighty-seven workers operating in four renowned surfing regions: O`ahu Hawai`i, southern California, Gold Coast and Illawarra regions, Australia. As a cultural industry, custom surfboard production is tightly linked to physical geography. Focused in coastal settings, board design {{is driven by}} the creativity of key individuals who seek to produce a faster, smoother and more responsive ride for surfers specific to prevailing waves and surf breaks. Unlike many other forms of commodity production, surfboard markers are not detached from their customers; instead makers depend on local surfing communities, providing a customised experience where the consumer meets with and even surfs alongside the craftsperson. Surfboards are thus central to surfing participation, sharing important cultural origins, stories and rituals. The production of surfboards is, however, in a state of flux. Since the 1950 s the international growth of surfing as an industry has been driven by convergence with other popular culture and media industries (TV, sport, tourism, fashion, film and music). This has given rise to transnational firms including Billabong and Quiksilver that package the surf in the form of equipment, clothing and fashion accessories. Such firms now dominate a multi-billion dollar industry with tentacles spreading into various other lifestyle and leisure pursuits. Against a background where consolidation of corporate power and offshore manufacturing have up-scaled surfboard production, I document how independent custom workshops survive in surf-friendly coastal regions. They do so through their use of two cultural production systems. The first enrols hand-based crafting methods and emphasises customisation. Here surfboards are made to suit local environmental conditions and individual surfers: customers pay high price for quality, hand-made and personalised products. This system relies on artisanal skills gained over years or even decades, and specialised, embodied knowledge, where artisans produce boards for consumers they know and will see riding them. Board-makers are iconic individuals within regional surf scenes, and take great pride in the practice of crafting tangible cultural products in this way, by hand. Yet this system of production is vulnerable to growing external competition from imported, mass produced boards. Hence independent workshops have increasingly turned to a second system: one that has speeded-up production following a computerised process that generates replicated boards for mass consumption. Relying on networks of surf retailers, sponsorship of professional surfers, and niche branding strategies, independent surfboard workshops can through automation make more boards than is possible through customisation, and thus potentially access wider markets for their products. While fifteen of the eighteen participating workshops have shifted production towards the use of mechanised technologies – to varying degrees – all but three maintain <b>hand-shaping</b> techniques, guarding hard-gained skills while lending cultural capital to their customised surfboards and brand identity. Their ageing makers – all of whom are men, the outcome of the highly gendered surfing subculture – consequently survive precariously in financial and logistical terms, the result of limited production capacity. Working hours and conditions have become erratic and irregular, rates of pay fluctuate across short temporal scales, skills development is informal and {{there is a lack of}} succession planning amongst an older generation of craftsman. Why hand-makers ultimately persist with uncertain, lowly paid and demanding jobs relates to the emotional transactions surrounding this form of cultural work. To understand meaning and value in this cultural industry I adapt the notion of an emotional terrain to expose the attachments and passions of surfboard-makers to their jobs. While uncovering deeply pleasurable pay-offs – surfboard shapers frequently described it as ‘soulful work’, making artful physical artefacts they saw being used locally, that linked to regional traditions, and in which they could take pride – there are equally significant unpleasurable experiences where workers are open to exploitation. Here discourses of ‘flexibility’ and ‘lifestyle work’ within surfing subculture mask more sinister conditions for labour. As surfboard production has shifted from labour-intensive to capital-intensive methods, automated production has become a flashpoint between workshop owners and their workers. The advent of automated production only increases the sense amongst these precarious workers that they make ‘soulful’ products using rare, inherited skills, valuable to surfing subculture beyond purely ‘economic’ considerations. I argue that for symbolic goods like surfboards, analysis can fruitfully combine political-economic considerations (competition, work place relations, labour markets, technological change) with greater sensitivity to local subcultural settings and the emotional transactions of cultural work. In the surfboard industry subcultural motivations powerfully drive design and production, and persistence with precarious forms of work. <b>Hand-shaping</b> survives only because of embodied and emotional connections to the work and to surfing subculture more generally...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} subtractive rapid manufacturing process for heterogeneous materials, in particular for custom shaped bone implants. Natural bone implants {{are widely used}} {{in the treatment of}} severe fractures or in tumor removal. In order for the human body to accept the bone implant material and heal properly, it is essential that the bone implant should be both mechanically and biologically compatible. Currently, the challenge of having correctly shaped natural bone implants created from an appropriate material is met through <b>hand-shaping</b> done by a surgeon. CNC-RP is a rapid machining method and software that can realize a fully automated Subtractive Rapid Prototyping (RP) process, using a 3 -axis milling machine with a 4 th axis indexer for multiple setup orientations. It is capable of creating accurate bone implants from different clinically relevant material including natural bone. However, there are major challenges that need to be overcome in order to implement automated shape machining of natural bones. They are summarized as follows: (1) Unlike homogeneous source materials for which a part can be machined from any arbitrary location within the original stock, for the case of donor bones, the site and orientation of implant harvest need to consider the nature of the heterogeneous internal bony architecture. (2) For the engineered materials, the source machining stock is in the convenient form of geometrically regular shapes such as cylinders or rectangular blocks and the entities of sacrificial supports can connect the part to the remaining stock material. However, irregularly-shaped bones and the heterogeneity of bone make the design of a fixture system for machining much more complicated. In this dissertation, two major areas of research are presented to overcome these challenges and enable automated process planning for a new rapid manufacturing technique for natural bone implants. Firstly, a new method for representing heterogeneous materials using nested STL shells is proposed. The nested shells model is called the Matryoshka mode, based in particular on the density distribution of human bone. The Matryoshka model is generated via an iterative process of thresholding the Hounsfield Unit (HU) data from a computed tomography (CT) scan, thereby delineating regions of progressively increasing bone density. Then a harvesting algorithm is developed to determine a suitable location to generate the bone implant from within the donor bone is presented. In this harvesting algorithm, a density score and similarity score are calculated to evaluate the overall effectiveness of that harvest site. In the second research area, an automated fixturing system is proposed for securing the bone implant during the machining process. The proposed method uses a variant of sacrificial supports (stainless surgical screws) to drill into appropriate locations and orientations through the free-form shaped donor bone, terminating at proper locations inside the solid part model of the implant. This automated fixturing system has been applied to machine several bone implants from surrogate bones to 3 D printed Matryoshka models. Finally, the algorithms that are developed for setup planning are implemented in a CAD/CAM software add-on called 2 ̆ 2 CNC-RPbio 2 ̆ 2. The results of this research could lead to a clinically relevant rapid machining process for custom shaped bone implants, which could create unique implants {{at the touch of a}} button. The implication of such high accuracy implants is that patients could benefit from more accurate reconstructions of trauma sites, with better fixation stability; leading to potentially shorter surgeries, less revisions, shorter recovery times and less likelihood of post-traumatic osteoarthritis, to name a few...|$|E

40|$|Multiple motor channel (MMC) {{theory of}} neocortical {{organization}} proposes that complex movements, such as {{reaching for a}} food item to eat, are produced by the coordinated action of separate neural channels. For example, the human reach-to-grasp act is mediated by two visuo-parieto-motor cortex channels, one for the reach {{and one for the}} grasp. The present analysis asked whether there is a similar organization of reach-and-grasp movements in the mouse. The reach-to-eat movements of the same mice were examined from high-shutter speed, frame-by-frame video analysis in three tasks in which the mice obtained equivalent success scores: when freely-moving reaching for food pellets, when head-fixed reaching for food pellets, and when head-fixed reaching for pieces of pasta. To reach, the mice used egocentric cues to vary upper arm movements in a task-appropriate manner to place an open hand on the food or to locate the food using a “touch-release-grasp” strategy. Although mice could not <b>hand-shape</b> offline when reaching, they could <b>hand-shape</b> using online touch-related cues from the mouth to manipulate the food at the mouth. That the reach can be performed offline in relation to egocentric cues whereas hand shaping for the grasp requires online cues supports the idea that for the mouse, as for primates, the reach and grasp are separate acts. The results are further discussed in relation {{to the use of the}} head-fixed behavioral procedure to identify the independent neural substrates of the reach and the grasp using mesoscale stimulation/imaging methods. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Behavioral {{studies have}} {{provided}} evidence for an action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE) that suggests a coupling of motor mechanisms and action-sentence comprehension. When both processes are concurrent, the action sentence primes the actual movement, and simultaneously, the action affects comprehension. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate brain markers of bidirectional impact of language comprehension and motor processes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand, or no manual action. Each participant was asked to press a button to indicate his/her understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a <b>hand-shape,</b> either closed or open, which had to be used to activate the button. There were two groups (depending on the assigned <b>hand-shape)</b> and three categories (compatible, incompatible and neutral) defined according to the compatibility between the response and the sentence. ACEs were found in both groups. Brain markers of semantic processing exhibited an N 400 -like component around the Cz electrode position. This component distinguishes between compatible and incompatible, with a greater negative deflection for incompatible. Motor response elicited a motor potential (MP) and a re-afferent potential (RAP), which are both enhanced in the compatible condition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present findings provide the first ACE cortical measurements of semantic processing and the motor response. N 400 -like effects suggest that incompatibility with motor processes interferes in sentence comprehension in a semantic fashion. Modulation of motor potentials (MP and RAP) revealed a multimodal semantic facilitation of the motor response. Both results provide neural evidence of an action-sentence bidirectional relationship. Our results suggest that ACE is not an epiphenomenal post-sentence comprehension process. In contrast, motor-language integration occurring during the verb onset supports a genuine and ongoing brain motor-language interaction...|$|R

The fusion of visual and shape cues is a very promising approach. The recent introduction of fast and inexpensive RGB-D sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect, allow to collect appearance and depth images. In this paper, we present a framework that recognizes the American Sign Language (ASL) Fingerspelling using RGB-D images. The proposed framework {{is based on the}} bag of features strategy combined with the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique in order to create models of the letters in the manual alphabet. It also uses the Binary Appearance and Shape Elements (BASE), a fast and low cost descripto...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel deep {{learning}} approach to solve simultaneous alignment and recognition problems (referred to as “Sequence-to-sequence” learning). We decompose the problem {{into a series}} of specialised expert systems referred to as SubUNets. The spatio-temporal relationships between these SubUNets are then modelled to solve the task, while remaining trainable end-to-end. The approach mimics human learning and educational techniques, and has a number of significant advantages. SubUNets allow us to inject domain-specific expert knowledge into the system regarding suitable intermediate representations. They also allow us to implicitly perform transfer learning between different interrelated tasks, which also allows us to exploit a wider range of more varied data sources. In our experiments we demonstrate that each of these properties serves to significantly improve the performance of the overarching recognition system, by better constraining the learning problem. The proposed techniques are demonstrated in the challenging domain of sign language recognition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on <b>hand-shape</b> recognition (outperforming previous techniques by more than 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a biometric measurement and sensing system {{is directly related to}} the performance generated from sensed data. This paper investigates a new approach to quantify the quality of sensed data from the user templates. The objective is to incorporate the quality of sensed data to generate a reliable estimate on the matching scores. The proposed method of extracting user quality is based on the confidence of generating reliable matching scores from the user templates. We simultaneously extract the palmprint and <b>hand-shape</b> images from the single hand image and ascertain the performance improvement for the individual trait. The experimental results from the proposed approach are also presented when the biometric measurements from the finger knuckles are employed. The experimental results presented in this paper show significant improvement in performance while incorporating the proposed method of user quality in the matching stages. The proposed user-quality-based fusion of the two biometric modalities also achieves promising improvement in performance. Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} problem of {{representations}} for anthropomorphic robot hands and their suitability for use in methods for learning or control. We approach hand configuration from the perspective of ultimate hand function and propose 2 parameterizations based on the ability of the hand to engage oppositional forces. These parameters can be extracted from grasp examples making them suitable for use in practical learning-from-demonstration frameworks. We propose a qualitative method to span hand functional space in a principled manner. This is used to construct a grasp set for evaluation and a qualitative baseline metric derived from human experience. Our results from human grasp data show that hand representations based on shape are not able to disambiguate hand-function. However, those based on hand-opposition primitives result in the widest separations among grasps that have radically different functions and can even clearly separate grasps whose functions overlap a great degree. We trust that these “functional parameterizations ” can bridge the contrasting goals of task-oriented robotic grasping, that of controlling a dexterous robot hand to manifest <b>hand-shape</b> but with the ability to exercise specific hand-function.

40|$|Device-free {{locators}} {{allow the}} user to interact with a system without the burden of being physically in contact with some input device or without being connected to the system with cables. This thesis presents a device-free locator that uses computer vision techniques to recognize and track the user's hand. The system described herein uses a video camera to capture live video images of the user, which are segmented and processed to extract features {{that can be used}} to locate the user's hand within the image. Two types of features, namely moment based invariants and Fourier descriptors, are compared experimentally. An important property of both these techniques is that they allow the recognition of <b>hand-shapes</b> regardless of affine transformation, e. g. rotation within the plane or scale changes. A neural network is used to classify the extracted features as belonging to one of several hand signals, which can be used in the locator system as 'button clicks' or mode indicators. The Siltrack system described herein illustrates that the above techniques can be implemented in real-time on standard hardware.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{detailed}} framework is presented for accurate real time gesture recognition. Our approach {{to develop a}} <b>hand-shape</b> classifier, trained using computer animation, along with its application in dynamic gesture recognition is described. The system developed operates in real time and provides accurate gesture recognition. It operates using a single low resolution camera and operates in Matlab on a conventional PC running Windows XP. The hand shape classifier outlined in this thesis uses transformation invariant subspaces created using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These subspaces are created from a large vocabulary created in a systematic maimer using computer animation. In recognising dynamic gestures we utilise both hand shape and hand position information; these are two o f the main features used by humans in distinguishing gestures. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are trained and employed to recognise this combination of hand shape and hand position features. During the course o f this thesis we have described in detail the inspiration and motivation behind our research and its possible applications. In this work our emphasis is on achieving a high speed system that works in real time with high accuracy...|$|R
