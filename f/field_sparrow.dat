We measured vegetation density, height and percent cover to determine if these site characteristics could be used to predict the presence/absence and abundance of these birds. Most of the birds we captured and/or resighted were in gravel pits (64. 3 %) and powerlines (38. 5 %).

40|$|I visit {{a lot of}} {{properties}} across the South each year. Without exception, there is one rec-ommendation I have given everyone—get rid of the tall fescue and/or bermudagrass. I have never made an initial property visit in the South (or Midwest or Northeast, for that matter) where I didn’t find one of these grasses. Few landowners realize that just by eradi-cating these grasses, they can enhance habitat for white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, <b>field</b> <b>sparrows,</b> indigo buntings, dickcissels, blue grosbeaks, yellow-breasted chats, American goldfinch, loggerhead shrikes, and many other species. And tall fescue and bermudagrass aren’t the only culprits. In my opinion (and in that of {{a whole lot of}} other biologists), you can add orchardgrass, timothy, bluegrass, john-songrass, crabgrass, goosegrass, bahiagrass, vaseygrass, velvetgrass, japangrass, and, cer-tainly, cogongrass. Why? None of these grass-es provide quality cover, forage, or seed for wildlife, none are native to North America, some are extremely invasive, and they all dis-place more desirable plants. Yes, I know deer may eat some of them at various times of the year, turkeys may eat bahiagrass seed, and quail and several other birds may eat crabgrass or johnsongrass seed. But why have a plant(s) that provides marginal cover, forage, or seed take up space where more desirable plants could grow?!? Make no mistake, you can increase the carrying capacity of your property for many wildlife species just by eradicating these grasses. Now, before you think I’m a native plant purist, let me explain. I do encourage people to promote native plants when possible and prac-tical, but I think foremost about landowner objectives and what would benefit wildlife. Thus, I’m also a proponent of food plots, for example, if they fit in with the landowner’s objectives. Of all the food plot plantings I might recommend, only a couple are native to North America.

Such expansion was coincident with not only a geographical expansion into suitable breeding habitats, but also a decrease in mean abundance across sites occupied during the winter surveys. Combined, these trends suggest that declining populations along the expansion front either stopped migrating or altered their autumn migration. The poleward expansion was not coincident with climatically induced decreases in peak metabolic energy demand, but it did track increases in ecosystem net primary productivity. After 1963, the species' lower lethal temperature prevented further poleward movement.

Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) nested primarily in CRP <b>fields,</b> and Grasshopper <b>Sparrow</b> (A. savannarum) in remnant prairies. Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) nested evenly across all three habitats. Daily nest survival rate for Eastern Meadowlark varied by nesting stage alone. Daily nest survival rate for Grasshopper Sparrow varied by nest vegetation and distance to the nearest woody edge; nest survival was higher near woody edges. In CRP fields, most predators were grassland-associated, primarily thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). In pastures, one-third of the nest predators were grassland-associated (primarily thirteen-lined ground squirrels) and 56...|$|R
40|$|July through September to {{less than}} 4 percent (Sedivec and Barker, 1997). Little {{bluestem}} has been used extensively in prairie restoration projects primarily because of its adaptation to a diversity of sites, drought tolerance, growth habit, and wildlife appeal. Erosion control: Little bluestem has moderate drought tolerance and broad adaptation to diverse sites. It can form mats from short rhizomes on wetter sites although this species is usually {{thought of as a}} bunchgrass (clumps) on dry, upland sites. It is deep-rooted, and somewhat slow to establish from seed. Wildlife: Little bluestem {{is one of the best}} grasses for nesting and roosting habitat. The clump type of growth habit and many fine leaves at the base provide excellent nesting sites. The seeds are consumed by small mammals and birds. Little bluestem seed is eaten by upland game birds. The seeds are of high value especially as a food source for birds that spend the winter on grasslands, such as prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse (Jones, 1963). Rosy finches and juncos, as well as chipping, <b>field,</b> and tree <b>sparrows</b> eat the seeds. Meadowlarks nest in areas where little bluestem grows. The dusky skipper butterfly caterpillars overwinter in tube tents above the base of the clumps (Knopf et al., 1997) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} how to {{conserve}} small and declining populations is currently receiving considerable attention in the ecological literature, particularly through the theoretical development of conservation biology and its application to endangered species conservation. This is true despite basic information on the natural history of most endangered species being very limited; not only for species that are very rare, elusive or living in remote areas, but also for species which occupy more accessible habitat (i. e. cultivated areas), such as the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora). In the research outlined in this thesis, field studies and molecular analyses were combined to establish the current population status, level of continued threat, contemporary connectivity among remnant populations and the genetic diversity of the endangered Java <b>sparrow.</b> <b>Field</b> work included intensive censuses at 6 sites across Central and East Java during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. To gain information about the current scale of trading and trafficking of Java sparrows, the numbers of birds for sale were surveyed at 7 bird markets, mostly situated close to the bird census sites. Further interviews with bird trappers established the level of trapping and distribution of trapping sites. DNA was extracted from both fresh whole blood (field samples) and tissue samples (museum specimens) and analysed using two different molecular marker systems – part one and two of the mtDNA control region and 5 independent nuclear microsatellite loci. MtDNA sequence data were used to infer phylogeography and historical demography of the Java sparrow, while, multi-locus microsatellite genotyping was used to assess contemporary connectivity and levels of genetic variation. In order to predict the future fate of the Java sparrow, a PVA and sensitivity analysis was also undertaken. Stochastic modelling was carried out using the program VORTEX. The results of this study highlight that remnant populations of Java sparrow in Central and East Java are currently small and highly fragmented. Based on roost counts at 6 sites, population estimates range from 5. 8 (± 0. 2 SE) to 125. 2 (± 1. 7 SE). The total estimated population for Central and East Java did not exceed 1000 individuals. If other regions of Indonesia within the species’ natural range have similar abundances, then the total Java sparrow population in Indonesia is likely to be {{at the lower end of}} the range of 2500 – 10, 000 individuals that is currently used to classify the species as ‘Vulnerable’. The major threat from trapping and trading is still ongoing at a high level, with an average 59. 3...|$|R
