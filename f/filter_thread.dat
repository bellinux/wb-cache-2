5000|$|... #Caption: [...] The revolutionary Nikon F, {{shown in}} black finish with standard, non-metering {{pentaprism}} and a 50mm f/1.4 7-element auto Nikkor lens attached. This and other auto Nikkor lenses standardized {{mostly on the}} 52mm front <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> while some other large lenses used a large 72mm filter thread-size.|$|E
50|$|A 28 mm f/2.8 shift lens with 67EW <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> and a {{lens shade}} with filter holder for 74R rimless filters and M92x1.00 filter ring. Many user-changeable mechanically-only mount modules {{available}} from Schneider Kreuznach. Also available as Leica PC-Super-Angulon R 28 mm f/2.8 with Leica R mount. Can be modified from a shift-only lens to a tilt-only lens by the German company.|$|E
50|$|Wratten {{filters are}} much used in {{observational}} astronomy by amateur astronomers. Color filters for visual observing made by GSO, Baader, Lumicon or {{other companies are}} actually Wratten filters mounted in standard 1¼″ or 2″ <b>filter</b> <b>threads.</b> For imaging interference filters are used. Wratten filters are also used in photomicrography.|$|R
5000|$|All lenses have {{internal}} electronic Seiko #1 shutters with {{a maximum}} 1/400 sec speed, PC-type X flash sync plug, T-switch for long exposures, a plug for standard remote cable release for B exposures, depth of field preview lever, distance scale, aperture adjust ring. In [...] "B" [...] mode, the RZ67 models will expose up to 30 seconds (a warning beep will sound for the last 10 seconds). In [...] "T" [...] mode, the camera can expose indefinitely without drawing power from the battery. Most lenses, except for the 37 mm, 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 77 mm <b>filter</b> <b>threads</b> {{on the front of}} the lens. The 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 105 mm <b>filter</b> <b>threads.</b> Some lenses have a floating element; focusing these lenses involves setting a subject distance ring on the lens after focusing with the bellows.|$|R
50|$|These had 55mm <b>filter</b> <b>threads</b> {{except where}} noted. Two new optical designs were {{introduced}} in the 55mm 1:1.7 and 135mm 1:3.5; the others were upgrades of the older Auto Rokkor lenses. The SR-T 101 retained compatibility with the earlier lenses with stop-down metering. A range of new MC lenses were introduced between 1966 and 1976, when they were superseded by the MD Rokkor line in 1977.|$|R
50|$|The lens was a fixed 25-50 mm f/4.5-16 manual focus zoom with macro {{focusing}} down to 11 in (280 mm). This gave a {{field of}} view range approximately equivalent to a 50-100 mm zoom lens on a 35 mm format camera. There was a built-in, pop out lens shade. The <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> diameter was 40.5 mm. Minolta sold UV, yellow and 1B filters.|$|E
50|$|Wide {{angle and}} {{telephoto}} lens adapters {{are available from}} Panasonic. The wide angle converter shoots at 0.7x magnification (24.5 mm) with f/2.8 brightness, while the telephoto adapter provides 1.7× magnification (714 mm) with f/3.7 aperture. Maximum optical zoom available when taking photos at 3MP is thus 32.47x (1137.5 mm). It is also possible to achieve greater limits of wide angle/macro and zoom capability with third-party lens converters, which can {{be attached to the}} standard 55 mm <b>filter</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid film advance lever. The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> size of 40.5mm.|$|E
50|$|Other {{advanced}} {{features of}} the 950 included shutter and aperture priority modes {{and the ability to}} custom-preset white balance. The 950 included a flash-sync socket for use with various Nikon external flash units (no shoe-mount was provided, however). As with all 9xx series, the lens movement during focusing and zooming was all internal, resulting in superior weather and dust resistance. The 950 shared with other 9xx series cameras the 28 mm <b>filter</b> <b>threads</b> and shared numerous Nikon and 3rd-party filters and diopter filters.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Filters</b> {{and other}} <b>threaded</b> lens {{accessories}} {{can be used}} with an adapter tube available from Canon or third party suppliers.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the threading of H. 264 decoder on the multithreaded SandBlaster DSP. We present an efficient way of partitioning computation intensive stages such as macroblock decoding, inter and intra prediction and deblocking <b>filter</b> across <b>threads.</b> We also describe features to multithread an application using the Sandblaster tools chain...|$|R
5000|$|The current EF 50mm 1.8 II lens has {{a plastic}} lens mount. The manual {{focusing}} ring {{has been replaced}} by a very small thin focusing ring on the front tip of the lens. However the lens does not suffer from rotating front lens element and can be used with polarizing filters. The optics for both lenses are identical, with 6 elements in 5 groups and a 5 blade diaphragm. Nevertheless, some photographers think the original EF 50mm 1.8 is slightly better [...] Both lenses have a 52mm <b>filter</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} SOM BERTHIOT 1:3.5 f=35 (mm) lens is {{used both}} under water and above {{due to the}} optical flat protecting front glass, but the lens has no <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> at the front. Two large aluminium knobs {{either side of the}} lens provides aperture and focusing controls. The special Calypso lens mount is of the bayonet variety with an O-ring sealing. The spring action of the O-ring locks the lens in place by two pins engaging in corresponding slots in the periphery of the lens mount. The lens release is accomplished by an outward pull and a quarter turn either way.|$|E
5000|$|In photography, a {{close-up}} filter, close-up lens or macro filter {{is a simple}} secondary lens used to enable macro photography without requiring a specialised primary lens. They work identically to reading glasses, allowing any primary lens to focus more closely. It is actually more appropriate to use the close-up lens terminology {{as it is a}} lens and not a filter, although close-up lenses typically mount on the <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> of the primary lens, and are manufactured and sold by suppliers of photographic filters. Some manufacturers refer to their close-up lenses as diopters, after the unit of measurement of their optical power.|$|E
50|$|Macro {{photography}} {{may also}} be accomplished by mounting a lens in reverse, {{in front of a}} normally mounted lens of greater focal length, using a macro coupler which screws into the front <b>filter</b> <b>threads</b> of both lenses. This method allows most cameras to maintain the full function of electronic and mechanical communication with the normally mounted lens, for features such as open-aperture metering. The magnification ratio is calculated by dividing the focal length of the normally mounted lens by the focal length of the reversed lens (e.g., when an 18 mm lens is reverse mounted on a 300 mm lens the reproduction ratio is 16:1). The use of automatic focus is not advisable if the first lens is not of the internal-focusing type, as the extra weight of the reverse-mounted lens could damage the autofocus mechanism. Working distance is significantly less than the first lens.|$|R
5000|$|Pentax 6×7 lenses {{feature the}} ability to accept both {{standard}} <b>threaded</b> <b>filters</b> and also Pentax bayonet filters that are available in standard and SMC versions to fit all diameters found on almost all lenses (except greater than 100mm) ...|$|R
50|$|On rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated, Straczynski {{regularly}} {{discussed with}} fans {{the process of}} creating and producing the show, the meaning of the work, and the development of the plot. He confirmed or denied fan theories and interpretations of the show, and answered questions - though often cryptically. In November 1995, Straczynski temporarily left the newsgroup due to an increasing number of flames, but returned in December when a process was put in place to <b>filter</b> the <b>threads</b> that reached him.|$|R
5000|$|Ordinary lenses can be {{used for}} macro {{photography}} by using a [...] "reversing ring." [...] This ring attaches to the <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> on the front of a lens and makes it possible to attach the lens in reverse. Excellent quality results up to 4x life-size magnification are possible. For cameras with all-electronic communications between the lens and the camera body specialty reversing rings are available which preserve these communications. When used with extension tubes or bellows, a highly versatile, true macro (greater than life size) system can be assembled. Since non-macro lenses are optimized for small reproduction ratios, reversing the lens allows it to be used for reciprocally high ratios.|$|E
50|$|The Centa Vision was {{the only}} 2× {{horizontal}} stretch anamorphic adapter with an Iscorama style form-factor that ISCO ever produced, and closely resembled the Iscorama 42 visually. ISCO-manufactured Centa Visions were always multicoated. Confusingly, ISCO also marketed a batch of re-branded Kowa Prominar 16-H lenses under the Centavision name. These were manufactured by Kowa in Japan, and were optically identical to the other versions of this lens (Kowa 8Z, Kowa for Bell & Howell, Elmoscope II), but differed physically in three respects: the ISCO version included a front <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> (72mm), had a standard diameter rear mounting thread (49mm), and featured a dual unit metric/imperial focus scale. The Kowa-manufactured version of the Centavision utilised a standard anamorphic focus mechanism, rather than ISCO's patented system.|$|E
50|$|The EF 35 mm 1.4L USM is a {{professional}} L series lens. It is constructed with a plastic body and metal mount. The screw-on <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> at the front is metal. Features of this lens are a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, and a distance window with infrared index. The maximum aperture of 1.4 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth of field and smooth bokeh effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 11 lens elements in 9 groups, including one ground and polished aspherical lens element. It uses a rear floating focusing system, powered by a ring type USM motor. Autofocus speed of this lens is very fast, and the front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing.|$|E
50|$|Filter mounting: This mount is {{used for}} {{attaching}} filters to EF lenses. There are three types: front threaded mount, inner drop-in mount, and rear gelatin holders. Front <b>threaded</b> <b>filters</b> are used on most lenses, and are attached by threading and tightening the filter. Inner, drop-in filter mounts are used on super telephoto EF lenses. They are attached by first pressing the two buttons on the filter mount, and pulling it out. Then either a round <b>threaded</b> <b>filter</b> is attached, or one can use a gelatin filter. Rear gelatin filter holders are used by cutting out a sheet of gelatin, to the size shown {{on the back of}} the lens and then sliding it into the holder. Filter mounts are useful for all types of photography, and every EF lens has either one or two of the three types used.|$|R
5000|$|The fuel inlet/fuel <b>filter</b> housing <b>threads</b> {{tend to be}} very fragile. When care is {{not taken}} to align the insert, it is {{possible}} for the fuel inlet to cross-thread and to strip when tightened in the main housing. There are several [...] "fixes" [...] available in the aftermarket: New, oversized, self-tapping fuel filter inserts; new fuel filter inserts that seal with O-rings; and Heli-Coil re-threading kits. In nearly all cases, the carburetor will require dis-assembly and internal cleaning of the aluminum thread residue, especially up to and including the needle and seat, (needle valve), to prevent flooding.|$|R
40|$|Foregut digesta {{from five}} feral {{dromedary}} camels were inoculated into three different enrichment media: cotton <b>thread,</b> <b>filter</b> paper, and neutral detergent fiber. A total of 283 16 S rRNA gene sequences {{were assigned to}} 33 operational taxonomic units by using 99 % species-level identity. LIBSHUFF revealed {{significant differences in the}} community composition across all three libraries...|$|R
5000|$|The lens is focus-by-wire, {{using the}} {{autofocus}} motor even for manual focus. The motor is quiet, suitable for video use ("MSC"- movie and stills compatible). Unlike other focus-by-wire systems, the lens offers two manual focus modes. In the traditional focus-by-wire mode, the focus mechanism operates {{the same way}} as other Micro Four Thirds lenses. The focus ring can be moved to engage a [...] "snap focus" [...] mode, which displays a distance scale for zone focusing, and provides a feel similar to mechanical focus systems. The [...] "snap focus" [...] mode makes this the first auto-focus capable Micro Four Thirds lens with a distance scale. The front element does not rotate, allowing the consistent use of polarized filters; a 46mm <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> lets users share filters with many of Panasonic's lenses.|$|E
50|$|There {{were four}} new Hexanon lenses offered {{along with the}} F. The normal lens was a 52 mm f1.4 with a 49 mm <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> (a similar lens was offered later with a 55 mm thread). A {{wide-angle}} 35 mm f2.0, and telephoto 85 mm f1.8 and 135 mm f2.8 lenses were also offered. The 35, 52 and 85 mm all had a linkage that juts out {{from the side of}} the lens, that inter-connects with a lever on the front of the camera, to register the lens' aperture setting with the camera's metering system. Because of this linkage interface, lenses sold with later Konica early mount cameras are not easily fitted onto the F, and vice versa, although they all share the same bayonet mount. In 1965, Konica introduced the Auto-Reflex line of cameras and lenses, which do not share the same bayonet mount as the F and its immediate successors, up to 1964's FM model.|$|E
50|$|The metal-bodied Iscorama 54 was {{the next}} {{anamorphic}} adapter to be released by ISCO, and was the largest of all Iscoramas. Although it was a totally different physical design to the original Iscorama and the Iscorama 36/Cinegon, the optical and mechanical configuration was very similar, with all three lenses sharing an identical focus and anamorphic alignment mechanism. Because of its large rear anamorphic element, and wide diameter mounting thread (77mm), the 54 can be attached to a much wider range of taking lenses than other Iscoramas without vignetting occurring (although a 35mm focal length {{seems to be the}} limit on APS-C cameras). One of the downsides of the Iscorama 54’s larger dimensions is the 95mm front <b>filter</b> <b>thread,</b> which has negative ramifications for the cost of filters and close-up lenses. Fortunately, it is possible to fix smaller (67mm and larger) filters within the recessed front opening of the lens without causing excessive vignetting.|$|E
40|$|The {{completed}} project, entitled âLow-Cost Substrates for High-Performance Nanorod LEDs,â {{targeted the}} goal of a phosphor-free nanorod-based white LED with IQE > 50 % across the spectrum from 450 nm to 600 nm on metallized silicon substrates. The principal achievements of this project included: â¢ Demonstration of (In,Ga) N nanopyramid heterostructures by a conventional OMVPE process. â¢ Verification of complete <b>filtering</b> of <b>threading</b> dislocations to yield dislocation-free pyramidal heterostructures. â¢ Demonstration of electroluminescence with a peak wavelength of ~ 600 nm from an (In,Ga) N nanopyramid array LED. â¢ Development of a reflective ZrN/AlN buffer layer for epitaxial growth of GaN films and GaN nanopyramid arrays on (111) Si...|$|R
5000|$|The lens is [...] "focus by wire"- the {{focusing}} ring sends commands, while the actual actuation is via a motor, even for manual focus. The front element does not rotate, allowing the consistent use of polarized <b>filters.</b> The 46mm <b>thread</b> lets a Micro Four Thirds user share filters between it, the Panasonic 14mm, Panasonic Leica 25mm, and Panasonic Leica 45mm lenses.|$|R
6000|$|... § 9. The third great use of {{mountains}} is to cause perpetual {{change in the}} soils of the earth. Without such provisions the ground under cultivation would {{in a series of}} years become exhausted and require to be upturned laboriously by the hand of man. But the elevations of the earth's surface provide for it a perpetual renovation. The higher mountains suffer their summits to be broken into fragments and to be cast down in sheets of massy rock, full, as we shall see presently, of every substance necessary for the nourishment of plants: these fallen fragments are again broken by frost, and ground by torrents, into various conditions of sand and clay--materials which are distributed perpetually by the streams farther and farther from the mountain's base. Every shower which swells the rivulets enables their waters to carry certain portions of earth into new positions, and exposes new banks of ground to be mined in their turn. That turbid foaming of the angry water,--that tearing down of bank and rock along the flanks of its fury,--are no disturbances of the kind course of nature; they are beneficent operations of laws necessary to the existence of man and to the beauty of the earth. The process is continued more gently, but not less effectively, over all the surface of the lower undulating country; and each <b>filtering</b> <b>thread</b> of summer rain which trickles through the short turf of the uplands is bearing its own appointed burden of earth to be thrown down on some new natural garden in the dingles below.|$|R
40|$|Most photographers have at {{one time}} of another run into a {{situation}} where the <b>filter</b> <b>thread</b> ring {{on the front of the}} lens has been bent in some accident and now there is a need to attach a certain filter or accessory to the lens 2 ̆ 7 s filter threads.

5000|$|The lens {{has both}} manual and power zoom (via a rocker switch), useful for smooth zoom motion during videography. Focusing is quiet. The lens has Panasonic's [...] "nano surface coating" [...] for {{increased}} contrast and reduced flare. The {{front of the}} lens neither extends nor rotates, beneficial for polarized <b>filters.</b> The 46mm <b>thread</b> diameter allows sharing of filters with the Panasonic 14mm, 20mm, 25mm, 45mm, and Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2 lenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} lens is the Carl Zeiss Planar 1:2 f=50mm in bright aluminium {{finish with a}} chrome 49 mm <b>thread</b> <b>filter</b> ring and an outer bayonet for ZI filters. The lens focuses to 30 cm, which is closer than the usual 50 cm. The focusing helical is remarkably smooth and precise. There is no aperture ring on the Contarex lens itself. It is set on the camera aperture wheel. The Contarex lens mount takes only Contarex lenses and accessories.|$|R

This high visual abstraction of threads allows us to display {{a large number of}} threads showing overall properties of the contents on a limited screen space. These proposed visualization techniques will assist the user to <b>filtering</b> noisy <b>threads</b> effectively from threads having important features.
