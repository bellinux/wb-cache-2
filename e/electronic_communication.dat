5|$|SGDs {{have their}} roots in early <b>electronic</b> <b>communication</b> aids. The first such aid was a sip-and-puff {{typewriter}} controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960. POSSUM scanned {{through a set of}} symbols on an illuminated display. Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of light at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.|$|E

HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition {{and the interests of}} service users in the field of <b>electronic</b> <b>communication</b> services and infrastructure, while contributing {{to the development of the}} internal market of the European Union. HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia. Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of minors, restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, profanity, use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programmeadvising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively. The restriction does not apply to educational, documentary, science or news programming.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} body of {{empirical}} research has begun to examine the practice of <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication.</b> <b>Electronic</b> group <b>communication</b> is a key process through which people can maintain communities of practice and leverage the strength of weak ties. Even though prior empirical investigations of <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication</b> have been successful at providing evidence for its effectiveness, these prior studies have not adequately dealt with the differences in the types of technology implementations of <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication.</b> We argue that different social and technical designs of <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication</b> technologies will influence various aspects of <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication,</b> such as level of participation, patterns of interaction and genres of communicative purposes. We propose and define the notion of conversation interface to be an important factor in electronic group communications. This paper illustrates the characteristics of the conversation interface and derives preliminary propositions concerning the impacts of conversation interface on <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication</b> based on prior theory. We also conduct an exploratory investigation of actual <b>electronic</b> group <b>communication</b> technologies to highlight the importance of the conversation interface factor.

25|$|Subsequent major European colonial empires {{included}} the French, Dutch, and British empires. The latter, consolidated {{during the period}} of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as <b>electronic</b> <b>communication</b> through the telegraph, cable, and radio. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as Belgium, Germany, and Italy, pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller. Ignoring the oceans, Russia built its Russian Empire through conquest by land in Eastern Europe, and Asia.|$|E
25|$|His {{views on}} {{language}} are polemical {{in their approach}} to word and structure formation. Stavans believes that dictionaries and language academies are buffers whose improbable function is to provide continuity for a language but suggests that such continuity, especially {{in the age of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>communication,</b> is fatuous. He accuses the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language in Madrid of colonialism, among other things. He has also studied the Iberian conquest of the Americas in the 16th century from a linguistic perspective. Translation, for Stavans, represents appropriation. He defined modernity as “a translated way of life” and has written and lectured on the role translators perform as communicating vessels across epochs and habitats.|$|E
25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, <b>electronic</b> <b>communication,</b> and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal {{as if it were}} an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we give our students nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.|$|E
