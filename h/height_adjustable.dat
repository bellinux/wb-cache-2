25|$|In an automobile, the {{headrest}} or {{head restraint}} is a device {{attached to the}} top of the seat behind the occupant's head. Most headrests are cushioned for comfort, are <b>height</b> <b>adjustable</b> and most commonly finished in the same material as the rest of the seat. The automobile headrest was invented by Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921. U.S. patent #1,471,168 for the headrest was issued to Katz on October 16, 1923.|$|E

50|$|To {{solve this}} issue, a {{standing}} desk may either be custom-made, {{to suit the}} height of the user, or made with adjustable parts. For writing or drafting, the angle or slant of the surface may be adjustable, with a typical drawing table or table à la tronchin. If the desk is made for computer use, the legs may be adjustable. Another option is a platform made to sit on top of a regular seated desk that raises the desk's surface to a useful height for standing. Such platforms may be fixed <b>height</b> or <b>adjustable.</b>|$|R

30|$|A rapid, {{cost-effective}} and high-throughput {{process for}} nanotexturing subwavelength structures with high uniformity using the polycarbonate (PC) is realized via injection nanomolding. The process enables the precise control of nanohole array (NHA) surface topography (nanohole depth, diameter, and periodicity) over large areas thereby presenting a highly versatile platform for fabricating substrates with user-defined, functional performance. Specifically, the optical {{property of the}} PC substrates were systematically characterized and tuned through the modulation of the depths of NHA. The aspect ratio submicron holes can be easily modulated and experimentally proven by simply adjusting the molding temperature. The nanotextured depths were reliably fabricated {{in the range of}} 200 to 400  nm with a period of approximately 700  nm. The fabricated PC films can reduce the reflectivity from an original bare film of 10.2 % and 8.9 % to 1.4 % and 2.1 % with 400 -nm depth of nanoholes at the wavelength of 400 and 550  nm, respectively. Compared with conventional moth-like nanostructures with nanopillar arrays with <b>heights</b> <b>adjustable</b> only by an etching process, this paper proposes a facile route with submicron holes to achieve a similar antireflective function, with a significantly reduced time and facile height modulation capability. Furthermore, the effects of multilayer coatings of dielectric and metallic layers on the nanomolded NHA have been performed and potential sensing application is explored.|$|R
