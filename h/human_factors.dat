40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that <b>human</b> and bovine <b>factor</b> VII exhibit 71 % {{amino acid sequence}} identity. In the present study, competition binding experiments revealed that the interaction of <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> VII with cell-surface <b>human</b> tissue <b>factor</b> was not inhibited by 100 -fold molar excess of bovine factor VII. This finding {{indicated that}} bovine and <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> VII are not structurally homologous in the region(s) where <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> VII interacts with <b>human</b> tissue <b>factor.</b> On this premise, we synthesized three peptides corresponding to regions of <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> VII that exhibited marked structural dissimilarity to bovine factor VII; these regions of dissimilarity included residues 195 - 206, 263 - 274, and 314 - 326. Peptide 195 - 206 inhibited the interaction of factor VII with cell-surface tissue factor and the activation of factor X by a complex of factor VIIa and tissue factor half-maximally at concentrations of 1 - 2 mM. A structurally rearranged form of peptide 195 - 206 containing an aspartimide residue inhibited these reactions half-maximally at concentrations of 250 - 300 microM. In contrast, neither peptide 263 - 274 nor peptide 314 - 326, at 2 mM concentration, significantly affected either factor VIIa interaction with tissue factor or factor VIIa-mediated activation of factor X. Our data provide presumptive evidence that residues 195 - 206 of <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> VII {{are involved in the}} interaction of <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> VII with the extracellular domain of <b>human</b> tissue <b>factor</b> apoprotein...|$|R
5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and <b>human</b> <b>factors.</b> However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

5|$|Other <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> {{have led}} to declines and even extinctions in seabird populations, colonies and species. Of these, perhaps the most serious are {{introduced}} species. Seabirds, breeding predominantly on small isolated islands, have lost many predator defence behaviours. Feral cats are capable of taking seabirds as large as albatrosses, and many introduced rodents, such as the Pacific rat, can take eggs hidden in burrows. Introduced goats, cattle, rabbits and other herbivores can lead to problems, particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young. Disturbance of breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as well—visitors, even well-meaning tourists, can flush brooding adults off a colony leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators.|$|E

The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>factors</b> are the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors {{are more likely to have}} catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E

5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis have been to {{evaluate}} to what extend the ongoing development of Nato Network Enabling Capabilities Maturity levels, (NNEC ML) have incorporated the <b>human</b> <b>factor,</b> or if the development is focusing to much on the technological aspects.

In my thesis I point out different areas where the <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> is not taken enough into consideration, and I argue for a shift in focus from technology to the <b>human</b> <b>factor.</b> My conclusion {{is that it is}} necessary to shift focus from technology to the <b>human</b> <b>factor</b> in the following development if we shall succeed in bringing NATO and the different nations to the highest maturity level, Coherent.

NNEC ML 5, Coherent means a maturity level where it is unnatural to operate in any other way than networked. A prerequisite to achieve this maturity level is that the people in the network feel familiar with the system they are operating, and trust their coalition partners.
