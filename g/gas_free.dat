40|$|Many mud diapirs {{have been}} {{identified}} in the southern Okinawa Trough from a seismic survey using R/V KEXUE I in 2001. The movement and accumulation of <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> related to mud diapirs are discussed in detail by an analysis of fluid potential which is based upon velocity data. It can be found that <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> moves from the higher fluid potential strata to the lower ones and the gas hydrate comes into being during <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> movement meeting the proper criteria of temperature and pressure. In fact, gas hydrates have been found in the upper layers above the mud diapirs and in host rocks exhibiting other geophysical characteristics. As the result of the formation of the <b>gas</b> hydrate, the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> bearing strata are enclosed by the gas hydrate bearing strata. Due to the high pressure anomalies of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> bearing strata the fluid potential increases noticeably. It can then be concluded that the high fluid potential anomaly on the low fluid potential background may be caused by the presence of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> below the gas hydrate bearing strata...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{numerical}} {{models for}} simulating <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> accumulation in marine sediments have been developed. These models include several physical {{processes such as}} phase equilibrium of gas hydrates, multiphase fluid flow in porous media, biogenic methane production, and sedimentation-compaction of sediments over geologic timescales. Non-dimensionalization of the models lead {{to the emergence of}} important dimensionless groups controlling these dynamic systems, such as the Peclet number, Damkohler number, and a sedimentation-compaction group that compares permeability to sedimentation rate. Exploring the entire parameter space of these dimensionless groups helps in delineating different modes of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> occurrence, e. g., no hydrate and hydrate with or without underlying <b>free</b> <b>gas.</b> Scaling schemes developed for these systems help in summarizing average gas hydrate saturation for hundreds of simulation results into two simple contour plots. The utility of these contour plots in predicting average hydrate saturation is shown through application to different geologic settings. The depth to the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) is also developed as an independent proxy for gas hydrate saturation for deep-source systems. It is shown through numerical modeling that scaled depth to the SMT correlates with the average gas hydrate flux through the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Later, analytical theory is developed for calculating steady-state concentration profiles as well as the complete gas hydrate saturation profile from the SMT depth. Application of this theory to several sites along Cascadia Margin indicates that SMT depth {{can be used as a}} fast and inexpensive proxy to get a first-order estimate of gas hydrate saturation, compared to expensive deep-drilling methods. The effect of overpressure development in low permeability gas hydrate systems is shown to have an important effect on <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturations. Specifically, overpressure development decreases the net amount of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> in the system, in addition to extending the base of the hydrate stability zone below the seafloor by a relatively small depth. We also study the role of upward <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> migration in producing long, connected <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> columns beneath the gas hydrate layer. Finally, two-dimensional models are developed to study the effect of heterogeneities on <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> distribution. Simulation results show that hydrate as well as <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> accumulates in relatively high saturations within these high permeability sediments, such as faults/fracture networks, dipping sand layers, and combinations of both, due to focused fluid flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the GHASS (Gas Hydrates, fluid Activities and Sediment deformations in the western Black Sea) cruise are twofold but interconnected. The first aim is to study the dynamics of <b>gas</b> hydrates and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> associated with geological and climate processes. The second aim is to identify the factors at the origin of observed sediment deformations and submarine landslides in two areas in the Romanian sector of the Black Sea. For the cruise we use quantitative approaches based on multidisciplinary studies (geochemistry, geology, geophysics and geotechnics). Gas hydrates and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> were detected using surface and deep-towed HR seismic (SYSIF) techniques and by performing in situ geotechnical and acoustic measurements using the Ifremer penetrometer (Penfeld). Dynamics of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> were evaluated based on geochemical analysis of pore fluids but also by carrying out in situ geotechnical measurements and long-term monitoring (several years) of few key sites with pore pressure and temperature measurements. The deformation and submarine landslides associated with <b>gas</b> hydrates, <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> and/or the Danube canyon activities were also studied by using advanced geotechnical technologies and detailed sedimentological studies on sediment cores. One of the main results of the GHASS cruise was to recover gas hydrates from coring {{for the first time}} in the Romanian sector of the Black Sea...|$|R

40|$|Bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) were {{observed}} beneath the seafloor {{in the northern}} continental margin of the South China Sea (SCS). Acoustic impedance profile was derived by Constrained Sparse Spike Inversion (CSSI) method to provide information on rock properties and to estimate <b>gas</b> hydrate or <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturations in the sediments where BSRs are present. In general, gas hydrate-bearing sediments have positive impedance anomalies and free gas-bearing sediments have negative impedance anomalies. Based on well log data and Archie's equation, gas hydrate saturation can be estimated. But in regions where well log data is not available, a quantitative estimate of <b>gas</b> hydrate or <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturation is inferred by fitting the theoretical acoustic impedance to sediment impedance obtained by CSSI. Our study suggests that gas hydrate saturation in the Taixinan Basin is about 10 - 20 % of the pore space, with the highest value of 50 %, and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturation below BSR is about 2 - 3 % of the pore space, that can rise to 8 - 10 % at a topographic high.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{studies on}} the characteristics of <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path in nanopores by molecular dynamics simulation. Our study results indicate that the mean free path of all molecules in nanopores depend on both the radius of the nanopore and the gas-solid interaction strength. Besides mean free path of all molecules in the nanopore, this paper highlights the <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path at different positions of the nanopore and the anisotropy of the <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path at nanopores. The molecular mean free path varies with the molecule’s distance {{from the center of the}} nanopore. The least value of the mean free path occurs at the wall surface of the nanopore. The present paper found that the <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path is anisotropic when gas is confined in nanopores. The radial <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path is much smaller than the mean free path including all molecular collisions occuring in three directions. Our study results also indicate that when gas is confined in nanopores the gas molecule number density does not affect the <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path in the same way as it does for the gas in unbounded space. These study results may bring new insights into understanding the gas flow’s characteristic at nanoscale...|$|R
