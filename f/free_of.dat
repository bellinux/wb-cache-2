The definition of a worker, primary and secondary legislation governing <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers and the scope <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers are presented as well. Moreover, derogations from the principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers are discussed. The next part of the thesis is dedicated to the description of the European Court of Justice, its composition and various types of proceedings. In the last part of the thesis the most significant ECJ cases concerning hindrances to <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers are selected and analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of common market {{was based on}} four fundamental freedoms. These freedoms have re-mained the central issue of the EU, although their perception has significantly changed since the Treaty of Paris. The principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers, as a part <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> persons, facilitates the mobility of workers within the EU, as any citizen of EU member states is {{allowed to go to}} another member state for work, having the same workplace rights as the nationals. The principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> move- ment <b>of</b> workers is associated with the lack of any discrimination between workers based on national- ity, which is guaranteed by EU legislation. For these reasons, that principle at the same time {{remains one of the most}} controversial issues of the European integration. It is so because from the beginning of its existence, its realisation has required the necessity to reconcile – sometimes different – national interests for the sake of common market. Due to the significant disparities between member states regarding their economic status and standard of living, the principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers is often associated by the highly developed countries with the inflow of cheap labour force from the poorer member states that poses a real threat for its national labour markets and welfare systems. Considering the above mentioned facts, the article solves the research problem: to determine the place of the principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers in the process of {{creation of}} the European common market. The aim of this paper is to present the decisive stages in changing the perception of the principle <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers through the process of European integration. To achieve this aim, the main tasks are: to present <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers at the beginning of Euro- pean integration, the perception <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers at the struggle to implement the idea of EU citizenship, the perception <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers at the time of EU enlargements and the impact of the economic crisis of 2008 + on the realisation <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers. The paper presents a combination of several research methods: comparative analysis of international sci- entific works; comparative analysis and interpretation of the EU legal documents, strategies and practical papers as well as the analysis of the CJEU decisions in cases that involve the <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers. The results of the article are: explanation of the emergence of the idea <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers at the beginning of European integration, presentation of the development <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers due to the implementation of the idea of EU citizenship, indication of the manner <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers for new member states, the way <b>of</b> realisation <b>of</b> <b>free</b> movement <b>of</b> workers at the time of economic crisis of 2008 +...|$|R
