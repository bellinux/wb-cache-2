50|$|Vehicle Type Approval is the {{confirmation}} that production samples of a design will meet specified performance standards. Traditionally, {{there are two}} systems of Type Approval in Europe. The first one bases on the EC Directives and regulates the approval of whole vehicles, vehicle systems, and separate components. The second one {{is part of the}} United Nations Economic Commission for Europe regulations (UNECE) and also regulates the approval of whole vehicles, vehicle systems, and separate components. Recent changes to the requirements have seen the <b>General</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Regulation</b> (GSR) EC661/2009 amending Directive 2007/46/EC by substituting the equivalent UNECE Regulations in place of the EC Directives. In effect the Directives are being replaced by UNECE Regulations. This now makes compliance with the UNECE Regulations for Type Approval submissions compulsory from 1 November 2012 and compulsory for all vehicles entering to service from 1 November 2014.|$|E
40|$|In 2010, the European Union renewed its {{commitment}} to improve road safety by setting a target of reducing road deaths by 50 % by 2020, compared to 2010 levels. This target followed an earlier target set in 2001 to halve road deaths by 2010. Since 2014, progress has virtually ground to a halt. 2016 was the third consecutive poor year for road safety: 25, 670 people lost their lives on EU roads compared to 26, 200 the previous year - a 2 % decrease. But this followed a 1 % increase in 2015 and stagnation in 2014. Out of the 32 countries monitored by the PIN Programme, 15 countries registered {{a drop in the}} number of road deaths last year. The best results were achieved in Lithuania with a 22 % reduction, Cyprus with 19 %, the Czech Republic with 17 %, Latvia with 16 % and Switzerland with 15 %. As many as 15 countries saw an increase while progress stood still in two countries. There has been progress over a longer time frame. Since 2010 road deaths in the EU 28 were cut by 19 %, equivalent to a 3. 4 % average annual reduction. But a 6. 7 % year-to-year reduction was needed over the 2010 - 2020 period to reach the EU 2020 target through constant progress in annual percentage terms. As a result of the failure to reduce deaths at the pace required, annual reductions of 11. 4 % each year are now needed between 2017 and 2020 for the EU to stay on track. Significant and urgent efforts are needed to achieve this. The political will to improve on this poor progress is important. The lack of it at EU member state level has contributed to a decline in levels of police enforcement, a failure to invest in safer infrastructure and limited action on tackling speed and drink driving in a number of countries. At the EU level, there has also been a conspicuous lack of action. Minimum EU vehicle safety standards have not been updated since 2009 despite rapid advances in vehicle crashworthiness and new technology that can help drivers to avoid or mitigate the consequences of collisions. Plans to update the standards were postponed and the proposal is not expected until March 2018. Updates to EU infrastructure safety rules have also not materialised. EU transport ministers recently urged the European Commission to come forward with a serious injury reduction target to cover the period 2020 - 2030. It is now critical that the European Commission bring forward the above initiatives and a long term road safety strategy for 2030 within the coming months. Key recommendations to member states: Seek to reach targets by all available means, including applying proven enforcement strategies according to the EC Recommendation on enforcement. Provide adequate government funds that allow the target-oriented setting of measures and set up financing and incentive models for the regional and local level. Set quantitative sub-targets based on compliance indicators. Use the evidence gathered to devise and update relevant policies. Make the choice of measures based on sound evaluation studies and - where applicable - cost effectiveness consideration. Set national targets for reducing serious injuries based on MAIS 3 + alongside the reduction of road deaths. Include serious injuries in the impact assessment of countermeasures. Streamline the emergency response chain and increase quality of trauma management in order to mitigate collision consequences more effectively. Support an urgent revision of the EU <b>General</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Regulation,</b> including live-saving technologies, such as Intelligent Speed Assistance, Alcohol Interlocks, Advanced Seat Belt Reminders on all seats, Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and Event Data Recorders. Key recommendations to EU institutions: Adopt a fully-fledged road safety strategy for 2030, including measures to tackle serious injuries against which delivery can be made accountable. Adopt a target to reduce by 50 % between 2020 and 2030 the number of people seriously injured based on MAIS 3 + as requested by the EU Transport Ministers. Within the context of the revision of the <b>General</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Regulation</b> prioritise the introduction and further extension of in-vehicle safety technologies linked to the key risk factors, which include Intelligent Speed Assistance, Alcohol Interlocks, Advanced Seat Belt Reminders on all seats and Autonomous Emergency Braking. Mandate Event Data Recorders in all new vehicles. Within the context of the revision of the Infrastructure Safety Management Directive, extend the application of the instruments of the Directive to cover all motorways and all EU (co-) financed roads, as well as main rural and urban roads. Within the context of the revision of the Cross-Border Enforcement Directive, strengthen the enforcement chain, including mandatory notification by the country of offence of the owner of the vehicle. Implement priorities for 2016 - 2020 put forward in ETSC’s position paper on the mid-term review of the road safety policy orientations including improved infrastructure, vehicle safety, and tackling speeding and drink driving.

40|$|In 2014 in Europe 25, 964 {{people died}} in road traffic and 203, 500 were seriously injured. However, the long term safety trend has been positive, {{especially}} so for car occupants who have benefitted more than other road users from road safety measures adopted over the past decade. There were 12, 345 car occupant deaths in Europe in 2012 compared with 27, 700 in 2001, a cut of 55 %. Other road user deaths fell by 41 % over the same period. Although the reduction in deaths may {{be a result of}} many factors, including better enforcement, changing behaviour and safer infrastructure, {{there is little doubt that}} improved vehicle safety standards since the late 1990 s have played an important role. Improvements in the safety of new vehicles in Europe have been driven by mandatory EU and UNECE safety requirements for new vehicles and by Euro NCAP (the European New Car Assessment Programme), a voluntary consumer testing organisation that carries out its own tests of many vehicles that sell in large numbers and awards safety ratings to them. Euro NCAP’s evolving 5 -star safety rating has come to represent the safety gold standard in Europe. The crash tests carried out by Euro NCAP are stricter than those required by regulation — and have also become stricter over time. A car that only meets the minimum legal EU safety requirements would receive a zero-star Euro NCAP rating. Since 2009, cars must perform well across four ‘boxes’ — adult occupant protection, child occupant protection, pedestrian protection and safety assistance systems - in order to receive the top 5 -star rating. One important indicator of the level of vehicle safety in Europe overall is what proportion of the number of tested vehicles actually sold meet Euro NCAP’s highest safety ratings. The last assessment of the progress of the Euro NCAP programme carried out by ETSC in 2009 found that there were very significant differences between the average Euro NCAP rating of new cars sold in Eastern and Central European countries, compared to their Western European counterparts. Part I of this report gives an overview of how Euro NCAP’s car assessment protocol works. Part II contains ETSC’s updated analysis on what proportion of tested cars sold have a Euro NCAP rating, what ratings those vehicles received, and how they performed in each of the four boxes mentioned above. Part II also looks at what can be done at national level. Part III continues the data analysis with a look at how individual car brands are performing. Part IV briefly discusses some of the questions raised by the dominance of the Euro NCAP programme in EU vehicle safety: it looks at the pros and cons of laboratory tests versus real world crash analysis and examines the issue of optimisation to meet laboratory tests. In part V, the analysis looks ahead to the European Commission’s forthcoming review of the <b>General</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Regulation</b> and Pedestrian Protection Regulation, the key legislation for vehicle safety in Europe, and makes a series of recommendations. Finally, part VI features an interview with Michiel van Ratingen, the secretary general of Euro NCAP, where he responds to the findings of this report and gives details to the changes the organisation had made to its testing protocol as of January 2016.
