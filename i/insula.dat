5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior <b>insula</b> cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the <b>insula</b> cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} medial sclerosis (TMS) {{is characterized}} by hippocampal sclerosis in temporal and by distinghished grades of injury near to other neurological structures such as: amygdaloid nucleus, parahippocampal girus and entorhinal region. The study analyzed 40 patients with TMS and 40 people from the control cluster. All the cases were appreciated by one method for measurement of <b>insula's</b> cortex (E-Film) and another method to calculate the <b>insula's</b> volume (Neuroline). There is no variation statistical between the <b>insula's</b> volume and <b>insula's</b> measurement for the two clusters.

5|$|The Batavi, a Germanic tribe, {{inhabited}} the region today known as Gelderland (Netherlands), in the Rhine river delta, {{then known as}} the <b>Insula</b> Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi", because surrounded by branches of the Rhine), part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. They were a warlike people, skilled horsemen, boatmen and swimmers. In return for the unusual privilege of exemption from tributum (direct taxes on land and heads normally exacted from peregrini), they supplied {{a disproportionate number of}} recruits to the Julio-Claudian auxilia: one ala and eight cohortes. They also provided most of Augustus' elite personal bodyguard unit (the Germani corpore custodes), which continued in service until 68AD. The Batavi auxilia amounted to about 5,000 men, implying that during the entire Julio-Claudian period, over 50% of all Batavi males reaching military age (16 years) may have enlisted in the auxilia. Thus the Batavi, although just 0.05% of the total population of the empire of c. 70 million in 23AD, supplied about 4% of the total auxilia i.e. 80 times their proportionate share. They were regarded by the Romans as the very best (fortissimi, validissimi) of their auxiliary, and indeed all, their forces. In Roman service, both their cavalry and infantry had perfected a technique for swimming across rivers wearing full armour and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Nuttall {{described}} the {{species in the}} second volume of the his 1846 work The North American Sylva with specific epithet aurea ('golden' in Latin). In 1768, Scottish botanist Philip Miller described Ficus maxima, citing Carl Linnaeus' Hortus Cliffortianus (1738) and Hans Sloane's Catalogus plantarum quæ in <b>insula</b> Jamaica (1696). Sloane's illustration of the species, published in 1725, depicted it with figs borne singly, a characteristic of the Ficus subgenus Pharmacosycea. As {{a member of the}} subgenus Urostigma, F. aurea has paired figs. However, a closer examination of Sloane's description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the subgenus Urostigma (since it had other diagnostic of that subgenus), almost certainly F. aurea, and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably artistic license. Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane's illustration was based and concluded that Miller's F. maxima was, in fact, F. aurea. In his description of F. aurea, which was based on plant material collected in Florida, Thomas Nuttall considered the possibility that his plants belonged to the species that Sloane had described, but {{came to the conclusion that}} it was a new species. Under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the name F. maxima has priority over F. aurea since Miller's description was published in 1768, while Nuttall's description was published in 1846.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} function, the <b>insula</b> is {{believed}} to process convergent information to produce an emotionally relevant context for sensory experience. To be specific, the anterior <b>insula</b> is related more to olfactory, gustatory, vicero-autonomic, and limbic function, whereas the posterior <b>insula</b> is related more to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function. Functional imaging experiments have revealed that the <b>insula</b> has {{an important role in}} pain experience and the experience of a number of basic emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness.|$|E

25|$|The insular cortex {{is divided}} into two parts: the larger {{anterior}} <b>insula</b> and the smaller posterior <b>insula</b> in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. The cortical area overlying the <b>insula</b> toward the lateral surface of the brain is the operculum (meaning lid). The opercula are formed from parts of the enclosing frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} <b>insula</b> {{receives a}} direct projection from the basal {{part of the}} ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus and a particularly large input from the central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, the anterior <b>insula</b> itself projects to the amygdala.|$|E
25|$|Another {{perception}} of the right anterior <b>insula</b> is the degree of nonpainful warmth or nonpainful coldness of a skin sensation. Other internal sensations processed by the <b>insula</b> include stomach or abdominal distension. A full bladder also activates the insular cortex.|$|E

25|$|A model {{proposed}} by Naqvi et al. (see above) {{is that the}} <b>insula</b> stores {{a representation of the}} pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the <b>insula</b> to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the <b>insula</b> is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, <b>insula</b> activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the <b>insula</b> {{may play a role in}} memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the <b>insula</b> reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.|$|E
