50|$|<b>Drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> are {{widespread}} in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian ocean purse seine fisheries. They catch over 1 million tons of tuna (nearly one-third of the global tuna total) and over 100,000 tons of by-catch {{in the vicinity of}} FADs as of 2005. Skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, Bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and yellowfin Thunnus albacares tuna are the three primary tropical tuna species that FADs target. Other fish include albacore, dolphin fish, wahoo, blue marlin, striped marlin, mako shark, silky shark, whitetip shark, galapagos shark, mackerel, and bonito.|$|E
40|$|Because {{tropical}} tunas {{are known}} to aggregate around floating objects, {{it has been suggested}} that the large number of drifting fish aggregating devices (FADS) built and deployed by purse seiners could act as an 'ecological trap'. This hypothesis states that these networks of <b>drifting</b> <b>FADS</b> could take fish to areas where they would not normally go or retain them in places that they would otherwise leave. Because the ecological trap hypothesis was first advanced for <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs,</b> some have argued that only studies using <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> can test this hypothesis. However, because working with <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> is difficult, accepting this precept would preclude the scientific community from providing urgently needed information to organizations charged with management of fisheries that exploit <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> We argue that because both anchored and <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> alter the natural environment, the more easily accessible anchored FADs can be used to test the ecological trap hypothesis. Also, based on a comparative scientific approach, we argue that understanding the behaviour of tunas around anchored FADs can improve our general understanding of tunas around all types of floating objects and help design new, well focused studies for <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> As anchored FADs are easier to access and offer a greater potential for research, we encourage scientists to design and conduct studies (in particular on the behaviour of fish at FADS) around the moored structures...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} cruise {{was conducted}} onboard the US flag purse seine vessel M/V Cape Finisterre from 22 May – 1 July 2012 {{as an integral}} part of the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) #BycatchProject which was formed to develop and test technical options to minimize non‐target catch in industrial tuna fisheries. Research and fishing operations took place within the EEZs of Tuvalu, Kiribati and Tokelau where one free school and 30 <b>drifting</b> <b>FAD</b> sets were conducted. Research activities included studies on the FAD‐associated ecosystem, the ability of fishermen to estimate size and species on FADs before setting, the vertical and horizontal behavior of tuna and other species surrounding floating objects, the behavior of tuna and bycatch in the net, best practices for the safe release of whale shark and manta ray from purse seine gear and a range of studies on oceanic sharks centered on their condition throughout the fishing process and post‐release survival rates. Onboard protocols for estimating size frequency and species composition of the total catch, including video monitoring were also conducted for subsequent comparison analyses. The latter half of the cruise concentrated on the selective release of non‐target species from the net. Preliminary data strongly suggest that ways to avoid non‐target species or selectively remove them from the net should be prioritized as condition and post‐release survival after brailing is very low. The use of pop‐up satellite archiving tags (PSAT) to verify post release condition of various species proved to be essential to meeting the cruise objectives...|$|R
40|$|Anchored and {{drifting}} Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are intensively used {{in tropical}} tuna fisheries. In both small-scale and industrial fisheries, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{are the main}} targets. The increasing development of this fishing practice by industrial purse seiners has {{raised the question of}} the impact of FADs on tuna communities, as they might act as an ecological trap. This study investigated the feeding habits of skipjack and yellowfin tuna associated with anchored and <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> in the western Indian Ocean. The diet of 352 tunas was analysed taking into account the type of FAD, ontogenetic variations, and the resources richness of the area. Poor-food and rich-food areas were defined according to the abundance of stomatopod Natosquilla investigatoris, the main prey of tunas, on the fishing sites. Diet composition was expressed through functional groups of prey. Significant dietary differences were found between both FAD types, as well as an effect of individual size. Around anchored FADs tuna preyed on diverse assemblages of coastal fish and crustacean larvae and juveniles, whereas a low diversity of epipelagic prey dominated the tuna diet associated with drifting FAD. Compared to anchored FADs, the frequency of empty stomachs was significantly higher and the stomach content mass significantly lower among skipjack and small yellowfin tunas caught around <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> This was magnified in poor-food areas, where <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> often evolved, suggesting that these FADs could negatively impact the growth of skipjack and small yellowfin tuna. Larger yellowfin tuna exhibited differences in their dietary habits between anchored and <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs,</b> and between poor-food and rich-food areas. However, <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> did not impact them as strongly as juveniles of yellowfin or skipjack tunas. Our study gives new highlights on possible detrimental effects of FAD on tunas, and this has to be considered in future sustainable management strategies of tuna fisheries...|$|E
40|$|We adapted {{a visual}} census method, mainly used in {{demersal}} and reef fish studies, to characterize fish communities associated to drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Western Indian Ocean. Drifting FAD associated fishes from both equatorial (Seychelles) and tropical waters (Reunion Island) were examined by divers. A total of 32 species (belonging to 16 families) were observed associated with <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> in equatorial waters, and 24 species (14 families) were found around FADs in tropical waters. Twenty species {{were found in}} both regions. The highest number of species observed at a single FAD was 18 (12 +/- 2, mean +/- SD) in equatorial and 13 (10 +/- 3) in tropical waters, not counting circumnatant species loosely associated with the FAD. Some species like Kyphosus vaigiensis, Canthidermis maculata, Elagatis bipinnulata, Acanthocybium solandri and Coryphaena hippurus were observed on {{all or most of}} the surveys. In this study, the contribution in biomass of the 18 common species associated with <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> (but excluding circumnatant species), represents more than 98 % of the biomass. The overall biomass values of closely associated species remains well below tuna biomass estimates for circumnatant tuna schools at FADs, estimated as high as 200 tons. The species that most significantly contribute to the by-catch in tuna purse-seines logically match those that showing the highest biomass values in our surveys (Carcharhinus spp., Elagatis bipinnulata, Coryphaena hippurus, Canthidermis maculata, and Acanthocybium solandri). One of the most abundant and ubiquitous species in our study was the spotted oceanic triggerfish Canthidermis maculata that sometimes formed massive schools of many thousands individuals around the <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> Future research is needed to explore the role of such non tuna species in the attraction and aggregation processes of tuna around <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs...</b>|$|E
40|$|Omnidirectional sonar {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} {{in close proximity to}} drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) offshore Seychelles, western Indian Ocean, to investigate the number, size, and distribution of FAD-associated fish schools. Echotrace detection techniques applied on the raw multibeam data enabled the extraction of empirical statistics regarding inter-school distances, and allowed the visualization of the temporal evolution of the pelagic aggregation on a FAD-centered coordinate system. The sonar recordings revealed the concurrent existence of multiple fish schools that were spatially clustered and exhibited low permanence in size and structure. Schools were predominantly detected within a radius of 500 m from the FADs, although 15 % of detections occurred between 500 to 1500 m from the floating devices. Fish school biomass detected with the sonar was aggregated into a few, large schools during daytime, and dispersed into a larger number of small schools during nighttime. Compared to daytime observations, nighttime schools maintained smaller inter-school distances and were located closer to the <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> The study demonstrates that horizontal sonars are powerful tools for studying the spatiotemproral distribution of large pelagic schools in the vicinity of <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurse seine {{fishing on}} fish {{aggregating}} devices (FADs) has expanded considerably {{during the last}} 15 yr in tropical tuna purse seine fisheries, and FADs currently account for about 70 % of their reported tuna catches. The scientific community has expressed concern over {{the consequences of this}} fishing practice in terms of yield per recruit and suspected detrimental effects on FAD-associated tunas. To explore possible detrimental effects, we compared stomach fullness, fish plumpness, growth rate, and migration behaviour between free school and drifting FAD-associated tunas for skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares caught in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Significant differences in fish plumpness and individual growth rates were found, suggesting that individuals associated with <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> were less healthy than those in free schools. Since stomach fullness indicated that tunas associated with FADs eat less than those in free schools, the difference in growth rate and condition could be the consequence of altered feeding patterns. For each species, significant changes in migratory direction and displacement rates were observed in the presence of <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> These findings support the hypothesis that FADs act as a super-stimulus, misleading tunas to make inappropriate habitat selection. However, further studies are required to investigate the long-term effect of FADs on the entire life cycle of tunas...|$|E
40|$|The Ph. D. Thesis {{focuses on}} the {{acoustic}} study of the spatiotemporal behaviour of tuna schools associated with drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), using omnidirectional multibeam sonars. FADs {{play a major role}} in industrial tuna fisheries, however the particular fishery-characteristics strongly bias parameters concerning fishing effort and increase uncertainty regarding management strategies. It is accepted that new methodologies need to be developed for the efficient in situ assessment of aggregations around FADs, using multibeam sonars. The objective of this Thesis is to provide with quantitative in situ acoustic descriptors of tuna aggregations around <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs,</b> and to standardize certain fishery-related parameters. Acoustic recordings around FADs were acquired in the western Indian Ocean. The initial research effort focused on developing the Multibeam Sonar Tracer, an operational software for sonar raw data interface, visualization, and processing. School detection and tracking algorithms were developed and integrated to the system, allowing for automatic school isolation and extraction of quantitative descriptors. The methodology incorporates the development of a 3 D school and sonar simulator, used to correct beam effect biases on school descriptors. Next to the description of the MST software and sensitivity analyses of its processing modules, the results comprise of a description of school typology and statistical analyses of school descriptors. Pelagic schools were characterized by high variability in morphology and density, and their average horizontal speed was estimated to 1. 2 ms- 1. A strong variability was also observed in the overall spatiotemporal distribution of schools relative to the <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs,</b> while time-series of total tracked school area and total tracked backscatter were found to be highly variable. Statistical differences were observed between day-time and night-time recordings: large schools during night-time were found to be fewer, and less dense compared to same size day-time schools. The highest biomass density was localized in a radial distance zone 400 m from the <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs,</b> accounting for 80 % of the total backscatter, echotrace area, and number of aggregations detected. The development and operational application of the system showed that quantitative multibeam acoustic research is feasible, and on methodological standards comparable to those used in high precision single-beam echosounding...|$|E
40|$|Silky sharks, Carcharhinus falciformis (Muller and Henle, 1839), are {{the primary}} elasmobranch bycatch species in tuna purse seine {{fisheries}} throughout the world's major oceans.

Here we present results from the first investigation into the behavior of juvenile silky sharks associated with <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> in the western Indian Ocean. A total of 10 silky sharks were tagged with coded acoustic transmitters around <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> equipped with acoustic receivers. Following release, all sharks undertook an excursion away from the FAD {{with which they were}} associated. Two individuals were subsequently never detected, while the initial absence period of the eight detected sharks ranged between 0. 1 and 3. 5 d. After returning, total association times averaged 5. 19 d (SD = 3. 15 d) and related horizontal movement rates ranged from 8 to 50 km d(- 1). Short excursions away from the FAD were undertaken by some individuals, all of which lasted a few hours and were made at night. During periods of association, silky sharks typically occupied the upper 35 m of the water column {{for the majority of the}} observation period.

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{compares the}} species {{composition}} of free swimming schools and schools associated with fish aggregating devices (or FADs) observed by {{scientists in the}} eastern equatorial Atlantic during the early eighties and late nineties. This comparison shows that in free swimming schools, big changes in the species composition have occurred. The main change is a rarefaction of mixed species free schools (skipjack and small yellowfin or bigeye). This change is probably a real biological one, and possibly {{a consequence of the}} large numbers of FADs seeded in the area since 1990. Nowadays, most small tuna living in the equatorial area appear to be concentrated under these <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> instead of in free schools.

Implementation of CMM 2008 ‐ 01 The implementation of the CMM was reviewed for its key components – purse seine effort, the FAD closure, the high seas pockets (HSP) closure, longline catches and catches by other fisheries. The main conclusions from the paper regarding implementation are as follows: Purse seine effort Purse seine effort has expanded since the introduction of CMM 2008 ‐ 01, with effort (excluding domestic purse seiners based in Indonesia and Philippines) in 2010 estimated to have increased by approximately 18 % compared to effort in 2004.

40|$|The main {{target species}} of Japanese purse seine {{operated}} {{in the tropical}} waters of the Pacific Ocean is skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) consisted of nearly 98 % to their total catch weight and the remaining is bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) according to logbook. The recent study of the vertical distribution of the three species around <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> (fish aggregating devices) indicates that the skipjack tuna distribute relatively shallower depth layer.

Relationship of the species composition of purse seine catch and the depth of FADs was investigated by port samplings and by log book, of 17 sets and 65 sets, respectively from May to June 2007.

Among the three tagging methods {{used in this study}} (surgery, external hooks, underwater bait without capture), the latest resulted in residence times significantly shorter than the other ones, likely due to regurgitation. Dolphinfish tagged with the two other methods usually stayed several days associated to FADs (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 5. 09 days, mean 6. 25 days, SD 4. 39 days, maximum 15. 26 days), drifting with them. There {{was no significant difference in}} the residence times of dolphinfish in equatorial and tropical areas. While associated to FADs, dolphinfish spent most of their time close to floating object (< 365 m). The total time spent away from FADs was low (median 8 %), and likely corresponded to making feeding excursions. Dolphinfish did not form a single school while associated to a given FADs, but formed multiple small schools. FADs are likely to be sites with exchanges of individuals between schools. These results are discussed in regards to the possibility of FADs acting as ecological traps and the validity of meeting-point hypotheses as an explanation for fish aggregations under floating objects...|$|E

However, currently available acoustic receivers require physical recovery of the units to download stored data. Such operation is often difficult in remote study areas like in the open ocean. We present a new satellite-linked acoustic receiver (Vemco VR 3 -Argos) that allows downloading data through a satellite uplink (Argos). The VR 3 -Argos can last up to one year, sending GPS positions and tag data at regular time intervals. We illustrate the advantages of this new technology with tagging data from 121 fish of seven species (yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna, wahoo, dolphinfish, silky shark and oceanic triggerfish) caught and released around drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Western Indian Ocean, far from any land.

40|$|The {{silky shark}} Carcharhinus falciformis {{is the primary}} elasmobranch bycatch in the global tuna purse seine fishery using fish {{aggregating}} devices (FADs). Information on the associative behaviour of this species with floating objects remains limited. Here the use of various electronic tags provided important new insight into this behaviour. Thirty-eight juvenile silky sharks (69 to 116 cm total length; TL) were tagged with acoustic tags at 9 <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> equipped with satellite-linked acoustic receivers in the western Indian Ocean (total monitoring = 154 d). Presence/absence and swimming depth data were transmitted from the receivers. A subset of 17 individuals was also fitted with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs; n = 13), or internal archival tags (n = 4). Behavioural data were successfully collected from 20 of the tagged sharks, covering a total of 300 d. Fine-scale movements of one individual were observed by active tracking, lasting 2 h 46 min. Sharks remained associated with the FAD where they were tagged for extended periods (2. 84 to 30. 60 d, mean = 15. 69 d). Strong diel changes were observed in both FAD association and swimming depth. Typically, individuals moved away from FADs after sunset and returned later that night, then remained closely associated until the following evening. Vertical behaviour also changed around sunset, with sharks using fairly constant depths, > 25 m, {{during the day and}} switching to rapid vertical movements during the night, with descents > 250 m recorded.

40|$|Multibeam {{omnidirectional}} sonars are tools {{currently used}} by fishers, but also allow the monitoring of pelagic fish schools surrounding a platform. Multibeam processing methods now offer improved capacities for raw data storage. The Simrad SP 90 sonar {{was used for}} the detection of fish schools associated with drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs), and digital systems developed for the acquisition and processing of volume backscattering echoes and position data. Data sampling methods were defined based on two modes: one for periods searching for FADs and associated schools, and one for school monitoring in drifting mode. Validation of the detection of several FAD-associated schooling species was made by simultaneous visual observations or/and cross-checking with echosounder recordings. The characteristics of schooling behaviour in the targeted fish species are fundamental for the correct interpretation of acoustic data. Sonar detection threshold {{is the result of a}} compromise between fish number, size, species and the nearest neighbour distance (NND) of individuals per dynamic structure (school or shoal). Tuna schooling dynamics mean that NND can sometimes be too large to allow the presence of these fish to be detected, despite their number. Sonar data should be analysed and interpreted in a holistic manner, in combination with behaviour pattern and dynamics of all species around the <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs.</b> An autonomous sonar buoy prototype equipped with 360 scanning sonar coupled to video cameras will increase our understanding of tuna behaviour around drifting or anchored objects. A similar methodology can be applied to different kinds of platforms, either anchored or in permanent positions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the purse seine fishery in 2009 and 2010, with particular {{reference to the}} FAD closures that occurred in both years.

The main findings of the paper are: The incidence of reported activity related to use of <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> was considerably lower in 2010 (5. 1 %) compared to 2009 (13. 5 %); The use of fish aggregation lights was observed on some vessels with a similar incidence in 2009 (2. 2 %) and 2010 (2. 9 %); Total catch was below average during the 2009 closure and in September of the 2010 closure, although effort remained at around normal levels throughout both closures; The catches of bigeye tuna were strongly reduced during both closure periods compared to the other months of those years; The impacts of the closures on skipjack and yellowfin catches are more moderate; The proportions of associated sets conducted during the 2010 closure were close to zero, and compliance with the measure appears to have improved somewhat; In 2010, the proportions of catch and effort associated with FAD usage outside the closure period, particularly the months immediately before and after the closure, had lower FAD usage than is typically the case. This may be associated with the retrieval and re-deployment of FADs, although this needs to be verified by other data; While catches were reduced during the closures, the average size of the catch was higher for all species, particularly yellowfin, during the closures because of the larger average size of fish caught in unassociated sets. These larger average sizes may offset to some extent the loss of catch that occurs {{as a result of the}} closures...|$|E
40|$|The {{silky shark}} Carcharhinus falciformis forms the primary elasmobranch bycatch in tuna purse seine {{fisheries}} using fish aggregating devices (FADs) {{in all of}} the world’s tropical oceans. Its life-history traits of slow growth, late maturation and low fecundity make it vulnerable to over exploitation, as is apparent from historical bycatch trends. Very {{little is known about the}} associative behaviour of this species with floating objects, information which is essential in formulating effective mitigation and management measures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap through the use of various electronic tagging techniques in conjunction with dietary analysis. Dietary data were collected from 323 silky sharks incidentally caught at FADs. Approximately 40 percent of the diet consisted of prey associated with FADs while the remaining 60 percent were non-associated species of crustaceans, cephalopods and fishes. These results suggest that the associative behaviour is not primarily driven by trophic enhancement, but is likely a combination of predator avoidance, social interactions and feeding. Fine-scale behavioural data from silky sharks associated with <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> were collected through the use of acoustic telemetry techniques. Acoustic tags were implanted into 38 silky sharks (69 - 116 cm TL) at eight FADs. FADs were equipped with satellite linked acoustic receivers and abandoned to drift freely. Presence/absence and swimming depth data were telemetered via the Iridium satellite system. A total of 300 d of behavioural data were collected from 20 tagged individuals. Individuals remain associated with the same FAD for extended periods (min = 2. 84 d, max = 30. 60 d, mean = 15. 69 d). Strong diel patterns were observed in both association and swimming depth. Typically individuals moved away from FADs after sunset and return later during the night, then remain closely associated until the following evening. Vertical behaviour also changed around sunset with sharks using fairly constant depths, within the upper 25 m, during the day and switching to rapid vertical movements during the night, with dives in excess of 250 m recoded. Broader scale movement behaviour was investigated using pop-up archival satellite tags (PSATs). Tags were deployed on 46 silky sharks (86 - 224. 5 cm TL) for a total of 1495 d. Light data were used to calculate geolocation estimates and reconstruct the sharks’ trajectories. Movement patterns differed between animals and according to deployment duration. Several extensive horizontal movements were observed, with an average track length of 3240 km during an average tag deployment of 44. 02 d. Horizontal movement patterns were found to correlate very closely with drift patterns of FADs. Consequently, it appears that the movement behaviour of juvenile silky sharks is strongly influenced by the movement of <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> in this region. Ghost fishing of silky sharks through entanglement in FADs was also investigated using data derived from PSATs as well as underwater visual censuses. Thirteen per cent of the tagged sharks became entangled in FADs and entangled sharks were observed in 35 percent of the 51 FADs surveyed. Using this information in conjunction with estimated time that sharks remained entangled in the FAD (from depth data from PSATs), and scaling up according to estimates of FAD numbers, it was found that between 480 000 and 960 000 silky sharks are killed annually in this manner in the Indian Ocean. Subsequent management measures in this region prevent the deployment of FADs with netting that could lead to entanglement. Overall, floating objects appear to play a significant role in the juvenile life stages of silky sharks in this region. While their association with floating objects is clearly advantageous in an evolutionary sense, under current tuna fishery trends, this behaviour is certainly detrimental for the population...|$|E
40|$|Tropical tuna {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the largest worldwide, with some having significant bycatch issues. However, pole-and-line tuna fisheries are widely believed to have low bycatch rates, although these have rarely been quantified. The Maldives has an important pole-and-line fishery, targeting skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). In the Maldives, 106 pole-and-line tuna fishing days were observed between August 2014 and November 2015. During 161 fishing events, tuna catches amounted to 147 t: 72 % by weight was skipjack, 25 % yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and 3 % other tunas. Bycatch (all non-tuna species caught plus all tuna discards) amounted to 951 kg (0. 65 % of total tuna catch). Most of the bycatch (95 %) was utilized, and some bycatch was released alive, so dead discards were particularly low (0. 02 % of total tuna catch, or 22 kg per 100 t). Rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) together constituted 93 % of the bycatch. Live releases included small numbers of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) and seabirds (noddies, Anous tenuirostris and A. stolidus). Pole-and-line tuna fishing was conducted on free schools and schools associated with various objects (Maldivian anchored fish aggregating devices [aFADs], <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> from western Indian Ocean purse seine fisheries, other drifting objects and seamounts). Free school catches typically included {{a high proportion of}} large skipjack and significantly less bycatch. Associated schools produced more variable tuna catches and higher bycatch rates. Fishing trips in the south had significantly lower bycatch rates than those in the north. This study is the first to quantify bycatch rates in the Maldives pole-and-line tuna fishery and the influence of school association on catch composition. Ratio estimator methods suggest roughly 552. 6 t of bycatch and 27. 9 t of discards are caught annually in the fishery (based on 2015 national catch), much less than other Indian Ocean tuna fisheries, e. g. gillnet, purse-seine, and longline...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the implementation and effectiveness of key management measures for tropical tuna, using the most current data and stock assessments available. For the most part, these measures relate to CMM 2008 - 01, although where possible, consideration is given to elements of that CMM that have been continued in 2012, pending the development of a comprehensive replacement tropical tuna CMM scheduled for WCPFC 9 in December 2012. Implementation of CMM 2008 - 01 The implementation of the CMM was reviewed for its key components – purse seine effort, the FAD closure, the high seas pockets (HSP) closure, longline catches and catches by other fisheries. The main conclusions from the paper regarding implementation are as follows: Purse seine effort Purse seine effort has expanded continuously since the introduction of CMM 2008 - 01, with effort (excluding domestic purse seiners based in Indonesia and Philippines) in 2011 estimated to have increased by approximately 31 % compared to effort in 2004. Further, stock assessment results indicate that the effectiveness of the effort has typically increased on top of the increase in total effort. FAD closure and FAD usage The incidence of reported activity related to use of <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> during the FAD closures was considerably lower in 2010 and 2011 (6. 0 and 8. 2 %) compared to 2009 (16. 1 %). However, the observed incidence of vessels drifting at night with fish aggregation lights on increased from 2. 3 % in 2009 to 6. 8 % in 2010 and 3. 4 % in 2011. Effort remained at around normal levels throughout the closures. In 2010, the proportions of effort associated with FAD usage outside the closure period, particularly the months immediately before and after the closure, were lower than is typically the case. In 2011, overall FAD usage returned to more typical levels prior to the 2011 closure. It i...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} landings by tuna purse seine fishing vessels are taken around drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). Although these FADs {{and their use}} by the fishing industry to capture tropical tuna have been well documented, operative tools to collect data around them are now required. Acoustic, video, photographic and visual data were collected on fish aggregations around <b>drifting</b> <b>FADs</b> in offshore waters of the western Indian Ocean. Multibeam sonars, multifrequency echosounders, pole-mounted digital video camera and an automated 360 ° rotating digital photographic camera were deployed from a vessel {{in the vicinity of}} FADs, and their observation capability evaluated with underwater visual census made by divers. Two prototypes of instrumented buoys equipped with scanning sonar were tested providing positive results on their feasibility and operability as pelagic observatory. Acoustics methods combined with digital underwater video represent interesting possibilities to remotely study the composition and behaviour of these fish aggregations. The acoustic methods allowed the accurate description of the spatial organisation and dynamics of individual fishes, schools and biotic scattering layers around the FAD, but species identification was difficult. In situ visual, photographic and video observations systems permitted species identification within a range of 0 to ~ 25 m. However, scuba divers observations were more efficient compared to the photographic and video cameras at detecting the presence of certain fish species around FADs. Obviously both methods are complementary, since the acoustic methods could not identify most fish species and could not detect the presence of small fishes found less than 5 meters under the FAD. These fishes represent {{a small part of the}} overall biomass of fish aggregations but they are part of the biodiversity of pelagic ecosystems and may play a major role in ecological processes associated with FADs. The opportunity to incorporate observation tools into the development of future autonomous instrumented drifting buoys for remotely monitoring fish diversity and abundance in the pelagic ecosystems is presented. The perspective of autonomously collecting large amounts of basic information useful for ecological and fisheries studies in an ecosystemic approach for open sea or coastal pelagic environment is emphasized.
