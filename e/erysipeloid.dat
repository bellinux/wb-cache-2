50|$|Erysipelas is {{also the}} name given to an {{infection}} in animals caused by the bacterium Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. E. rhusiopathiae can also infect humans, but in that case the infection is known as <b>erysipeloid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Erysipeloid</b> is {{transmitted}} by several animals, particularly pigs, {{in which the}} disease (very common in the past) has several names (swine erysipelas in English, rouget du porc in French and mal rossino in Italian). Urticaria-like lesions, arthralgia, arthritis, endocarditis, and sepsis are the most characteristic features of swine erysipelas. Other animals that can transmit the infection are sheep, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, emus, scorpion fish, and lobsters.Erysipeloid is an occupational disease, mainly found in animal breeders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, furriers, butchers, fishermen, fishmongers, housewives, cooks, and grocers. One epidemic of <b>erysipeloid</b> was described in workers involved in manufacturing buttons from animal bone. The disease is of economic importance to the pig industries of North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.|$|E

5000|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, rod-shaped, nonspore-forming, nonacid-fast, nonmotile bacterium. The {{organism}} {{was first}} {{established as a}} human pathogen late in the 19th century. It may be isolated from soil, food scraps, and water contaminated by infected animals. It can survive in soil for several weeks. In pig faeces, the survival period of this bacterium ranges from 1 to 5 months. It grows aerobically and anaerobically and does not contain endotoxin. Distributed worldwide, E. rhusiopathiae is primarily considered an animal pathogen, causing a disease known as erysipelas in animals (and <b>erysipeloid</b> in humans - see below). Turkeys and pigs are most commonly affected, but cases {{have been reported in}} other birds, sheep, fish, and reptiles. In pigs, the disease is known as [...] "diamond skin disease".

40|$|SummaryWe {{report the}} {{epidemiological}} and clinical {{characteristics of the}} <b>erysipeloid</b> form of cutaneous leishmaniasis as well as its diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Case reportA 63 -year-old woman, with no medical history, presented with a one-month history of erythematous nasal swelling. The lesion appeared after an accidental trauma. Erythematous infiltrative plaque was noted on the center of the face. There were also crust formations on the traumatic region. Despite local treatment and oral antibiotherapy, there was no improvement. The diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis was confirmed by positive skin smears. Histopathological examinations of a skin biopsy showed no malignancy. The patient was treated intramuscularly with 10 mg/kg per day systemic meglumine antimoniate with partial regression of symptoms. ConclusionThe <b>erysipeloid</b> type is a rare and unusual presentation of cutaneous leishmaniasis that often causes late diagnosis. Diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of the parasite by skin smear, histopathological examination and polymerase chain reaction. There are various therapeutic options. The evolution is generally favourable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent times, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the number of reports for new and rare variants of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Here, we describe three unusual clinical forms of CL identified in Ecuadorian children. A total of 131 patients with CL were diagnosed over a 2 -year period of active search. In 3 (2. 29 %), the lesions were very unusual; these included <b>erysipeloid,</b> recidiva cutis (LRC), and disseminated leishmaniasis (DL). The <b>erysipeloid</b> case is charac-terized by erythematous and indurated plaque seen on the face of a 5 -year-old boy; the LRC one is differentiated by slowly progressing red-brown papules around large scars of healed sores in a 6 -year-old girl, and the DL case is characterized by dozens of cutaneous ulcers distributed in the whole body of a 1 -year-old girl. Leishmania parasites were isolated by lesion aspirate and analyzed by the technique multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). All three isolates were identified as Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis. These distinct clinical variants rarely have been reported previously in the American cutaneous leishmaniasis, and for the first time L. (V.) panamensis was identified as the etiologic agent. Our cases extend the spectrum of clinical presentations in New World leishmaniasis...|$|E

40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as a cause}} of infection in animals and man since the late 1880 s. It is the aetiological agent of swine erysipelas, and also causes economically important diseases in turkeys, chickens, ducks and emus, and other farmed animals such as sheep. The organism has the ability to persist for long periods in the environment and survive in marine locations. Infection in man is occupationally related, occurring principally as a result of contact with animals, their products or wastes. Human infection can take one of three forms: a mild cutaneous infection known as <b>erysipeloid,</b> a diffuse cutaneous form and a serious although rare systemic complication with septicaemia and endocarditis. While {{it has been suggested that}} the incidence of human infection could be declining because of technological advances in animal industries, infection still occurs in specific environments. Furthermore, infection by the organism may be under-diagnosed because of the resemblance it bears to other infections and the problems that may be encountered in isolation and identification. Diagnosis of <b>erysipeloid</b> can be difficult if not recognised clinically, as culture is lengthy and the organism resides deep in the skin. There have been recent advances in molecular approaches to diagnosis and in understanding of Erysipelothrix taxonomy and pathogenesis. Two PCR assays have been described for the diagnosis of swine erysipelas, one of which has been applied successfully to human samples. Treatment by oral and intramuscular penicillin is effective. However, containment and control procedures are far more effective ways to reduce infection in both man and animals...|$|E
40|$|Carcinoma erysipeloides (CE) is an {{uncommon}} but distinctive form of cutaneous metastasis that usually manifests clinically as a fixed erythematous patch or plaque resembling cellulitis or erysipelas.

40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a facultative, non-spore-forming, non-acid-fast, small, Gram-positive bacillus.

These include a localised cutaneous lesion form, <b>erysipeloid,</b> a generalised cutaneous form and a septicaemic form often associated with endocarditis. The organism is ubiquitous and able to persist {{for a long period}} of time in the environment, including marine locations. It is a pathogen or a commensal in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, birds and fish. Swine erysipelas caused by E. rhusiopathiae is the disease of greatest prevalence and economic importance. Diseases in other animals include erysipelas of farmed turkeys, chickens, ducks and emus, and polyarthritis in sheep and lambs. Infection due to E. rhusiopathiae in humans is occupationally related, principally occurring as a result of contact with contaminated animals, their products or wastes, or soil. <b>Erysipeloid</b> is the most common form of infections in humans.

Various virulence factors have been suggested as being involved in the pathogenicity of E. rhusiopathiae. The presence of a hyaluronidase and neuraminidase has been recognised, and it was shown that neuraminidase plays a significant role in bacterial attachment and subsequent invasion into host cells.

He recovered completely after aortic valve replacement and a 6 -week course of intravenous ceftriaxone. 1. Background Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a gram-positive rod causing swine erysipelas. It is a zoonotic infection in humans, with meat (swine) and fish handlers being at greatest risk. It most commonly causes <b>erysipeloid,</b> a localized cellulitis caused by direct bacterial invasion of cuts or abrasions in the skin.

40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a nonsporulating, gram-positive, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium {{which was}} identified more than 100 {{years ago as}} the etiologic agent of swine erysipelas. Since then, {{it has been found}} to cause infection in several dozen species of mammals and other animals. Humans become infected through exposure to infected or contaminated animals or animal products. By far {{the most common type of}} human infection is a localized, self-limited cutaneous lesion, <b>erysipeloid.</b> Diffuse cutaneous and systemic infections occur rarely. Approximately 50 cases of endocarditis have been reported; all but one recent case have involved native valves. The organism may be isolated from biopsy or blood specimens on standard culture media. It is identified by morphology, lack of motility, and biochemical characteristics; identification may be confirmed by the mouse protection test. It is susceptible to penicillins, cephalosporins, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but it is often resistant to many other antibiotics, including vancomycin, a drug frequently used in empiric therapy for infections due to gram-positive bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is {{pathogenic}} {{for both}} animals and humans, causing erysipelas in swine and <b>erysipeloid</b> in humans. In swine, disease may be either acute or chronic, {{resulting in the}} development of arthritis and endocarditis. In Japan, erysipelas remains an animal hygiene problem causing great economic loss as infected swine are disused. Human infection closely resembles that seen in swine, with both acute and chronic forms also. The most common presentation is <b>erysipeloid,</b> a localized cutaneous infection. In Western Australia, an erysipeloid-like infection referred to as "crayfish poisoning" occurs in lobster fishermen and handlers. A second type of presentation is a generalized cutaneous form involving lesions that progress from the initial site of infection or appear in remote areas. The third and most serious form of disease is a septicemia that is almost always linked to endocarditis. The mortality rate in Erysipelothrix endocarditis is still high (38 %) and {{can be explained by the}} use of vancomycin (to which Erysipelothrix spp. are inherently resistant) as empirical therapy. Therefore, it is critical to have an early diagnosis of E. rhusiopathiae infection. Unfortunately, several problems exist with the diagnosis of E. rhusiopathiae infections by conventional cultural procedures, and these infections are often incorrectly diagnosed. First, because of their very small colony size and slow growth rates, it is difficult to isolate E. rhusiopathiae from heavily contaminated specimens. Various selective media have been described to improve the isolation of E. rhusiopathiae from contaminated specimens; however, not all contaminants are inhibited. The development of two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods has created an opportunity to greatly improve the efficiency with which these organisms are detected and identified. Makino et al. designed a PCR method that amplifies a 407 -bp DNA fragment derived from the 16 S rRNA coding sequence. The primers in this method are specific for the genus Erysipelothrix and do not differentiate between the species. A second set of primers designed by Shimoji et al. amplifies a 937 -bp DNA fragment which is derived from a sequence associated with virulence of E. rhusiopathiae. These primers are specific for E. rhusiopathiae only. Shimoji et al. also utilized a selective enrichment medium based on tryptic soy broth containing ethidium bromide and sodium azide...|$|E
40|$|Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, a pleomorphic gram-positive bacillus, {{is found}} widely in nature or as a {{commensal}} pathogen. It infects domestic {{animals such as}} swine, {{which may be the}} major reservoir of the organism. E. rhusiopathiae is primarily an occupational illness; 89 % of the cases are linked to high-risk epidemiological situations. Humans that are infected by this bacillus typically present with one or a combination of the following symptoms: localized skin lesion (<b>erysipeloid),</b> diffuse cutaneous eruptions with systemic symptoms, or bacteremia, which is often followed by endocarditis. We report a case of E. rhusiopathiae bacteremia that was present without severe clinical illness such as endocarditis, arthritis, or skin lesions. The patient was a 64 -year-old male with a complicated past medical history including subclinical alcoholic liver disease. Penicillin-G therapy completely resolved the patients bacteremia. The case presented has exceptional clinical merit due to 2 key factors: the patient does not fit the occupational demographic typically affected by this bacterium, and the patient presented with subclinical septicemia, which has a high correlation with fatal endocarditis.

40|$|Aim: Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae {{causes the}} occupationally-related {{infection}} <b>erysipeloid</b> in humans, {{and may be}} responsible for infections in lobster fishermen in Western Australia. There are little recent data pertaining to antimicrobial susceptibility, or susceptibility to disinfectants that might be used in the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the susceptibility of E. rhusiopathiae from human, animal and environmental sources to various antimicrobial agents and disinfectants. Methods: The susceptibility of 60 E. rhusiopathiae isolates was determined using a recommended agar dilution procedure. Susceptibility to disinfectants was achieved using a broth microdilution method. Results: Penicillin and ceftriaxone, with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (MIC 90 0. 03 mg/l and 0. 125 mg/l, respectively), remained active against E. rhusiopathiae and should continue to be recommended for treatment. Ciprofloxacin MICs were particularly low (MIC 90 0. 06 mg/l), offering an alternative agent for the penicillin allergic patient. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is still resistant to vancomycin (MIC 90 64 mg/l), highlighting the importance of early diagnosis of E. rhusiopathiae infection in cases of endocarditis. In addition, 31 E. rhusiopathiae isolates were tested against several commercially available home disinfectants.

Twenty-one Erysipelothrix spp. were isolated from 52 seafood parts. Primary isolation of Erysipelothrix spp. was most efficiently achieved with brain heart infusion broth enrichment followed by subculture onto a selective brain heart infusion agar containing kanamycin, neomycin, and vancomycin after 48 h of incubation. Selective tryptic soy broth, with 48 h of incubation, was the best culture method for the detection of Erysipelothrix spp. with PCR. PCR detection was 50 % more sensitive than culture. E. rhusiopathiae was isolated from a variety of different fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, including a Western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus). There was no significant correlation between the origin of the seafoods tested and the distribution of E. rhusiopathiae. An organism indistinguishable from Erysipelothrix tonsillarum was isolated for the first time from an Australian oyster and a silver bream. Overall, Erysipelothrix spp. were widely distributed in Australasian seafoods, illustrating the potential for erysipeloid-like infections in fishermen...|$|E

40|$|E. rhusiopathiae is the causative {{agent of}} {{erysipelas}} in animals and <b>erysipeloid</b> in humans, but its pathogenicity is poorly understood. To identify virulence {{factors associated with}} E. rhusiopathiae and screen engineered vaccine candidates, we used proteomics and transcriptomics to compare the highly virulent strain HX 130709 with an isogenic avirulent derivative, HX 130709 a. 1, 299 proteins and 1, 673 transcribed genes were identified and 1, 292 of the proteins could be associated with genes. In a comparison between HX 130907 and HX 130709 a, 168 proteins and 475 genes exhibited differences in regulation level. Among these, levels for 61 proteins and transcripts were positively or negatively correlated. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggests {{that many of the}} down-regulated proteins in the attenuated strain have catalytic or binding functions. Potential protein-protein interactions suggest that some of the down-regulated proteins may regulate PTS, GMP synthase and ribosomal proteins. Morphological results showed that HX 130709 and HX 130709 a have similar colony and capsule morphology. Growth curves and pyruvate measurements suggest that TCA cycle and saccharide phosphorylation levels were decreased and gluconeogenesis was increased in HX 130709 a. Our study confirms that SpaA and neuraminidase, but not hyaluronidase and capsule, are associated with virulence in E. rhusiopathiae. We conclude that the virulence of E. rhusiopathiae may be associated with slow reactions of the TCA cycle and down-regulation of selected proteins...|$|E

Some of the Erysipelothrix spp. are the causative agents of <b>erysipeloid,</b> which is an occupational infection in humans. The aim {{of the present study}} was to isolate E. rhusiopathiae from animals as well as the hands of the butchers working in Ahvaz, Iran, and to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics. Methods: Totally, 150  samples were taken from slaughterhouse workers, fishermen, and livers and hearts of sheep and calves by the swabbing method. Phenotypical methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used for the isolation and identification of E. rhusiopathiae. The isolates were tested for their susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents using the disk diffusion protocol described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Results: Out of the 150  samples examined via phenotypical and biochemical tests, 16  samples were positive as putative Erysipelothrix spp. twelve cases out of the 16 putative Erysipelothrix spp. were confirmed by PCR. The tested isolates were highly sensitive to the antibiotics used. The results of the sensitivity and specificity of PCR revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of indirect PCR were higher than those of direct PCR. Conclusion: E. rhusiopathiae is widely distributed on seafood and presents as a commensal pathogen in nature and animals. Infection with this microorganism should be emphasized because it is a rare organism causing severe infections such as infectious endocarditis and polyarthritis following localized infections...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The term "leishmaniasis" {{defines a}} group of vector-borne {{diseases}} caused by species of the genus Leishmania and characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Parasite properties (infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence), host factors, and host responses regulate heterogeneous disease expression. Sicily {{is one of the}} major islands of the Mediterranean Basin and is considered to be a hypo-endemic area for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Leishmania infantum is the most common species on the island. METHODS: Fifty patients (both sexes and different ages) with lesions clinically suggestive of cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded over a 1 -year period. The diagnosis was based on positive slit-skin smear and histopathologic studies when needed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as test confirmation. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients had typical solitary lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Multiple lesions were present in five patients. In 20 patients, the lesions were very unusual, including <b>erysipeloid,</b> zosteriform, and lupoid leishmaniasis. The results of Leishmania isoenzyme characterization identified Leishmania infantum as the species responsible for the 20 atypical cases. CONCLUSION: The global number of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sicily has increased in recent years, and such increases can be explained, in part, by the fact that, in this region, sandflies are present during a large part of the year. This is a result of the climatic variation in recent years (increasing temperature and humidity). There has also been an increase in the number of new and rare variants of cutaneous leishmaniasis. A knowledge of the unusual clinical variants of cutaneous leishmaniasis, as well as classical forms, allows early detection...|$|E
