5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's <b>heat</b> <b>content.</b> The Earth has an internal <b>heat</b> <b>content</b> of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E
5|$|With weak {{steering}} currents {{provided by}} {{an area of}} high pressure to the north, the disturbance slowly moved towards the east-southeast. At 1500UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the disturbance which they designated as Tropical Cyclone 16S. With high oceanic <b>heat</b> <b>content,</b> low wind shear, and good divergence aloft, significant strengthening was likely. Early the next day, Météo-France upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression as winds increased to 55km/h (35mph 10-minute winds). However, in the post-season analysis, Météo-France determined that the system had become a depression about 12hours earlier and was already a moderate tropical storm {{by the time of}} the operation upgrade. At 0600UTC, Météo-France classified the depression as a moderate tropical storm and was given the name Hondo; a name submitted to the World Meteorological Organization by Zimbabwe. It was later determined that Hondo was already a severe tropical storm by the time it was named operationally.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{intensified}} {{through the}} night of August19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled eye. At 0100UTC August20, the storm passed 120mi (190km) {{to the south of}} Sea Buoy42056, which recorded a significant wave height of 36ft (11m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high <b>heat</b> <b>content,</b> and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160mph (260km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210mi (335km) from its first landfall.|$|E

5|$|Upon first forming, {{the system}} contended with the {{entrainment}} of dry {{air to the}} northwest of the storm, which was expected to limit intensification. The storm steadily intensified, and early on June 2 the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status. Later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu about 760km (470mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. As a mid-latitude trough developed over Pakistan, Gonu turned {{to the north and}} northeast, though it resumed a westward track after ridging built {{to the north of the}} storm. With a solid area of intense convection, it rapidly intensified to attain severe cyclonic status early on June 3, and with good outflow the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated. A well-defined eye developed in the center of convection, and after moving over a local increase in ocean <b>heat</b> <b>content,</b> Gonu rapidly deepened.|$|E
5|$|With {{very warm}} sea surface temperatures, high ocean <b>heat</b> <b>content,</b> low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly {{reached its peak}} {{intensity}} early on October16 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (215km/h). During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20mph (32km/h). Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50mph (85km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due {{to a combination of}} very high wind shear and dry air. By October17, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 2010, the Australian monsoon trough {{extended}} unusually {{far east}} over the southern Pacific Ocean. With above-average sea surface temperatures, {{stemming from a}} moderate-strength El Niño, multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across the region. An unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued, including four hurricane-strength storms: Oli, Pat, Rene, and Tomas. On February6, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a tropical depression, dubbed 09F, well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. Embedded within a well-developed trough, the system displayed curved convective banding features. Environmental conditions in the area, including low wind shear, high ocean <b>heat</b> <b>content,</b> and upper-level outflow, favored cyclogenesis. Additionally, an active Madden–Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development. Steady improvement of the system's convective structure ensued and early on February7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The low trekked generally east-southeast {{in response to a}} near-equatorial ridge anchored to the north. The storm's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5, indicating gale-force winds were likely present. Accordingly, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18:00UTC and dubbed it Tropical Cyclone 14P. Forecasters noted, however, that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates. The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone, assessing it as a Category1 on the Australian cyclone scale.|$|E

5|$|For several hours, steady {{strengthening}} {{continued as}} the depression maintained a westward track. Operationally, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Julia early on September13, though post-analysis confirmed {{the storm had}} reached winds of 40mph (65km/h) twelve hours after formation. For several hours, no significant change occurred in its intensity or organization as Julia passed near Cape Verde, though the storm gradually retraced to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a deep-layer ridge. Slow intensification resumed as the storm bypassed the Cape Verde islands; by early September14, it displayed a ragged, banded eye-like feature in satellite imagery. Due to locally high sea surface temperatures of about 28°C (82°F), a period of rapid intensification subsequently commenced; within hours, Julia attained Category 1 hurricane status. Though located over an area with relatively low oceanic <b>heat</b> <b>content,</b> Julia continued to intensify rapidly under low vertical wind shear and over favorable sea surface temperatures; as such, the hurricane was upgraded to Category2 status on September 15. In less than two hours, the hurricane deepened to reach Category3 intensity, becoming the fourth major hurricane of the season. The rapid intensification trend continued, and Julia eventually strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane six hours later. Based on satellite estimates, its winds peaked at 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg), though operationally estimated at 135mph (215km/h) and 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean passed {{south of}} Jamaica {{on the evening}} of August 19 and began to intensify again that night. Its eyewall {{replacement}} cycle was thought to be completed. A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August 20, but did not last long. The hurricane, still tracking west-northwest under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered high pressure system to the north, moved over waters with extremely high <b>heat</b> <b>content</b> and began to strengthen once again. The eyewall became even better defined during the day, and, at 8:35pm AST on August 20 (0035 August 21, UTC), Dean restrengthened to a Category 5 hurricane, the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall as a Category5 storm in Quintana Roo's Costa Maya region, 40mi (65km) northeast of the border between Mexico and Belize, and weakened on its way over land, reemerging on the western side of Yucatán as a Category1 storm. Dean regained strength as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico, and made its second landfall as a Category2 storm on August 22, at around 11:30 CDT, near Tecolutla, Veracruz, to the south of Tuxpan, where after it moved westward, losing strength and disintegrating over central Mexico. A small remnant circulation reached the Pacific Ocean, eventually moving northwestward around an anticyclone, roughly parallel to the Mexican coast and finally back inland over the southwestern United States, where it completely dissipated on August 27.|$|E

Numerical modeling of compressor using CFX has been performed for both steady and unsteady states.
