25|$|An {{integrated}} system has several technical advantages {{in comparison to}} towed barges. Traditionally tugs, being short in length, have to operate at relatively high Froude numbers resulting in <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> making resistance and the barges, being towed in the tugs' wake, have skegs that improve directional stability but increase drag. Positioning the tug behind the barge in a stern notch improves the hydrodynamic efficiency of the combination, resulting in significant reductions in the total resistance. In addition the tug, operating {{in the wake of}} the barge, has better control over the combination and thus improves seaworthiness and maneuverability in comparison to the traditional towing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> action. There are myriad {{ways in which the}} organisms prevent dislodgement due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|E
500|$|Sea palms {{are found}} on the rocky shores of western North America, from {{as far north as}} Vancouver Island, to the {{southern}} central coast of California. [...] They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in very wavy areas. [...] <b>High</b> <b>wave</b> action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus, allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize. [...] In addition, the constant wave action removes competitors, such as the California mussel. [...] Recent studies have shown that Postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists. A control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes. [...] Alternatively, it is thought that the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as Corallina or Halosaccion, allowing Postelsia to grow freely after wave action removes the mussels.|$|E

2500|$|Shoreline type is {{classified}} by rank {{depending on how}} easy the target site would be to clean up, how long the oil would persist, and how sensitive the shoreline is. [...] The floating oil slicks put the shoreline at particular risk when they eventually come ashore, covering the substrate with oil. [...] The differing substrates between shoreline types vary in their response to oiling, and influence the type of cleanup that {{will be required to}} effectively decontaminate the shoreline. [...] In 1995, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration extended ESI maps to lakes, rivers, and estuary shoreline types. [...] The exposure the shoreline has to wave energy and tides, substrate type, and slope of the shoreline are also taken into account—in addition to biological productivity and sensitivity. [...] The productivity of the shoreline habitat is also taken into account when determining ESI ranking. [...] Mangroves and marshes tend to have higher ESI rankings due to the potentially long-lasting and damaging effects of both the oil contamination and cleanup actions. [...] Impermeable and exposed surfaces with <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> action are ranked lower due to the reflecting waves keeping oil from coming onshore, and the speed at which natural processes will remove the oil.|$|E
60|$|On the 30th of November, we were {{preparing}} for our return to Silhet, and our canoes were loading, {{when we were}} surprised by a loud rushing noise, and saw a <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> coming down the river, swamping every boat that remained on its banks, whilst most of those that pushed out into the stream, escaped with a violent rocking.

Happily our dried collections were not embarked, and the hot sun repaired much of the damage.|$|E
40|$|In recent several years, {{extremely}} <b>high</b> <b>waves</b> occasionally {{struck the}} Korean {{coast of the}} East Sea and caused severe coastal disasters almost every winter season. In this paper, characteristics of such <b>high</b> <b>waves</b> are reported by analyzing wave records collected at multiple stations along {{the east coast of}} Korea. Meteorological data obtained at relevant weather stations were also used in the analysis. The reason for appearance of the <b>high</b> <b>waves</b> was identified as the strong northeasters due to extra-tropical low pressure systems that had been rapidly developing in the East Sea. The general mechanism concerning the formation and spatial evolution of such strong low pressure systems was more clearly understood through the synthetic analysis of the wave and meteorological data. In particular, the influence of spatiotemporal features of the low pressure system on the resulting characteristics of the <b>high</b> <b>waves</b> was described in more detail in this study. Since the overall wave direction was also northeast, the first wave arrival time on the coastline became later for a wave station whose latitude is lower. At present, however, the arrival time of such <b>high</b> <b>waves</b> on the coast as well as their intrinsic characteristics such as wave height and period are not satisfactorily predicted by the daily weather forecast. Hence, it is necessary to enhance predictability of the <b>high</b> <b>waves</b> by investigating developmental mechanisms of the strong low pressure system in the winter season more thoroughly...|$|R

60|$|The tides of the sea--as the {{two great}} flowings and ebbings of the water every twenty-four hours are called--are caused principally by the {{attractive}} influence of the moon, which, to a small extent, lifts {{the waters of the}} ocean towards it, as it passes over them, and thus causes a <b>high</b> <b>wave.</b> This wave, or current, when it swells up on the land, forms high tide. When the moon's influence has completely passed away, it is low tide. The moon raises this wave wherever it passes; not only in the ocean directly under it, but, strange to say, it causes a similar wave {{on the opposite side of}} the globe. Thus there are two waves always following the moon, and hence the two high tides in the twenty-four hours. This second wave has been accounted for in the following way: The cohesion of particles of water is easily overcome. The moon, in passing over the sea, separates the particles by her attractive power, and draws the surface of the sea away from the solid globe. But the moon also attracts the earth itself, and draws it away from the water on its opposite side thus causing the <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> there, as represented in the diagram, figure 1.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{now take}} a {{retrospective}} glance at the situation. The ship Nupple-duck, (Abersouth, master) had, it will be remembered, gone down with all on board except me.

60|$|The key {{to every}} man is his thought. Sturdy and defying though he look, {{he has a}} helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all his facts are classified. He can only be {{reformed}} by showing him a new idea which commands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving circle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and that without end. The extent to which this generation of circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on the force or truth of the individual soul. For it is the inert effort of each thought, having formed itself into a circular wave of circumstance,--as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a local usage, a religious rite,--to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify and hem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over that boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep, which also runs up into a <b>high</b> <b>wave,</b> with attempt again to stop and to bind. But the heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and narrowest pulses, it already tends outward with a vast force and to immense and innumerable expansions.|$|E
60|$|There we all sat, {{while the}} ship blazed and {{crackled}} away, before us. She drifted {{faster than we}} did, and so got {{farther and farther away}} from us. The fire lighted up the sea for a good distance, and every time we rose {{on the top of a}} wave, some of us looked about to see if we could see anything of the other boats. But we saw nothing of them. Once I caught sight of a black spot on a <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> at quite a distance, which I thought might be a boat, but no one else saw it, and it was gone in an instant. The captain said it made no real difference to us whether we saw the other boats or not; they could not help us. All the help we had to expect was from some passing ship, which might see us, and pick us up. He was very encouraging, though, about this, for he said we were right in the track of vessels bound North, which all sought the Gulf Stream; and, besides, a burning ship at night would attract the attention of vessels at a great distance, and some of them would be sure to make for us.|$|E
60|$|But {{in all his}} moods, sane or insane, {{intolerant}} or stoical, {{he never}} really doubted this: that the machine held him as light and as hopelessly as he had from his birth been held by the hopeless cosmos of his own creed. He knew well the ruthless and inexhaustible resources of our scientific civilization. He no more expected rescue from a medical certificate than rescue from the solar system. In many of his Robinson Crusoe moods he thought kindly of MacIan as of some quarrelsome school-fellow who had long been dead. He thought of leaving in the cell when he died a rigid record of his opinions, and {{when he began to}} write them down on scraps of envelope in his pocket, he was startled to discover how much they had changed. Then he remembered the Beauchamp Tower, and tried to write his blazing scepticism on the wall, and discovered that it was all shiny tiles on which nothing could be either drawn or carved. Then for an instant there hung and broke above him like a <b>high</b> <b>wave</b> the whole horror of scientific imprisonment, which manages to deny a man not only liberty, but every accidental comfort of bondage. In the old filthy dungeons men could carve their prayers or protests in the rock. Here the white and slippery walls escaped even from bearing witness. The old prisoners could make a pet of a mouse or a beetle strayed out of a hole. Here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice. There was no natural corruption and no merciful decay by which a living thing could enter in. Then James Turnbull looked up and saw the high invincible hatefulness of the society in which he lived, and saw the hatefulness of something else also, which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believed. But all the time he had never once doubted that the five sides of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward, and it gave him a shock of surprise even to discover the faint light through the aperture in the ventilation tube. But he had forgotten how close efficiency has to pack everything together and how easily, therefore, a pipe here or there may leak.|$|E
