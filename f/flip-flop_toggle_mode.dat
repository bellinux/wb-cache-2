The contract allows Vitesse to enhance the capabilities of its VIP- 2 process, selected for its ability to enhance speed, power, performance, circuit reliability and production-worthy manufacturing practices required for the DARPA specification. InP technology allows direct digital synthesis of high-frequency signals, simplifying the system design and reducing the number of discrete components required in advanced satellite, aircraft and terrestrial communication systems. Vitesse will collaborate with BAE Systems on the design of communications circuits; initially, these are for direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) for electronic warfare and radar applications. UIUC will focus on research for the next-generation transistor structures meant to further extend circuit performance and applications. A factor of two improvements in critical performance parameters has already been attained in early VIP- 2 experiments at 0. 45 μ.

40|$|Spinal pathologies or {{injuries}} can severely {{compromise the}} quality of life for the patients. The surgical intervention is often performed using internal fixation devices. Fixation with pedicle screws is a well-established method providing spinal stability and deformity correction. However, reported rates of fixation failure because of screw loosening have become a major concern, especially with the appearance of new and more powerful surgical techniques. Numerous experimental studies have been devoted to pedicle screw fixation strength evaluation. The evaluation methods are commonly including preoperative measurements of bone mineral density, screw insertional torque measurement and pullout tests. Bone mineral density measurement gives only to some extent an estimation of the pedicle screw fixation strength. Several studies indicated that the screw insertional torque measurement can provide predictive information on the fixation strength. However, the latter was not confirmed by other studies. This controversy illustrates the need for improving the understanding of factors related to pedicle screw fixation strength. In addition, there is a need for better understanding the mechanisms of pedicle screw loosening leading to failure and their effects on the fixation strength. The main objective of this doctoral thesis was to improve the understanding on the mechanisms of pedicle screw loosening and the factors related to pedicle screw fixation strength. This objective is related to two hypotheses: 1) the indentation force measured while performing the pilot hole and the torque observed during screw insertion are related to the screw pullout force and stiffness; 2) cyclic bending load (toggling) on pedicle screw in craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral (ML) directions loosens the screw and affects the pullout force and stiffness. Three specific objectives were defined to verify the hypotheses using two experimental protocols. The first specific objective was to develop and validate tools measuring the indentation force while performing the pilot hole and the insertional torque during pedicle screw insertion. The second objective was to compare the screw loosening mechanisms through <b>toggling</b> in different <b>modes</b> and evaluate their effects on pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness. Finally, the third objective was to establish the relationships between the indentation force, the insertional torque and the screw pullout force and stiffness. The first protocol was performed on synthetic bone surrogates mainly to explore the first specific objective. Furthermore, to account for the effect of various bone densities and <b>toggling</b> <b>modes</b> on pullout force and stiffness, pedicle screw were pulled out with and without toggling from synthetic bone surrogates of three different densities. With five repetitions, a total of 36 trials have been completed. Finally, potential relationships between the indentation force and the insertional torque with the pullout force and stiffness were explored. The second protocol was performed on porcine vertebrae to investigate the second and the third specific objectives. As the second specific objective, three <b>toggling</b> <b>modes</b> (CC, ML and no toggling (NT)) were performed on porcine lumbar vertebrae ranging from L 1 to L 3. The screws were then submitted to axial pullout test. A complete design of experiment with two factors and three levels (32 = 9 trials) was used to investigate on the main effect of <b>toggling</b> <b>mode</b> and vertebral level on screw pullout force and stiffness, as well as their quadratic interactions. With five repetitions, a total of 54 trials were performed on 27 isolated vertebrae, using both pedicles. Finally, potential relationships were investigated between the indentation force while performing a pilot hole, the insertional torque during screw insertion, and the pullout force and stiffness with and without toggling. The results of the first protocol suggest that screw toggling significantly affects the pullout force (P = 0. 01) and stiffness (P < 0. 0001). A higher pullout force and stiffness was demonstrated for higher density without toggling. The effect of density was higher than the effect of toggling on pullout force. The indentation force while performing the pilot hole was significantly correlated to pullout force and stiffness (r = 0. 99, P < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 92, P < 0. 0001 respectively). Strong correlations were also shown between the insertional torque during screw insertion and the pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 91, P < 0. 0001 respectively). The study on porcine vertebrae showed that screw toggling significantly affects the pullout force (P = 0. 0004) and stiffness (P 0. 85, P < 0. 0001). For pullout force without toggling BMD and pedicle area were the main contributing factors to the regression model. For the stiffness with and without toggling, the indentation force was the single best factor with highest contribution to the regression model. In conclusion, pedicle screw toggling significantly affects the pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness. Screw toggling, in particular CC toggling, should be considered in the biomechanical evaluation of pedicle screw fixation strength. Furthermore, the contribution of toggling was more important on the stiffness than the pullout force. The effect of vertebral level should be considered in determining the fixation strength. The developed instruments and methods for indentation force measurement during pilot hole creation and insertional torque measurement during screw insertion were reproducible, and provide valuable data to estimate pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness. The relationship between the pilot hole indentation force and screw insertional torque, and the screw pullout force and stiffness are a affected by the <b>toggling</b> <b>mode.</b> Indentation force and insertional torque measurements, together with BMD measurement, are recommended for a better estimation of pedicle screw fixation strength after CC toggling...|$|R
