500|$|Three {{days before}} the season's premiere, Mel B made {{comments}} about the other judges, labelling them dishonest and boring. She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so</b> otherwise she deserves a slap." [...] Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following day and said, [...] "They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as well take that bloody crown." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the run-up}} of the 2001 general election, after a six-year spell in opposition, which Berlusconi called [...] "the {{crossing}} of the desert", he managed to re-unite the coalition under the [...] "House of Freedoms" [...] banner. According to its leader, the alliance was a [...] "broad democratic arch, composed of the democratic right, namely AN, the great democratic centre, namely Forza Italia, CCD and CDU, and the democratic left represented by the League, the New PSI, the PRI and, at least <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so,</b> Cossiga".|$|E
2500|$|The concert {{begins with}} Harrison {{taking to the}} stage alone and {{addressing}} the audience, his comment [...] "We've got a good show lined up – well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so</b> anyway..." [...] alluding to {{the speed with which}} the event was organised. He then introduces the first group of musicians, led by Shankar, who, like Harrison, attempts to convey the intricacies of Indian classical music to the audience, as well as outlining the reason for this [...] "special benefit concert". Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan proceed to tune their instruments and then stop after about 90 seconds. The audience, apparently believing they have heard an entire piece, respond with enthusiastic applause, to which Shankar replies: [...] "Thank you, if you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more." [...] The four musicians then launch into a fifteen-minute dhun.|$|E
60|$|I {{was very}} much frightened, and said, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>so,</b> if he pleased. I felt, all this while, as if my ear were blazing; he pinched it so hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nick must {{certainly}} come, {{as well as}} dear Biddy, whom <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>so</b> much to find," [...] Peter pronounced. [...] "Because I'm going away--I don't {{know when}} I, shall see them again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'POSTSCRIPTUM.--This {{position}} will scarcely be as remunerative as <b>I</b> <b>hoped,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> {{am glad to}} be able to earn {{a little}} outside, enough to buy you a present that will make your pretty eyes shine.' ...|$|R
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> Tarleton: I'm beyond measure humiliated and {{annoyed by}} my son's {{behavior}} in your house. I had better take him home.|$|E
60|$|Are there Fairies {{as well as}} Bunyips in Australia? <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so</b> (a pause). You won't find Foxon Falls a bad old town.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} that <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>so</b> {{and went to}} our quarters where I found an excellent meal ready cooked and with it a stone flagon, {{of the contents of}} which Billali said we were all three to drink by the command of Ayesha, who declared that it would take away our weariness.|$|R
60|$|TIM. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> not <b>so,</b> good neighbor. Pray, {{for your}} poor children's sake, do not so unwomanly cast away yourself.|$|R
60|$|Tim. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> not <b>so,</b> good neighbour; pray, {{for your}} poor children's sakes, do not so unwomanly cast away yourself.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> I'm {{going back}} to Newcastle this afternoon, there's nothing doing here.|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> Anyhow, out he goes! Out of the army! He or I.|$|E
60|$|UNCLE TITUS. Well, I hope he {{will have}} the grace not to come. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
60|$|Carefully I {{climbed to}} a sitting posture across the anchor's arms. I {{wondered}} if by chance the vessel might be deserted. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>so.</b> Or possibly it might {{belong to a}} friendly people, and have wandered by accident almost within the clutches of the pirates and the therns. The {{fact that it was}} retreating from the scene of battle lent colour to this hypothesis.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> little had <b>I</b> <b>hoped,</b> <b>so</b> {{much had}} <b>I</b> feared; {{there was a}} fulness of delight in this taste of fruition--such, perhaps, as many a human being passes through life without ever knowing. The poor English teacher in the frosty garret, reading by a dim candle {{guttering}} in the wintry air, a letter simply good-natured--nothing more; though that good-nature then seemed to me godlike--was happier than most queens in palaces.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I am {{content with}} that, my boy. You will stay here now a few days, <b>I</b> <b>hope.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>so</b> much {{to hear of}} your life, and of course I wish to become better acquainted with you.” ...|$|R
60|$|CROFTS. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> [Vivie reappears {{with two}} more chairs. He hurries to her assistance]. Allow me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> I should {{break my}} heart otherwise. But can you wonder that Papa should wish for some delay and some proof?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so, too. I am sure <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> Because you {{remember}} what the ride to Long Valley did to Miss Spencer," [...] rejoined Glenn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahuh! Wal, I'm sorry, Abel, {{your family}} had {{to lose in}} this. Maybe Ted's not bad hurt. <b>I</b> shore <b>hope</b> <b>so....</b> An' y'u an' Jim keep out of the fight, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> {{have had}} much doubt about this, {{and have been}} sorely perplexed; but now <b>I</b> do <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> Frank--Mr Gresham--" [...] and then Dr Thorne rose from his chair; but was, for a moment, unable {{to go on with}} his tale.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Devon--Christie--forgive me that I did {{not trust}} you sooner. It was so hard to tell; <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>so</b> much from time; I never could believe that my poor {{children}} would be made the victims of my mistake. Do not forsake us: Helen loves you so. Stay with her, I implore you, and let a most unhappy mother plead for a most unhappy child." [...] Then Christie went to the poor woman, and earnestly assured her of her love and loyalty; for now she felt doubly bound to them because they trusted her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> But I {{had better}} go home! It was {{but the other}} day that my sister told me I had become so used to the prison that I had its tone and character. It must be so. I am sure it must be when I see these things. My place is there. I am better there, it is unfeeling in me to be here, when I can do the least thing there. Good-bye. I had far better stay at home!' ...|$|E
6000|$|PURDIE. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> But I {{think now}} of special little ways of giving her pleasure. That never-to-be-forgotten {{day when we}} first met, you and I! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, my dear, we {{are doing}} very well;--at least, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> But you are old enough now to {{understand}} {{that this is a very}} serious matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our old {{chief is}} full of the right spirit. He is losing power with the young men, but I think he can still guide them. <b>I</b> will <b>hope</b> <b>so,</b> and we will return {{as soon as we}} can." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> didn't <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> They all crowded up {{and leaned}} over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, {{watching}} with all their might. I could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The letter shall {{certainly}} be burnt, {{if you believe}} it essential {{to the preservation of}} my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> quite <b>so</b> easily changed as that implies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Going to the glass.] <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> By Jove, what {{a strong}} light. You must be pretty sure of your {{complexion}} {{to be able}} to stand that.|$|E
60|$|O genuine, and inimitable (at least <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so)</b> Warburton! This note of thine, if but {{one in five}} millions, {{would be}} half a one too much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>so,</b> but I'm afraid you'll be disappointed," [...] {{answered}} Leeds. He {{was a new}} pupil, and was of {{a decidedly}} pessimistic turn of mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you," [...] {{she said}} simply, [...] "I have seen nobody except the doctor once, and the {{undertaker}} twice. It is dreadful to sit alone hour after hour {{face to face with}} the irretrievable. If I had not been so foolish as to enter into that agreement with Messrs. Meeson, I could have got the money by selling my new book easily enough; and I should have been able to take Jeannie abroad, and I believe that she would have lived--at least <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>so.</b> But now it is finished, and cannot be helped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> only <b>hoped</b> <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> feared I {{might be}} wrong. But I began to find holding myself back {{was getting too}} hard, and I was afraid {{somebody}} else might come along who {{had the power to}} rouse you. I believe you can be roused." ...|$|R
60|$|Be it <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> it is <b>so.</b> But I {{think that}} it is not so easy to believe it as we fancy.|$|R
