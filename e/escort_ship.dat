5|$|Washington next {{participated in}} the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, serving again as a carrier <b>escort</b> <b>ship,</b> though she was {{detached}} on the 13th to fire on Japanese positions on Saipan and Tinian. With the sortie {{of a majority of}} the remaining ships in the Imperial Japanese Navy spotted by American submarines, Washington, along with six other battleships, four heavy cruisers and fourteen destroyers covered the aircraft carriers of TF58; on the 19th, with the attack of many aircraft, the Battle of the Philippine Sea began. Able to beat off the attacks, Washington refueled and continued escorting carriers until she, with three battleships and escorts, formed a new task group. After a lengthy stop at Enewetak Atoll, she supported troops assaulting Peleliu and Angaur before returning to screening duties. This duty lasted from 10 October to 17 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|The German {{military}} {{then turned}} its attention westward, and in April 1940 invaded Denmark. Schleswig-Holstein {{was assigned to}} the naval component of the invasion force. During the invasion, the ship was briefly grounded off the Danish coast. Following the operation, she was transferred back to training duties, as the flagship of the Chief of Training Units. At the end of 1943, the reactivation of Schleswig-Holstein was once again contemplated. In her favor was the fact that she retained some coal-fired boilers, given the ever-worsening oil-supply situation. Thus, on 1 February 1944 she was once again recommissioned, at first taking up her old role as a cadet training ship, then later in the year docking at Gotenhafen (Gdynia) for a refit. She was to be converted into a convoy <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> with a greatly enhanced anti-aircraft armament, but after being hit three times by Royal Air Force bombers on 18 December 1944, she eventually foundered in shallow water. As the ship was permanently disabled, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg.|$|E

50|$|One early {{maritime}} {{application of}} this technique was used with an aircraft carrier and its <b>escort</b> <b>ships.</b> Because the aircraft carrier physically dwarfed the other vessels its radar return was much larger making it relatively easy for a radar operator to pick it out as a target. <b>Escort</b> <b>ships</b> were fitted with blip enhance transmitters that received and amplified the radar signal so {{that all of the}} <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> looked like they were aircraft carrier-sized targets. When all the <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> activated their blip enhance transmitters, all the ships blips grew on the radar display masking the true aircraft carrier blip, and confusing any attempt to target the aircraft carrier for a missile attack.|$|R

25|$|Yaeyama was refit at Cavite Naval Yards as an anti-submarine convoy <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> in December 1943, {{with all}} minelaying rails removed and {{replaced}} by 36 depth charges, and was reassigned to the First Southern Expeditionary Fleet. She escorted a convoy of transports from Manila to Singapore in January 1944, and a convoy from Manila to Halmahera Island in May 1944.|$|E

25|$|In February 1944, Katoomba ended her escort duties, {{and after}} a short period on patrol, was sent to Sydney for refitting. Upon her return to New Guinea waters in early May 1944, the {{corvette}} was assigned as an anti-submarine patrol ship. She remained in this role until the start of March 1945, although during this period she was occasionally used as an <b>escort</b> <b>ship.</b> The corvette returned to Australian waters, spent three months in Fremantle, then was assigned to Darwin, where she operated {{until the end of}} World War II.|$|E
25|$|At 1.50am on April 27, 1975, the North Vietnamese {{landed on}} the island and the fight for Phú Quý Island began. Caught by {{surprise}} South Vietnamese units retreated to the administrative center of the island, where they organized their defenses in an attempt to push back the North Vietnamese forces. While at sea, the RVN's HQ-11 <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> clashed with boats from the VPN 125th Navy Transport Brigate, but ultimately the long-range artillery used by the VPN proved too much for the HQ-11 and it retreated from the island with significant damages. After several hours of waiting, the commander of the HQ-11 decided to pull anchor and escaped to the Philippines when further reinforcements from the RVN failed to arrive. At 6.30am remnants of the ARVN gave up and ended their resistance. The North Vietnamese claimed to have captured 382 ARVN prisoners, and collected more than 900 weapons of various kinds.|$|E
25|$|The destroyer's first mission after {{completing}} sea trials in October 1941 was {{to deliver a}} British trade union delegation from Iceland to Russia. Norman then spent some time as an <b>escort</b> <b>ship,</b> then sailed to Southampton for minor modifications. At the start of 1942, the destroyer {{was assigned to the}} British Eastern Fleet. From January until May, Norman served as a convoy escort in the Indian Ocean, before being recalled to participate in the convoy escort screen for Operation Vigorous, one of two major convoys attempting to supply the island of Malta. After this, she returned to the Indian Ocean, and during September was involved in the Madagascar Campaign. The destroyer spent the remainder of 1942, all of 1943, and the early part of 1944 on uneventful patrols of the Indian Ocean. In late March 1944, Norman sailed to Sydney for a two-month-long refit. This concluded in late June, and Norman returned to the Eastern Fleet.|$|E

The other Japanese vessels known to have taken part in the mission was the seaplane tender Kiyokawa Maru, the destroyer Kashi, the escort ships Tsushima, Daito, Kume, Shonan, CD No. 9 and CD No. 61. There was also the submarine chaser No. 156, five oilers, Arita Maru, Toa Maru, Hishidate Maru, Marii Maru, Otowasan Maru and three landing craft depot ships, Shinshu Maru, Kibitsu Maru and Mayasan Maru. The landing craft depot ships were carrying hundreds of men and supplies of the Imperial Japanese Army 23rd Division from Manchuria and were directed to separate from the main convoy at Mako and reinforce the Japanese army engaged in the Philippines Campaign. The rest of the convoy would then continue on to Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Merten {{was posted}} {{to the light}} cruiser Karlsruhe (21 September 1935– 7 March 1937), serving as the 2nd {{artillery}} officer and watch officer. On 1 April 1936, Merten was promoted to Kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) and on 2 October 1936 received the Wehrmacht Long Service Award 4th Class, which had been created on 16 March 1936, for four years of military service. In back-to-back assignments, he was briefly transferred to the light cruiser Leipzig (8 March– 20 May 1937), serving as the anti-aircraft artillery officer, and then again on Karlsruhe (21 May– 11 June 1937). On Karlsruhe and Leipzig he participated in the Kriegsmarines non-intervention patrols of the Spanish Civil War. For this service he received the Spanish Cross in Bronze on 20 April 1938. Merten led a Star sailing boat training course (21 July– 29 September 1937) and was then given command of the <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> F-7 (30 September 1937– 12 February 1939).|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1779, {{a convoy}} of more than 50 ships, which had been trading with ports in the Baltic, had set sail from a {{rendezvous}} off the Norwegian coast {{at the mouth of}} the Skagerrak channel to cross the North Sea. Some ships left the convoy before Britain came in sight, heading for northern ports such as Leith and the River Tyne. When the Yorkshire coast was sighted early on 23 September, just over 40 remained, mostly carrying iron or timber (often in the form of planks and masts for ships), bound for ports all around the southern half of the British Isles, from Hull round to Bristol, and Waterford in Ireland. Although the Baltic convoy had received a warning from Scarborough that an enemy squadron was in the vicinity, some ships ignored the signals (by both flags and guns) from the 44-gun <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> HMS Serapis to stay close for protection. Early in the afternoon, as they approached Flamborough Head, the lookouts of the foremost ships saw the danger in Bridlington Bay for themselves. Hastily tacking, they attempted to run for the safety of Scarborough. Serapis put on all sail to get between the fleeing merchant vessels and a potential attack from the Franco-American squadron, while the smaller Countess of Scarborough (a hired armed vessel built by private subscription and hired to the Admiralty for escort duty) shepherded the convoy. About 4pm, with the whole convoy to his north, and the squadron of strangers clearly in sight to the south, Captain Richard Pearson of the Serapis signalled the Countess of Scarborough to join him. As the squadron caught up, the Royal Navy vessels made sure to position themselves so that the presumed enemy could not easily sail round them to reach the slower merchant ships.|$|E

500|$|Of the {{original}} squadron only two ships returned to France immediately: Vétéran had separated {{before the storm}} and Captain Bonaparte, assisted by a specially selected veteran crew, managed to intercept a convoy travelling from Quebec to Britain escorted only by the 22-gun [...] under Captain Robert Howe Bromley on 10 August. Although Bromley made {{a desperate attempt to}} draw off the French ship of the line, Vétéran ignored the small <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> and seized six merchant vessels, setting them on fire. Champion and the transport Osborne escaped, accompanied by nine other merchant ships. On 26 August 26 days after he deserted Willaumez's squadron, Bonaparte was nearing the French coast when he was chased by the 80-gun [...] under Captain Willoughby Lake and the frigates [...] and [...] under Captains William Robert Broughton and Thomas Baker. Closely pursued, the reliable officers placed under Bonaparte abandoned the intended destination of Lorient and instead used their expert local knowledge to direct Vétéran to the tiny port of Concarneau, the first time a ship of the line had ever successfully anchored in the harbour. Although another captain might have been court martialed for abandoning his admiral without orders or permission, the Emperor's brother was instead praised for intercepting the Quebec convoy and promoted soon afterwards. The other surviving ship of Willaumez's squadron was Cassard, which passed through the hurricane relatively intact and made its way to Europe alone, arriving at Rochefort several weeks later.|$|E
