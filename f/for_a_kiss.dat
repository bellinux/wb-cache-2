5|$|Meanwhile, Hans has led a {{group of}} {{soldiers}} to the ice palace. Elsa's defenses are not enough and she is taken back to Arendelle's dungeon unconscious. At the castle, Anna's request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> is denied by Hans, who reveals their engagement was merely a ploy to seize the throne of Arendelle. He locks Anna in her room without a fire, leaving her to die. Hans falsely claims that Anna is already dead and that they spoke their marriage vows before she died, making him the ruler of Arendelle. Olaf aids Anna while revealing to her Kristoff's love for her. Elsa also escapes into the fjord, her fears triggering a massive blizzard, but breaks down in shock when Hans tells her that she killed Anna and the blizzard stops. While {{the end of the}} storm allows Anna to reunite with Kristoff, she sees Hans ready to kill Elsa, and with her final breath, she stops him from killing her sister and inadvertently knocks him unconscious just as she freezes solid—a result of the earlier accident.|$|E

50|$|For this solo project, Eva O {{wanted to}} write a dark concept album about angels and began searching for {{literature}} about the subject, and the album was initially entitled Angels Fall <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Demon's <b>Kiss.</b> After reading through books that approached the subject from a new age point of view, Eva decided to look for more traditional sources and read Billy Graham's book titled Angels. After reading the book, Eva realized the hierarchy of angels and rewrote the album, titling it Demons Fall <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Angel's <b>Kiss.</b>|$|R

500|$|Part of {{creating}} the new identity for Warriors of Rock was by creating the game's Quest mode. Activision contacted Gene Simmons, who initially thought the company was asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>KISS</b> song {{to be included in}} the game. Instead, when Simmons learned they wanted him to be the narrator and the voice of the Demigod, he became very interested in the project feeling that the Demigod character had elements of his own stage personality in it. Activision also approached the members of Rush for inclusion of [...] "2112", and the group provided inspiration and feedback on the Rush-themed venues that [...] "2112" [...] is played in within the game. The developers also approached Dave Mustaine of Megadeth to write the music for the game's final boss battle. [...] The Quest mode also gave Activision the opportunity to explore the characters that have been in the series since its inception but otherwise only used as player avatar. The developers were able to expand on these existing designs and gave each one a unique venue and setlist throughout the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began on September 20, 2012, with shots of Jepsen on set of the music video {{surfacing}} online the same day. She was pictured {{wearing a pair of}} leather pants along with a red-black corset and a silver chain hanging from her waist. The singer said she is aiming to show a more mature side with the music video. On October 8, 2012, a 24-second teaser was uploaded to YouTube featuring Jepsen performing the track at a party, falling for a guy in a grey beanie and then jumping into a swimming pool with him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss.</b> Two weeks later, the singer tweeted, [...] "the music video for This Kiss is coming soooo soon! Until then here is a little preview. Hope you enjoy it! Mwah x," [...] followed by the link of the teaser. A lyric video, which [...] "channels the familiar opening credits of the classic show Saved By The Bell" [...] as noted by Carl Williot of Idolator, was released on October 18, 2012. The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After they come out of the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). The guy is immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts the}} young Jesus assisting Joseph in his workshop. Joseph {{is making a}} door, which is laid upon his carpentry work-table. Jesus has cut his hand on an exposed nail, symbolizing the stigmata and foreshadowing Jesus' crucifixion. Some of the blood has fallen onto his foot. As Jesus' grandmother, Anne, removes the nail {{with a pair of}} pincers, his concerned mother, Mary, offers her cheek <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss.</b> Joseph examines Jesus' wounded hand. A young boy, who would later be known as John the Baptist, brings in water to wash the wound, prefiguring his later baptism of Christ. An assistant of Joseph's, who represents Jesus' future Apostles, observes these events.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1998, the reunited group issued Psycho Circus. Although it was {{the first}} album with the {{original}} lineup since 1979's Dynasty, the contributions of Frehley and Criss were minimal. While the images of Frehley and Criss are featured prominently on the album, most of the lead guitar work was later revealed to have been performed by future band member Tommy Thayer. Former member Kulick made an appearance on the intro of the song [...] "Within". Most drum duties were handled by session musician Kevin Valentine. Despite the controversy, the album achieved a No. 3 chart debut, the highest position <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Kiss</b> album until Sonic Boom debuted at No. 2 in 2009. The title track received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The Psycho Circus Tour opened at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on Halloween in 1998, and was simulcast on FM radio across the U.S. It proved to be another success, and was historic for being the first to ever incorporate 3D visuals into a stage show.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 128 is {{comparable}} to the sonnet in Romeo and Juliet in which Romeo pleads for a first kiss. Like that pilgrim/saint tête-à-tête, this sonnet is set in a public musical celebration. Shakespeare watches his dark lady play the keyboard virginal (or Bassano built clavichord), captivated by her back swaying with the melody. Like Romeo, he longs <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kiss,</b> but in this sonnet he envies the jacks (wooden keys) that the lady's playing fingers [...] "tickle" [...] while trilling the notes. Perhaps he also envies the other men (Jacks) standing around the lady. Surely, this is an amusing scene to Shakespeare because he secretly is having an affair with the dark lady. He decides not to envy those keys—although he would like to be tickled as they are—but hopes instead to receive a kiss on his lips. Fred Blick points out that this plea for a [...] "kiss", leaving the fingers to the jacks, is a compromise, just as the tuning of the virginal or other keyboard instrument is, in musical temperament, a compromise.|$|E

50|$|Tired of Rozz getting most of {{the credit}} for the Shadow Project work (much of which she wrote), Eva O went solo and {{released}} Past Time in 1993 on Cleopatra Records.

In 1994, she began working on her second solo album, which she was originally going to call Angels Fall <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Demon's <b>Kiss,</b> but after studying more about the classic hierarchy of angels {{on both sides of the}} good-vs-evil spectrum, she ended up becoming a Christian and rewriting the entire record and renaming it Demons Fall <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Angel's <b>Kiss.</b> Produced by Johnny Indovina, the album was tamer and calmer in comparison to her previous rugged and wild material.|$|R
