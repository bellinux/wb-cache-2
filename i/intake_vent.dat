50|$|While {{the power}} supply (PSU) {{contains}} a fan with few exceptions, {{it is not}} to be used for case ventilation. The hotter the PSU's intake air is, the hotter the PSU gets. As the PSU temperature rises, the conductivity of its internal components decrease. Decreased conductivity means that the PSU will convert more of the input electric energy into thermal energy (heat). This cycle of increasing temperature and decreased efficiency continues until the PSU either overheats, or its cooling fan is spinning fast enough to keep the PSU adequately supplied with comparatively cool air. The PSU is mainly bottom-mounted in modern PCs, having its own dedicated intake and exhaust vents, preferably with a dust filter in its <b>intake</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|E
30|$|The overall running effect {{shows that}} the {{temperature}} controlled on working face is steady, around 26 – 29  °C, compared with the average temperature on working face before operating the system, which decreases by 4 – 6  °C after operating our system; relative humidity of intake wind decreases most after passing HEMS-II cooling device, relative humidity of roadway wind continuously rises when conveyed to working face, the relative humidity at controlling point C is 96.4  %, and that at air <b>intake</b> <b>vent</b> is 83  %. Relative humidity on working face before operating the system is 100  %, so after operating the system the relative humidity decreases by 3.6  %– 17  %, largely improving the working environment for workers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work employs FDS to {{simulate}} the heating process of a tunnel-type dryer and visualizes the computational results using Smokeview. The inappropriate design of a tunnel-type dryer in a factory has motivated this work. This poorly designed dryer not only has caused terrible fuel consumption but also produced parts {{some of which are}} under- or over-cooked. These are caused by the terribly uneven temperature distribution within the dryer. In order to improve the evenness of temperature distribution, this work simulates and investigates the effects of various ventilation schemes. Based on the results, it is found that the hot air <b>intake</b> <b>vent</b> should be placed at the bottom whereas the cold air outtake vent at the top. The flow rate through the intake vents does not have a very significant effect on the temperature distribution after 40 s...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that legionnaires ' disease can betransmitted to suscepti-ble. hosts by contaminated aerosolized water from cooling towers and evaporative condensers; however, epidemic strains of Legionella have not been isolated by air sampling at such sites dur-ing epidemiologic investigations. An outbreak of legionnaires ' disease occurred at a retirement hotel; Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from an evaporative condenser and from potable water. A case-control study showed that the only significant exposure risk was in area A. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated during air sampling near the evaporative condenser exhaust site, the air conditioning <b>intake</b> <b>vent,</b> and an air vent in area A, but not in shower stalls. Monoclonal antibody subtype patterns of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates from patients matched those from the evaporative condenser but not from shower water. Air sampling and monoclonal antibody subtyping results support epidemiologic evidence that the evaporative con-denser was the source of this outbreak.

50|$|Attic heat {{is caused}} by the sun baking down on the roof surface. This {{sunlight}} causes the roofing material to heat up, thus transferring the heat into the attic via thermal transfer. The buildup of heat is generally dissipated by normal convection, i.e.: as the air is heated it expands and rises, flowing out of the attic through vents placed at or near the peak, while fresh air is pulled into the attic from <b>intake</b> <b>vents</b> that are generally in the eave (soffit) area. However, most roof vents are inadequate at expelling the heat and require the use of a powered vent fan to remove heat effectively. A solar powered attic fan is an effective way to remove attic heat using only the power of the sun to run the fan.|$|R

50|$|In {{appearance}} the car {{remains very}} similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile {{similar to those of the}} Carrera GT, Porsche's mid-engined supercar. The <b>intake</b> <b>vents</b> on the sides of the Boxster are now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches have been enlarged to allow wheels up to 19 inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series. The most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor. The base engine is a 2.7 L 176 kW (240 hp) flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2 L 206 kW (280 hp) engine. The Cayman 2-door fastback coupé is derived from the 987.|$|R

50|$|In many vehicles, a {{crankcase}} breather pipe feeds {{into the air}} <b>intake</b> to <b>vent</b> the crankcase without releasing raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into the crankcase. This creates an excess oil mist, which is then drawn from the crankcase into the air intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this oil mist as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more oil mist to be {{forced out of the}} crankcase and into the engine, and a positive feedback loop is created. The engine quickly reaches a point where it is generating so much fuel from its own crankcase oil that it can sustain operation even with the normal fuel supply shut off, and it will run faster and faster until it is destroyed.|$|R
50|$|The Sagaris {{made its}} debut at the MPH03 Auto Show in 2003. The {{pre-production}} model was then shown at the 2004 Birmingham Motorshow. In 2005 the production model was released for public sale at TVR dealerships around the world. Based on the TVR T350, the Sagaris was designed with endurance racing in mind. Several design features of the production model lend themselves to TVR's intentions to use the car for such racing. The multitude of air <b>vents,</b> <b>intake</b> openings and other features on the bodywork allow the car to be driven for {{extended periods of time}} on race tracks with no modifications required for cooling and ventilation. The final production model came with several variations from the pre-production show models e.g. the vents on the wings are not cut out, different wing mirrors, location of the fuel filler and bonnet hinges. There are other subtle differences as well.|$|R
50|$|A key {{attribute}} of fifth-generation fighters {{is a small}} radar cross-section. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced {{to the point where}} it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing IR signatures, especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, thermoset and thermoplastic materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover <b>intake</b> and cooling <b>vents,</b> heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the Northrop YF-23), and coating internal and external metal areas with radar-absorbent materials and paint (RAM/RAP).|$|R
40|$|This is the thirty-third column {{inspired}} by a DOE report covering energy-saving HVAC&R technologies. Most commercial buildings use mechanical systems to ventilate and cool commercial buildings. In contrast, a building with natural ventilation (NV) relies on natural forces, primarily wind and thermal buoyancy, to move air to ventilate and cool buildings. The two basic approaches to NV are cross and stack ventilation. 1, 2 In both cases, the build-ing designs allow for suffi cient volume of outdoor air (OA) to fl ow through building spaces. NV buildings typically have more complex façade and window systems, such as operable (including automated) windows, dedicated air <b>intakes,</b> and roof <b>vents</b> to effectively control building airfl ows. Cross-ventilated buildings rely upon outdoor wind forces to generate a pressure gradient {{from one side of}} the building to another that drives OA through open windows (or other air intake devices) on the high-pressure side of the building and ou...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of fuel-cell technology to aircraft propulsion and/or energy supply is becoming {{of great interest}} for undoubted advantages in terms of pollution emissions and noise, features particularly important for commuter airplanes that usually take off and land from and in urban areas. The conversion of conventional aircraft into more/all-electric one tends {{to be based on}} the installation of such innovative systems. A better understanding of problems related to fuel cells applied to aeronautics is sought by the European Commission funded project environmentally friendly intercity aircraft powered by fuel cells ENFICA-FC. The main objective of the ENFICA-FC project is to develop and to validate the use of a fuel-cell based power system for propulsion of an all-electric aircraft. The fuel-cell system will be installed in a light sport aircraft Rapid 200 that will be flown and performance tested as a proof of functionality and future applicability. Specific aspects have to be investigated in the onboard installation of the innovative system and new design indications have to be pointed out in order to fulfill the conversion. One of the key items under investigation is the simulation of existing cooling system and the evaluation of motor and fuel-cell temperature; the temperature has to be maintained within the limits established by manufacturers of critical systems during all likely operating conditions as indicated by aeronautic regulations for general aviation. The computational problem addressed in this paper is the numerical computational fluid dynamics CFD simulation of the existing air-cooling system that satisfies air request for cooling and venting. An engineering model has been developed and it is used to support air inlet and outlet design. The flow is reasonably approximated by a potential flow plus boundary layer; hence, total upstream pressure losses are neglected except for those within the thin boundary layer. Pressure recovery of incoming cooling air and pressure coefficient distribution have been studied by using VSAERO panel code, and the optimal position of cooling and <b>venting</b> <b>intakes</b> is defined according to aerodynamic results. Propeller effects are included by referring to an optimal propeller specifically designed for the ENFICA-FC project.
