2500|$|Stanley is Eddie's next-door neighbor, who {{is obsessed}} with Raven. He serves as the primary {{antagonist}} of the show, he has a frenemy relationship with Eddie and Cory, although he is usually seen scamming them. Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes {{much more interested in}} Raven, and in one episode, Loka. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, but <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> lot of things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He appears primarily in Seasons 3 and 4, in the episodes [...] "Opportunity Shocks"; [...] "Taken to the Cleaners"; [...] "The Grill Next Door"; [...] "Mr. Perfect"; [...] "The Four Aces"; [...] "Driving Miss Lazy"; [...] "Sister Act"; [...] "Checkin' Out"; [...] "Fur Better or Worse" [...] and [...] "When 6021 Met 4267". He also appeared in the Cory in the House episode [...] "Uninvited Pest" [...] when he covets the Presidential medal Cory was going to receive for his Young Businessperson of the Year project. He got into the [...] "Up with Goodness" [...] program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has a fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1826, Ibrahim managed to capture the marshes around the city, {{although}} not without heavy losses. He thus cut the Greeks off from the sea and blocked off their supply route. Despite the Egyptians and the Turks offering them terms to stop the attacks, the Greeks refused, and continued to fight. On 22 April, the Greeks decided to sail from the city during the night, with 3,000 men, to cut {{a path through the}} Egyptian lines and allow 6,000 women, children and non-combatants to follow. However, a Bulgarian deserter informed Ibrahim of the Greeks' intention, and he had his entire army deployed; only 1,800 Greeks managed to cut their way through the Egyptian lines. Between 3,000 and 4,000 women and children were enslaved and {{many of the people who}} remained behind decided to blow themselves up with gunpowder rather than be enslaved. The news that the Third Siege of Missolonghi had ended in an Ottoman victory sparked horror all over Greece; at the National Assembly, Kolokotronis was giving a speech when the news of Missolonghi's fall reached him, leaving him to remember: [...] "the news came to us that Missolonghi was lost. We were all plunged into great grief; for half an hour there was so complete a silence that no one would have thought there was a living soul present; each of us was revolving in his mind how great was our misfortune". The American philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe, serving as a doctor with the Greeks, wrote back to America: [...] "I write you with an almost breaking heart. Missolonghi has fallen!", which he called [...] "damning proof of the selfish indifference of the Christian world. You may talk to me of national policy and the necessity of neutrality, but <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> curse upon such a policy!". The news of Missolonghi's fall had a huge impact on the rest of Europe, sparking a vast outpouring of songs, poems, essays, sermons and plays in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, with the recurring image of Missolonghi's fall being the murder of a sweet and innocent young Greek woman at the hands of the Turks as a symbol of the unwillingness of the Christian powers of the world to do anything for the Greeks. In May 1826, Hastings arrived in Greece with a British-built steamship, the Karteria (Perseverance), which astonished the Greeks to see a ship powered by steam and did not move either via sail or oars. The Karteria suffered from constant engine breakdowns, but Hastings was able to use the ship successfully twice over the course of the next two years, at Volos and in the Gulf of Corinth.|$|E
