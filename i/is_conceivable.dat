5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting {{to make peace with}} the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that Ímar {{received}} {{some form of}} support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, {{and one of his}} first royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that such a medium {{could be used in}} the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} {{aid from}} in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. It <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well. That being said, {{there are several reasons}} to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
5|$|If Lǫgmaðr {{was indeed}} a crusader, it is {{uncertain}} which particular crusade he undertook. One possibility is that he {{took part in the}} First Crusade, a movement that reached its climax with the successful siege and capture of Jerusalem in mid 1099. Lǫgmaðr could have embarked upon this enterprise in about 1096, the year the pope's calls reached England, and perhaps joined Robert's assembling forces that summer. Alternately, in light of Lǫgmaðr's capture by the Norwegians in 1098, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that his release from custody was made conditional upon his exile and participation in the First Crusade. On the other hand, it is not impossible that Lǫgmaðr originally undertook a pilgrimage before catching wind of the crusade en route. Whatever the case, if Lǫgmaðr indeed participated and perished in the First Crusade, he may have met his end on campaign in Syria or Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Guðrøðr's {{authority}} in the Hebrides is unknown due to his apparent coexistence with Gilli, and to the uncertainty of Orcadian encroachment. Guðrøðr's successor is likewise uncertain. On one hand, {{he may have been}} succeeded by his son, Rǫgnvaldr (died 1004/1005). Although it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that either Gilli or Sigurðr capitalised on Guðrøðr's death, and extended their overlordship as far south as Mann, possible after-effects such as these are uncorroborated. Although it is possible that Gilli controlled the Hebrides whilst Guðrøðr ruled Mann, the title accorded to the latter on his death could indicate otherwise. If so, the chronology of Gilli's subordination to Sigurðr may actually date to the period after Rǫgnvaldr's death in 1004/1005.|$|E

5|$|Ælfgar's Irish confederate of 1055 is not {{identified}} in any source, {{and it is}} not clear that Diarmait had a part to play in the aforesaid events of that year. In fact, it is possible that Ælfgar received aid not from Diarmait, but from DonnchadDiarmait's enemy and Echmarcach's associatea man who then controlled the Norse-Gaelic enclaves of Limerick and possibly Waterford. Furthermore, although Diarmait appears to have gained overlordship of Mann by 1061, Echmarcach presumably enjoyed overlordship of at least part of the Hebrides in 1058. Since Magnús utilised Islesmen during his English campaign of that year, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that Echmarcach may have played a prominent part in these operations. If Echmarcach was indeed involved in the campaign, the enmity between him and Diarmait could indicate that these two were unlikely to have cooperated as allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China <b>is</b> <b>conceivable.</b> Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.|$|E

40|$|One {{powerful}} {{argument for}} dualism {{is provided by}} Chalmers: the ‘zombie’ or conceivability argument. This paper aims to establish that if one adopts the ‘Powerful Qualities’ account of properties developed by Martin and Heil, this argument can be resisted at the first premise: the claim that zombies <b>are</b> <b>conceivable</b> <b>is,</b> by the lights of Chalmers’ own account of conceivability, false. The Powerful Qualities account is outlined. Chalmers’ argument, and several distinctions which underlie it, are explained. It is argued that {{to make sense of}} the claim that zombies <b>are</b> <b>conceivable,</b> some account of properties must be given. The paper's central claim is presented and defended from potential responses: given the Powerful Qualities view, zombies are in fact inconceivable. Finally, an error theory is presented, which offers an explanation of why so many have taken the conceivability of zombies to be unproblematic, and the view is briefly contrasted with Russellian monism...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I inquire whether the zombie-argument is sound, and thus whether it refutes physicalism of the mind. I {{do so by}} {{investigating}} the two controversial premises of the argument, namely (P 1) zombies <b>are</b> <b>conceivable,</b> and (P 2) if zombies <b>are</b> <b>conceivable,</b> then zombies <b>are</b> metaphysically possible. The {{first part of the}} thesis consists of an introduction in the subject. In the second part I discuss the first premise of the zombie-argument, and conclude that it is sound. In the third part I discuss the second premise of the zombie-argument, and, on the basis of Stephen Yablo's argument and my argument, I conclude that the second premise isn't sound. Therefore, the zombie-argument isn't sound, and physicalism of the mind is not refuted by it...|$|R

25|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Fergus' ecclesiastical patronage is uncertain. On one hand, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> {{that he was}} imitating or {{competing with}} the extensive patronage of the Scottish monarchy. On the other hand, familial connections with the rulers of England and the Isles could have {{played a part in}} his ecclesiastical interests. Contact with influential ecclesiasts like Máel Máedoc and Ailred could have also inspired Fergus' benefactions.|$|E
25|$|Although a fully {{mechanistic}} {{life support}} system <b>is</b> <b>conceivable,</b> a closed ecological system is generally proposed for life support. The Biosphere 2 project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people {{for at least a}} year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.|$|E
40|$|Does osmotic {{pressure}} stimulate assembly or disassembly of supramolecules in vesicles? Self-assembly <b>was</b> <b>conceivable</b> as intravesicular response to osmotic shrinking upon application of extravesicular overpressure, whereas disassembly <b>was</b> <b>conceivable</b> {{as a response}} to bilayer stress in hyperosmotic vesicles. Self-assembly of guanosine 5 '-monophosphates (GMPs) into G-quartets was selected to investigate the nature of remote control of supramolecular chemistry within vesicles by {{osmotic pressure}}. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy to selectively detect G-quartets, we found that extravesicular overpressure stimulates intravesicular self-assembly, whereas underpressure stimulates disassembly. G-quartet self-assembly by osmotic pressure exhibited ion-selective metal-cation templation, as expected. The key conclusions are that supramolecular chemistry within vesicles is governed by vesicle shape rather than vesicle stress and that detection of osmotic pressure by CD spectroscopy is an interesting alternative to the commonly used methods based on fluorescence self-quenching...|$|R

25|$|Although {{all living}} things on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as a solvent, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than hydrocarbons, however, water is more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
25|$|While often {{likened to}} St. Paul's Cathedral in London, it <b>is</b> <b>conceivable</b> that the {{greatest}} influence behind this great structure was Benoit Haffreingue. During Petre's formative years studying under Haffreingue in France, Haffreingue had been {{the driving force of}} the reconstruction of the Basilica of Notre-Dame in Boulogne-sur-Mer, a French cathedral that has a very similar plan to that of The Blessed Sacrament, including the controversial siting of the dome over the altar rather than the centre of the cathedral.|$|E

In December 1471 Pope Sixtus IV ordered the present sculpture to be transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, and the twins were added some time around then. The Capitoline Wolf joined a number of other genuinely ancient sculptures transferred at the same time, to form the nucleus of the Capitoline Museum.|$|E
