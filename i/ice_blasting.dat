25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{mechanical}} uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry ice pellets are shot from a nozzle with compressed air, combining {{the power of the}} speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, water blasting or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable. Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced as a method of removing smoke damage from structures after fires.|$|E
2500|$|Dry ice is {{typically}} produced in three standard forms: large blocks, cylindrical small (5/8 or 1/2 inch diameter) pellets and cylindrical tiny (1/8 inch diameter), high surface to volume pellets that float on oil or water {{and do not}} stick to skin because of their high radii of curvature. Tiny dry ice pellets are used primarily for <b>ice</b> <b>blasting,</b> quick freezing, fire fighting, oil solidifying and {{have been found to}} be safe for experimentation by middle school students wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment such as gloves and safety glasses. A standard block weighing approximately 30kg covered in a taped paper wrapping is most common. These are commonly used in shipping, because they sublime relatively slowly due to a low ratio of surface area to volume. Pellets are around [...] in diameter and can be bagged easily. This form is suited to small scale use, for example at grocery stores and laboratories where it is stored in a thickly insulated chest.|$|E

In March 2015, the company was re-launched and re-branded as Coulson <b>Ice</b> <b>Blast.</b> The Coulson <b>Ice</b> <b>Blast</b> team {{is a group of}} specialized industry experts to cater to the various industries and educate customers on the advantages of the refined <b>ice</b> <b>blast</b> technology.

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blasting</b> {{can be used}} to {{effectively}} clean many different surfaces and has applications across multiple industries. It has an appeal because of its minimal water usage and the absence of chemical ingredients to provide an eco-friendly cleaning solution.

50|$|Dry-ice {{blasting}} {{can be used}} {{to clean}} food processing equipment to effectively decontaminate surfaces of Salmonella enteritidis, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes such that these microorganisms are not detectable using conventional microbiological methods. It may also be used to clean some equipment without disassembly and without producing fire or electrical hazards. The EPA recommends dry <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> as an alternative to many types of solvent-based cleaning. Dry <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> can clean numerous objects with differing, complex geometries at once. Due to the blast media sublimating without residue dry <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> finds use in the semiconductor and aerospace industries.|$|E

50|$|In paint-stripping, <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> {{is used to}} {{overcome}} the cohesive bond of the coating. Depending on the paint or makeup of the bond, some coatings cannot be cleaned. <b>Ice</b> <b>blasting</b> is especially useful in removing lead paint, as it poses the least danger. <b>Ice</b> <b>blasting</b> has {{the lowest level of}} airborne contaminants for blasting technology in removing lead paint. Ice particles produce a blast mist, which helps to suppress dust or airborne particulates to minimize unintended dispersion. This characteristic of ice blast is of particular interest in terms of worker health and safety in the abatement process of asbestos and lead-based paint.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blasting</b> (or wet-ice blasting, frozen-ice blasting, {{water-ice}} blasting) {{is a form}} of non-abrasive blasting where frozen water {{particles are}} combined with compressed air and propelled towards a surface for cleaning purposes.Blasting can be performed in different mediums. An alternate method of non-abrasive blasting is dry <b>ice</b> <b>blasting</b> using frozen CO2. Other forms of abrasive blasting use mediums such as sand, plastic beads, and baking soda.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blasting</b> {{technology}} {{allows for}} thorough and efficient cleaning for molds {{in a wide}} range of industries, including tire manufacturing, automotive production, and packaging plants. Since the method is non-abrasive, the cleanings will not damage molding surfaces. <b>Ice</b> <b>blasting</b> can be used on hot or cold molds, reducing the downtime in production facilities. Ice sublimates on impact, so entrapment of the blasting media is not a concern. Grit entrapment is the reason abrasive media such as sand cannot be used to clean online.|$|E

The company created environmentally-friendly solutions to industrial cleaning needs. UIB held four patents two of which were issued in 1999, one was issued in 2001 and one was issued in 2003. These patents cover the method and equipment for manufacturing, transport, and continuous delivery of ice particles to a nozzle to do continuous ice blast cleaning work on various surfaces.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blast</b> is not abrasive. It {{does not}} remove {{strongly}} adherent tough coatings like abrasive media would. However, <b>ice</b> <b>blast</b> can remove coatings with weakened adhesion resulting from coating defects or corrosion. As an ice particle impacts on a coating, it causes a compressive {{stress on the}} coating and target system. On impact, the ice particle melts. The coating and target system under compressive stress will react in the opposite direction, producing a tensile stress. When the tensile stress exceeds the coating adhesion force, coating lifting takes place. The lifted coating is in the force of chips and would be carried by the residual water.|$|R

If Freeze's hand, <b>Ice</b> <b>Blast,</b> or <b>ice</b> sword comes in contact with energy blasts from some of his opponents, [...] "neutral energy" [...] blasts will turn to ice and reflect back to the creator.
