[...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E

Tydeman resigned from the project to protect his company from possibly liability, but helped the committee come up with a new, safer design. The committee considered piercing the plywood panels to allow wind to travel through, but Jones said [...] "some of the wood could have splintered apart and taken someone's head off". Jones called A.P. Heller, the Reading-based company that built the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, and sought advice from the son of the man who owned the firm when the work was done. The son suggested shortening the candle would allow it to withstand the wind, but also delivered a message from his father: [...] "He wants to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> want to cover up his work?"

They packed hurriedly, while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis. Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi. When asked why they were leaving, Lennon replied [...] "If you're so cosmic, you'll know why". Paul Mason, a biographer of the Maharishi, later interpreted Lennon's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi's claim of cosmic consciousness. Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. According to Mardas: [...] "John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, [...] "I am only human". But Lennon said he was [...] "a bit rough to him" [...] and the Maharishi responded by saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>you</b> must tell me." [...] While waiting for Mardas to return, Lennon wrote the song [...] "Maharishi", which was later renamed [...] "Sexy Sadie" [...] because Harrison advised Lennon that was potentially libellous.

[...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck.

Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing {{one of his own}} men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that [...] "...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of." [...] Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode [...] "See No Evil", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: [...] "Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die if you and I don't stop him."

[...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved."
