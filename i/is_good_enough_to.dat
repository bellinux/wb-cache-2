5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E

The move came after New Zealand lost a two-Test series to Australia 2-0, in which Redmond scored 115 runs {{at an average}} of 28.75. Former New Zealand cricket captain, Martin Crowe stated that he did not believe that Redmond <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> play Test cricket, but has conceded that his first year in Test cricket in which he {{averaged}} 23.00 in seven matches had been a difficult one. In December 2013 he was recalled into the Test side in the home series against the West Indies.|$|E

500|$|When Ward {{decided to}} try out for the {{football}} team as a sophomore, Michigan track fans worried that Ward would be injured. The Associated Press reported: “University of Michigan track fans do a lot of worrying these days because a Negro boy from Detroit insists on playing football. Willis Ward, they believe, will be the greatest track man ever to compete for the Maize and Blue—if he doesn’t get hurt. [...] … Ward is a good football player and loves the game[...] [...] [...] Well wishers even have told him about the advantages of competing only in track and staying away from the gridiron, but he is determined to play on the eleven, and he <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make the grade.” [...] Michigan’s track coach, Chuck Hoyt, noted that “Ward is his own boss and football is his recreation.” ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E

In The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan ranking of the fifty best episodes of 2002, it was placed 17th. David Bianculli, a writer for New York Daily News, said the pilot [...] "not only establishes the character of Monk, it establishes the perfect tone for the show, a delicate but deft blend of wry humor and tender drama." [...] United Feature Syndicate's critic Kevin McDonough praised the [...] "whimsical" [...] direction, and added [...] "Monk is not easy to love, but shines as a funny and fresh alternative to summer reruns." [...] It was also called [...] "fresh and funny" [...] by Entertainment Weeklys Bruce Fretts, and a [...] "invigorating" [...] "fresh spring breeze {{in the middle of}} summer" [...] by The Washington Posts Tom Shales. Varietys Phil Gallo praised the [...] "breezy gait of the storytelling, the nicely explained quirks of a brilliant mind and Tony Shalhoub's sterling characterization" [...] in his review. Tom Gliatto, a Peoples critic, declared [...] "This is probably not a clinically accurate portrayal of an OCD sufferer, but Shalhoub's gentle earnestness keeps it from being gimmicky." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman praised how OCD was used [...] "creatively from humor to sadness." [...] Chris Hicks of Deseret News declared, [...] "this pilot episode <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be a theatrical film; in fact, it's better than most features — funny, warm, character-driven and loaded with hilarious vignettes." ...|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Vibe magazine's Jason King {{said that}} the album {{occasionally}} [...] "sounds desperate to reach every demographic". Kelefa Sanneh, writing in The New York Times, felt that it missed the harmonies Beyoncé had in Destiny's Child records and that she is more effective [...] "when she's got a posse behind her". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it [...] "a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent". Uncut called its ballads [...] "self-pitying/self-mythologising", while Q stated, [...] "She has good songs, but no great songs". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it [...] "demonstrates vocal finesse [...] But, especially on the ballads, [...] often drags things out with diva acrobatics". The Guardians Adam Sweeting wrote that [...] "the desperate urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul-ballad {{means that there is}} barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy" [...] as the album's highlights and quippedly remarked, [...] "Dangerously in Love ... with her daddy, the bonus cut reveals—as if we didn't know." [...] He gave the album a one-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that [...] "the first half <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R records released in 2003, and makes a strong case that Beyoncé might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny".|$|E

2500|$|Although Prolog {{is widely}} used in {{research}} and education, Prolog and other logic programming languages {{have not had a}} significant impact on the computer industry in general. [...] Most applications are small by industrial standards, with few exceeding 100,000 lines of code. Programming in the large is considered to be complicated because not all Prolog compilers support modules, and there are compatibility problems between the module systems of the major Prolog compilers. [...] Portability of Prolog code across implementations has also been a problem, but developments since 2007 have meant: [...] "the portability within the family of Edinburgh/Quintus derived Prolog implementations <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow for maintaining portable real-world applications." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the tallest}} {{building}} {{in the world and}} the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building was immediately an icon of the city and of the entire country. Time magazine called the building a way that [...] "you know that you’re in New York City". John Tauranac calls the tower [...] "'the' twentieth-century New York building", even despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings. Early in the building's history, travel companies such as Short Line Motor Coach Service and New York Central Railroad used the building as an icon to symbolize the city. After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect Paul Goldberger noted that the Empire State Building [...] "is famous for being tall, but it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be famous for being good." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Lester Bangs gave a lukewarm assessment and called Wavelength [...] "a very nice record. I'm {{sure all the}} people at Warner Bros. are pleased with it. Ditto the DJs... Still, though, it do confound how such a monumental talent can mire himself in such twaddle, fine as some of it may be." [...] Melody Maker reviewed the album as evidence of Morrison's [...] "drift into the American Dream." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau {{referred to it as}} a good but not great album and called attention to side two, which he felt was [...] "an evocative reinterpretation of Van's America fixation, but side one is nothing more (and nothing less) than class programming." [...] Time magazine was more enthusiastic: [...] "Morrison has made two, maybe three albums that rank high among the finest of all rock 'n' roll. Wavelength <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stand close by Morrison's best work, a record of sinuous, sensuous magic. The man just can't be beat." ...|$|E

[...] "A senior intelligence official" [...] also told The New York Times that the U.S. has observed the site for years by spy satellite. Subsequent searches of satellite imagery discovered that an astronaut aboard the International Space Station had taken a picture of the area on September 5, 2002.

He sneaks into the house and plays tricks on Lynsey by turning the gas on and writing a [...] "sinister" [...] message on her mirror with lipstick. Of this, Rawle explained: [...] "Silas alters Lynsey's reality — so when she insists that one thing is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute." [...] Silas sneaks into Lynsey's flat at night and moves her things around which Rawle said is [...] "a subtle way of sending a person barmy". Lynsey's friends do not believe her accusations and question her state of mind, so she leaves the village. Lynsey's friend, Brendan Brady (Emmett J.
