So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not <b>just</b> <b>something</b> of the moment.|$|E

It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the {{beginning}} I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{clarified}} {{that her}} age {{did not have}} anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that she had in mind for a long time and with [...] "4 Minutes", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing [...] "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was [...] "a funny paradox" [...] and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008).

500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's <b>just</b> <b>something</b> about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E

[...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it...

He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it."

500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{preference}} for null relativizers when a main clause that is informationally light is directly adjacent to the relative clause. [...] For example: 6) Its <b>just</b> kinda <b>something</b> Ø I noticed recently. 7) They get values {{and stuff like that}} from church that they might not get at home.In this example, the main clause its <b>just</b> kinda <b>something</b> provides little semantic information and it is adjacent to the relative clause I noticed recently. As such, it is thought that the main clause and the relative clause are processed together as a unitary processing chunk that is functioning like a single statement, which results in a null relativizer.|$|R
