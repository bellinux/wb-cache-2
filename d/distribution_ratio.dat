40|$|The {{radiation}} chemistry of CMPO {{has been investigated}} {{using a combination of}} irradiation and analytical techniques. The {alpha}-, and {gamma}-irradiation of CMPO resulted in identical degradation rates (G-value, in {mu}mol Gy{sup - 1 }) for both radiation types, despite the difference in their linear energy transfer (LET). Similarly, variations in {gamma}-ray dose rates did not affect the degradation rate of CMPO. The solvent extraction behavior was different for the two radiation types, however. Gamma-irradiation resulted in steadily increasing <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> for both forward and stripping extractions, with respect to increasing absorbed radiation dose. This was true for samples irradiated as a neat organic solution, or irradiated in contact with the acidic aqueous phase. In contrast, {alpha}-irradiated samples showed a rapid drop in <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> for forward and stripping extractions, followed by essentially constant <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> at higher absorbed doses. These differences in extraction behavior are reconciled by mass spectrometric examination of CMPO decomposition products under the different irradiation sources. Irradiation by {gamma}-rays resulted in the rupture of phosphoryl-methylene bonds with the production of phosphinic acid products.

50|$|Some solutes such as {{noble gases}} can be {{extracted}} from one phase to another {{without the need}} for a chemical reaction (see absorption). This is the simplest type of solvent extraction. When a solvent is extracted, two immiscible liquids are shaken together.

Some solutes that do not at first sight appear to undergo a reaction during the extraction process do not have <b>distribution</b> <b>ratio</b> that is independent of concentration. A classic example is the extraction of carboxylic acids (HA) into nonpolar media such as benzene.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the work that}} followed the CSSX model development completed in FY 2002. The developed cesium and potassium extraction model was based on extraction data obtained from simple aqueous media. It was tested to ensure {{the validity of the}} prediction for the cesium extraction from actual waste. Compositions of the actual tank waste were obtained from the Savannah River Site personnel and were used to prepare defined simulants and to predict cesium <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> using the model. It was therefore possible to compare the cesium <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> obtained from the actual waste, the simulant, and the predicted values. It was determined that the predicted values agree with the measured values for the simulants. Predicted values also agreed, with three exceptions, with measured values for the tank wastes. Discrepancies were attributed in part to the uncertainty in the cation/anion balance in the actual waste composition, but likely more so to the uncertainty in the potassium concentration in the waste, given the demonstrated large competing effect of this metal on cesium extraction. It was demonstrated that the upper limit for the potassium concentration in the feed ought to not exceed 0. 05 M in order to maintain suitable cesium <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

In this work a more detailed study of the distribution equilibria was made. If not given otherwise, 2, 6 -di(5, 6 -dipropyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazin- 3 yl) pyridine (= B) was taken {{as a representative of}} the title extractant class and a mixture of branched alkanes (TPH) modified with 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol was taken as a diluent. Since Am(III) and Eu(III) (=M) are extracted as complexes of the type M(NO 3 3 3 B, their <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> increase strongly with the activity of nitrate ions in the aqueous phase and the concentration of the extractant in the organic phase. The <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> of the metals are suppressed in the presence of macro amounts of Eu(III), due to lowering the free extractant concentration as the solvent loading is not negligible, but the Am(III) /Eu(III) separation factor remains unchanged. The extraction of Am(III) and Eu(III) is little changed if 1 -octanol is taken as a TPH modifier instead of 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, and the highest <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> are attained at 10 - 20 vol % alcohol. The optimum concentration of the alcohol is 20 vol%, giving appropriate solubilization of the extractant in the mixed diluent. Higher <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> are obtained in the presence of 1 -butanol which, however, solubilizes the extractant less effectively than the octanols.

40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} (REEs), including lanthanides, {{are critical}} materials for many industrial technologies. As a result recycling of end-of-life products containing REEs might be beneficial, as this could partially satisfy the growing demands of industry for these elements. However, recycling of end-of-life products is often technically and/or commercially challenging. One possible method for the recycling of such materials is a hydrometallurgical treatment of wastes, which includes leaching of valuable metals (e. g. lanthanides) with mineral acids followed by solvent extraction for isolation and {{separation of the}} metals. As part of our efforts towards better REEs recycling, novel polyfunctional amides (polyamides) have been synthesized and tested as solvent extraction reagents for trivalent lanthanides in this work. The structure of the polyamide ligands was shown to affect largely the <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> of trivalent lanthanides. It is very likely {{that the ability to}} form chelate complexes with lanthanide(III) ions is an important feature of the polyamides as solvent extraction reagents. It was demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} increase the <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> of trivalent lanthanides using malonamides as extractants by increasing the denticity of the ligands. Thus the <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> of lanthanide(III) ions obtained with the tetraamide 2, 2 ’-(1, 2 -phenylenebis(methylene)) bis(N,N,N’,N’-tetrabutylmalonamide), bearing two N,N,N’N’-tetrabutylmalonamide units on an ortho-xylylene platform, were up to one hundred times greater (under particular experimental conditions) than those with the diamide – N,N,N’N’-tetrabutylmalonamide – in two diluents – nitrobenzene and 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene. The increase of the <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> of trivalent lanthanides obtained with this tetraamide can be attributed to the entropic effect. This conclusion follows from the studies of the stoichiometry of europium(III) extraction with the tetraamide, from the comparison of the <b>distribution</b> <b>ratios</b> of trivalent lanthanides obtained with the tetraamide and its structural isomers, and from the single-crystal diffraction studies of the neodymium(III) nitrate complex with the analogue of the tetraamide. It was shown that solvent extraction properties of the synthesized amides are sensitive to the nature of the diluent. Polar diluents promote the extraction of trivalent lanthanides with the amides. It was demonstrated that the use of the extraction chromatography resin with N,N,N’N’-tetrabutylmalonamide as an extractant and polystyrene as a support potentially can relieve the complications (e. g. toxicity, the third liquid phase formation etc.) introduced to the solvent extraction process by diluents.
