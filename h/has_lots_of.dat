25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it <b>has</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E

Miss Vansittart has been teaching there for several years, and Miss Rich for 18 months. Miss Johnson is the girls' matron. The new staff include Angèle Blanche (French teacher), Grace Springer (gym teacher), Ann Shapland (Miss Bulstrode's new secretary), and Adam Goodman (gardener). Miss Bulstrode is nearing retirement, and is deciding whom to appoint as her successor. Many assume Vansittart will be the successor.

These deliberations are cut short when Miss Springer is shot dead in the Sports Pavilion late at night. Johnson and Chadwick discover her body.|$|E

500|$|Explaining how Ben Stiller {{came to be}} cast in {{the role}} of Greg, Roach states: [...] "I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream, and in my view nobody plays that kind of {{material}} better than Ben." [...] Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller's creative and ad lib abilities stating that [...] "he <b>has</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> great ideas and he's very skilled at loose improvisation." [...] Stiller's character Gaylord [...] "Greg" [...] Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film's script was initially written with Jim Carrey {{in the role of}} Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not think would be successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the levels}} are areas {{that require a}} minimum number of LocoRoco in order to cause them to sing and wake {{up one of the}} planet's odd residents, who will then reward the player with an item for their [...] "Loco House". There are also hidden MuiMui {{throughout}} the levels to be found. Levels also contain [...] "Pickories" [...] which can be collected by the LocoRoco and are used as a form of currency to play two mini-games outside of the main game. The mini-games are [...] "MuiMui Crane", a variation of a crane game, and [...] "Chuppa Chuppa" [...] that use Chuppa, bird-like launchers for the LocoRoco, to navigate a long course. Both mini-games grant additional Loco House parts and Pickories as prizes. The player can use the accumulated Loco House parts to create a course that the LocoRoco will automatically navigate, with additional parts that can be collected by directing the course appropriately. A Loco Editor is also an unlockable feature in the game, creating an interactive course with a start and finish using the Loco House parts. LocoRoco <b>has</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> other characters and enemies that have strange names.|$|E
500|$|Karen Hartley-Thomas was {{the hair}} and make-up {{designer}} for the production. She began prepping {{a couple of months}} before filming began, and she met with the director and producer early on to discuss the whole look of the film. Like the costumers, she read books and went to art galleries during her research. The female characters in Sense and Sensibility wear a [...] "no make-up look" [...] because in the time period in which the film is set, only the lower classes would have worn white and pink make-up. The Dashwood sisters wore no mascara and only a little corrective and blush. Hartley-Thomas also used very little make-up on the men, as she does not like them looking made up. Discussing the hair, Hartley-Thomas said [...] "Elinor's hair is always quite neat and done, where Marianne, being a freer character and more rebellious, she <b>has</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> different looks and lots of wild looks with the hair loose." [...] She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair, whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and clippered. John Dashwood and his son were given red hair, as Hartley-Thomas wanted them to stand out amongst the more natural colours of the other male characters.|$|E

500|$|Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{referred}} {{the album}} to as a [...] "smart, bristly, busy sophomore disc", writing that [...] "Too {{much of it}} apes Avril Lavigne, with the standard shouted choruses and hiccupped verses that are beginning to sound very '03." [...] Stewart named [...] "Every Time You Lie" [...] and [...] "World of Chances" [...] as [...] "direction signs pointing to a much more interesting career". Awarding the album five out of ten points, Cody Miller of PopMatters was mixed in his review and said that Lovato [...] "desperately wants to be Kelly Clarkson", writing [...] "Lovato can't work miracles with mediocre pop songs like Clarkson, but the young singer-actress has a bigger range than any of her contemporaries, and {{a better sense of}} on-record charisma." [...] Miller was mixed regarding album's content, saying that [...] "there's nothing that really separates the tracks from each other. Most of the album's up-tempo numbers just blend together." [...] He concluded his review: [...] "Here We Go Again isn't perfect by any means, and when compared to someone like Clarkson or Pink, it's obvious the young singer <b>has</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> work ahead of her if she wants to truly cement herself as a serious, viable pop/rock artist outside of the Disney mold. But given the context, Here We Go Again is certainly enjoyable to some scale." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of five, saying [...] "Lovato has chops and spunk akin to a fellow Texas pop singer, though her voice doesn't churn with Kelly Clarkson's gutsy heart yet." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song about that for a long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she <b>has</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E
