5|$|The magical {{and mystical}} {{side of the}} herbal also lives on. Herbals often {{explained}} plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatures,</b> the belief that there were similarities in {{the appearance of the}} part of the body affected the appearance of the plant {{to be used as a}} remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary anthroposophy (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy, aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Signatures.</b> Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E
40|$|The {{taste and}} smell of the {{environment}} are important to humans in everyday life and are of particular relevance for the selection of medicinal versus non-medicinal plant species. In a 16 -months study with the Popoluca of southern Veracruz (Mexico), we focused on the indigenous selection criteria for medicinal plants. We provide evidence for a highly significant association between organoleptic properties of plants {{and the use of}} these species as medicine. Additionally, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> is an essential mnemonic aid, which facilitates remembering the use assigned to the plant. From the Popoluca point of view, it is essential to find substitutes or alternative treatments when a certain species is not at hand. We show that organoleptic properties and the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> are excellent guides for selecting or memorising such medicinals. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

25|$|Herbs were {{commonly}} used in salves and drinks to treat a range of maladies. The particular herbs used depended largely on the local culture and often had roots in pre-Christian religion. The success of herbal remedies was often ascribed to their action upon the humours within the body. The use of herbs also drew upon the medieval Christian <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> which stated that God had provided some form of alleviation for every ill, and that these things, be they animal, vegetable or mineral, carried a mark or a signature upon them that gave an indication of their usefulness. For example, skullcap seeds (used as a headache remedy) can appear to look like miniature skulls; and the white spotted leaves of lungwort (used for tuberculosis) bear a similarity to the lungs of a diseased patient. A large number of such resemblances were believed to exist.|$|E

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John. Therefore it is necessary to study the terms which mean sin or describe certain aspects of sin in order to discern John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole...|$|R
