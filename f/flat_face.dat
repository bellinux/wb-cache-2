5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century {{to reduce the size}} of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a <b>flat</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

25|$|Homo neanderthalensis {{retained}} most of {{the features}} of Homo heidelbergensis after its divergent evolution. Although shorter, Neanderthals were more robust, had large brow-ridges, a slightly protruding face, and lack of prominent chin. With a virtually identical cranial capacity to Cro-Magnon, they also had a larger brain than all other hominins. Homo sapiens, on the other hand, have the smallest brows of any known hominin, are taller and more gracile, and have a <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> with a protruding chin. H. sapiens have a larger brain than H. heidelbergensis, and a smaller brain than H. neanderthalensis, on average. To date, H. sapiens is the only known hominin with a high forehead, <b>flat</b> <b>face,</b> and thin, flat brows.|$|E

The stone slabs appear to be set into a low mound of earth and stone, {{possibly}} the result of leveling the central area.

25|$|If the {{triangle}}s are coplanar, {{this test}} is not entirely successful. One can add some extra planes, for instance, planes that are normal to triangle edges, {{to fix the problem}} entirely. In other cases, objects that meet at a <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> must necessarily also meet at an angle elsewhere, hence the overall collision detection will be able to find the collision.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} may be quite large at birth and appear normal but may have inguinal (in the groin) or umbilical (where the umbilical cord passes through the abdomen) hernias. Growth in height may be faster than normal but begins to slow {{before the end of}} the first year and often ends around age 3. Many children develop a short body trunk and a maximum stature of less than 4 feet. Distinct facial features (including <b>flat</b> <b>face,</b> depressed nasal bridge, and bulging forehead) become more evident in the second year. By age 2, the ribs have widened and are oar-shaped. The liver, spleen, and heart are often enlarged. Children may experience noisy breathing and recurring upper respiratory tract and ear infections. Feeding may be difficult for some children, and many experience periodic bowel problems. Children with Hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, and cardiac complications.|$|E

It stands [...] and was found in the first half of the 20thcentury on the site of the electricity generator of the Santa Margarita plantation and moved close to the administration office. The sculpture has a large, <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> with prominent eyebrows. Its style is very similar to that of a monument found at Kaminaljuyu in the highlands.|$|E

500|$|In 1916 Lewis {{left school}} {{to take a}} job at a {{locomotive}} factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars a week. Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was [...] "built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents." [...] While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time, his large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> are now recognized as hallmarks of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.|$|E
500|$|Reception of the {{painting}} {{as a work of}} art has been predominantly negative. The historian David Starkey described it as [...] "an appallingly bad picture and there's absolutely no reason to suppose it's got anything to do with Lady Jane Grey", a sentiment which the art dealer Christopher Foley echoed. Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery gave less sharp criticism, stating [...] "it's a paint-by-number, labored copy", and [...] "its value is as a historical document rather than a work of art". Zarin describes {{the painting}} as looking bleached in comparison with other portraits of monarchs, with [...] "the <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> of a paper doll". Edwards writes [...] "the quality might be described as naive, primitive, or even folk art".|$|E

5000|$|Euhedral {{crystals}} have <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> {{with sharp}} angles. The <b>flat</b> <b>faces</b> (also called facets) are oriented {{in a specific}} way relative to the underlying atomic arrangement of the crystal: They are planes of relatively low Miller index. This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower surface energy). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.) ...|$|R

The commander had four episcopes in his cupola and a monocular mirror, 1.3 x 30° periscope which he could extend, once he had removed its armoured cover in his hatch, to give vision while [...] "buttoned-up". As the sole occupant of the turret, the commander was responsible for loading, aiming and firing the main gun and the turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding the tank. The Germans added an extra crewman {{on the right side of}} the turret to load the main gun and to operate the turret machine gun. Some ammunition had to be removed to accommodate him.|$|E

500|$|Henschel won {{the design}} contract, and all Tiger IIs were {{produced}} by the firm. Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the [...] "Porsche" [...] turret due {{to the belief that}} it was designed by Porsche for their prototype; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes. This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. The more common [...] "production" [...] turret, sometimes called the [...] "Henschel" [...] turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker <b>flat</b> <b>face,</b> no shot trap (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.|$|E

40|$|The break {{force of}} <b>flat</b> <b>faced</b> tablets subject to {{diametrical}} compression (often {{referred to as}} "hardness") {{can be related to}} the tensile strength of the material using the Hertz contact theory. For curved tablets analytical solutions do not exist and an empirical equation developed by Pitt is usually used. In this paper we measure the break force of curved faced tablets having a range of curvatures pressed at various compaction forces. An empirical equation is proposed to relate the break force of curved faced tablets to the material tensile strength. The proposed equation is simplified and reduced to a form that is consistent with Hertz theory for <b>flat</b> <b>faced</b> tablets. 12236...|$|R

Pedro II revealed in a letter written to the Countess of Barral in early 1881 that: [...] "The [...] with the earrings which you mentioned, has been the cause for much recrimination {{on the part of}} someone [...] who thinks that I have been to blame for their disappearance." [...] Her son-in-law, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885: [...] "On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps (and with whom, I infer from what she told us, she was arguing as she sometimes does), she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down <b>flat</b> <b>face</b> forward."
