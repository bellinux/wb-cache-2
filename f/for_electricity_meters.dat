40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{compression}} approach for load profile data, which addresses practical requirements of smart metering. By providing linear time complexity {{with respect to}} the input data size, our compression approach is suitable for low-complexity encoding and decoding for storage and transmission of load profile data in smart grids. Furthermore, it allows for resum-ability with very low overhead on error-prone transmission lines, which is an important feature not available for stan-dard time series compression schemes. In terms of compression efficiency, our approach outperforms transmission encodings that are currently used <b>for</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>metering</b> by an order of magnitude.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a study <b>for</b> modernizing the <b>electricity</b> <b>metering,</b> billing and collection processes for Electricité du Liban (EDL), the national power company of Lebanon. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide EDL with the best alternatives <b>for</b> modernizing their <b>electricity</b> <b>metering</b> of low-voltage customers. These customers are currently being metered using a variety of old and new electromechanical meters. The metering process at EDL is manual, and prone to errors. The existing system does not provide EDL with reliable methods to readily check bills, identify problematic customers, and reduce fraud. Therefore, EDL’s modernization requirements include an automated system capable of enhancing current metering processes, minimizing fraud, and maximizing revenue collection. This paper will describe the functional requirements of EDL and investigate the feasibility of using Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology to satisfy these requirements. Both procedural and equipment modernization techniques will be identified and assessed. The proposed modernization system will make EDL’s metering activities as advanced as those of modern utilities. Most importantly, with the modernized system, EDL will regain the confidence of its customers, and would become a highly reputable and revenue generating organization. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : Secure Hardware SystemsInternational audienceDue {{to ongoing}} {{changes in the}} power grid towards decentralised and highly {{volatile}} energy production, smart <b>electricity</b> <b>meters</b> are required to provide fine-grained measurement and timely remote access to consumption and production data. This enables flexible tariffing and dynamic load optimisation. As the power grid forms part of the critical infrastructure of our society, increasing the resilience of the grid’s software components against failures and attacks is vitally important. In this paper we explore the use of Protected Module Architectures (PMAs) to securely implement and deploy software <b>for</b> smart <b>electricity</b> <b>meters.</b> Outlining security challenges and an architectural solution {{in the light of}} security features provided by PMAs, we evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation of a security-focused smart metering scenario.

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{market in}} the UK is undergoing dramatic changes and requires a transformation of existing practices to meet the current and forthcoming challenges. One aspect of the solution is the deployment of demand side management (DSM) programmes to influence domestic behaviour patterns {{for the benefit of}} the overall network. Effective deployment of DSM requires segmentation of the population into a small number of groupings. Using a database of <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> data collected at a frequency of five minutes over a year from several hundred houses, households are clustered based on the shape of the average daily electricity usage profile. A novel method, incorporating evaluation criteria beyond compactness, of evaluating the resulting groupings is defined and tested. The results indicate the potentially most useful algorithms for use with load profile clustering. Patterns within the <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> data are approximated and symbolised to allow motifs (representing repeated behaviours) to be identified. Uninteresting motifs are automatically identified and discarded. The different possible parameters, including size of motif and number of symbols used in representing the data, are explored and the most appropriate values found <b>for</b> use with <b>electricity</b> <b>meter</b> data motif detection. The concept of variability of regular behaviour within a household is introduced and methods of representing the variability are considered. The novel method of using variability in timing of motifs is compared to other techniques and the results tested using the previously defined evaluation criteria. Combining the generated motif data with the meter data to produce a single set of archetypes does not produce more useful results for use with DSM. However, creating complementary sets of archetypes based on each set of data, provides a more complete understanding of the households and allows for better targeting of DSM initiatives...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} smart <b>metering</b> of <b>electricity</b> demand has {{attracted}} attention around the world. A {{number of countries}} and regions have started deploying new metering systems; and many others have set targets for deployment or are undertaking trials. Across the board advances in technology and international experience characterize the metering landscape as a fast-changing one. These changes are taking place {{at a time when}} increasing emphasis is being placed {{on the role of the}} demand-side in improving the efficiency of energy markets, enhancing security of supply and in unlocking the benefits of energy and carbon savings. Innovative forms of metering can be a useful tool in achieving an active demand-side and moving beyond a supply-focused sector. In this paper we focus in particular on smart <b>metering</b> in liberalized <b>electricity</b> markets. We firstly set the context <b>for</b> innovative <b>electricity</b> <b>metering</b> in terms of policy, the role and market structure for metering, and the potential for smart metering to increase demand-side participation. We then provide an overview of new metering technologies by examining international trends, the various components of smart metering systems, and the likely future developments. Next we assess the economics of smart meters focusing on the costs and benefits of smart metering and the distribution of these. We review the evidence in Europe, North America and Australia; we look at how countries and regions have differed in their approaches and how these differences have had an impact on policy making. We conclude by outlining the main challenges that remain, particularly in technology choice and its regulation, the methodology of analyzing costs and benefits and the role of uncertainty in investment and policy making. <b>Electricity</b> demand, smart <b>meter,</b> energy saving, demand-side participation. ...|$|R
