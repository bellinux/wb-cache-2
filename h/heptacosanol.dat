40|$|World Health Organization {{appreciated}} {{the importance of}} medicinal plants for public health care in developing nations. Eclipta alba (Bhringaraja) having {{important role in the}} traditional Ayurvedic and Unani systems of holistic health and herbal medicine of the east. The principal constituents of Eclipta alba are coumestan derivatives like wedololactone[1. 6 %], demethylwedelolactone, desmethyl-wedelolactone- 7 glucoside and other constituents are ecliptal, ÃŸ-amyrin, luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside, hentriacontanol, <b>heptacosanol,</b> stigmasterol. All the parts of Eclipta alba and chemical constituents are used as anticancer, antileprotic, analgesic, antioxidant, antimyotoxic, antihaemorrhagic, antihepatotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, spasmogenic, hypotensive, ovicidal, promoter for blackening and growth of hair. This article high-lights chief constituents their biological activities, uses of various parts, pharmacological activities, toxicity and clinical studies of Eclipta alba...|$|E
40|$|In crystallization, the {{critical}} nucleus size is of pivotal importance. Above this size, it is favorable {{for the new}} crystalline phase to form; below this size, the clusters will tend to dissolve rather than grow. To date, {{there has been no}} direct method for measuring {{the critical}} nucleus size. Instead, the size is typically calculated from the variation of crystallization rates with temperature. This involves using bulk values of the interfacial tension and enthalpy of fusion, which are inappropriate for small critical nucleus sizes. Here, we present a direct method for measuring the size of the critical nucleus, based on observing crystallization temperatures of materials within microemulsions. Using this approach, the number of molecules in the critical nucleus can be found simply by measuring the droplet size. Data on the freezing of water in water-in-oil microemulsions with and without the nucleating agent, <b>heptacosanol,</b> are presented to support our hypothesis. The results show that the critical nucleus contains 90 - 350 ice molecules for water pool radii of ~ 1. 2 - 1. 8 nm for the heptacosanol-doped microemulsions in which heterogeneous nucleation is initiated at the droplet interface. For the microemulsions without <b>heptacosanol,</b> the critical nucleus contains 70 - 210 ice molecules for water pool radii of ~ 1. 2 - 1. 8 nm. The smaller values arise because homogeneous nucleation occurs and therefore the crystallization temperatures are lower. We can also determine how bulk properties are perturbed at the nanoscale, and we find that the ratio of the ice-water interfacial tension to the enthalpy of fusion decreases significantly for water pool radii that are < 2 nm...|$|E
40|$|Policosanol is {{a mixture}} of {{long-chain}} primary alcohols that has been shown to decrease serum cholesterol in animals and in humans. The hypocholesterolemic effect results from a de-crease in cholesterol synthesis by suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity, but the mechanism of this suppression and the active components of policosanol have not been estab-lished. In the present study, we investigated the ability of poli-cosanol and its principal components to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in cultured rat hepatoma cells. Maximal inhibition by policosanol yielded a 30 % decrease in [14 C]acetate incorpora-tion without evidence of cellular toxicity. Octacosanol (C 28, the major constituent of policosanol), <b>heptacosanol</b> (C 27), and hexacosanol (C 26) yielded smaller and statistically insignificant decreases in cholesterol synthesis, whereas triacontanol (1...|$|E
