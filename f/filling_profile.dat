The pulse {{pressure of}} a VPC with a short coupling interval or originating from the left ventricle tends to be smaller. However, the hemodynamic change of a VPC originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is not well elucidated. In addition to their prematurity and {{the site of the}} origin of VPCs, the left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>profile</b> (Ei/Ai ratio) during preceding control beats may affect the occurrence of a subsequent pulse deficit. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the hemodynamic change of different coupling intervals of VPCs originating from the RVOT. Furthermore, this study evaluates whether the left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>profile</b> during preceding control beats significantly affects the occurrence of pulse deficits by VPCs. Methods：In 12 open-chest dogs anesthetized with α-chloralose, sinus node crushing was done, and then a single bipolar ventricular pacing using sutured epicardial electrodes was done at 3 different sites；left ventricular apex (LVA), right ventricular apex (RVA), RVOT.

40|$|An {{effective}} simulation {{approach is}} introduced {{in this paper}} to study the thermal fluid-structure interaction (thermal FSI) {{on the effect of}} pin-through-hole (PTH) diameter on the wave soldering zone. A 3 D single PTH connector and a printed circuit board model were constructed to investigate the capillary flow behavior when passing through molten solder (63 SnPb 37). In the analysis, the fluid solver FLUENT was used to solve and track the molten solder advancement using the volume of fluid technique. The structural solver ABAQUS was used to examine the von Mises stress and displacement of the PTH connector in the wave soldering process. Both solvers were coupled by MpCCI software. The effects of six different diameter ratios (0. 1 < d/D < 0. 97) were studied through a simulation modeling. The use of ratio d/D = 0. 2 yielded a balanced <b>filling</b> <b>profile</b> and low thermal stress. Results revealed that filling level, temperature, and displacement exhibited polynomial behavior to d/D. Stress of pin varied quadratically with the d/D. The predicted molten solder profile was validated by experimental results.

40|$|Changing the {{combustion}} process {{of a gas}} turbine from a constant-pressure to a pressure-increasing approximate constant-volume combustion (aCVC) {{is one of the}} most promising ways to increase the efficiency of turbines in the future. In this paper, a newly proposed method to achieve such an aCVC is considered. The so-called shockless explosion combustion (SEC) uses auto-ignition and a fuel stratification to achieve a spatially homogeneous ignition. The homogeneity of the ignition can be adjusted by the mixing of fuel and air. A proper <b>filling</b> <b>profile,</b> however, also depends on changing parameters, such as temperature, that cannot be measured in detail due to the harsh conditions inside {{the combustion}} tube. Therefore, a closed-loop control is required to obtain an adequate injection profile and to reject such unknown disturbances. For this, an optimization problem is set up and a novel formulation of a discrete extremum seeking controller is presented. By approximating the cost function with a parabola, the first derivative and a Hessian matrix are estimated, allowing the controller to use Newton steps to converge to the optimal control trajectory. The controller is applied to an atmospheric test rig, where the auto-ignition process can be investigated for single ignitions. In the set-up, dimethyl ether is injected into a preheated air stream using a controlled proportional valve. Optical measurements are used to evaluate the auto-ignition process and to show that using the extremum seeking control approach, the homogeneity of the ignition process can be increased significantly...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for electronic devices with smaller sizes, higher performance and increased functionality. The development of vertical interconnects or through silicon vias (TSV) {{may be one of}} the most promising approaches to provide the three-dimensional (3 D) integration of integrated circuits (IC). It is possible to improve the system's performance with shorter RC delay, shorter signal paths and less power consumption. Electroplating process is one of the major contributors to the cost of TSV. Thus, plating time is one of our major concerns in TSV applications. About 80 % of the TSVs are filled with copper due to its high conductivity and wide applications in multilayer wiring. Even though the electroplating of copper for interconnections is well established for the copper damascene micro-fabrication process, it has been shown that the filling of TSVs with copper plating is a different situation due to the much larger dimensions of TSVs. Generally the filling mechanism consists of conformal plating and bottom up plating. A 100 % bottom up filling is preferred for copper filling in TSV. A seam may exist in via if the majority of filling mechanism is conformal plating. Thus, the bottom up <b>filling</b> <b>profile</b> is one the critical points to achieve void free filling. In this study, the void free copper filling TSVs with diameter from 10 - 30 m and depth from 50 - 150 m will be investigated by copper electroplating. A near 100 % bottom up plating formula was developed in order to achieve void free and seam free filling. Filling performance of this plating formula was evaluated by examining vertical cross-sections and top-down cross-section of the filled TSVs using optical microscope and X-ray method. Pretreatment process and relationship with diffusion time will be also studied with respect to the TSV plating process. The effect of concentration of copper, acid and additives will be optimized to achieve the desired bottom up plating process. The ultimate goal is to achieve TSV plating with shorter plating time and better consistency. Electroplating experiment was conducted with an industrial electroplating tool. Successful plating results are demonstrated with optimized plating bath and plating mechanism. The void free and seam free copper deposition results are shown with minimized overburden. The time taken for the plating process is also greatly reduced with this near 100 % bottom up plating formula. The benefits of this novel plating mechanism will be discussed in detail in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Background—Cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) is established for assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function {{but has not}} been widely used to assess diastolic function. This study tested performance of a novel CMR segmentation algorithm (LV-METRIC) for automated assessment of diastolic function. Methods and Results—A total of 101 patients with normal LV systolic function underwent CMR and echocardiography (echo) within 7 days. LV-METRIC generated LV <b>filling</b> <b>profiles</b> via automated segmentation of contiguous short-axis images (20439 images, 2 : 040 : 53 minutes). Diastolic function by CMR was assessed via early:atrial filling ratios, peak diastolic filling rate, time to peak filling rate, and a novel index—diastolic volume recovery (DVR), calculated as percent diastole required for recovery of 80 % stroke volume. Using an echo standard, patients with versus without diastolic dysfunction had lower early:atrial filling ratios, longer time to peak filling rate, lower stroke volume–adjusted peak diastolic filling rate, and greater DVR (all P 0. 05). Prevalence of abnormal CMR filling indices increased in relation to clinical symptoms classified by New York Heart Association functional class (P 0. 04) or dyspnea (P 0. 006). Among all parameters tested, DVR yielded optimal performance versus echo (area under the curve: 0. 870. 04, P 0. 001). Using a 90 % specificity cutoff, DVR yielded 74 % sensitivity for diastolic dysfunction. In multivariate analysis, DVR (odds ratio, 1. 82; 95 % CI, 1. 13 to 2. 57; P 0. 02) was independently associated with echo-evidenced diastolic dysfunction after controlling for age, hypertension, and LV mass (273. 4, P 0. 001). Conclusions—Automated CMR segmentation can provide LV <b>filling</b> <b>profiles</b> that may offer insight into diastolic dysfunction. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have prolonged diastolic filling intervals, which are associated with echo-evidenced diastolic dysfunction independent of clinical and imaging variables.

In a few cases, the surface tension of the polymer was taken into consideration but interfacial tension between polymer and stamp was not accounted for.

The only study with relevance to the NIL or HEL process, applying a nonlinear constitutive equation is that of Eriksson et al. [11]. Eriksson et al.

40|$|As {{the lightest}} {{structural}} metal, magnesium alloys have been attractive to reduce vehicle weight and emissions by lightweight {{design in the}} automotive industry. Crashworthiness is not a physical property itself, but correlates with the material’s ductility and structural design. Magnesium {{is known to be}} a material with lower failure strain than other metallic structural materials.

For structures with axial crash loads the normal buckling mode will lead to a very early fracture of the magnesium part. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Windsor and the University of Waterloo, novel technologies for energy absorption which are based on cutting or peeling mechanisms have been developed and investigated, which allow the use of magnesium in these challenging applications.
