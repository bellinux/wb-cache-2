5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a <b>hierarchy</b> of being, and the latter to a <b>hierarchy</b> of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each <b>hierarchy.</b> In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E

40|$|Using {{deformations}} of associative products, derivative nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) <b>hierarchies</b> are recovered as AKNS-type <b>hierarchies.</b> Since {{the latter}} {{can also be}} formulated as Gelfand-Dickey-type Lax <b>hierarchies,</b> a recently developed method to obtain 'functional representations' can be applied.

40|$|<b>Hierarchies</b> {{have been}} used for organization, summarization, and access to information, yet a {{lingering}} issue is how best to construct them. In this paper, our goal is to automatically create domain specific <b>hierarchies</b> {{that can be used for}} browsing a document set and locating relevant documents. We examine methods of automatically generating <b>hierarchies</b> and evaluating them. To this end, we compare and contrast two methods of generating topic <b>hierarchies</b> from the text of documents: one, subsumption <b>hierarchies,</b> uses subsumption relations found within document sets, and the other, lexical <b>hierarchies,</b> utilizes frequently used words within phrases. Our evaluation shows that subsumption <b>hierarchies</b> divide documents into smaller groups, allowing one to find all relevant documents without looking at as many non-relevant documents. However, such <b>hierarchies</b> are more likely to contain no path to a relevant document. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this article is}} to study the validity of these approximations. I show that modelling <b>hierarchies</b> with a continuum of tiers is not a good approximation. I also show, for a particular model of balanced <b>hierarchies,</b> that ignoring rounding operators and integer constraints in formulae derived from the discrete model can be a valid approximation, when <b>hierarchies</b> are suitably large.

Defining <b>hierarchies</b> using star or snowflake schemas can be misleading,since they are not explicitly well-modeled.

This paper focuses on the definitionof multidimensional <b>hierarchies.</b> We present and illustrate rules for definingmultidimensional <b>hierarchies</b> from UML schemas, especially based onaggregation and generalization <b>hierarchies.</b> The definition of <b>hierarchies</b> ispart of a data warehouse design method based on the three usual modelinglevels : conceptual, logical, and physical.

40|$|In {{enterprise}} data warehouses, different {{users in}} different business units often define their own application specific dimension <b>hierarchies</b> tailor made to their reporting and business performance monitoring needs. Due to resource constraints, {{only on a}} small number of these <b>hierarchies</b> are precomputed for performance optimization. Consequently aggregations over <b>hierarchies</b> without precomputations are often less responsive. We report on a performance problem in a very large banking enterprise where the large number of application specific <b>hierarchies</b> became a performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel solution for optimizing the performance of data warehouses with a large number of application specific <b>hierarchies.</b> We exploit the observation that dimension <b>hierarchies</b> in real data warehouses often contain significant overlaps. Our method detects common sub-structures among <b>hierarchies</b> and provides a rewriting algorithm to exploit any precomputations on these shared sub-structures. Our solution is applicable to data warehouses of large enterprises with a large number of business units and hence a large number of application specific <b>hierarchies.</b> 1...|$|R
