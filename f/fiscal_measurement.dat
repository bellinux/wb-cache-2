The expenditure cuts centred the adjustments as the wage bill was trimmed by 4% of GDP (constituted roughly 30% wage cut for central government employees), pensions cut by 10% (later revoked by Constitutional Court) and investment by 3% of GDP. The measurements were estimated at 6.7% of Latvia GDP.On the revenue end, personal income tax was increased from 23% to 26%, tax-free personal income tax allowance was cut to €50/month (from €125/month), VAT was increased by 3% to 21% (2009) followed by another 1% to 22% (2011), while the reduced rates increased by 5% to 10%. Employee social contribution was raise from 9% to 11%. On top of that, excise duties on tobacco, alcohol, and energy were increased along with vehicle taxes. Subsequently, progressive real estate tax was introduced in 2009 that doubled effective from 2011 onwards. The revenue budget was about 2.8% of Latvia GDP.In strengthening the financial sector, new internal FCMC (The Financial and Capital Market Commission) guidelines has been introduced to specify prompt remedial action for troubled banks before regulatory thresholds are breached.

40|$|The phase {{response}} of a transducer {{acting as a}} transmitter or receiver of sound is important in many industrial applications, such as <b>fiscal</b> <b>measurements</b> of natural gas, therein multipath ultrasonic transit-time flow meters, measurements on the velocity of sound in the gas, as well as quality measurements on natural gas. A recurring challenge when attempting to measure the {{phase response}} of transducers acoustically are the estimates of both the separation distance between the transmitter and receiver {{as well as the}} speed of sound in the media. Small deviations in both are associated with large deviations in the measured phase. For example, at 100 kHz given a sound speed in air of 343 m/s, a deviation of only ± 1 mm in the measured distance between the transmitter and receiver gives a phase deviation of ± 105 º, and for 300 kHz the phase deviation is ± 315 º. In the current work, laser sensors are employed to determine the separation distance between the transmitter and receiver. The uncertainty associated with the distance measurement is estimated to be 40 µm. Utilizing the lasers, piezoelectric disks operating in air are calibrated using the reciprocity method for both magnitude and phase. The calibrated quantities are the transmitting voltage response and the receiving voltage sensitivity, and the frequency range of primary interest is 70 - 125 kHz, where a SNR larger than 40 dB is expected. The calibrated quantities are compared to FE-simulations, and around 90 - 105 kHz the deviations between the simulated and measured phases are less then 15 º for the receiving voltage sensitivity, and approximately 6. 5 º for the transmitting voltage response. 8 measurements on the repeatability of the measurement set-up have been performed and the standard deviation about the mean is calculated to 2 º for the same frequency range. The measurement uncertainties are developed for magnitude and indicates an uncertainty of approximately 0. 3 dB.

(1) The variance in fiscal capacity was reduced when measured {{by adjusting the}} property tax base by weighting personal income and assessed valuation of real property equally relative to the variance in capacity measured by assessed valuation of real property or by the product of assessed valuation of real property and personal income relative to statewide average personal income.

(3) Low tax effort districts exhibited above average assessed valuation, below average property tax liability, below average K- 12 enrollment, and median age of adult residents, 49. 0 years. (4) High tax effort districts showed significant correlations between tax effort and median age of adult residents (+. 4407) and percentage {{of students enrolled in}} public scholls (+. 6484).

40|$|A {{generally}} recognized object of fiscal federalism is the equalization {{of the fiscal}} position of subnational governments. Fiscal position refers {{to the relationship between}} a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s relative ability to generate revenues from own sources (its fiscal capacity) and the expenditures required to provide certain levels of publically provided goods and services (its fiscal need). The existence of variations in fiscal position among subnational governments will result in variations in the tax effort of States required to finance any given service levels, consequently violating the principle of horizontal equity (i. e., people in equal positions should be treated equally). ^ In the pursuit of equalization objectives in the U. S. Federal-State fiscal relations, income is most frequently used to measure fiscal capacity and population or some subset of population is most frequently used to measure need for services in grant allocation formulae. Yet income and population may have substantial shortcomings as measures of fiscal capacity and fiscal need. If indeed these measures do prove to lack precision in assessing a State 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal position, there may be a misallocation of Federal grants among the States. The principle objectives of this research are to examine the current role of equalization in Federal-State fiscal relations and to evaluate how well population and income measure a State 2 ̆ 7 s needs and capacity to finance those needs. An alternative approach to the measurement of State and local fiscal capacity and fiscal need, based on positive economic theory, is presented in this research. The alternative measures are intended to be normative and not necessarily designed for employment in actual policy situations. Rather, the measures developed in the research are used to appraise the income and population measures presently used in Federal-State fiscal relations and other measures suggested in the literature in the past. ^ The alternative approach to fiscal capacity and <b>fiscal</b> need <b>measurement</b> developed in this thesis is based on a simultaneous equation financial model to explain interstate variations in nonFederal public spending decisions by major expenditure functions (ie., local education and highways). The model considers the interaction between demand factors (aggregated at the State level) and the role of perceived tax price in State and local expenditure determination. Two-stage least square regression techniques are employed to estimate the model using 1972 cross-sectional data for the State and local governments. ^ The principle conclusion of this research is that income and population are not adequate proxies for State and local fiscal capacity and fiscal need (nor are the other approaches suggested in the literature). In particular, it was found that in the Northeast and North Central States, population tends to underestimate fiscal need and income tends to overestimate fiscal capacity. In most low income States, the reverse is true. That is, population overestimates fiscal need and income underestimates fiscal capacity. ...|$|R
