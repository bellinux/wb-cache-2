The data for the study were generated from 499 Uda ramsrandomly selected from different herds in Nasarawa State, north-central Nigeria. Pearson’s moment correlation (r) between body weight and morphometric traits ranged from moderate to high values (r = 0. 43 - 0. 76; P≤ 0. 01). Basedon {{the importance of the}} independent variables in predicting the body weight of sheep, five body measurementsnamely; chest circumference, shoulder width, rump width, body length and <b>face</b> <b>length</b> were found to be moreefficient. Thus, they were the variables entered to obtain the optimal regression tree. Among these five variables,chest circumference was found to be the primary splitting variable; and together with <b>face</b> <b>length</b> accounted for about 62 % of the variation in body weight. The regression tree analysis indicated that animals with chest circumference > 87. 45 cm or ≤ 94. 05 cm and <b>face</b> <b>length</b> > 28. 85 cm could be expected to have higher body weights.

40|$|Longwall panels, where geologically possible, are {{becoming}} larger everyday. The increase in size {{is limited by}} rock mechanics and economic factors. In a caving longwall panel, as the <b>face</b> <b>length</b> increases, pressure exerted {{on the edges of}} the entries {{on both sides of the}} panel increases up to a limit and then decreases. From this point, only the pressure on the face ends increases, although more slowly. The induced stress lies within the mineral and hence only affects the sides of the adjacent roads and not the immediate roof. The capacity of the powered supports therefore need not increase with the length. The only problem remains to be possibility of rock bursts and the instability at the cross-sections with the face, before yielding of the rock that occurs at the start of coal outing and before caving is completed.

We used facial {{photographs}} of 600 Korean women obtained from 2003 ~ 2004 Size Korea Project and we measured these photographs indirectly in this study by utilizing the Venus face 2 D program. Total 62 measurements on the face were measured and analyzed by statistical methods. The results were as follows. First of all, the mean of <b>face</b> <b>length</b> was 196 mm, top <b>face</b> <b>length</b> was 62. 3 mm, middle <b>face</b> <b>length</b> was 68. 9 mm, bottom <b>face</b> <b>length</b> was 66. 5 mm, mean of forehead width was 125. 1 mm. As based on those average sizes, we proposed a average facial size and shape of Korean women and a average facial size and shape of 20 's, 30 's, 40 's and 50 's in this study. When examined characteristic of 20 's facial shape, it was recognized that the width of forehead was wider and the width of gnathion was smaller than other age groups. In the characteristic of 30 's facial shape, the ratios of facial length, top of face, middle of face and bottom of face were balanced well, as comparing with other age groups. Overall, the values of facial measurement of 30 's were similar to the averages of total women. In the facial shape of 40 's, mean length and width of face each were the smallest among each age group. The eye shape of 40 's was more drooped than the average eye shape and the protrusion of the zygomatic bone was significantly different. In case of the facial shape of 50 's, it was similar to the facial shape of 40 's, but mean lengths and widths of 50 's face were slightly larger than the values of 40 's.

40|$|Abstract Background When simple {{sequence}} repeats {{are integrated}} into functional genes, they can potentially act as evolutionary ‘tuning knobs’, supplying abundant genetic variation with minimal risk of pleiotropic deleterious effects. The genetic basis {{of variation in}} facial shape and length represents a possible example of this phenomenon. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2), which is involved in osteoblast differentiation, contains a functionally-important tandem repeat of glutamine and alanine amino acids. The ratio of glutamines to alanines (the QA ratio) in this protein seemingly influences the regulation of bone development. Notably, in domestic breeds of dog, and in carnivorans in general, the ratio of glutamines to alanines is strongly correlated with facial length. Results In this study we examine whether this correlation holds true across placental mammals, particularly those mammals for which facial length is highly variable and related to adaptive behavior and lifestyle (e. g., primates, afrotherians, xenarthrans). We obtained relative facial length measurements and RUNX 2 sequences for 41 mammalian species representing 12 orders. Using both a phylogenetic generalized least squares model and a recently-developed Bayesian comparative method, we tested for a correlation between genetic and morphometric data while controlling for phylogeny, evolutionary rates, and divergence times. Non-carnivoran taxa generally had substantially lower glutamine-alanine ratios than carnivorans (primates and xenarthrans with means of 1. 34 and 1. 25, respectively, compared to a mean of 3. 1 for carnivorans), and we found no correlation between RUNX 2 sequence and <b>face</b> <b>length</b> across placental mammals. Conclusions Results of our diverse comparative phylogenetic analyses indicate that QA ratio does not consistently correlate with <b>face</b> <b>length</b> across the 41 mammalian taxa considered.
