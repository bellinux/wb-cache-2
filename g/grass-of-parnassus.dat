50|$|Areas fed by {{freshwater}} springs support common butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> (Parnassia palustris), {{marsh lousewort}} (Pedicularis palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), sea arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima) and the rare seaside centaury (Centaurium littorale).|$|E
50|$|Shale {{cliff and}} talus community, 6 acre. Featuring damp, sheer cliffs with loose rocks and talus accumulations at their base; ledges support some sparse {{herbaceous}} plant cover, including flat-top aster (Doellingeria umbellata), fen <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> (Parnassia glauca), and bladder ferns (Cystopteris).|$|E
50|$|The area {{adjacent}} to Hisehope Burn is predominantly a soligenous mire, with a sparse tree cover of downy birch, Betula pubescens, and alder, Alnus glutinosa; the mire {{is rich in}} sedges, Carex spp and bryophytes and contains several species that are localised in County Durham, including few-flowered spike rush, Eleocharis quinqueflora, <b>grass-of-Parnassus,</b> Parnassia palustris, sundew, Drosera rotundifolia, and lesser clubmoss, Selaginella selaginoides.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} local wetland areas {{strongly}} influenced by limestone characterised by marsh valerian (Valeriana dioica), butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), lesser club-moss (Selaginella selaginoides), <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> (Parnassia palustris), dioecious sedge (Carex dioica), few-flowered spike-rush (Eleocharis quinqueflora) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans). Dry limestone flora {{are for the most}} part not found on the moors, with the exception of areas of mat-grass (Nardus stricta).|$|E
50|$|As {{part of a}} 2002 {{marketing}} campaign, {{the plant}} conservation charity Plantlife chose the <b>Grass-of-Parnassus</b> as the county flower. Parnassus flowers had {{been associated with the}} county since 1951, when they were included in the coat of arms granted to the Cumberland County Council. They subsequently featured in the arms granted to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council, in both cases to represent Cumberland.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been studied by botanists since the 17th century and {{attracted}} particular interest in the Victorian era. More than 300 species of vascular plants have been recorded in the area, though {{some of them have}} not been found in recent years. Rare plants include <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> and marsh helleborine orchid, which are on the Red List of Threatened Species compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|The {{treeless}} {{summit is}} home to rare plant species including three-toothed cinquefoil (Sibbaldia tridentata) and Rocky Mountain woodsia (Woodsia scopulina); other rare plants, such as bog bluegrass (Poa paludigena) and large-leaved <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> (Parnassia grandifolia), are found at seeps along the mountain's base. In total, the preserve protects thirteen rare plant occurrences, three rare animal occurrences, and six significant natural communities. Buffalo Mountain is also {{the only place in}} the world where the mealybug Puto kosztarabi is known to live.|$|E
50|$|Upstream, in Lanark County, {{there are}} two {{sections}} of the river that are important for their plant communities. The first section of interest includes {{the east end of}} Dalhousie Lake and the swamp- and marsh-lined portion of the Mississippi River from the lake almost to Sheridans Rapids. Shallow lakes and adjacent river make up the provincially significant McCullochs Mud Lake Wetland. The second portion of interest is the rocky, rapid-filled section of the river from Sheridans Rapids down to just past Playfairville. Here there are small populations of unusual species including Parnassia glauca (<b>Grass-of-parnassus),</b> Platanthera flava (Tubercled Orchid) and Spiranthes lucida (Shining Ladies'-tresses).|$|E
50|$|The rushing water carves out small {{depressions}} where soil accumulates, forming micro-islands {{that play}} host to plants that thrive {{with low levels of}} nutrients and shallow root structures. Typical species include Sphagnum moss; carnivorous plants such as round-leaf sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea and S. jonesii), and horned bladderwort (Utricularia cornuta); several orchid species such as common grass pink (Calopogon tuberosus), small green wood-orchid (Platanthera clavellata), rose pogonia (Pogonia ophioglossoides), and nodding ladies’-tresses (Spiranthes cernua). Other plants found in cataract bogs are limeseep <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> (Parnassia grandifolia), Indian paint brush (Castilleja coccinea), stiff cowbane (Oxypolis rigidior), Appalachian bluet (Houstonia serpyllifolia) and northern sundrops (Oenothera tetragona).|$|E
50|$|Wooded {{areas of}} Billsmoor Park support alder (Alnus glutinosa) with some hazel (Corylus avellana) on lower lying wet soils, and an {{undergrowth}} of soft rush (Juncus effusus), {{tufted hair grass}} (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood-sedge (Carex sylvatica), greater-tussock sedge (C. paniculata) and pendulous sedge (C. pendula). Birch is found on steeper sections of the valley. Above the woodlands, open areas of the site support bracken and occasional birch, with grassland composed of mat grass (Nardus stricta), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and common bent (Agrostis capillaris). In very wet areas of the site, mire vegetation arises, including bog myrtle (Myrica gale), broad-leaved cottongrass (Eriophorum latifolium), <b>grass-of-Parnassus</b> (Parnassia palustris) and purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and, around springs, yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum), bugle (Ajuga reptans) and water mint (Mentha aquatica).|$|E

The Osprey (1970 -present) is a provincial nature journal and the main publication of Nature Newfoundland and Labrador, a province-wide organization with a primary interest in promoting the enjoyment and protection of wildlife and natural history resources {{in the province of}} Newfoundland and Labrador and its surrounding waters. The periodical provides a forum for discussion of environmental issues, and is a source of information and original research material focusing on various aspects of the province's natural history such as birds, plants, insects, mammals, general ecology and philosophical nature musings in the form of poetry or prose. Additionally, the journal serves to update members on society affairs such as meetings, outings, lectures, presentations, and projects. It publishes work from biologists, ecologists, trained naturalists, and untrained nature enthusiasts alike...|$|E
40|$|The new Flora of Bedfordshire has {{now been}} published, {{following}} years of recording {{by members of the}} Society. <b>Grass-of-Parnassus</b> painted by Caroline Gaye in 1844 County Floras have been and still are an important feature of Britain’s botanical scene. The Flora of Bedfordshire will provide an up-to-date account of the status and distribution of the flowering plants and mosses of the county, and place their occurrence in the context of over 400 years of study of the local flora. For Bedfordshire it follows {{in a long line of}} such works, from Charles Abbot’s Flora Bedfordiensis in 1798, to James Saunders’ Field Flowers of Bedfordshire of 1911 and, more recently John Dony’s masterly Flora of Bedfordshire of 1953 and Bedfordshire Plant Atlas of 1976. The authors, Chris Boon for the flowering plants, and Alan Outen for the mosses, have each spent many years studying their fields of natural history, and are not only recorders for the county, but are also involved with their respective national societies. The flora is the culmination of more than 20 years of a comprehensive programme of recording in the county by the BNHS. There are introductory chapters on many aspects pertaining to the flora of the county including geology, soils, conservation of the countryside and changes in the flora over the last 50 years. Also given are accounts of the history of botany in Bedfordshire, and an overview of the botanical hotspots. Significant records are listed, and the distribution maps for each of the 2, 250 species that have ever been recorded in the county show their presence in areas of 2 x 2 km. A unique feature is the indication on the maps of the distribution data from an earlier survey in the 1970 s by John Dony, the distinguished former county botanist, showing clearly the changes that have taken place...|$|E
