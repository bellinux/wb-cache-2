According to University of Pennsylvania Law School Professors David Shakow and Reed Shuldiner, [...] "A wealth tax also taxes capital that is not productively employed. Thus, a wealth tax {{can be viewed as}} a tax on potential income from capital." [...] Because a net wealth tax can be the equivalent of an annual tax on <b>imputed</b> income, the <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> estate and gift taxes are not necessary.|$|R

Plans which reduce <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes by excluding a fixed fraction of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> from taxable income, by taxing real rather than nominal gains, and by using a sliding scale <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> exclusion are considered. We reach three main conclusions. 1. Using plausible measures of economic status, <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> receipts are highly concentrated among those with high incomes. The richest 2 percent of Americans receive more than 50 percent of all <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> Claims that <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> recipients only appear to be rich because their <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> income is transitory are not supported by longitudinal data. Likewise, claims that a large fraction of the benefits from <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax reductions flow to middle income taxpayers result from failing to consider tax shelters. <b>Capital</b> <b>gains</b> on corporate stocks are considerably more concentrated among high income indi-viduals than <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> on other assets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In a {{cross-border}} takeover, the {{tax base}} associated with future <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> is transferred from target shareholders to acquirer shareholders. Cross-country differences in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rates enable us to estimate the discount in the takeover price on account of future <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> The estimation suggests that a one percentage point increase in the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rate reduces the valuation of new equity by 0. 136 %. The implied average effective tax rate on <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> is 4. 57 %, indicating that <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation is a significant cost to firms when raising new equity capital. Apart from the taxation of future <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> we also find that takeover prices are affected by <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation resulting from the accelerated realization of past <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> by target shareholders...|$|R
40|$|Lowering or {{eliminating}} {{the tax on}} <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> may be a tempting undertaking for Canada's federal government facing electorate pressure. It {{may also be a}} tempting course of action for interest groups and public policy stakeholders. To analyse the merits of such a policy measure, this paper explores two queries. Fist, how the previous changes in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation affected the level of realization of <b>capital</b> <b>gains?</b> And, second, do provincial differences in tax rates transpire into differences in the intensity of realizing <b>capital</b> <b>gains?</b> The analysis shows that only {{a relatively small number of}} Canadians report <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> and a smaller proportion of them effectively pay taxes on <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> The changes in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rate introduced in 2000 lead to only a temporary increase in intensity and volume of realized <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> Similarly, no significant increase in holdings of capital assets by households was observed.

40|$|From 1922 to 1986, {{long-term}} <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> were {{taxed at}} lower rates than other income, generally by allowing {{a portion of}} long-term <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> to be excluded from taxable income. While taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> at the same rates as other income has been hailed {{by some as a}} major accomplishment of tax reform, it has been criticized by others as one of its main flaws. As a result, there have been proposals each year since 1986 to restore some type of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> preference. These proposals have sparked a lively debate centered on three main questions: Would reducing the <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax lower or raise federal revenues?

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes on investment decisions {{is a central}} issue of accounting and public finance research. However, the implications of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes on investors' willingness to invest in irreversible projects with entry and exit flexibility {{have not yet been}} a focal issue. As a result, the effects of taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> on the interdependencies of investment and divestment decisions have to be identified, especially under timing flexibility. This paper closes this gap by simultaneously analyzing investment timing and abandonment decisions for risky irreversible investment projects with uncertain cash flows under differential tax rates for ordinary income and <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> We investigate whether <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxes affect immediate and delayed investment asymmetrically. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation on the optimal abandonment decision. Performing extensive numerical simulations we find that varying the liquidation proceeds affects the decision whether or not to postpone the investment decision. Higher cash flow volatility favors delayed investment. We find that the introduction of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation tends to be harmful for immediate investment. Moreover, we show that taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> may induce a tax paradox for delayed investment. Depending on the pre-tax parameter setting the future value of delayed investment may even increase in absolute terms for increasing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> tax rates. For sufficiently high liquidation proceeds <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation tends to favor continuation of a project. We find taxing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> mainly induces other, but not necessarily less arbitrary distortions than exempting <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA 97) {{significantly}} {{changed the}} tax treatment of housing <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> in the United States.
