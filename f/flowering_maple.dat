50|$|As {{they are}} {{a major source of}} pollen in early spring before many other plants have <b>flowered,</b> <b>maples</b> are {{important}} to the survival of honeybees that play a commercially important role later in the spring and summer.|$|R
5|$|Red pandas are {{excellent}} climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries. In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, <b>flowers,</b> <b>maple</b> and mulberry leaves, and bark and fruits of maple, beech, and mulberry.|$|R
50|$|Common garden plants include dogwood, azalea, hydrangea, <b>flowering</b> cherry, <b>maples,</b> pin oak, red-tip photinia, holly, juniper, white pine, magnolia, Bradford pear, forsythia, liriope (mondograss), and English ivy. Lawns can {{be either}} cool-season grasses like fescue and rye, or warm-season like zoysia and {{bermudagrass}} which turn brown in late fall. A few homeowners associations actually prohibit green grass in the winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} regular, pentamerous, and borne in racemes, corymbs, or umbels. They have {{four or five}} sepals, four or five petals about 1 - 6 mm long (absent in some species), four to ten stamens about 6 - 10 mm long, and two pistils or a pistil with two styles. The ovary is {{superior}} and has two carpels, whose wings elongate the flowers, {{making it easy to}} tell which <b>flowers</b> are female. <b>Maples</b> <b>flower</b> in late winter or early spring, in most species with or just after the appearance of the leaves, but in some before the trees leaf out.|$|R
50|$|<b>Maple</b> <b>flowers</b> are green, yellow, {{orange or}} red. Though {{individually}} small, {{the effect of}} an entire tree in flower can be striking in several species. Some maples are an early spring source of pollen and nectar for bees.|$|R

50|$|Acer sinopurpurascens is a {{deciduous}} tree up to 10 meters {{tall with}} brownish-gray bark. It is dioecious, meaning that {{male and female}} flowers are on separate trees. Leaves are non-compound, up to 14 cm wide and 8 cm across, thin and papery, usually with 5 lobes but sometimes with only 3. Flowers are purple, unlike the green <b>flowers</b> of most <b>maples.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{non-native}} plants also occur, {{including many}} invasive {{species such as}} English ivy, Scotch broom, laurel-leafed daphne, Himalayan blackberry, chicory, Queen Anne's lace, and red clover. Long-established exotic trees include London plane, horsechestnut, flowering cherry, <b>flowering</b> plum, Norway <b>maple,</b> sycamore maple, Japanese maple, catalpa and tulip tree. In recent years the American sweetgum, Freeman maple and Chinese windmill palm have become very popular.|$|R
50|$|The campus {{has since}} become a {{conglomeration}} of facilities displaying the differences in architectural influences for over a century. At 15.0 acre, the campus on Oakwood Road ranks among the most beautiful {{in the state and}} country. The outdoor living classroom of trees with historical significance also cultivates <b>flowering</b> dogwoods, <b>maples,</b> and oaks, which enhance the landscape and make every season a beautiful environment for learning.The campus currently consists of the original school and several separate structures including a science and mathematics building called the Freshman building, a full-sized gymnasium, and a cafeteria. The decentralized campus provides for a college atmosphere due to the outdoor nature of travel between classes. The campus also features many walkways, a small waterfall, flowering bushes, and rolling hills.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is covered}} {{in a number of}} native species. There are a variety of oak {{including}} Southern live oak, water oak, laurel oak, white oak, overcup oak, post oak, black oak as well as other hardwood trees such as American sweetgum, a variety of magnolia, as well as hickory, <b>flowering</b> dogwood, red <b>maple,</b> and redbud. Conifers are also abundant, including shortleaf pine, loblolly pine. The Red Hills are home to some of the last remnants of the great longleaf pine forests remaining in the nation.|$|R
50|$|The house stands {{independently}} as a masterpiece. Where {{the interior}} blends into the exterior, the gentleness of nature {{flows into the}} softness of the space, and light creates a subtle modulation within. Both aspects create an aura that solidifies sensibly where {{the inner and outer}} worlds meet. The house is in perfect harmony with nature - there is no garden architecture, no pathways, beds or <b>flowers.</b> A large <b>maple</b> tree protects the raised travertine marble terrace. The discrete white of the steel construction and the transparent glass panes make the house almost invisible; it offers its respect to nature.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the process of}} stand degradation of individual forest ecosystems {{in the region of}} the zonal community Tilio-Carpino-Qurcetum robori-cerris Jov. 79 located {{in the western part of}} Fruška Gora National Park. Degradation occurred is consequence to regeneration felling and it progressed towards the extinction of oaks, first of all the valuable pedunculate oak and Vergilius's oak, and then also Turkey oak. The analyzed mature stands were degraded coppice and mainly predominated by the Turkey oak in the tree stratum. In juvenile stands, often initially well regenerated with Turkey oak, the dominant species in the tree stratum are lime, hornbeam, <b>flowering</b> ash, field <b>maple</b> and other secondary species, predominantly of coppice origin. Restitution of the degraded stands is possible by applying an adequate regeneration system. Taking into account the primarily protective function of the analyzed forest ecosystems and the fact that these are degraded and coppice stands, the system of regeneration should be based on combined restoration...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{medicines}} {{and the use}} of botanical extracts in the prevention and treatment of ailments is globally gaining interest (Mazzio and Soliman, 2009). Detrimental side effects may be reduced using natural therapies (Desai et al., 2008). Worldwide, there are about 120 different maple species. Of those, thirteen are native to eastern North America (Maple Field Guide, 2002). Maple syrup is a natural sweetener derived from collected and concentrated maple tree sap. It takes about 40 liters of sap to make one liter of syrup. Maple plant parts have been used by Native Americans for medicinal purposes. The University of Rhode Island’s Bioactive Botanical Research Laboratory (BBRL) has evaluated the biological activities of maple parts including maple leaves, bark, sap, and syrup. Results include α-glucosidase inhibition, -one of the several strategies of diabetes management, from red maple (Acer rubrum) stems (Wan, et al. 2012) and the antiproliferative effects on colon cancer cells (González-Sarrías et al,. 2012) of compounds isolated from maple sap and syrup. Of the maple plant parts studied so far, the flowers are yet to be examined for phytochemicals and biological activity. This project explores the isolation and structural elucidation of phytochemicals present in red <b>maple</b> <b>flowers...</b>|$|R
6000|$|My tent was pitched {{on a broad}} terrace, {{opposite}} the junction of the Zemu and Thlonok, and 10,850 feet above the sea. It was sheltered by some enormous transported blocks of gneiss, fifteen feet high, and surrounded by a luxuriant vegetation of most beautiful rhododendrons in full flower, willow, white rose, white <b>flowered</b> cherry, thorn, <b>maple</b> and birch. Some great tuberous-rooted Arums* [Two species of Arisaema, called [...] "Tong" [...] by the Tibetans, and [...] "Sinkree" [...] by the Lepchas.] were very abundant; and the ground was covered with small pits, in which were large wooden pestles: these {{are used in the}} preparation of food from the arums, to which the miserable inhabitants of the valley have recourse in spring, when their yaks are calving. The roots are bruised with the pestles, and thrown into these holes with water. Acetous fermentation commences in seven or eight days, which is a sign that the acrid poisonous principle is dissipated: the pulpy, sour, and fibrous mass is then boiled and eaten; its nutriment being the starch, which exists in small quantities, and which they have not the skill to separate by grating and washing. This preparation only keeps a few days, and produces bowel complaints, and loss of the skin and hair, especially when insufficiently fermented. Besides this, the [...] "chokli-bi," [...] and many other esculents, abounded here; and we had great need of them before leaving this wild uninhabited region.|$|R
5000|$|The cove forest {{community}} is particularly well {{developed in the}} Great Smoky Mountains, where some 72000 acre of cove forest are still old-growth. [...] The forest there is categorized into three subclasses. The rich montane subclass is found in protected coves with nutrient-rich soils, typically at elevations of 610 to 1,400 m, in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. Dominant trees may include sugar maple, yellow buckeye, white ash, silverbell, or basswood, but yellow birch and beech are not dominant species. Bitternut hickory and northern red oak also may be common in the canopy. A defining feature of the rich montane association {{is the presence of}} lush herbaceous flora, including calciphilic plants whose presence indicates soils of neutral to alkaline pH (typically formed on limestone). The typic montane subclass of cove forest is characterized by the absence or scarcity of calciphilic species and is found on non-limestone soils at elevations of 600 to 1,370 m in the southern Blue Ridge, including the Smoky Mountains, and 300 to 900 m in the northern Blue Ridge and adjacent Ridge and Valley. Dominant canopy trees include yellow buckeye, white ash, basswood, cucumber-tree magnolia, tulip poplar, red maple, Eastern hemlock, and black birch. Typical subcanopy trees and shrubs include <b>flowering</b> dogwood, striped <b>maple,</b> sweetshrub, and rosebay rhododendron. In the third subclass, the typic foothills type, tulip poplar is the dominant species, but the canopy also may include basswood, white ash, mockernut hickory, yellow buckeye, silverbell, American beech, white oak, and red maple. Ferns are often common in the herbaceous layer. This subclass, found on protected sites at elevations mostly below 610 m, lacks species typical of higher elevation cove forests.|$|R
