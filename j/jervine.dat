25|$|Amianthium {{consists}} of a single species, A. muscitotoxum, known as flypoison. It is found in eastern North America. It grows from a bulb and has a dense oval-shaped inflorescence. Individual flowers start off white and develop red-green shades with age. All parts of the plant are poisonous; two unique alkaloids, <b>jervine</b> and amianthine, contribute to its toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Veratrum nigrum {{contains}} more than 200 steroid-derived alkaloids, including isorubijervine, <b>jervine,</b> pseudojervine, rubijervine, tienmuliumine, tienmuliluminine, and verazine. The herb causes irritation of mucous membranes. When ingested, the irritation of the mucosal membranes of the stomach and intestines will cause nausea and vomiting. If the herb is introduced to the nose, this mucosal irritation will cause sneezing and coughing. Ingestion can also cause bradycardia (slow heart rate), hyperactivity, and hypotension (low blood pressure). In high concentrations, topical contact can cause skin irritation, excessive tears from the eyes, and redness.|$|E

40|$|Protoveratrine {{was first}} isOlated by Salzberger (1) from Veratrum album. Further {{chemical}} studies by Poethke (2, 3) revealed {{that it is}} a triacylester of the alkamine protoverine, and that the three acids in combination with proto-verine are acetic acid, methylethyl acetic acid, and methylethyl glycolic acid. According to Craig and Jacobs (4) and Jacobs and Craig (5) the empirical formulae of protoveratrine and protoverine are C 3 H 1 O 1 N and C 2 rHaON respectively.

Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) has been described to {{play a crucial role}} in the proliferation and differentiation of leukemia cells, this enzyme seems to play an important role in chemoresistance in different cancer types. Previously, we demonstrated that diosgenin, a plant steroid, induced apoptosis in HEL cells with concomitant COX- 2 overexpression. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of cyclopamine and <b>jervine,</b> two steroidal alkaloids with similar structures, on HEL and TF 1 a human erythroleukemia cell lines and, for the first time, their effect on COX- 2 expression. Cyclopamine, but not <b>jervine,</b> inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cells. Both compounds induced COX- 2 overexpression which was responsible for apoptosis resistance. In jervine-treated cells, COX- 2 overexpression was NF-κB dependent. Inhibition of NF-κB reduced COX- 2 overexpression and induced apoptosis. In addition, cyclopamine induced apoptosis and COX- 2 overexpression via PKC activation. Inhibition of the PKC pathway reduced both apoptosis and COX- 2 overexpression in both cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the p 38 /COX- 2 pathway was involved in resistance to cyclopamine-induced apoptosis since p 38 inhibition reduced COX- 2 overexpression and increased apoptosis in both cell lines...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} in order to investigate the antiobese effects of the ethanolic extract of Veratri Nigri Rhizoma et Radix (VN), a herb with limited usage, due to its toxicology. An HPLC analysis identified <b>jervine</b> as a constituent of VN. By an Oil Red O assay and a Real-Time RT-PCR assay, VN showed higher antiadipogenic effects than <b>jervine.</b> In high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced obese C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, VN administration suppressed body weight gain. The levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein (aP 2), adiponectin, resistin, and LIPIN 1 were suppressed by VN, while SIRT 1 was upregulated. Furthermore, VN activated phosphorylation of the liver kinase B 1 - (LKB 1 -) AMP-activated protein kinase alpha- (AMPKα-) acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) axis. Further investigation of cotreatment of VN with the AMPK agonist AICAR or AMPK inhibitor Compound C showed that VN can activate the phosphorylation of AMPKα in compensation to the inhibition of Compound C. In conclusion, VN shows antiobesity effects in HFD-induced obese C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. In 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, VN has antiadipogenic features, {{which is due to}} activating the LKB 1 -AMPKα-ACC axis. These results suggest that VN has a potential benefit in preventing obesity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFrom time of {{embryonic}} emergence, the gustatory papilla types on the mammalian tongue have stereotypic anterior and posterior tongue locations. Furthermore, on anterior tongue, the fungiform papillae are patterned in rows. Among the many molecules that have potential roles in regulating papilla location and pattern, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been localized within early tongue and developing papillae. We used an embryonic, tongue organ culture system that retains temporal, spatial, and molecular characteristics of in vivo taste papilla morphogenesis and patterning {{to study the}} role of Shh in taste papilla development. Tongues from gestational day 14 rat embryos, when papillae {{are just beginning to}} emerge on dorsal tongue, were maintained in organ culture for 2 days. The steroidal alkaloids, cyclopamine and <b>jervine,</b> that specifically disrupt the Shh signaling pathway, or a Shh-blocking antibody were added to the standard culture medium. Controls included tongues cultured in the standard medium alone, and with addition of solanidine, an alkaloid that resembles cyclopamine structurally but that does not disrupt Shh signaling. In cultures with cyclopamine, <b>jervine,</b> or blocking antibody, fungiform papilla numbers doubled on the dorsal tongue with a distribution that essentially eliminated inter-papilla regions, compared with tongues in standard medium or solanidine. In addition, fungiform papillae developed on posterior oral tongue, just in front of and beside the single circumvallate papilla, regions where fungiform papillae do not typically develop. The Shh protein was in all fungiform papillae in embryonic tongues, and tongue cultures with standard medium or cyclopamine, and was conspicuously localized in the basement membrane region of the papillae. Ptc protein had a similar distribution to Shh, although the immunoproduct was more diffuse. Fungiform papillae did not develop on pharyngeal or ventral tongue in cyclopamine and <b>jervine</b> cultures, or in the tongue midline furrow, nor was development of the single circumvallate papilla altered. The results demonstrate a prominent role for Shh in fungiform papilla induction and patterning and indicate differences in morphogenetic control of fungiform and circumvallate papilla development and numbers. Furthermore, a previously unknown, broad competence of dorsal lingual epithelium to form fungiform papillae on both anterior and posterior oral tongue is revealed...|$|E
40|$|Activation of Hedgehog (Hh) {{signaling}} {{requires the}} transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), {{a member of}} the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. In mammals, Smo translocates to the primary cilium upon binding of Hh ligands to their receptor, Patched (Ptch 1), but it is unclear if ciliary trafficking of Smo is sufficient for pathway activation. Here, we demonstrate that cyclopamine and <b>jervine,</b> two structurally related inhibitors of Smo, force ciliary translocation of Smo. Treatment with SANT- 1, an unrelated Smo antagonist, abrogates cyclopamine- and jervine-mediated Smo translocation. Further, activation of protein kinase A, either directly or through activation of Galphas, causes Smo to translocate to a proximal region of the primary cilium. We propose that Smo adopts multiple inactive and active conformations, which influence its localization and trafficking on the primary cilium...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{based on}} triple {{quadrupole}} tandem mass spectrometry {{have been widely}} used and reported as highly selective and sensitive methods for quantifying substances of herbal medicines. However, most of them were limited to targeted components, due to the difficulties to optimize the multiple reaction monitoring transitions without authentic standards. This study proposed a novel strategy for non-targeted optimization of multiple reaction monitoring method based on the diagnostic ion guided family classifications, tandem mass spectrometry database establishment, and transitions and collision energy screening. Applying this strategy, 59 Fritillaria alkaloids in Fritillariae Ussuriensis Bulbus have been classified, and 51 of these Fritillaria alkaloids were successfully detected by the optimal multiple reaction monitoring method. For semi-quantification, the easy-to-obtain Fritillaria alkaloids of each type, such as verticinone for cevanine type and peimisine for <b>jervine</b> type, were used as the reference standards to calibrate the other Fritillaria alkaloids in the same type. The method was demonstrated a good linearity (R 2 > 0. 998) with satisfactory accuracy and precision, and the lower limits of quantification of verticinone and peimisine were estimated to be 0. 076 and 0. 216 pg, respectively. In addition, the results suggested that the proposed strategy might obtained high quality metabolomics data in discrimination of Fritillaria unibracteata and Fritillaria ussuriensis.

40|$|AbstractTaste {{papillae}} are ectodermal specializations {{that serve}} to house and distribute the taste buds and their renewing cell populations in specific locations on the tongue. We previously showed that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) {{has a major}} role in regulating the number and spatial pattern of fungiform taste papillae on embryonic rat tongue, during a specific period of papilla formation from the prepapilla placode. Now we have immunolocalized the Shh protein and the Patched receptor protein (Ptc), and have tested potential roles for Shh in formation of the tongue, emergence of papilla placodes, development of papilla number and size, and maintenance of papillae after morphogenesis is advanced. Cultures of entire embryonic mandible or tongues from gestational days 12 to 18 [gestational or embryonic days (E) 12 –E 18] were used, in which tongues and papillae develop with native spatial, temporal, and molecular characteristics. The Shh signaling pathway was disrupted with addition of cyclopamine, <b>jervine,</b> or the 5 E 1 blocking antibody. Shh and Ptc proteins are diffuse in prelingual tissue and early tongue swellings, and are progressively restricted to papilla placodes and then to regions of developing papillae. Ptc encircles the dense Shh immunoproduct in papillae at various stages. When the Shh signal is disrupted in cultures of E 12 mandible, tongue formation is completely prevented. At later stages of tongue culture initiation, Shh signal disruption alters development of tongue shape (E 13) and results in a repatterned fungiform papilla distribution that does not respect normally papilla-free tongue regions (E 13 –E 14). Only a few hours of Shh signal disruption can irreversibly alter number and location of fungiform papillae on anterior tongue and elicit papilla formation on the intermolar eminence. However, once papillae are well formed (E 16 –E 18), Shh apparently does not have a clear role in papilla maintenance, nor does the tongue retain competency to add fungiform papillae in atypical locations. Our data not only provide evidence for inductive and morphogenetic roles for Shh in tongue and fungiform papilla formation, but also suggest that Shh functions to maintain the interpapilla space and papilla-free lingual regions. We propose a model for Shh function at high concentration to form and maintain papillae and, at low concentration, to activate between-papilla genes that maintain a papilla-free epithelium...|$|E
