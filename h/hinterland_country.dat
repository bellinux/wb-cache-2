40|$|Discoveries {{of oil and}} gas in East African Countries (EAC) has {{attracted}} the attention of many MNCs and EMNCs. EAC governments of northern corridor countries have come together, not only to strengthen the Northern Corridor Transport System (NCTS), but also to establish a new transport corridor project called Lamu Port, Southern Sudan, and Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET). The project will transport crude oil to be refined at Lamu and to bring back refined oil and gas products to the <b>hinterland</b> <b>countries.</b> It consists of Roads, Railways, and Pipelines running through the Northern Corridor countries. This study was conducted to find out business opportunities created by the discovery {{of oil and gas}} in EAC countries, and to determine what othe...|$|R
40|$|The paper firstly {{describes}} how, {{using the}} two laws of ‘increasing firm size’ and ‘uneven development’, Hymer characterises the multinational corporation (MNC) as a geographically segmented hierarchy. In this structure HQs {{in a limited}} number of core countries exercise authoritarian control over global operations through the centralised generation of competitive advantages and determination of strategy. Poor <b>hinterland</b> <b>countries</b> then execute static and dependent low-value roles. The paper then discusses a number of changes to the practical configuration of MNCs since Hymer wrote. Notably the use of integrated supply networks, decentralisation of innovation and R&D and even of strategic decision making. The new organisation is seen in terms of Hedlund's heterarchy. But it is also noted that Hymer foresaw the potential of supply networks and showed the technological feasibility of heterarchical ‘grids’. The predicted persistence of hierarchy, for Hymer, was therefore a choice taken by MNCs to secure the continuation of core-country control and the ability to appropriate surplus from the periphery...|$|R

Taking the historical assumptions by Géraldine Muhlmann (2008) regarding unifying, decentralizing journalism as a starting point, this article discusses how Monteiro Lobato journalistically represented issues involving a national project in his narrative Problema Vital (1918). We conclude that the literary journalist condemned the Brazilian national crisisby omitting information on data concerning foreign countries and interpreting the scenario in the <b>hinterland</b> of the <b>country</b> with its lack of public sanitation...|$|R

This study investigates discriminatory indirect taxation in situations of tax competition for cross-border shoppers and …nds that such fears of increased tax competition are unwarranted. As long as the border region is su ¢ ciently large, tax rates will not be reduced in the border region or in the neighbouring country.

Lutz was also responsible for the identification of South American blastomycosis, which received his name (Lutz-Splendore-de-Almeida disease). His dedication to public health was also paramount to the research and fight of several epidemics in many points in Brazil, such as cholera, bubonic plague, smallpox, typhoid fever, malaria, ankylostomiasis, schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis; which were then widely prevalent as tropical diseases in the state, due to the poor conditions of poverty, hygiene and ignorance about its transmission mechanisms. To this purpose, Lutz travelled widely across Brazil, visiting often the <b>country's</b> <b>hinterland</b> along the São Francisco River.|$|R
5000|$|Clans of Liberia were local {{political}} units created {{as part of}} an effort to extend influence to the <b>hinterland</b> of the <b>country.</b> The first tier of administrative government, beneath districts of Liberia, the clan structure only loosely corresponded to traditional {{local political}} groupings. Clans were legally recognized through legislation in 1905 and 1912. In a number of cases the clans, each under a chief, were combined under larger units called chiefdoms and headed by a paramount chief. [...] Clans and chiefdoms were in some cases parts of a limited number of recognized tribes. [...] Indigenous Africans were regarded as corporate members of their respective groups rather than as individual citizens of Liberia. Clan land was owned communally and could be alienated only with the agreement of the chiefs. [...] The units of clans and chiefdoms gradually merged into the state. The County Council, affirmed in the Budget Act of 2012, replaced informal town hall meetings and includes a broad representation of citizen groups, districts, chiefdoms and clans.|$|R
40|$|Engendering {{interest}} and support {{among young people}} was a key strategy for the organisers of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Part of the approach entailed promoting the event as a context and inspirational catalyst to propel young people’s proclivities toward, and enduring participation in, sport and physical activity. Although a variety of participatory platforms were entertained, the discipline of physical education remained a favoured space in which enduring Olympic imperatives could be amalgamated with government policy objectives. In this paper data are presented taken from the initial three years of a longitudinal study on young people’s engagement with the London 2012 Olympic Games, sport, physical activity and physical education within the UK’s West Midlands region. Memory scholarship is brought together with Olympic critiques, legacy debates, youth work and discussions about physical education to conceptualise participants’ anticipations and recollections of the London 2012 Olympic Games as a triptych of narrative fragments: each provides insights regarding youth experiences and the remnants of Olympic ether in the <b>country’s</b> <b>hinterland.</b> The paper offers a means subsequently to think differently about how we might play with the qualitative sociological/historiographical moments (experiences, voices, accounts, stories, etc.) that we capture in and through our work...|$|R
40|$|Deficiencies {{of housing}} and urban {{infrastructures}} are heterogeneous in Brazil, making territorial analyses necessary. In this article we analyze data of the 2010 Census regarding "aglomerados subnormais" (AS), a national classification of census tracts that generally correspond to slums. We try to identify different behaviors taking into account the occurrence of AS in municipalities according to their position in the urban network, as well as their regional insertion. Using the classification of municipalities of Regi 5 es de Influ das Cidades 2007, a study by the national statistical office (IBGE), we find four trends. Firstly, the phenomenon of AS in 2010 is not as predominantly metropolitan as it was ten years before. A second trend refers to the intensification of the presence of AS in municipalities on the outskirts of metropolises. The third trend is a move of AS towards the <b>country's</b> <b>hinterland,</b> more accentuated in the North, while the presence of AS increases in municipalities in the coast of the Southeast and the Northeast. The fourth trend is the finding that AS are present in "networks of influence" of metropolises, comprising chains of centers at different levels. The identification of such trends adds complexity to the analysis of slums, and serves as an input to policies aimed at the urban development with regional and spatial equity...|$|R

The Southern Marmara part and Northern Aegean have formed the <b>hinterland</b> in our <b>country</b> of the port which exists on the routes of international maritime trade. While the port comes to the fore in respect of the function of service port, cargoes and passengers transportation play an important part too. As well as the advantages resulting from its geographical situation of the Çanakkale Kepez Port, it has a various of differentiated propertics with regard to the services it presents. In addition to the solid and liquid disposals purchasing services, the port has a production establisment of maritime fuel which will process the fuel oil and fuel oil derived disposals in the recycle facilities. From this aspect, the strait and the affiliated seas have an important mission to keep the dirty away.

40|$|Sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are the vectors of Leishmania parasites, the causative {{agents of}} {{leishmaniasis}}. Cutaneous leishmaniasis {{is an increasing}} public health problem in the Republic of Suriname and is mainly caused by Leishmania (Vianna) guyanensis, but L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (L.) amazonensis, and L. (V.) naiffi also infect humans. Transmission occurs predominantly in the forested <b>hinterland</b> of the <b>country.</b> Information regarding the potential vectors of leishmaniasis in Suriname is limited. This study aims to broaden the knowledge about vectors involved in the transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Suriname. For this purpose, sand flies were characterized in various foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the country, the districts of Para, Brokopondo, and Sipaliwini. Sand flies were collected in areas around mining plots and villages using CDC light traps in the period between February 2011 and March 2013. They were categorized by examination of the spermathecea (females) and the external genitalia (males). A total of 2, 743 sand fly specimens belonging to 34 different species were captured, including four species (Lutzomyia aragaoi, Lu. ayrozai, Lu. damascenoi, and Lu. sordellii) that {{had never before been}} described for Suriname. Five percent of the catch comprised Lu. squamiventris sensu lato, one female of which was positive with L. (V.) braziliensis and was captured in a gold mining area in Brokopondo. Other sand fly species found positive for Leishmania parasites were Lu. trichopyga, Lu. ininii, and Lu. umbratilis, comprising 32, 8, and 4 %, respectively, of the catch. These were captured at gold mining areas in Brokopondo and Sipaliwini, but the Leishmania parasites they had ingested could not be identified due to insufficient amounts of DNA. The sand fly fauna in Suriname is highly diverse and comprises Lutzomyia species capable of transmitting Leishmania parasites. Four new Lutzomyia species have been found, and four species - Lu. squamiventris (s. l.), Lu. trichopyga, Lu. ininii, and Lu. umbratilis - have been found to harbor Leishmania parasites. The latter were among the most abundant species captured. These observations may contribute to the understanding of leishmaniasis transmission and the development of control programs in Surinam...|$|R
