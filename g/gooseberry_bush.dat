60|$|So a {{whimsical}} fate ordered that her hat {{should be taken}} off--veil and all attached--and placed upon his head, Troy tossing his own into a <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush.</b> Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round his collar and the gloves put on him.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gooseberry</b> <b>bushes</b> are {{vulnerable}} to magpie moth (Abraxas grossulariata) caterpillars. In cultivation, the best method for removing them is to remove the larvae by hand soon after they hatch; its eggs are laid on fallen gooseberry leaves.|$|R
60|$|Button {{yearned to}} get in, and leaned so {{hard against the}} hateful fence that the rotten board cracked, a long bit fell out, and she nearly went after it, as it dropped upon the green bank below. Now the full splendor of the roses burst upon her, and a {{delightful}} <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush</b> stood close by with purplish berries temptingly bobbing within reach. This obliging bush hid the hole, but left fine openings to see through; so the child popped her curly head out, and gazed delightedly at the chickens, the flowers, the fruit, and the unconscious old gentleman not far away.|$|E
60|$|The twenty-one-years-old {{minister}} {{returned to}} the manse somewhat sadly, but when he saw his mother at the window of her bed-room, his heart leapt {{at the thought that}} she was with him and he had eighty pounds a year. Gaily he waved both his hands to her, and she answered with a smile, and then, in his boyishness, he jumped over a <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush.</b> Immediately afterwards he reddened and tried to look venerable, for while in the air he had caught sight of two women and a man watching him from the dyke. He walked severely to the door, and, again forgetting himself, was bounding upstairs to Margaret, when Jean, the servant, stood scandalised in his way.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a hot}} midday afternoon, not {{a breath}} of wind, and the dust was thick in the roads. Few people were about, but the deer beyond the park palings browsed in {{profound}} tranquillity. They saw {{a couple of big}} wasps stripping a <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush</b> just outside Hickleybrow, and another was crawling up and down the front of the little grocer's shop in the village street trying to find an entry. The grocer was dimly visible within, with an ancient fowling-piece in hand, watching its endeavours. The driver of the waggonette pulled up outside the Jolly Drovers and informed Redwood that his part of the bargain was done. In this contention he was presently joined by the drivers of the waggon and the trolley. Not only did they maintain this, but they refused to let the horses be taken further.|$|E
50|$|Lygocoris rugicollis {{is active}} from May to October, and feeds on plants, {{particularly}} on {{members of the}} Salicaceae and Betulaceae families. It has been reported as a pest on pome (apple trees) and ribes (currant and <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bushes)</b> in Europe.|$|R
50|$|It is {{native to}} Europe, northwestern Africa, west, south and {{southeast}} Asia. <b>Gooseberry</b> <b>bushes</b> produce an edible fruit and are grown on both a commercial and domestic basis. The species is also sparingly naturalized in scattered locations in North America.|$|R
60|$|And {{he walked}} away into the region of fruit trees and {{vegetable}} beds to exchange irritation for boredom. It was there, among the <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bushes</b> and beneath the medlar trees, that the temptation to the perpetration of a great literary fraud came to him.|$|R
60|$|The {{quietness}} of Mervyn's absence {{did much}} {{for the restoration of}} Phoebe's spirits. The dame's school was not delightful to her; she had not begun early enough in life for ease, but she did her tasks there as a duty, and was amply rewarded by the new enjoyment thus afforded to Maria. The importance of being surrounded by a ring of infants, teaching the alphabet, guiding them round the <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush,</b> or leading their songs and hymns, was felicity indescribable to Maria. She learnt each name, and, with the reiteration that no one could endure save Phoebe and faithful Lieschen, rehearsed the individual alphabetical acquirements of every one; she painted pictures for them, hemmed pinafores, and was happier than she had ever been in her life, as well as less fretful and more manageable, and she even began to develop more sense and intelligence in this direction than she had seemed capable of under the dreary round of lessons past her comprehension.|$|E
6000|$|BY the {{following}} Monday {{it was known}} at many looms that something sat heavily on the Auld Licht minister's mind. On the previous day he had preached his second sermon of warning to susceptible young men, and his first mention of the word [...] "woman" [...] had blown even the sleepy heads upright. Now he had salt fish for breakfast, and on clearing the table Jean noticed that his knife and fork were uncrossed. He was observed walking into a <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush</b> by Susy Linn, who possessed the pioneer spring-bed of Thrums, and always knew when her man jumped into it by suddenly finding herself shot to the ceiling. Lunan, the tinsmith, and two women, who had the luck {{to be in the}} street at the time, saw him stopping at Dr. McQueen's door, as if about to knock, and then turning smartly away. His hat blew off in the school wynd, where a wind wanders ever, looking for hats, and he chased it so passionately that Lang Tammas went into Allardyce's smiddy to say-- ...|$|E

50|$|Ivan Ivanovich Chimsha-Gimalayski, a {{veterinary}} surgeon, {{tells the}} story of his younger brother Nikolai Ivanovich. An official at the Exchequer Court, the latter became obsessed with the idea of returning back to the country where he and his brother had spent their happy childhood. The symbol of this fantasies for some reason, became a <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bush.</b> Finally his dream came true. He bought himself a farm and became a landowner. Ivan Ivanovich tells how he visited Nikolai, and how depressing it was for him to see this apparently happy man, now fat and flabby, living in what he imagined to be his earthly paradise, referring to himself as 'we, noblemen' and experiencing sheer delight which brings tears to his eyes, when his cook, as fat and pig-like as he is, delivers him a plateful of gooseberries. All this makes Ivan Ivanovich think about the nature of human happiness, which for him is very much the result of any happy man's unawareness of how much grief and pain is there behind the walls of the narrow world he'd built for himself.|$|E

60|$|There {{was no one}} so fully {{convinced}} of this as Walter himself, and one day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt. He took with him his drum, which had holes in one end since {{the time he had}} climbed up on it to reach a cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little broken, because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a whole unfriendly army of <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bushes.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{were playing}} hide-and-seek with bicycle lamps after tea. Dan had hung his lamp on the apple tree {{at the end}} of the {{hellebore}} bed in the walled garden, and was crouched by the <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bushes</b> ready to dash off when Una should spy him. He saw her lamp come into the garden and disappear as she hid it under her cloak. While he listened for her footsteps, somebody (they both thought it was Phillips the gardener) coughed in the corner of the herb-beds.|$|R

Davy and his young woman was standing in the arbor looking very sheepish, especially Davy, for she had told him what it was that had scared him. As we was going through the house, Jone taking my tricycle, I stopped to say good-by to the girl.|$|R
40|$|Satire on {{the presidential}} {{campaign}} of 1836, portraying the contest as a boxing match between Democratic candidate Martin Van Buren and Whig candidate William Henry Harrison. The artist clearly favors Harrison. The work is a variation on an 1834 cartoon which uses the boxing match {{as a metaphor for}} the struggle between Andrew Jackson and Nicholas Biddle, president of the Bank of the United States. (See "Set To Between Old Hickory and Bully Nick," no. 1834 - 4). In a ring Van Buren and Harrison spar as their seconds and a crowd of observers stand by. On the left, Van Buren is seconded by Andrew Jackson and "bottle holder" Amos Kendall. On the right, Harrison's second is a "Western lad" (a frontiersman in buckskins) and his bottle holder "Old Seventy-six" (a lame Revolutionary war veteran). The text below the scene identifies Harrison's backers as "the People" and Van Buren's as "Office holders & mail Contractors. " Kendall (drinking from the bottle) : "I begin to tremble for Matty [...] There appears to be a Surplus Fund in this Bottle, so I'll een take a pull to raise my spirits... " Jackson: "By the Eternal! what a severe counter hit! It's bunged up Matty's peeper, and if he don't keep his other eye open he'ill get a Cross buttock. He begins to be a little queerish already. D [...] n his Dutch courage! Amos where's the Bottle? after this Round put some more into him. " Van Buren: "Stand by me Old Hickory or I'm a gone Chicken!" Harrison: "Look out for your bread-basket Matty, I'll remove the deposits for you. " Jackson's words recall his controversial 1834 order to withdraw federal funds or "deposits" from the Bank of the United States.

60|$|On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still {{unable to}} follow his {{ordinary}} employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore. She got downstairs before me, {{and out into the}} garden, where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bushes,</b> and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century much brickearth-type land in west Middlesex, {{including}} in Heathrow, {{was used for}} orchards of fruit trees, often several sorts mixed in one orchard. Much [...] was grown, often in the orchards under the fruit trees. Sometimes vegetables, or flowers for cutting, were grown under the fruit trees. An author in 1907 reported [...] "thousands and thousands" [...] of plum, cherry, apple, pear, and damson trees, and innumerable currant and <b>gooseberry</b> <b>bushes,</b> round Harmondsworth and Sipson and Harlington and Heathrow. After World War I the amount of fruit growing in the area decreased due to competition from imports and demand for more market-gardening land, and by 1939 less than 10% of the orchard area was left.|$|R

He named it Martha's Vineyard after his daughter. Another island nearby, Cuttyhunk Island, he named Elizabeth Island, in honor of Elizabeth I of England, from which the Elizabeth Islands take their name. He intended to place a trading post there, but {{when the time came}} for the return voyage, the colonists decided not to remain. Gosnold ventured a second time to the New World in 1608 as Captain John Smith's second in command of the Jamestown expedition. After three months there he died of malaria.|$|R
