At his request he was transferred to St. Ladislas' Church, Cleveland, and was succeeded on September 16, 1894, by Father Sigmund Wozny, who had just then come to the diocese. During 1895 Wozny had the church property enclosed by a fence, and replaced the chairs with pews, besides making other necessary improvements. Like his immediate predecessor, he found an unruly element to deal with, which, with the comparatively large parish debt, about $17,000, discouraged him, and hence he asked to be relieved from his unpleasant pastoral charge. His wish was granted, and he left the diocese in February, 1896 and was at once succeeded by Father Francis X. Fremel, who set courageously to work to put men and things to rights. He too met with opposition at the start, but with prudence and firmness he soon succeeded in surmounting the difficulties that beset him. Under his direction, seconded by the generosity of the people, the interior of the church was ornamented quite neatly, and all the requisites for divine service procured. At the same time he did not lose sight of the <b>funded</b> <b>debt,</b> but strained every nerve to have it reduced.|$|E
25|$|This was the fiscally sound, {{but still}} burdened, Reading Railroad whose {{presidency}} Gowen assumed in 1869. Instead of gleaning insight from the railroad's successful struggle to bring its overhead under control, {{he turned the}} enterprise in the following decade into a mysteriously accounted borrowing machine. In 1874, a former Gowen friend turned enemy by Gowen's organization of the anthracite industry, accused Gowen in print of dishonest and misleading financial representations in the Reading's annual report and its prospectuses. Though Gowen was able to easily slough off such accusation at that time, it was renewed more powerfully in 1876 by Charles E. Smith—Gowen's direct predecessor as president, who had recommended the young man for the position in his absence. Even following Gowen's election to the post in his own right, Smith had remained on the corporation's Board of Managers. After hearing from Gowen of a US$7 million floating debt {{that had never been}} discussed in any board meetings, Smith inspected the unpublished books of the subsidiary Coal & Iron Co., which issued no annual report of its own. He found that the parent corporation's floating debt was being transferred to the subsidiary before the parent's fiscal year end in November, to avoid appearing in year-end statements; only to be shifted back to the parent prior to the subsidiary's own fiscal year end in December, thus effectively masking the joint enterprise's precarious condition overall. Smith raised the issue to the Reading's principal source of funds, the McCalmont Brothers investment banking firm in London, seeking Gowen's ouster, but was rebuffed. Though Gowen remained as president, and Smith resigned from the board, the incident forced Gowen's 1876 annual report to approximate frankness. It indicated the corporation's <b>funded</b> <b>debt</b> as US$65 million, resulting in US$5.5 million annually in carrying charges, compared to just over US$3 million in earnings for the railroad and a US$600,000 loss for the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Gowen did {{not well}} discern the special {{nature of the}} Reading, as {{compared}} to other railroads of the time, {{in terms of its}} underlying capitalization. As noted above, the road was [...] "constructed without financial stint"; specifically, it was laid out at a cost per mile that far exceeded that of other lines in the coal region, or even of such trunk lines as the B&O and Erie. Carrying costs for this capitalization was the issue that first drove the Reading into the arms of English lenders and investors. Somewhat a relief {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, then, was the period 1861–1867, when the railroad managed to cut its <b>funded</b> <b>debt</b> roughly in half—from $11,819,400 to $5,902,300.|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} {{sector has}} become a highly competitive marketplace and universities in the UK have {{to raise money to}} fund research, buildings and services to increase their competitive edge. However, due to the budget reduction in higher education sector, universities have to seek other sources of funding. Among all the possible <b>funding</b> sources, <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> is widely used in higher education sector. There are many researches that analyze the financial management in higher education institutions, but did not analyze <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in depth. Therefore, the aim of this research is to find the current situation and problems of <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in universities in the UK and put forward some suggestions about <b>debt</b> <b>funding.</b> The researcher interviewed a financial director and collected secondary data to analyze current <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in universities in the UK. Universities in the UK have similar income sources and they rely heavily on tuition fees. The researcher also finds that external borrowing in higher education sector has an increasing trend {{during the past few years}} and universities’ external borrowing’s proportion of total income are different. Some universities use no <b>debt</b> <b>funding,</b> while others raise a huge amount of debt for working capital. Although <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> has many advantages, financial directors have to notice its problems. The uncertainty of long term debt to universities makes banks unwilling to borrow to universities. The difficulty of external borrowings and high costs also require universities to find other sources of funding. The researcher presents some possible method for universities to raise money. The researcher recommended that universities could use <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in the short run, but should generate surplus and reserves to reduce vulnerability to risks and become financially self-sufficient. The high reliance on tuition fees as income might have a negative impact on cash flow when some political issues reduce the number of enrolled students. In terms of debt management, universities can cooperate with debt management companies to create a plan about how to manage debt. The researcher reviewed and summarized the current financial condition about <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in higher education sector in the UK. Financial directors of universities can compare their use of <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> with peers and measure the financial performance using the conclusions from this research. The recommendations might be helpful financial directors when making decisions. Key words: <b>debt</b> <b>funding,</b> external borrowings, United Kingdom universitie...|$|R
