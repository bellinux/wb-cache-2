5|$|In May 2015, in {{recognition}} of the sociopolitical progress made in Somalia and its return to effective governance, US Secretary of State John Kerry announced a preliminary plan to reestablish the US embassy in Mogadishu. He indicated that although there was no set timetable for the premises' relaunch, the US government had immediately begun upgrading its diplomatic representation in the country. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke also presented to Kerry the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound. Mohamud concurrently signed an Establishment Agreement with the EU Head of Delegation in Somalia Michele Cervone d’Urso, which facilitates the opening of more embassies in Mogadishu by European Union member states. The EU also announced that it had opened a new <b>EU</b> <b>Delegation</b> office in the city.|$|E

40|$|Five {{years after}} the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon {{and at the end}} of the first mandate of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission (HR/VP), this {{analysis}} provides an in-depth view of the on-going institutional socialisation between Member State Embassies and <b>EU</b> <b>Delegations.</b> Specifically, it focuses on the Member States’ perceptions of the role of <b>EU</b> <b>Delegations.</b> These perceptions can back up or restrain the <b>EU</b> <b>Delegations</b> in fulfilling their mandate. More precisely, the paper examines to what extent the socialisation between <b>EU</b> <b>Delegations</b> and <b>EU</b> Member State Embassies helps the Delegations to fulfil their mandate in bilateral diplomacy. It argues that <b>EU</b> <b>Delegations</b> are still under dynamic processes of institutional socialisation with the Member States’ Embassies which increasingly accept and expect EU Delegations’ actions. The post-Lisbon context of EU Diplomacy is consolidating a primus inter pares role of Delegations being central hubs coordinating and implementing EU policies on the spot...|$|R

The issue of the geographical and gender balance within this category has started to be addressed, as stipulated in the documents setting up the European External Action Service and in the political commitments of the High Representative. This trend should continue because, despite the overall positive evolution, imbalances still exist. The nationals of some member states are overrepresented among the HoDos, while those from other member states are not represented at all, or are underrepresented. At the same time women still account for less than 20 % of all heads of <b>EU</b> <b>delegations...</b>|$|R

25|$|Assad's {{government}} {{tried to}} decrease population growth, but this was only marginally successful. One sign of economic stagnation was Syria's lack of progress in talks with the EU on an agreement. The main cause of this failure was the country's difficulty in meeting EU demands to open the economy and introduce reforms. Marc Pierini, head of the <b>EU</b> <b>delegation</b> in Damascus, {{said that if the}} Syrian economy was not modernised it would not benefit from closer ties to the EU. Assad's government gave civil servants a 20-percent pay raise on the anniversary of the corrective movement that brought him to power. Although the foreign press criticised Syria's reluctance to liberalize its economy, Assad's government refused to modernize the bank system, permit private banks and open a stock exchange.|$|E

Steinmeier visited Uzbekistan again from 6–9 April to further assess the effects of the economic sanctions and how to proceed. Uzbek Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov stressed the need to respect Uzbekistan's sovereignty when an <b>EU</b> <b>delegation</b> met with officials from Central Asian governments in Astana, Kazakhstan on 27–28 March.

40|$|EU {{institutions}} and member states have made several commitments {{in recent years}} to improve division of labour and complementarity, and proceed to joint programming of development cooperation. On the basis of country studies in Burkina Faso and Ghana, this report analyses the progress in implementing these commitments in practice. Transfer of management responsibility to <b>EU</b> <b>delegations</b> in the 2000 s and the legal changes of the Lisbon Treaty have paved the way to strengthening the role of <b>EU</b> <b>delegations</b> in coordination at country level. The EU has become a major forum for coordination for all member states, reflected, for instance, in the intense dialogue presently taking place around the process of joint programming of development cooperation in Ghana. Implementation of the commitments, though, is not a straightforward process from goals to results. In practice, division of labour processes concern multiple actors, have political ramifications and impinge upon longstanding traditions of individual donor agencies. The linking of stronger internal coordination in the EU with wider donor coordination processes is also a central issue. [...] ...|$|R
