Within a few years, the new industrial center that became Lowell was using canals feeding off of a widened and deepened Pawtucket Canal as a <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> for their textile mills. The first of these canals was the Merrimack Canal, which powered the Merrimack Manufacturing Company. The repurposing of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals allowed the Associates to sell water power to other companies, starting with the Hamilton Canal, leading to the explosive growth of the town, and then shortly thereafter, city, of Lowell.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} {{abundant}} mechanical energy generated on human bodies in people's everyday life, {{we can make}} use of the triboelectric nanogenerator to convert this amount of mechanical energy into electricity, for charging portable electronics and biomedical applications. This will help to greatly improve the convenience of people's life and expand the application of the personal electronics. A packaged power-generating insole with built-in flexible multi-layered triboelectric nanogenerators has been demonstrated, which enable harvesting mechanical pressure during normal walking. The TENG used here relies on the contact-separation mode and is effective in responding to the periodic compression of the insole. Using the insole as a <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> <b>source,</b> we develop a fully packaged self-lighting shoe that has broad applications for display and entertainment purposes. A TENG can be attached to the inner layer of a shirt for harvesting energy from body motion. Under the generally walking, the maximum output of voltage and current density are up to 17 V and 0.02 μA/cm2, respectively. The TENG with a single layer size of 2 cm×7 cm×0.08 cm sticking on the clothes was demonstrated as a sustainable power source that not only can directly light up 30 light-emitting diodes (LEDs), but also can charge a lithium ion battery by persistently clapping clothes.|$|E
50|$|When {{current is}} applied, by the <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> <b>source,</b> to the electrodes, {{migration}}s occur beneath the soil surface. Although {{there are many}} types of migrations that occur {{in tandem with the}} current there are two driving migrations within electrokinetics; ionic migration and electrophoresis. When the electrolytic solution is injected within the soil part of the ionic solution forms a diffuse double layer with soils and contaminants. This diffused double layer will aid in the ionic drift that will occur as the current passes though the soil and surrounding liquid, this process is called electroosmosis. The thickness of the diffused double layer is a function of ionic composition of bulk solution and the average charge density of hydration products. As the electrolyte concentration increases the diffuse double layer thickness decreases.Electrophoresis is the mass flux of charged particles under an electric field. Both processes work at the same time but in a counter current manner. The charged particles driven by electrophoresis flow from the cathode to the anode while electrolytic solution flows from the anode to the cathode. Of the two main processes electrophoresis (or electromigration) is more dominant than electroosmosis. Electrophoresis servies as the driving factor that induces the flow of electroosmosis in the opposite direction. Electromigration also serves as the major component for ionic contaminant removal. For electromigration to occur absorbed material must be dissolved to an ionic form whether they are metals, organic or inorganic particles. Electroosmotic flow between the electrodes promotes the development of a low-pH environment in the soil. This low pH environment inhibits metallic contaminants from being sorbed onto soil particle surfaces which aids in the formation of compounds making electrokinetics possible. By this thought it is possible to acidify the soil and induce the release of absorbed heavy metals.|$|E

Therefore, the possibility of simplifying reactor design by both eliminating potentiostatic control of the cathode and removing the membrane separating the anode and cathode was investigated with biofilms of Sporomusa ovata, which reduces carbon dioxide to acetate. In traditional ‘H-cell’ reactors, where the anode and cathode chambers were separated with a proton-selective membrane, the rates and columbic efficiencies of microbial electrosynthesis remained high when electron delivery at the cathode was <b>powered</b> with a <b>direct</b> current <b>power</b> <b>source</b> rather than with a poteniostat-poised cathode utilized in previous studies. A membrane-less reactor with a direct-current <b>power</b> <b>source</b> with the cathode and anode positioned to avoid oxygen exposure at the cathode, retained high rates of acetate production as well as high columbic and energetic efficiencies.

Here we demonstrate a novel and simple generator with extremely low cost for efficiently harvesting mechanical energy that is typically present {{in the form of}} vibrations and random displacements/deformation. Owing to the coupling of contact charging and electrostatic induction, electric generation was achieved with a cycled process of contact and separation between two polymer films.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aiming at {{harvesting}} ambient {{mechanical energy}} for self-powered systems, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been recently {{developed as a}} highly efficient, cost-effective and robust approach to generate electricity from mechanical movements and vibrations {{on the basis of}} the coupling between triboelectrification and electrostatic in-duction. However, all of the previously demonstrated TENGs are based on vertical separation of triboelectric-charged planes, which requires sophisticated device structures to ensure enough resilience for the charge separation, otherwise there is no output current. In this paper, we demonstrated a newly designed TENG based on an in-plane charge separation process using the relative sliding between two contacting surfaces. Using Polyamide 6, 6 (Nylon) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films with surface etched nanowires, the two polymers at the opposite ends of the triboelectric series, the newly invented TENG produces an open-circuit voltage up to ∼ 1300 V and a short-circuit current density of 4. 1 mA/m 2 with a peak power density of 5. 3 W/m 2, which can be used as a <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> for instantaneously driving hundreds of serially connected light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The working principle and the relationships between electrical outputs and the sliding motion are fully elaborated and systematically studied, providing a new mode of TENGs with diverse applications. Compared to the existing vertical-touching based TENGs, this planar-sliding TENG has a high efficiency, easy fabrication, and suitability for many types of mechanical triggering. Furthermore, with the relationship between the electrical output and the sliding motion being calibrated, the sliding-based TENG could potentially be used as a self-powered displacement/speed/acceleration sensor...|$|E

Using arc or flame spray equipment is certainly not a new process, but because of ongoing pro-motion, there is an increased interest for its use in various applications. These long-life thermal spray deposits are used for corrosion protection of steel in rural, in-dustrial, marine, and immersion services. Aluminum, zinc, and 85 / 15 (zinc/ aluminum) alloys provide both barrier and cathodic protection when applied in non-through porosity thickness — Figs. 1, 2. When cut through exposing the substrate steel, or when applied in a through poros-ity thickness, these thermal spray deposits will retard corrosion through cathodic protection. They will also corrode in pref-erence to the steel, continuing to protect the structure as long as it remains.
