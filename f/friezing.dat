To its east is a wall memorial as an oval white marble plaque set on a grey marble field, set within a fluted pilaster frame with flower-head devices at the top corners. The plaque is supported below by a fluted shelf held by floriate-carved corbels, with apron between. Above the pilasters is a shelf on which sits a carved marble relief chalice with decorative <b>friezing.</b> This memorial is to Thomas Green, who died 1793, and his wife, Susannah, who died 1801, aged 5 years [...] Further to the east is a grey marble oval plaque supported by a single scrolled corbel, to Colby Graves (died 1799, aged 17), and his mother Grace Graves (died 1824, aged 75). The most eastern south aisle tablet is a white marble memorial on a black marble ground with urn above, to Samuel Newzam (died 1826); his wife, Ann (died 1799); his and Ann's sons, John (died 1788), and Henry (died 1802).|$|E
50|$|In July 1781, George Washington and his generals {{surveyed}} the forts of northern Manhattan from nearby {{points in the}} Bronx, apparently in preparation to reclaim their captured forts. By that time the fort showed signs of neglect, as reflected in Washington’s observation that “the fort on Cox’s Hill was in bad repair and but little dependence placed on it. There is neither ditch nor <b>friezing,</b> and the northeast corner appears quite easy of access.” This attack never materialized, and the fort was held by the British until the war ended in 1783.|$|E

40|$|A <b>frieze</b> in {{the modern}} sense is a map from the set of objects of a {{triangulated}} category C to some ring. A <b>frieze</b> X is characterised by the property that if τ x→ y→ x is an Auslander-Reiten triangle in C, then X(τ x) X(x) -X(y) = 1. The canonical example of a <b>frieze</b> is the (original) Caldero-Chapoton map, which send objects of cluster categories to elements of cluster algebras. In <b>friezes</b> 1 and <b>friezes</b> 2, the notion of generalised <b>friezes</b> is introduced. A generalised <b>frieze</b> X' has the more general property that X'(τ x) X'(x) -X'(y) ∈{ 0, 1 }. The canonical example of a generalised <b>frieze</b> is the modified Caldero-Chapoton map, also introduced in <b>friezes</b> 1 and <b>friezes</b> 2. Here, we develop {{and add to the}} results in <b>friezes</b> 2. We define Condition F for two maps α and β in the modified Calero-Chapoton map, and in the case when C is 2 -Calabi-Yau, we show that it is sufficient to replace a more technical "frieze-like" condition from <b>friezes</b> 2. We also prove a multiplication formula for the modified Caldero-Chapoton map, which significantly simplifies its computation in practice. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Sykes {{was born}} near Bradford in Yorkshire. His father was Samuel Sykes of <b>Friezing</b> Hall, and {{they belonged to}} the family of Sykeses of Yorkshire. He joined {{military}} service as a cadet in 1803 and obtained a commission on 1 May 1804 with the Honourable East India Company. Joining the Bombay Army, he was to lieutenancy on 12 October 1805. He saw action at the siege of Bhurtpur under Lord Lake in 1805. He commanded a regiment at the battles of Kirkee and Poonah and was involved in the capture of hill forts. By 1810 he could speak Hindi and Marathi languages. He became a captain on 25 January 1819 and travelled for four years across Europe from 1820. He returned to India in October 1824 and was appointed by Monstuart Elphinstone as a statistical reporter to the Bombay government. He then collected statistical and natural history researches, and completed a census {{of the population of the}} Deccan, producing two voluminous statistical reports, and a complete natural history report illustrated with drawings. He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Hay of Renistoun, in 1824. He was promoted to the rank of major on 8 September 1826 and to lieutenant-colonel on 9 April 1831. In December 1829 the post of statistical reporter was abolished, but he took leave from military duty and continued to work on his statistical surveys. He completed this in January 1831 and left for Europe on furlough. He retired from active service with the rank of colonel on 18 June 1833, and in September 1835 he became a Royal Commissioner in Lunacy, a post he held till 1845. On account of his knowledge of Indian matters, he was made a director of the East India Company in 1840. In 1867 he was elected chairman of the court of directors of the East India Company.|$|E

25|$|The capitals {{support the}} entablature. In the Doric order, the entablature always {{consists}} of two parts, the architrave and the Doric <b>frieze</b> (or triglyph <b>frieze).</b> The Ionic order of Athens and the Cyclades also used a <b>frieze</b> above an architrave, whereas the <b>frieze</b> remained unknown in the Ionic architecture of Asia Minor until the 4th century BC. There, the architrave was directly followed by the dentil. The <b>frieze</b> was originally {{placed in front of}} the roof beams, which were externally visible only in the earlier temples of Asia Minor. The Doric <b>frieze</b> was structured by triglyphs. These were placed above the axis of each column, and above the centre of each intercolumniation. The spaces between the triglyphs contained metopes, sometimes painted or decorated with relief sculpture. In the Ionic or Corinthian orders, the <b>frieze</b> possesses no triglyphs and is simply left flat, sometimes decorated with paintings or reliefs. With the introduction of stone architecture, the protection of the porticos and the support of the roof construction was moved upwards {{to the level of the}} geison, depriving the <b>frieze</b> of its structural function and turning it into an entirely decorative feature. Frequently, the cella is also decorated with architrave and <b>frieze,</b> especially at the front of the pronaos.|$|R

50|$|In interiors, the <b>frieze</b> {{of a room}} is {{the section}} of wall above the picture rail and under the crown moldings or cornice.

40|$|We {{examine the}} growth {{behaviour}} of the entries occurring in n-periodic tame <b>friezes</b> of real numbers. Extending T, we prove that generalised recursive relations exist between all entries of such <b>friezes.</b> These recursions are parametrised by {{a sequence of}} so-called growth coefficients, which are shown to satisfy itself a recursive relation. Thus, all growth coefficients are determined by a principle growth coefficients, which can be read off directly from the <b>frieze.</b> We place special emphasis on periodic tame <b>friezes</b> of positive integers, specifying the values the growth coefficients take for any such <b>frieze.</b> We establish that the growth coefficients of the pair of <b>friezes</b> arising from a triangulation of an annulus coincide. The entries of both are shown to grow asymptotically exponentially, while triangulations of a punctured disc are seen to provide the only <b>friezes</b> of linear growth.

40|$|The {{infinite}} <b>friezes</b> {{of positive}} integers were introduced by Tschabold as {{a variation of}} the classical Conway-Coxeter <b>frieze</b> patterns. These infinite <b>friezes</b> were further shown be to realizable via triangulations of the infinite strip by Baur, Parsons and Tschabold. In this paper, we show that the construction of Baur, Parsons and Tschabold can be slightly adapted in order to obtain a bijection between the infinite <b>friezes</b> and the so-called admissible triangulations of the infinite strip with no special marked points on the upper boundary. As a consequence, we obtain that the infinite <b>friezes</b> with enough ones are in bijection with the admissible triangulations of the infinity-gon. Comment: 23 page...|$|R
