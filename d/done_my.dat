25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always <b>done</b> <b>my</b> best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

[...] He was the last surviving member of the 228 Japanese-Canadian veterans of World WarI when he died on 22 April 1987.|$|E
500|$|The sixth {{movement}} is an alto recitative. The lengthy text begins [...] "" [...] (How might then I, O Lord, sufficiently repay thee {{for all that}} thou hast <b>done,</b> <b>my</b> flesh and soul to feed?). It is a further supplication to God, giving thanks for His gifts, recognizing the duty to help the needy and praying to be rewarded in the hereafter. Like the first recitative, it is declamatory without arioso sections; but in this case, instead of a bare bass line, it is accompanied by sustained chords in the string section, marked piano, which help create the prayer-like mood.|$|E

500|$|On Election Day, Humphrey was {{defeated}} by Nixon 301 to 191 in the electoral college. Wallace received 46, all in the deep south. The popular vote was much closer as Nixon edged Humphrey 43.42% to 42.72%, with a margin of approximately 500,000 votes. Humphrey carried {{his home state of}} Minnesota and Texas, the home state of President Johnson (as well as Maine, running-mate Ed Muskie's home state). He also won most of the Northeast and Michigan, but lost the west to Nixon and the south to Wallace. Humphrey conceded the race to Nixon, and stated that he would support him as president. On his way out he remarked: [...] "I've <b>done</b> <b>my</b> best." ...|$|E
500|$|During Singh's 17-year {{career on}} the bench, 105 of his {{judgments}} {{were reported in}} the law reports. Particularly noted for his criminal judgments, {{he was known as}} [...] "the Hanging Judge" [...] for handing down a large number of capital sentences. He was the first judge in Singapore to impose the death penalty on a woman, Mimi Wong, a cabaret singer who murdered her Japanese lover's wife in 1970. In a 1996 interview with The Straits Times, he said: [...] "I'm satisfied that I've made no mistake and that I've <b>done</b> <b>my</b> duty according to the law." [...] All the five judgments he wrote {{as a member of the}} Court of Criminal Appeal were upheld by the Privy Council, then Singapore's highest appellate court.|$|E
500|$|The Speaker {{ordered that}} Bellingham be {{transferred}} to the Serjeant-at-Arms's quarters, where MPs [...] who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing [...] under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: [...] "I have been ill-treated... I have sought redress in vain. I am [...] a most unfortunate man and feel here"—placing hand on heart—"sufficient justification for what I have done." [...] He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the [...] authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been told to do his worst: [...] "I have obeyed them. [...] I have <b>done</b> <b>my</b> worst, and I rejoice in the deed." [...] At around eight o'clock, Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial.|$|E

500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had <b>done</b> <b>my</b> country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{has said}} of his {{creative}} intentions with the follow-up, [...] "I’ve never shut my ears to anything, really. It’s not like I’m always looking for things, either, but I can’t close my ears to any music. Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, {{trying to understand what}} makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've <b>done</b> <b>my</b> whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would be afraid to take. Stone Rollin means I'm going all the way out there this time".|$|E
500|$|As onlookers gazed in horror, and as McKinley lurched {{forward a}} step, Czolgosz {{prepared}} to take a third shot. [...] He was prevented from doing so when James Parker, an American of part-African part-Spanish descent from Georgia who had been behind Czolgosz in line, slammed into the assassin, reaching for the gun. [...] A split second after Parker struck Czolgosz, so did Buffalo detective John Geary {{and one of the}} artillerymen, Francis O'Brien. [...] Czolgosz disappeared beneath a pile of men, some of whom were punching or hitting him with rifle butts. [...] He was heard to say, [...] "I <b>done</b> <b>my</b> duty." [...] McKinley staggered backwards and to the right, but was prevented from falling by Cortelyou, Milburn, and Detective Geary; they guided him across some fallen bunting to a chair. [...] The President tried to convince Cortelyou he was not seriously injured, but blood was visible as he tried to expose his injury. [...] Seeing the pummeling being taken by Czolgosz, McKinley ordered it stopped. [...] Czolgosz was dragged away, but not before being searched by Agent Foster. [...] When Czolgosz kept turning his head to watch the President while being searched, Foster struck him to the ground with one punch.|$|E

500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood {{for a minute or two}} before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have <b>done</b> <b>my</b> duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|William IV had a {{short but}} eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the {{ascendancy}} of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated {{a reduction in the}} political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence with the people. During the reign of George III, the King could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the people to vote in favour of the new administration. Such {{was the result of a}} dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the Fox-North Coalition, and in 1807, after the dismissal of Lord Grenville. But when William IV dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Sir Robert Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the people, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, [...] "I have my view of things, and I tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have <b>done</b> <b>my</b> duty." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've <b>done</b> <b>my</b> fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones: Indiana's father, a {{professor}} of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery {{in mind when he}} suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as [...] "a crazy, eccentric" [...] professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is [...] "strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, [...] "Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond movies." [...] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. [...] "I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [...] Burton," [...] Connery commented. [...] "I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father." [...] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that [...] "whatever Indy'd <b>done</b> <b>my</b> character has done and my character has done it better". Connery signed to the film on March25, 1988. He improvised the line, [...] "She talks in her sleep", which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.|$|E
