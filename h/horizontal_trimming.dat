25|$|The free-swimming diver {{may need}} to trim erect or {{inverted}} at times, but in general, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimises disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (the centroid). Small errors can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible.|$|R

5000|$|... iFLY15 is a 15-foot {{hydrofoil}} catamaran {{equipped with}} automatic foils, built by CEC Catamarans GmbH. It uses a mechanical automatic system {{to stabilize the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Jibes are facilitated by the four T-shaped foils which are always {{in the water and}} stabilize the boat.|$|R
25|$|Underwater trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. The free-swimming diver may need to trim erect or inverted at times, but in general, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A slightly head down <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimizes disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (the centroid). Small errors can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible. The position of the centre of buoyancy is largely beyond the control of the diver, though the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of ballast weights. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position.|$|R

The walls of the passenger area are decorated in beaded panelling and <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim.</b> Some of the railway's communications equipment remains in the attic, and freight scales remain in that area.|$|R
25|$|The third prototype, piloted by Kudrin, lost <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> tab in flight; {{the pilot}} managed {{to land the}} plane but refused to fly on SPB (D) prototypes anymore. On 29 July 1940 the project was cancelled; tests {{required}} for proper crash examination were not completed. The government preferred to build twin-engined dive bombers on a simplified Petlyakov VI-100 platform, – the conversion, named Petlyakov Pe-2, took over the roles originally intended for the SPB (D).|$|R
50|$|Pachyosteosclerosis is a {{combination}} of thickening (pachyostosis) and densification (osteosclerosis) of bones. It makes bones more heavy, but also more fragile. The condition often occurs in aquatic vertebrates, especially those living in shallow waters, creating ballast as an adaptation for maintaining neutral buoyancy and <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim.</b> It is in no way pathological. To resist roll, it frequently is found especially in ventral bones, whereas concentration near the lungs helps in maintaining trim.Examples of animals showing pachyosteosclerosis are seacows (dugongs and manatees), the extinct Plesiosauria and Mesosauria and extinct aquatic sloths.|$|R
50|$|Trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. Accurately controlled trim reduces swimming effort, as it reduces the sectional area of the diver passing through the water. A slight head down trim is recommended to reduce downthrust during finning, and this reduces silting and fin impact with the bottom. Buoyancy compensators and weighting systems that make <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> difficult are deprecated for this reason. Systems are recommended that concentrate weight centrally and restrict weighting to what is actually needed to compensate for equipment buoyancy and use of gas during the dive.|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} new dipole corrector magnet has been thoroughly studied. The planned Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) beam line will require correctors capable of greater range and linearity than existing correctors, so a new design is proposed based on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> dipole correctors built for the Main Injector synchrotron at Fermilab. The gap, pole shape, length, and number of conductor turns remain the same. To allow operation over {{a wider range of}} excitations without overheating, the conductor size is increased, and to maintain better linearity, the back leg thickness is increased. The magnetic simulation was done using ANSYS to optimize the shape {{and the size of the}} yoke. The thermal performance was also modeled and analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Diving {{weighting}} systems {{increase the}} average {{density of the}} scuba diver and equipment {{to compensate for the}} buoyancy of diving equipment, particularly the diving suit, allowing the diver to fully submerge with ease by obtaining neutral or slightly negative buoyancy. Weighting systems originally consisted of solid lead blocks attached to a belt around the diver's waist, but some diving weighting systems are incorporated into the BCD or harness. These systems may use small nylon bags of lead shot or small weights which are distributed around the BCD, allowing a diver to gain a better overall weight distribution leading to a more <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> in the water. Tank weights can be attached to the cylinder or threaded on the cambands holding the cylinder into the BCD.|$|R
25|$|An {{investigation}} by the USAF determined that the crash was likely caused by an improper stabilizer trim setting. The investigation was unable to determine conclusively what had caused the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer <b>trim</b> to be set improperly, but theorized that the most likely cause was an aircraft system malfunction.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{longitudinal}} and lateral-directional aerodynamic {{characteristics were}} obtained for a generic transatmospheric vehicle concept having a replaceable minimum drag forebody shape. The alternate forebody tested was a 1 / 4 -power series body. Tests were made over a range of Mach numbers from 2 to 10 at a nominal Reynolds number, based on a length of 2. 3 x 10 to the 8 th and angles of attack from - 4 to 20 deg. The minimum drag forebody provided significant improvements in minimum drag and L/D for the configuration {{as well as a}} longitudinally stabilizing increment. Although the baseline configuration is longitudinally unstable, the L/D improvements at low to moderate angles of attack would enhance cruise performance. Varying wing incidence angles was demonstrated as an effective <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> device without significant trim drag penalties...|$|R
50|$|In 1953 Buick's middle priced line {{shared the}} Roadmaster's new V8 and, {{for this year}} the Roadmaster shared the Super and Special's 121.5 in wheelbase. The Super earned a <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> bar on its rear fenders which {{distinguished}} it from the Series 70 Roadmasters. Otherwise its side trim bar on its rear fenders was identical although the Super was had only three VentiPorts on each front fender. Series identification {{was found on the}} deck emblem. Full wheelcovers were now standard. The vee in the bombsight ornament signified the V8 power under the hood. Interiors in most models were nylon and silky broadcloth. The convertible had power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. Dynaflow was now standard equipment. Air conditioning was a new option. A total of 190,514 Supers were sold.|$|R
50|$|The use of bungees for upper {{cylinder}} attachment and trim is a quintessential identifier of sidemount configuration. The bungee {{is attached to}} the rear upper harness/BCD and routes under the diver's armpits to the front shoulder webbing. Appropriate length and thickness bungees are critical to ensure that the sidemount cylinders remain in trim horizontally along the diver's side torso with the valves under the armpits. The cylinder/s should neither rise above, or drop below, the diver when they are in flat, <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim</b> position. The cylinder is secured by wrapping, or routing, the bungees around the cylinder valve handle, stem and/or cylinder neck. In addition to providing the desired cylinder positioning and trim, the bungees also provide the capacity to secure the cylinder top end to the diver while the cylinders are detached at the bottom and maneuvered into a forward position.|$|R
5000|$|Frog kick {{involves}} the simultaneous and laterally mirrored motion of both legs together, approximately {{parallel to the}} frontal plane. The description assumes that the diver is <b>trimmed</b> <b>horizontal</b> and intents to swim horizontally.|$|R
2500|$|Most suits have {{relatively}} baggy trouser legs to allow {{passage of the}} feet to the boots. This can hold a large volume of air when inverted, which may pull the boots off the feet. Elastic or tailored [...] "gaiters" [...] can be pulled snug around the lower legs to reduce the potential airspace to help prevent an inversion event and help maintain <b>horizontal</b> <b>trim.</b> Gaiters may also reduce hydrodynamic drag when finning, {{reduce the risk of}} the feet pulling out of the boots when inverted, and can be used effectively on membrane and neoprene suits. Ankle straps perform a similar function. Small ankle-weights (typically one or two pounds) can also be used with any dry suit, both to provide trim weight {{at the bottom of the}} suit, and function as short gaiters to constrict the ankle region of suit once the foot is in the boot. Ankle-weights have to be accelerated and decelerated along with the fins during every kick, which requires more energy from the diver. Gaiters do not have this drawback as they are typically very light and approximately neutral buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|The 1950 {{model year}} saw the VJ-3 Jeepster's first styling revisions, which {{included}} a new instrument panel and redesigned front end featuring a V-shaped grille with <b>horizontal</b> chrome <b>trim.</b> The car had very little standard equipment. Willys' L161 Lightning six-cylinder was offered {{in addition to the}} standard Kill Devil four-cylinder. Model designations were dependent on production timeframe, with early 1950s four-cylinder Jeepsters given VJ-3 463 and six-cylinders VJ-3 663, changed to VJ-473 and VJ-673, respectively, for later year vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board determined that inadequate maintenance led to excessive wear and eventual failure of a critical flight control system during flight. The probable cause was stated to be [...] "a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer <b>trim</b> system jackscrew assembly's acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly".|$|R
40|$|A {{deployable}} wing airplane for {{the exploration}} of the Martian surface is described and the deploying maneuver in the Martian atmosphere is analyzed. The system could be used to prepare the landing of a human crew on the Martian surface, collecting data on the Martian surface and giving accurate and updated information on the landing site to the astronauts. The crew orbiting the planet releases a balloon containing the aircraft in a stowed wing configuration. The aircraft reaches a stationary velocity in nose-dive trajectory. At a proper altitude from the land the aircraft lifting surfaces deploy, a pull-up maneuver starts, and an <b>horizontal</b> <b>trimmed</b> flight is reached. The parameters which determine the trajectory, such as for example, the initial height, velocity, wing configuration, are selected. A parametric optimization process is here used to evaluate the above mentioned parameters in order to satisfy the final conditions of trimmed-likeflight. Depending on the airplane geometric configuration, a trajectory satisfying the desired requirements can be found. A sensitivity analysis of the final conditions with respect to errors in the optimal parameters is performed, showing that the trajectory is robust and feasible...|$|R
50|$|The {{high pitch}} {{attitude}} {{and loss of}} speed put the airplane in a stall situation. About fourteen seconds after the noise and the “gear up” callout, the stick shaker began to operate intermittently, then continuously, {{until the end of}} the recording. The “don’t sink” aural warning told the crew that the airplane was dropping. The pitch attitude was apparently maintained until impact with the ground, as examination of the site showed. On the wreckage, the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer <b>trim</b> was found in the position for a normal takeoff, which tends to support this hypothesis.|$|R

50|$|During {{the course}} of the investigation, and later in its final report, the NTSB issued 24 safety recommendations, {{covering}} maintenance, regulatory oversight, and aircraft design issues. More than half of these were directly related to jackscrew lubrication and end play measurement. Also included was a recommendation that pilots were to be instructed that {{in the event of a}} flight control system malfunction they should not attempt corrective procedures beyond those specified in the checklist procedures, and in particular in the event of a <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer <b>trim</b> control system malfunction the primary and alternate trim motors should not be activated, and if unable to correct the problem through the checklists they should land at the nearest suitable airport.|$|R

25|$|Among 787 flight systems, a key {{change from}} {{traditional}} airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g., engine starters or brakes. Boeing says this system extracts 35 percent less {{power from the}} engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel economy. The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners; the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer <b>trim,</b> and wheel brakes. Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air. An active gust alleviation system, similar to the system used on the B-2 bomber, improves ride quality during turbulence.|$|R
