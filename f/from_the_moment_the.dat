5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> egg is hatched, {{the male}} {{macaroni}} penguin cares {{for the newly}} hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E

Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (see image above).|$|E

In 1958, the law governing conversions changed to today's version, which allows the kicker to place the ball and prohibits the defence from advancing toward the kicker until he begins his run-up.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding them closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is {{the same as it was}} last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41.

However, while camping near Nicea, the {{remnants}} of the German army, including a dazed and sick King Conrad, staggered past the French camp, bringing news of their disaster. The French, with what remained of the Germans, then began to march in increasingly disorganized fashion towards Antioch. They were in high spirits on Christmas Eve, when they chose to camp in a lush valley near Ephesus. Here they were ambushed by a Turkish detachment, but the French proceeded to slaughter this detachment and appropriate their camp.|$|E

500|$|In early December 2013, Beyoncé and her {{management}} company Parkwood Entertainment held meetings concerning its release with executives from Columbia Records and the iTunes Store, using the code name [...] "Lily" [...] for the album.

On December 9, 2013, Rob Stringer, Chairman of Columbia Records, knowingly told media that the album would be released at some point in 2014 and it would be [...] "monumental". On December 13, 2013, the album was released {{in the early hours of}} the morning without any prior announcement or promotion exclusively on the iTunes Store.

500|$|The {{notion of}} faith and deep belief is a large party of the novel, and {{is related to the}} book's other theme of identity. Throughout the story there is a tension between a faith in the Nameless Ones and their power, and human curiosity and the {{tendency}} to question. The importance of tradition and belief in Kargish culture is emphasized when Tenar is taken from her family, and chosen to be the high priestess of the Tombs. However, Tenar's mother unsuccessfully tries to dupe the priestesses into believing the child has a skin disease. Commentators state that this episode suggests certain universal impulses can lead to resistance against [...] "cultural imperatives"; Tenar's mother is willing to bend the rules to keep her child. Unlike the rest of Earthsea, which relies on the [...] "Old Speech" [...] for its magic and rituals, the Kargish lands use their own tongue, and rituals are conducted with meaningless babble; thus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> chanting of the priestesses is described, Le Guin suggests that the Kargish faith is one of meaningless words and ritual. The Kargish deities are revered as the [...] "Nameless Ones"; thus Ged's statement to Arha that all things have names also works to undermine her faith.|$|E
