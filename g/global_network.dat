40|$|The role of <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> is {{increasingly}} important in influencing state’s decision on grand project. Tactics and strategies are employed across borders {{to build up}} cases and arguments to influence state’s decision. Global actors such as the non-governmental organizations particularly environmentalist groups adopt strategies that bypass their state and search out for international allies to bring pressure on their state from outside. Sahabat Alam Sekitar (SAM) and other international allies {{who are members of}} World Commission on Dam (WCD) rally campaigns for the severe environmental and social structure effect on the Bakun dam project. <b>Global</b> <b>networks</b> presented their findings on eight large dams that have put pressure on the Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and the Malaysian government to reconsider the big-dam project. Here the discussions on tactics and strategies by <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> are vital because a similar analysis can be applied in examining the impact of <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> on state’s decision. However, actions from <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> have to be consistent and continuous to convince state actors. Local networks have to find ways to redefine issues concerning environments and people who are affected as a way to maintain endorsement from international networks. If supports are not consistent and continuous, the impact of collective efforts from <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> is rather subtle or perhaps forgettable...|$|R

5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its <b>global</b> <b>network</b> apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of weather ships {{proved to be}} so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had established a <b>global</b> <b>network</b> of 13weather ships by 1948, with seven operated by the United States, one operated jointly by the United States and Canada, two supplied by the United Kingdom, one maintained by France, one a joint venture by the Netherlands and Belgium, and one shared by the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden. The United Kingdom used Royal Navy corvettes to operate their two stations, and staffed crews of 53 Met Office personnel. The ships were out at sea for 27days, and in port for 15days. Their first ship was deployed on July 31, 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{stationary}} weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo-France to help support shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, {{which led to the}} loss of several ships and many lives. On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a <b>global</b> <b>network</b> of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the United States, and Europe. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985.|$|E
