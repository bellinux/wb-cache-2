2500|$|Gripen Gas {{announced}} in April 2012 the drilling results from their Ekeby Permit, onshore Sweden. Four shallow vertical wells tested the prospectivity of biogenic {{gas from the}} organic rich Cambro-Ordovician Alum Shale over an area covering about 150km². [...] The prospective Alum Shale was encountered at depths of 75–85 metres in the wells and all wells had gas shows whilst drilling. One well cored the Alum Shale section. All wells were <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> tested. Gripen Gas confirmed in October 2012 that Bergsstaten (Swedish Mines Inspectorate) had awarded the Sandön exploration licence covering 162km² {{in the western part}} of lake Vättern, in Östergötland County. The exploration licence is for biogenic gas exploration in the organic rich Alum shale formation. This new award plus the existing licences make Gripen Gas AB the principal gas explorer in Sweden at 583km².|$|E
2500|$|Drilling of Leduc No. 1 began November 20, 1946. Several <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> tests down to {{depths of}} [...] showed only traces {{of oil and}} natural gas. [...] As {{drilling}} passed into Mesozoic depths, tests indicated large quantities of natural gas and some oil. It was a small find, {{and close to the}} limits of the Paleozoic Era, where conventional wisdom of the time held that oil was unlikely to be found. [...] Imperial was left to choose whether to begin production of this small find, or drill deeper and risk having the byproducts of drilling ruin the company's ability to complete a well at the depth of this find. [...] Imperial chose to continue drilling. [...] When drilling reached , into the Devonian Era, tests showed promising results. [...] On February 3, 1947, a test sent a geyser shooting out of the drilling hole and up half the height of the drilling derrick, covering a worker with oil.|$|E

50|$|The USDC {{is driven}} by a Piezoelectric stack {{actuator}} that creates the vibrations. The actuator vibrates at an extremely high frequency, making it ultrasonic, and it is these waves of vibration that are transmitted by the horn of the actuator {{all the way to}} the bit itself. The vibrations are created at the actuator and are transferred by the horn to a free mass. The free mass vibrates between the <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> and the horn of the actuator to transmit the vibrations down the <b>drill</b> <b>stem.</b> The <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> houses the drill bit, and the vibrations push the bit into the material. The repetitive impact on the <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> by the free mass, creates stress pulses that transmit to the tip of the bit and into the rock. Ultimately, the repetitive strike of the bit produces enough strain on the surface to fracture it.|$|E

40|$|Ailanthus altissima is a {{well-known}} invasive tree {{in many parts of}} the world showing an outstanding ability to establish within woodlands and other less-disturbed habitats. Previous studies have reported that control of this species is very difficult because of its strong resprouting. Indeed, effective control can be achieved only by mechanical treatment followed by the application of a systemic herbicide. Operating drills or saws and other mechanical equipment require electric power supply which is not readily available in many invaded sites, notably shrubslands and woodlands. In two study sites, we evaluated control obtained by glyphosate through a stem-injection technique and compared two sources of power for the electric drill used. More than 90 % of the glyphosate-treated trees in this study appeared to be dead just 1 month after treatments, and a car battery plus inverter was the most practical electrical source for <b>drilling</b> <b>stems</b> in the field...|$|R

Analyses of samples from the Apollo 15 and 16 <b>drill</b> <b>stems</b> together with authors' previously published results (1974, 1976), and the Battelle Na- 22 and Al- 26 data, indicate that in three of the four cases studied the regolith was measurably disturbed within the last 10 m. y. Activities measured in the uppermost 2 g/sq cm indicate frequent mixing within this depth range. The Monte Carlo gardening model of Arnold (1975) was used to derive profiles for the gardened moon-wide average of Mn- 53 and Al- 26 {{as a function of}} depth.

40|$|Proper use {{of firing}} pattern vis-à-vis the blast {{requirements}} can provide optimal blast performance {{in terms of}} fragmentation, throw, wall control etc. This is largely attributed {{to the importance of}} firing burden in any blast round. By changing the firing patterns the firing burden, and, thereby the ratio of spacing to burden is also subject to change. Proper initiation timing is as important for fragmentation as the burden, spacing, sub <b>drilling,</b> <b>stemming</b> etc. Simultaneous initiation leads to the problems, such as, coarser fragmentation, blasting {{of a large number of}} holes at a given time which leads to the other problems. The present research study which was conducted in three limestone quarries where major problems such as of improper fragmentation, poor wall control, and poor heave characteristics of the muckpile were observed.

40|$|Drill {{cuttings}} {{are generally}} used in open pits and quarries {{as the most}} common stemming material, since these are most readily available at blast sites. The plaster stemming method {{has been found to}} be better than the <b>drill</b> cuttings <b>stemming</b> method, due to increased confinement inside the hole and better utilization of blast explosive energy in the rock. The main advantage of the new stemming method is the reduction in the cost of blasting. At a limestone quarry, blasting costs per unit volume of rock were reduced by 7 %. This is obtained by increasing burden and spacing distances. In addition, better fragmentation was obtained by using the plaster stemming method. Blast trials showed that plaster stemming produced finer material than the conventional methods. In the same blast tests, + 20 cm size fragments reduced to 42. 6 % of the total, compared to 48. 7 % in the conventional method of <b>drill</b> cuttings <b>stemming...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>stem</b> must be {{designed}} to transfer drilling torque for combined lengths that often exceed several miles down into the Earth's crust, and also {{must be able to}} resist pressure differentials between inside and outside (or vice versa), and have sufficient strength to suspend the total weight of deeper components. For deep wells this requires tempered steel tubes that are expensive, and owners spend considerable efforts to reuse them after finishing a well. A used <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> is inspected on site, or off location. Ultrasonic testing and modified instruments similar to the spherometer are used at inspection sites to identify defects from metal fatigue, in order to preclude fracture of the <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> during future wellboring.

40|$|Abstract. Downhole motor is an {{instrument}} to drill oil wells, different from rotary drilling in working methods. While downhole motor works, the <b>drilling</b> <b>stem</b> of which remains still supplies power to bits directly so that a much higher transmission efficiency of power can be achieved. Downhole motor has been a key developing downhole tool recently. It is installed in a limited space with a certain diameter, asking for a higher power, so the design of which is rather difficult. This paper mainly studies the key components of downhole motor in structure design and its working characteristics. And parametric design employed in series design to shorten design cycle is {{presented in this paper}}. After taken Solidworks as a basic software platform and turbodrill turbine section with diameter of 245 mm as an original model, parametric design of key components in downhole motor has been achieved by setting the parameters of key components, adding relations, editing program, creating a new part etc. Parametric design methods presented in this paper has already been applied in series design of downhole motor at Yangtze University...|$|R
40|$|Development and {{utilization}} of deep geothermal resources, especially a {{hot dry rock}} (HDR) geothermal resource, is beneficial for both economic and environmental consideration in oilfields. This study used data from multiple sources to assess the geothermal energy resource in the Daqing Oilfield. The temperature logs in boreholes (both shallow water wells and deep boreholes) and the <b>drilling</b> <b>stem</b> test temperature were used to create isothermal maps in depths. Upon the temperature field and thermophysical parameters of strata, the heat content was calculated by 1 km × 1 km × 0. 1 km cells.

The heat content within 3 – 5 km is 24. 28 × 1021 J, wherein 68. 2 % exceeded 150 °C. If the recovery factor was given by 2 % and the lower limit of temperature was set to be 150 °C, the most conservative estimate for recoverable HDR geothermal resource was 0. 33 × 1021 J. The uncertainties of the estimation are mainly contributed to by the temperature extrapolation and the physical parameter selections...|$|R

40|$|Blasting is {{a crucial}} part in mining operation. Proper {{blasting}} practice not only reduces the adverse effects like peak particle velocity but also improve the production and productivity. The blasting in open pit mine is controlled by number of parameters like spacing, burden, quantity of explosive etc. The production and productivity are measured by power factor, throw, and drop. Numerous models {{have been developed to}} calculate the powder factor, drop, and throw using spacing, burden, hole depth and explosive charges etc. as input variables, which means that for known input variables, powder factor, throw, and drop can be calculated. However, field mining engineers are more interested about what should be the suitable values of input parameters to get a specific factor, throw, and drop. In most cases this has been done on a trial and error basis to fix the values of input parameters. A technique was developed to predict a nearly optimum set of blast design parameters from the nine variable design parameters (drill penetration rate, bench height, burden, spacing, hole depth, sub-grade <b>drilling,</b> <b>stemming,</b> blast round, and length to width ratio) that largely affect the shape (throw and drop) and the PF values of blasted muck piles. A stepwise forward multivariate regression algorithm was applied to generate optimum forward equation for powder factor, drop, and throw parameters. A linear inverse theory was applied to develop linear equations for independent variables. The developed method was applied in a limestone case study mine and results revealed that the this approach could be a good methods for selection of blasting parameters to get desire outputs...|$|R

50|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>stem</b> {{testing is}} an {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} procedure to isolate, stimulate and flow a downhole formation to determine the fluids present and the rate at which they can be produced. The main objective of a DST is to evaluate the commercial viability of a zones economic potential by identifying productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent of an oil or gas reservoir. These tests can be performed in both open and cased hole environments and provide exploration teams with valuable information {{about the nature of the}} reservoir. <b>Drill</b> <b>stem</b> testing involves deploying a series of tools known as a test bottomhole assembly (BHA). A basic <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> test BHA consist of a packer or packers, which act as an expanding plug to be used to isolate sections of the well for the testing process, valves that may be opened or closed from the surface during the test, and recorders used to document pressure during the test. In addition to packers a downhole valve is used to open and close the formation to measure reservoir characteristics such as pressure and temperature which are charted on downhole recorders within the BHA. Below are two types of BHA DST, Cased Hole which can be applied after the well has been cased, and Open Hole which may be performed before casing.|$|E

40|$|The {{stilbene}} biosynthetic pathway yielding products pinosylvin and pinosylvin monomethyl ether {{has been}} implicated in Scots pine’s (Pinus sylvestris) heartwood constitutive resistance to decay. This trait, which is very valuable in forest economies has been suggested to be genetically controlled. The molecular basis for this control is not known. Wounding by <b>drilling</b> in <b>stems</b> of Scots pine seedlings have been suggested to induce production of pinosylvin and pinosylvin monomethyl ether in xylem of these seedlings which transforms to heartwood on maturity. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the transcripts co-expressed with candidate genes in the stilbene biosynthesis pathway (Ps 4 CL, PsPAL, PsSTS and PsPMT) and their expression patterns, reconstruct a comprehensive transcriptome and decipher the difference between half sib families in the expression of transcripts reacting to the wounding of Scots pine seedlings using the next generation sequence (ABI SOLiD) profiling of RNA (RNA-Seq). Our bioinformatic pipeline involving de novo transcriptome assembly and scaffolding, read mapping and Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis were utilized to analyze this RNA-Seq data and its results were validated with quantitative PCR. The results show that RNA-Seq analysis generated 25, 010 non redundant consensus sequences (representing expressed transcripts) and DGE revealed that the Scots pine seedling transcriptome was altered with up-regulation of 830 EST tags (genes) and down-regulation of 518 EST tags. PsSTS was induced in the wounding experiment while Ps 4 CL, PsPAL and PsPMT appeared to be expressed constitutively. Of the total 77, 326 tags from the PGI EST list (our pseudo reference transcriptome), 29 % (mean) of reads from eight RNA-Seq libraries were mapped to 13, 000 EST tags. QPCR results confirmed the RNA-Seq data although the latter appeared more sensitive. Read counts from mapped RNA-Seq could be used to distinguish differentially expressed genes between half sib families comprising of high and low decay resistance lines. We conclude that wounding Scots pine seedlings induced a large number of genes including PsSTS. With ABI SOLiD RNA-Seq and DGE technologies, the complex transcriptome of wounded Scots pine seedlings can be reconstructed, constituent expressed transcripts elucidated and half sib family lines with divergent decay resistant trait can be distinguished...|$|R

Natural Resources Research Institute, 5013 Miller Trunk Highway, Duluth MN 55811 - 1442 Taconite {{aggregates}} (collectively termed Mesabi Hard Rock™) {{have been}} used as construction aggregate in Minnesota for nearly 50 years, dating back to {{the early days of the}} taconite industry. Coarse taconite tailings are a ready-made, free-draining, fine aggregate equivalent suitable for use as select granular and fine filter aggregates. Their angular interlocking form, when placed with water and covered with Class 5, produces sound embankment fill material. Their hardness, strength and durability produce superior wear and friction properties in bituminous mixes. This, coupled with 100 % fractured faces, makes them ideal for Superpave mixes. Their cleanness (very low - 200 mesh) makes them a valuable tool for adjusting volumetric properties in bituminous mix design. Crushed taconite rock brings the same hardness, strength and durability to the coarser aggregate size fractions, making it ideal for crushing to desired specifications for use as fill, filter material and the coarse aggregate component in bituminous and concrete mixes. Historically, taconite aggregate products {{have been used}} most when road construction, maintenance, and repair projects are in close proximity to the taconite operations, i. e., on the Mesabi Range. The 1970 s and 1980 s saw the use of coarse taconite tailings spread to the Twin Cities metropolitan area, as well as to the southern and western reaches of the state for use in bituminous overlays and surfacing. The 1990 s and 2000 s saw taconite aggregates become a staple of Duluth area bituminous contractors and road constructors, to the degree that they are used in some capacity in nearly every project. Millions of tons of taconite byproducts are produced every year in the mining and pellet production process. Couple this with nearly 50 years of production and the enormous size of this resource becomes obvious. While much of this material is consumed by the taconite mines for day to day operations (haul roads, tailings dams, shovel pads, <b>drill</b> hole <b>stemming,</b> etc.), much remains stockpiled and available for use. Infrastructure already in place for shipment of pellets (roads, railroads, and Lake Superior docks and ship-loading facilities) can be accessed for shipment of aggregates throughout the United States and beyond. This report is a historical narrative of the highlights of taconite aggregate usage as road construction aggregates in Minnesota. It documents how taconite byproducts have evolved from stockpiled "wastes" to become premium "in-demand" aggregates suitable for meeting today's infrastructure needs.
