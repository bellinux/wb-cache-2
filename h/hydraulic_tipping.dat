5000|$|... 1948 - {{introduced}} the first <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tipping</b> trailer in Europe ...|$|E
2500|$|Options {{included}} a winch, <b>hydraulic</b> crane, <b>tipping</b> body, tankers and specialist-vehicles for refuelling operations. The optional [...] crane has {{a capacity of}} 6.5 t/m while the winch (produced by Reynolds Boughton) has a capacity of 5,500kg front and rear and is provided with 75 m of cable.|$|R
5000|$|Grapple trucks {{enable the}} {{collection}} of bulk waste. A large percentage of items in the solid waste stream are too large or too heavy to be safely lifted by hand into traditional garbage trucks. These items (furniture, large appliances, branches, logs) are called bulky waste or [...] "oversized." [...] The preferred method for collecting these items is with a grapple truck. Grapple trucks have <b>hydraulic</b> knucklebooms, <b>tipped</b> with a clamshell bucket, and usually include a dump body or trailer.|$|R
40|$|Citriculture {{normally}} uses high application volumes in pesticide solutions (of 2. 000 to 5. 000 L ha(- 1)) {{to control}} pests and diseases {{that affect the}} crop, which generates an increase in operational costs. For this reason, diverse systems of application are being developed to reduce application volumes and improve the uniformity of pesticide deposition. The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of two application systems of pesticides in citrus trees. One system used a prototype for terrestrial application with rotary disc atomizers that are widely used in agricultural aviation, and the other system used hollow cone tip hydraulics. For {{the treatment of the}} trees the insecticide Metidation was used at the dose of 180 gr per hectare. To study the droplet spectrum, water-sensitive papers were installed at different positions in the trees canopy, and for the study of insecticide deposition leaves of the treated plants were collected. The water-sensitive papers were collected and analyzed using a computerized image analysis system (e-Sprinkle, EMBRAPA, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the leaves analyzed by the technique of gas chromatography. Pesticide deposition was similar in both application system, although the solution volume used by the application system equipped with rotary disc atomizers was one quarter of the volume used by the application system equipped with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tips,</b> reducing considerably the cost of the phytosanitary treatments...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{developed}} a new semianalytical model for multiple-fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) with stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in tight oil reservoirs by combining source function theory with boundary element idea. The model is first validated by both analytical and numerical model. Then new type curves are established. Finally, the effects of SRV shape, SRV size, SRV permeability, and parameters of hydraulic fractures are discussed. Results show that SRV has great influence on the pressure response of MFHWs; the parameters of fractures, such as fracture distribution, length, and conductivity, also can affect the transient pressure of MFHWs. One novelty of this model is to consider the nonlinear flow around <b>hydraulic</b> fracture <b>tips.</b> The other novelty {{is the ability to}} model the shape of the SRV, production behavior of different fractures, and interfaces. Compared to numerical and analytic methods, this model can not only reduce extensive computing processing but also show high accuracy...|$|R
