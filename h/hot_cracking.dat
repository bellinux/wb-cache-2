50|$|The {{weldability}} {{of aluminium}} alloys varies significantly, depending on the chemical composition of the alloy used. Aluminium alloys are susceptible to <b>hot</b> <b>cracking,</b> and to combat the problem, welders increase the welding speed to lower the heat input. Preheating reduces the temperature gradient across the weld zone and thus helps reduce <b>hot</b> <b>cracking,</b> but it can reduce the mechanical properties of the base material {{and should not be}} used when the base material is restrained. The design of the joint can be changed as well, and a more compatible filler alloy can be selected to decrease the likelihood of <b>hot</b> <b>cracking.</b> Aluminium alloys should also be cleaned prior to welding, with the goal of removing all oxides, oils, and loose particles from the surface to be welded. This is especially important because of an aluminium weld's susceptibility to porosity due to hydrogen and dross due to oxygen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>cracking,</b> {{also known}} as {{solidification}} cracking, can occur with all metals, and happens in the fusion zone of a weld. To diminish the probability {{of this type of}} cracking, excess material restraint should be avoided, and a proper filler material should be utilized. Other causes include too high welding current, poor joint design that does not diffuse heat, impurities (such as sulfur and phosphorus), preheating, speed is too fast, and long arcs.|$|E

50|$|Longitudinal cracks {{run along}} the length of a weld bead. There are three types: check cracks, root cracks, and full {{centerline}} cracks. Check cracks are visible from the surface and extend partially into the weld.

40|$|P 91 is a {{new kind}} of {{heat-resistant}} and high-tensile steel. It can be extruded after ingot casting and can be widely used for different pipes in power plants. However, due to its mushy freezing characteristics, a lack of feeding in the ingot center often generates many defects, such as porosity and crack. A six-ton P 91 ingot was cast and sliced, and a representative part of the longitudinal section was inspected in more detail. The morphology of crack-like defects was examined by X-ray high energy industrial CT and reconstructed by 3 D software. There are five main portions of defects larger than 200 mm 3, four of which are interconnected. These initiated from continuous liquid film, and then were torn apart by excessive tensile stress within the brittle temperature range (BTR). The 3 D FEM analysis of thermo-mechanical simulation was carried out to analyze the formation of porosity and internal crack defects. The results of shrinkage porosity and Niyama values revealed that the center of the ingot suffers from inadequate feeding. Several criteria based on thermal and mechanical models were used to evaluate the susceptibility of <b>hot</b> <b>crack</b> formation. The Clyne and Davies’ criterion and Katgerman’s criterion successfully predicted the high <b>hot</b> <b>crack</b> susceptibility in the ingot center. Six typical locations in the longitudinal section had been chosen for analysis of the stresses and strains evolution during the BTR.

In conclusion, <b>hot</b> <b>crack</b> develops only when stress and strain exceed a threshold value at the same time during the BTR...|$|R
