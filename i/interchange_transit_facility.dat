40|$|Urban rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> play a {{critical}} role in citizen’s social activities (e. g., residence, work and education). Using panel data on housing prices and urban rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> for 35 Chinese cities for 2002 to 2013, this study constructs a panel data model to evaluate the effect of rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> on housing prices quantitatively. A correlation test reveals significant correlations between housing prices and rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities.</b> Empirical results demonstrate that rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> can markedly elevate real estate prices. Quantitatively, a 1 % increase in rail transit mileage improves housing prices by 0. 0233 %. The results highlight the importance of other factors (e. g., per capita GDP, land price, investment in real estate and population density) in determining housing prices. We also assess the effects of expectations of new rail transit lines on housing prices, and the results show that expectation effects are insignificant. These findings encourage Chinese policy makers to take rail <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> into account in achieving sustainable development of real estate markets...|$|R

40|$|Mass transit {{can play}} a {{critical}} role in making communities more livable. To be effective public transit must be a positive element in a community. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) encourages design excellence, including the use of public art in public <b>transit</b> <b>facilities.</b> While public art may be a viable strategy to creating pleasant and interesting places, public opinions and attitudes towards public art [...] as a design element [...] are relatively unknown. This research documents the effectiveness of public art in public transit improvement projects. Surveys addressing transit agencies nationwide and three transit-supportive areas in metropolitan Tucson were evaluated. Four public <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> projects in Tucson are documented for future research on the effects of public art in public <b>transit</b> <b>facilities.</b> The project resulted in significantly different approaches by transit agencies nationwide, as well as a range of opinions on the functional and aesthetic attributes of public <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> designs...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{design and}} {{construction}} costs in a consistent, reliable, and accurate way is critical for an organization since the information generated is the basis for: projecting program funds, prioritizing projects by financial analysis, determining required funds, and providing a baseline for project control. This thesis focused on cost estimating methods, database, and prototype tool development for {{design and construction}} of rural and small urban <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> that are usually small, numerous, and geographically dispersed. To address these issues, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) funded a research team to provide guidance to state transit agencies in assisting their sub-recipients with preparing accurate design and construction cost estimates. This thesis was written according to {{the scope of the}} funded research project. The main objectives of this study were to determine the distinct characteristics of rural and small urban <b>transit</b> <b>facilities</b> and to develop a cost database and a prototype tool to assist agencies with preparing conceptual estimates. Conducting a literature review and telephone interviews with experts in the <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> industry improved the understanding of the estimating practices used in the rural and small urban <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> industry. Unique characteristics and risk factors of those facilities were identified. A cost estimating database was constructed based on the historical cost data collected through online surveys. A cost estimating prototype tool was developed based on the findings obtained from the literature review, telephone interviews, and analysis of the cost estimating database. Review of the prototype tool was then performed to ensure the tool?s self-explanation, functionality, and user-friendliness. This thesis contributes to the <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> industry by developing the first national database and prototype tool to support conceptual estimating for rural and small urban <b>transit</b> <b>facilities.</b> A research limitation of this research and recommendations for future research were explicitly described {{at the end of this}} thesis...|$|R
