25|$|Shanghai was {{the birthplace}} of Chinese cinema and theater. China's first short film, The Difficult Couple (1913), and the country's first fictional feature film, An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather (孤儿救祖记, Gu'er Jiu Zuji, 1923) were both {{produced}} in Shanghai. These two films were very influential, and established Shanghai {{as the center of}} Chinese film-making. Shanghai's film industry went on to blossom during the early 1930s, generating great stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors {{as a result of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry. Many aspects of Shanghainese popular culture ("Shanghainese Pops") were transferred to Hong Kong by the numerous Shanghainese emigrants and refugees after the Communist Revolution. The movie <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mood</b> <b>for</b> Love, which was directed by Wong Kar-wai (a native Shanghainese himself), depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.|$|E
25|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front cash deposit from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4.|$|E

40|$|Getting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> {{athletic}} {{competition is}} seen by many athletes and coaches as {{an important part of}} the process of mental preparation, and the success or failure to do so is often presented by athletes as an attribution to explain performance outcomes. This workshop will address the what, why and how of mood assessment and <b>mood</b> regulation <b>for</b> athletes, especially those preparing for international competition. The assessment of pre-competition mood, referred to as mood profiling, has a long history <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of sport psychology. Mood profiling can assist processes such as acclimatisation, determining optimal training load, tapering, monitoring injured athletes, problem identification and also act as a catalyst <b>for</b> discussion. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> regulation process involves assessment and interpretation of mood responses, followed by prescription of evidence-based interventions that, ideally, have been pre-learnt and practised. In particular, this workshop will explain how to administer, score, and interpret <b>the</b> Brunel <b>Mood</b> Scale (BRUMS: Terry, Lane, Lane, & Keohane, 1999; Terry, Lane, & Fogarty, 2003), a 24 -item measure that assesses six dimensions of mood – anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, tension, vigour – that have been shown to be predictive of sport performance (Beedie, Terry, & Lane, 2000). The workshop will include examples of mood regulation strategies that have been shown to be effective among athletes (Terry, Dinsdale, Karageorghis, & Lane, 2006), many of which are very easy to implement. Workshop participants will be provided with a BRUMS User Guide...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare <b>the</b> identification of <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> music by children (aged from 3 [...] 14 years) and adults. Previous research on adult subjects suggested that key and tempo were critical in conveying happy and sad moods: a major key and fast tempo conveyed happiness, a minor key and slow tempo sadness. In {{this research}} an attempt was made to compare the relative importance of key and tempo <b>in</b> establishing <b>the</b> musical <b>mood.</b> Eight pieces of music were selected for use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiments <b>in</b> four of these key and tempo were complementary, (i. e. two in a major key at a fast tempo, and two in a minor key at a slow tempo) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other four pieces of music, key and tempo were opposed. The 154 subjects under 12 years of age were tested individually and heard four pieces of music each. The 108 older children and adults were tested in groups and heard all eight pieces of music. Each subject was required to indicate whether each piece of music was happy or sad. The results of this research showed that the majority of subjects <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> age groups tested, from the three year olds to <b>the</b> adults, agreed <b>in</b> their identification of <b>the</b> <b>moods</b> of <b>the</b> music played to them. Music written in a major key at a fast tempo was judged to be happy, and music written in a minor key at a slow tempo was judged to be sad.

Growth factors were assessed by CBA/ELISA in adolescent bipolar offspring (n = 96, mean age = 16 years) and in age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 50). EGF belonged to a mutually correlating cluster of mainly neurotrophic compounds including S 100 B and BDNF, which were in general decreased in serum. IL- 7, SCF, IGF-BP 2 and sCD 25, belonged to a different mutually correlating cluster of immune growth factors, which were in general increased: IGF-BP 2 significantly in serum of offspring without a mood disorder, IL- 7 and SCF in serum of offspring who had experienced a mood episode. This pattern of de- and increases was not different between bipolar offspring that developed or did not develop a mood disorder over time, apart from the IGF-BP 2 level, which was near significantly higher in offspring later developing a mood disorder. Correlations with the previously published immune-cellular abnormalities were not found. In conclusion non-affected adolescents at familial mood disorder development risk were characterized by a distinct pattern of a series of compounds operating in a network of hematopoiesis, neurogenesis and inflammation.

500|$|Some of the images' impact belies their {{historical}} accuracy; nearly all ceremonies and public events that were filmed for newsreels {{in the early}} sound era were staged, {{and in some cases}} even reenacted. For instance: when FDR signed an important bill, a member of his cabinet was called away before the staged reenactment began, so the film shows him absent {{at the time of the}} signing, although he had been present. The newsreels of FDR were staged to hide his hobbled gait caused by polio.

500|$|Once the {{inevitable}} punishment {{of the rebels}} had occurred, the Persians were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>for</b> conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, {{it made no sense}} to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size. Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies. The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo. [...] Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.|$|E
