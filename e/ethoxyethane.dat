5000|$|In 1846 Louis-Nicolas Ménard and Florès Domonte {{discovered}} that cellulose nitrate could be dissolved in ether. [...] They devised {{a mixture of}} ether (<b>ethoxyethane)</b> as the solvent and ethanol as a diluent that rendered cellulose nitrate into a clear gelatinous liquid. Collodion was first used medically as a dressing in 1847 by the Boston physician John Parker Maynard. The solution was dubbed [...] "collodion" [...] (from the Greek κολλώδης (kollodis), gluey) by Dr. A.A. Gould of Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{hydrophilic}} polyurethane elastomers (PUEs) were synthesized from 1, 2 -bis(isocyanate) <b>ethoxyethane</b> (TEGDI), poly(ethylene oxide-co-propylene oxide) copolyol (EOPO) and 1, 4 -butane diol/ 1, 1, 1 -trimethylol propane (75 / 25) (wt/wt) by a prepolymer method. 4, 4 ′-Diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) -based PUEs were synthesized as {{a control}} as well. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed {{that the degree of}} microphase separation of the TEGDI-based PUEs was much weaker than for the MDI-based PUEs. Young's modulus and elongation at break of the TEGDI-based PUEs were quite lower and larger than for the MDI-based PUEs, respectively. This is due to quite weak cohesion force of the hard segment chains in the TEGDI-based PUEs. The degree of swelling of the TEGDI-based PUEs was five times larger than for the MDI-based one. This is associated with the hydrophilic nature of TEGDI and weak cohesion force in the TEGDI-based PUEs...|$|E
40|$|A novel diisocyanate, 1, 2 -bisisocyanate <b>ethoxyethane</b> (TEGDI) whose {{backbone}} is ether bonds, {{was used}} for the preparation of polyurethane elastomers (PUEs). Highly softened TEGDI-based PUEs were successfully prepared on account of flexibility of TEGDI itself and weaker phase separation. A relationship between conformation and molecular mobility of the soft segment were investigated using dynamic viscoelastic measurement. The peaks of α relaxation of the soft segment chains were clearly observed in the loss tangent (tan δ) curves at various strains. The onset temperature of α relaxation decreased with increasing strain. This result indicates that the size of cooperative motion of the glass transition decreased due to the orientation of the soft segment chains with increasing strain. The effect of the microaggregation structure on the rheological properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were investigated. The TPUs showed the strain hardening of uniaxial elongation viscosity with increasing annealing temperature owing to residual hard segment domains at an operating temperature. It was revealed that the formation of well-organized hard segment domains {{had a profound effect on}} the rheological properties of TPUs, in particular on their elongational viscosity...|$|E
