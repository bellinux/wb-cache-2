25|$|In {{species or}} {{population}} analysis, {{for example in}} conservation work, PCR primers which amplify microsatellites in one individual or species can work in other species. However, the risk of applying PCR primers across different species is that null alleles become likely, whenever sequence divergence is too great for the primers to bind. The species may then artificially {{appear to have a}} reduced diversity. Null alleles in this case can sometimes be indicated by an excessive frequency of homozygotes causing deviations from <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>equilibrium</b> expectations.|$|E
25|$|The Hardy–Weinberg {{principle}} {{states that}} a large population in <b>Hardy–Weinberg</b> <b>equilibrium</b> will have {{no change in the}} frequency of alleles as generations pass. It is impossible for a population of any considerable size to reach this equilibrium because of the five requirements that must be met. A population must be infinite in size. There must be a zero percent mutation rate between generations, because mutations can alter existing alleles or create new ones. There can be no immigration or emigration in the population, because individuals arriving and leaving directly change allelic frequencies. There can be no selective pressures of any kind on the population, meaning that no individual is more likely than any other to survive and reproduce. Finally, mating must be totally random, with all males (or females in some cases) being equally desirable mates. This ensures a true random mixing of alleles.|$|E
30|$|All {{statistical}} analyses {{carried out with}} Stata 10.1 continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or as median (interquartile range, IQR). Allele frequencies were estimated by the gene-counting method, and <b>Hardy-Weinberg's</b> <b>equilibrium</b> was tested by chi-square test. To obtain a more meaningful genotype group size, patients were pooled into three groups: (1) wild-type, LM, and QR heterozygotes (group 1, n = 7); (2) MM homozygotes (group 2, n = 5); and (3) RR homozygotes (group 3, n = 6). Variable differences between these three genotype subgroups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance. Relations between variables were assessed using non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation (ρ). We secondly performed multivariate regression analysis (β) and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to determine independent relationships to the PON 1 activity or MBF, including all variables with significant correlations on univariate analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.|$|R

Since the lineages are discriminated only by mitochondrial DNA, {{there is a possibility}} of gene flow among lineages at the genomic level. Nine polymorphic microsatellite loci were newly isolated from the taxon. Moderate to high levels of polymorphism were observed, with numbers of alleles ranging from 6 to 12 in 51 individuals. The mean observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0. 1373 to 0. 3725 and 0. 5381 to 0. 7748, respectively. Contrary to the expectation under <b>Hardy-Weinberg’s</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> six of the nine loci exhibited a reduction to homozygosities.

It was found that the various chromosome types do not fluctuate at random, as they would if selectively neutral, but adjust to certain frequencies at which they become stabilised. With D. persimilis he found that the caged population followed the values expected on the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>equilibrium</b> when conditions were optimal (which disproved any idea of non-random mating), but with a restricted food supply heterozygotes had a distinct advantage.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{view is that}} Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Reginald Punnett had by 1918 formed a {{synthesis}} of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and {{the probability that a}} new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900. The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that [...] "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected". Also in 1902, the statistician Udny Yule showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's confrontational approach, but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.|$|E

We decided to focus on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose genotype was already known. Our study was carried out in a selected, small population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hence resulting in deviations from <b>Hardy-Weinberg's</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Regardless, our results need to be confirmed in a larger prospective cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The absence of correlation between the MBF response to adenosine or CPT regarding the PON 1 genotype or PON 1 activity confirms the results of Malin et al.[7] and would be in agreement with the study of Acampa et al. [13]. This seems to indicate that PON 1 is not involved in the development of atherosclerosis by an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasomotion, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. Furthermore, PON 1 activity variations may be a part of a multifactorial mechanism leading to a decreased coronary vasoreactivity. The relative effect of PON 1 on coronary vasomotion as well as its relative value in predicting cardiac event-free survival remains to be determined.|$|R

The Haploview and SimHap software {{were used to assess}} data for <b>Hardy-Weinberg's</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and to obtain subject-level haplotypes. Multiple logistic regression was used to seek for associations in dominant, additive, and recessive models. Results. Mean plaque index (MPI) showed the strongest association with SCP (OR= 16). A significant LD was observed in the cases (D'= 0. 80 and r 2 = 0. 47). The genotype at each locus showed significant association with SCP in the recessive model (TT versus TC+CC) even after adjustment for MPI (OR= 6. 29 & 461, resp.). The C-T haplotype conferred protection against SCP in a dominant manner (OR= 0. 16). On the other hand, the T-T haplotype in double dose (recessive model) showed strong association with CP (OR= 15. 6). Conclusions. IL- 1 two-locus haplotype is associated with SCP in Yemenis.

This study evaluated the effect of genetic polymorphism of enzymes producing or responsible for reducing ROS on coronary artery calcification in type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Methods An index for coronary-arteriosclerosis, coronary artery calcium score (CACS) was evaluated in 91 T 2 D patients using a multi-slice computed tomography. Patients were genotyped for ROS-scavenging enzymes, Glutathione peroxidase- 1 (GPx- 1), Catalase, Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, as well as SNPs of NADPH oxidase as ROS-promoting elements, genes related to onset of T 2 D (CAPN 10, ADRB 3, PPAR gamma, FATP 4). Age, blood pressure, BMI, HbA 1 c, lipid and duration of diabetes were evaluated for a multivariate regression analysis. Results CACS with Pro/Leu genotype of the GPx- 1 gene {{was significantly higher than}} in those with Pro/Pro (744 ± 1, 291 vs. 245 ± 399, respectively, p = 0. 006). In addition, genotype frequency of Pro/Leu in those with CACS ≥ 1000 was significantly higher than in those with CACS OR = 3. 61, CI = 0. 97 – 13. 42; p = 0. 045) when tested for deviation from <b>Hardy-Weinberg's</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Multivariate regression analyses revealed that CACS significantly correlated with GPx- 1 genotypes and age. Conclusion The presence of Pro 197 Leu substitution of the GPx- 1 gene may {{play a crucial role in}} determining genetic susceptibility to coronary-arteriosclerosis in T 2 D. The mechanism may be associated with a decreased ability to scavenge ROS with the variant GPx- 1. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research were to study the genetic variation and allozyme band pattern of Pristipomoides multidens from several locations of Indonesian sea based on the pattern of allozyme. Samples of the fish were collected from three geographically different water areas of Bali, Sumbawa and Moluccas. Ten different enzymes, ADH, MDH, LDH, α-GPD, PGM, GPI, IDH, ME, EST and SP were used in this study. Polymorphic loci of genetic variation were {{in line with the}} <b>Hardy-Weinberg’s</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The genetic variation was calculated based on the proportion of polymorphic loci, frequency of allele, amount of allele per locus, and heterozygosity. The results of this research indicate that from the 10 different enzymes, 16 loci were detected, and 3 of them were polymorphic (PGM- 1, GPI- 1 and EST). Population of Moluccas has 2 polymorphic loci (PGM- 1 and GPI- 1) by proportion of 13 %, however, population from Bali and Sumbawa has only 1 polymorphic locus (EST- 1) with the value of 6 %. The allelic number per locus was 1. 06 – 1. 125, while the observed heterozygosity (D) of the populations was 0. 005. The fish population of Moluccas is having better genetic variation than that of population from Bali and Sumbawa. The genetic distance between populations was between 0. 002 – 0. 005.

Attempt has also been made {{to find out whether}} telomere length attrition is associated with hypertension and obese individuals. Methods Venous blood samples were collected from 37 normal, 35 obese and 47 hypertensive individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and PCR amplifications were achieved using locus specific primers. Genotyping of ApoB minisatellite was performed using 4 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by silver staining, whereas LPL and Leptin loci were genotyped using ALF Express™ DNA sequencer. Telomere length was determined using a recently developed real time based quantitative PCR, where the relative telomere length was determined by calculating the relative ratio of telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) PCR products which is expressed as T/S ratio. Results All the three loci are highly polymorphic, display high heterozygosity and conform to <b>Hardy-Weinberg's</b> <b>equilibrium</b> expectations. ApoB minisatellite displayed 14 alleles, whereas LPL and Leptin tetranucleotide loci were having 9 and 17 alleles, respectively. Interestingly two new alleles (9 and 11 repeats) were detected at ApoB locus for the first time. The alleles at Leptin locus were classified as Class I (lower alleles: 149 - 200 bp) and Class II alleles (higher alleles: > 217 bp). Higher alleles at ApoB (> 39 repeats), predominant allele 9 at LPL and alleles 164 bp and 224 bp at Leptin loci have shown allelic association with hypertensive individuals. After adjusting the influence of age and gender, the analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) revealed the relative telomere length (T/S ratio) in hypertensive individuals to be (1. 01 ± 0. 021), which was significantly different (P Conclusion The present study revealed that allelic association at ApoB, LPL, Leptin loci and loss of telomere length may have strong genetic association with hypertensive individuals.
