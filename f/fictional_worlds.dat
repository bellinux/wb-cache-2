5|$|Myst co-creators and {{brothers}} Rand and Robyn Miller often created <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and stories as young children. Their vision was refined by {{the works of}} fantasy and science fiction writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov; Star Wars offered them a glimpse at an exciting, fully realized fictional world. Younger brother Robyn began working on a children's novel called Dunnyhut; though he never completed the work, elements from the story influenced aspects of Mysts story.|$|E
5|$|Myst was {{originally}} conceptualized by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. The Millers had created <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and stories as young children, {{influenced by the}} works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. They formed a video game company together called Cyan, Inc.; their first game, called The Manhole, won the Software Publishers Association award in 1988 for best use of the digital medium. Cyan produced other games, aimed at children; the Millers eventually decided their next project would be made for adults.|$|E

500|$|A linked {{series of}} adventures is {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "campaign". The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire fictional universe, are referred to as [...] "campaign settings" [...] or [...] "world". D settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology. Popular commercially published campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons include Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Mystara, Spelljammer, Ravenloft, Dark Sun, Planescape, Birthright, and Eberron. Alternatively, DMs may develop their own <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> to use as campaign settings.|$|E

500|$|Roleplaying {{may be seen}} as part of a {{movement}} in Western culture towards participatory arts, as opposed to traditional spectator arts. Participants in a LARP cast off the role of passive observer and take on new roles that are often outside of their daily life and contrary to their culture. The arrangers of a LARP and the other participants act as co-creators of the game. This collaborative process of creating shared <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> may be associated with a broader burgeoning [...] "geek" [...] culture in developed societies that is in turn associated with prolonged education, high uptake of information technology and increased leisure time. In comparison to the mainstream video-game industry, which is highly commercialized and often marketed towards a male audience, LARP is less commoditized, and women actively contribute as authors and participants.|$|E
500|$|Dozens of Square Enix {{companion}} {{books have}} been produced since 1998, when video game developer Square began to produce books that focused on artwork, developer interviews, and background information on the <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> and characters in its games rather than on gameplay details. The first series of these books was the Perfect Works series, written and published by Square subsidiary DigiCube. They produced three books between 1998 and 1999 before the line was stopped {{in favor of the}} [...] series, a portmanteau of ultimate and mania. This series of books is written by Studio BentStuff, which had previously written game guides for Square for Final Fantasy VII. They were published by DigiCube until the company was dissolved in 2003. Square merged with video game publisher Enix on April 1, 2003 to form Square Enix, which resumed publication of the companion books.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Ingels {{released}} a video entitled [...] {{as part of}} the Future of StoryTelling summit, which introduced his concept of creating architecture that focuses on turning [...] "surreal dreams into inhabitable space". Citing the power of alternate reality programs and video games, like Minecraft, Ingels' 'worldcraft' is an extension of 'hedonistic sustainability' and further develops ideas established in his first book, Yes Is More. In the video (and essay by the same name in his second book, Hot to Cold: An Odyssey of Architectural Adaptation) Ingels notes: [...] "These <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> empower people with the tools to transform their own environments. This is what architecture ought to be..." [...] "Architecture must become Worldcraft, the craft of making our world, where our knowledge and technology doesn't limit us but rather enables us to turn surreal dreams into inhabitable space. To turn fiction into fact." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first issue}} of the revived Other Worlds, in May 1955, had a {{black-and-white}} cover picture; later issues returned to colour, though until 1956 these were all reprints of covers from the first incarnation of the magazine. [...] For {{the cover of the}} November 1955 issue (the first in pulp format) Palmer reprinted artwork by J. Allen St. John from the back cover of the November 1952 issue; St. John's artwork had saved another Palmer magazine, Fantastic Adventures, from cancellation in 1939. [...] The quality of the fiction dropped from the occasional highs of the first run of Other Worlds. [...] Falcons of Narabedla, the first novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley, appeared in 1957, and Palmer also bought her first Darkover novel, Sword of Aldones, though he never ran it and eventually returned the manuscript to Bradley. [...] Palmer hoped to publish Tarzan on Mars, a novel by Stuart Byrne that used <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but he was unable to get authorization from the Burroughs estate, and had to shelve the idea.|$|E
500|$|Ray Muzyka, {{co-founder of}} BioWare, {{said that the}} team wanted to try {{something}} that would be new but familiar to most players. They hoped that Origins would redefine the genre to become The Lord of the Rings of video game franchises. Greg Zeschuk, another co-founder of BioWare, described the fantasy of Dragon Age as in between the high fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien's works and the low fantasy of works by George R.R. Martin. The goal was a [...] "dark heroic fantasy" [...] that would suit the taste of any fan of the genre. Thus, while the game has the typical races of human, elf, and dwarf, they are slightly altered from the usual nature of the three races, and a new lizard-like race called the Qunari was introduced. Some of the alterations they made included flipping how certain races, like elves, are treated in other <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds.</b> While elves are often described as a race of high prestige in fiction, Dragon Age: Origins presents them as slaves of humans, labelled as second class citizens who resent the human race. This extended to the gameplay, where the player can choose to discriminate against other races, and can experience discrimination from others based on their choices.|$|E
500|$|Director Sakaguchi {{named the}} main {{character}} after his mother, Aki, who died in an accident several {{years prior to the}} production of the film. Her death led Sakaguchi to reflect on what happened to the spirit after death, and these thoughts resurfaced while he was planning the film, eventually taking the form of the Gaia hypothesis. He later explained that the theme he wanted to convey was [...] "more of a complex idea of life and death and spirit", believing {{that the best way to}} portray this would be to set the film on Earth. By comparison, Final Fantasy video games are set in <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds.</b> Dan Mayers from Sight & Sound stated the film followed the same theme typically found in Final Fantasy video games: [...] "A party of heroes averts impending global holocaust by drawing on their individual skills, gaining knowledge through challenges and emerging victorious with new-found love and respect for themselves and their companions." [...] Writing in the book Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams, Livia Monnet stated the film remediated [...] "the notion of life in the neovitalistic, evolutionary biology of Lynn Margulis and in contemporary theories on artificial life", going on to state that the film's exploration of the Gaia hypothesis raised interesting questions regarding the life and death process of both cinema and digital media, as well as contemporary life sciences, cybernetics, philosophy and science fiction. The concept of artificial life and resurrection was also discussed, and compared to similar themes in the 1914 book Locus Solus; the Phantoms in The Spirits Within were considered to be brought to life by various forces: by the alien planet's red Gaia and then by human spiritual energy.|$|E

2500|$|Like many MUDs, Lost Souls {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by popular fantasy literature, with much content being visibly an adaptation of material from these sources. [...] In the 1990s, this intermingling of <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> into an arguably coherent whole was aggressively pursued by the game's developers. [...] More recently, the creative direction has been toward the development of purely original content and the repurposing of adaptational content away from its third-party roots. [...] Despite these efforts, Lost Souls retains the stamp of many literary and gaming influences, the most marked being Roger Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber, J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.|$|E
2500|$|Alternate universes and simulacra {{are common}} plot devices, with <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> {{inhabited}} by common, working people, rather than galactic elites. [...] "There are no heroes in Dick's books", Ursula K. Le Guin wrote, [...] "but there are heroics. One is reminded of Dickens: what counts is the honesty, constancy, kindness and patience of ordinary people." [...] Dick {{made no secret}} that much of his thinking and work was heavily influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. The Jungian constructs and models that most concerned Dick {{seem to be the}} archetypes of the collective unconscious, group projection/hallucination, synchronicities, and personality theory. Many of Dick's protagonists overtly analyze reality and their perceptions in Jungian terms (see Lies Inc.). Dick's self-named Exegesis also contained many notes on Jung in relation to theology and mysticism.|$|E

2500|$|Cherryh's works depict <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> {{with great}} realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings have I been so caught up in any tale as I have been in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E
2500|$|While Nintendo {{had promised}} a virtual reality experience, the {{monochrome}} display limits the Virtual Boy's potential for immersion. Reviewers often considered the 3-dimensional features a gimmick, added to games that were essentially 2- or even 1-dimensional. The Washington Post felt that, {{even when a}} game gives the impression of 3-dimensionality, it suffers from [...] "hollow vector graphics." [...] Yokoi, the system's inventor, said the system did best with action and puzzle games, although those types of games provided only minimal immersion. Multiple critics lamented the absence of head-tracking in the Virtual Boy hardware. Critics found that, as a result, players were unable to immerse themselves in the game worlds of Virtual Boy games. Instead, they interacted with the <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds</b> {{in the manner of}} any traditional 2-dimensional game (that is, via a controller). Boyer said the console [...] "struggles to merge the two distinct media forms of home consoles and virtual reality devices." [...] While the device employed virtual reality techniques, it did so via the traditional home console. No feedback from the body was incorporated into gameplay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which Austen's novels are {{realistic}} is vigorously debated by scholars. The lack of physical description in her novels lends them an air of unreality. In Austen novels, as Page notes, there is a [...] "conspicuous absence of words referring to physical perception, the world of shape and colour and sensuous response". Yet, Austen carefully researched the background of her novels, using almanacs and read books to accurately describe the chronology and geography of her <b>fictional</b> <b>worlds.</b> Alastair Duckworth argues that she displays [...] "a concern that the novelist should describe things that are really there, that imagination {{should be limited to}} an existing order." [...] Austen's prose also repeatedly contains [...] "a relatively small number of frequently-used words, mainly epithets and abstract nouns indicating personal qualities—qualities, that is, of character and temperament rather than outward appearance". This allows readers to feel as if they know the characters [...] "intimately as a mind". Many scholars view this connection between the reader and character as a mark of realism. For example, Janet Todd writes that [...] "Austen creates an illusion of realism in her texts, partly through readerly identification with the characters and partly through rounded characters, who have a history and a memory." [...] However, there is little agreement regarding the depth of Austen's characters. Butler has argued that Austen is not primarily a realist writer because she is not interested in portraying the psychology of her heroines. Seeing Austen as a polemicist against sensibility, Butler argues that she avoided [...] "the sensuous, the irrational, [...] the involuntary types of mental experience because, although she cannot deny their existence, she disapproves of them." ...|$|E
