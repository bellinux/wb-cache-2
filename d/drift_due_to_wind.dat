50|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind.</b> As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed {{to the left or}} right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
50|$|For higher {{altitude}} drops, {{the effect}} of wind and bomb trajectory {{could no longer be}} ignored. One important simplification was to ignore the terminal velocity of the bomb, and calculate its average speed as the square root of the altitude measured in feet. For instance, a bomb dropped from 10,000 feet would fall at an average rate of 400 fps, allowing easy calculation of the time to fall. Now all that remained was a measurement of the wind speed, or more generally the ground speed. Normally this was accomplished by flying the aircraft into {{the general direction of the}} wind and then observing motion of objects on the ground and adjusting the flight path side to side until any remaining sideways <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> was eliminated. The speed over the ground was then measured by timing the motion of objects between two given angles as seen through the sight.|$|E
50|$|The {{angle is}} {{the angle of}} the wind or tide as it {{presents}} itself relative to the ship or aircraft, so if the wind is coming from the left at a relative angle of 30°, we use a sine of 0.5. Once the sine has been estimated, the <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> or tide can be estimated accordingly by resolving the velocity of the wind or tide into a forward component and a sideways component. The sideways component is the windspeed x the sine, and the forward component is (1 - the sine) x windspeed (i.e. the cosine). Naturally we must apply these corrections to our groundspeed in the appropriate direction according to logic - a wind from the left will blow us off course in that direction; a headwind will slow our progress, a tailwind will increase it. Converting this back to a heading correction can be done using the 1 in 60 rule.|$|E
50|$|An anchor is a device, {{normally}} made of metal, used {{to connect}} a vessel {{to the bed}} of {{a body of water}} to prevent the craft from <b>drifting</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> or current. The word derives from Latin ancora, which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυρα (ankura).|$|R
50|$|The Battenberg course {{indicator}} is a mechanical calculating device invented by Prince Louis of Battenberg in 1892 for taking station on other vessels whose range & bearing and course & speed are known. By extension, {{it has a}} range of other functions related to relative velocity calculations. A number of versions of the device were produced and it proved particularly useful for station-keeping, such as ships moving in convoy during World War II. Manufacture of the instruments was contracted to Elliott Brothers, London. Devices based on the Battenberg indicator were also developed for determining course and distance in aviation and when making allowances for aircraft <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>winds.</b> Instruments were also manufactured for other navies, for example in the USA.|$|R
40|$|DE 10355314 A UPAB: 20050818 NOVELTY - The device has a {{floating}} buoyancy unit (1) with min. underwater depth, which is placed around the oil spill. The buoyancy unit has a drive (6) {{to move it}} in the water, and two or coupling elements (5) for connection to further buoyancy units. It also has a location device for relative or absolute fixing of its position, a communication device between two or more buoyancy units, and a control device for drive and coupling elements. A pollution phase detector determines the transition between water and oil spill. Each buoyancy unit has a jacket inflated preferably by air, or a rigid hollow body (2), which contains all components with exception of the coupling elements. Each hollow body has barrier arms (3), filled with air and/or ballast water. USE - Containment of water-born pollution, especially maritime oil spills. ADVANTAGE - Can be deployed during bad weather periods, <b>drifting</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> and flood is prevented, to reduce pollution danger for coastal areas...|$|R
50|$|With a mil reticle-equipped scope the {{distance}} to an object can be estimated with a fair degree of accuracy by a trained user by determining how many angular mils an object of known size subtends. Once {{the distance}} is known, the drop of the bullet at that range (see external ballistics), converted back into angular mils, {{can be used to}} adjust the aiming point. Generally mil-reticle scopes have both horizontal and vertical crosshairs marked; the horizontal and vertical marks are used for range estimation and the vertical marks for bullet drop compensation. Trained users, however, can also use the horizontal dots to compensate for bullet <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind.</b> Mil-reticle-equipped scopes are well suited for long shots under uncertain conditions, such as those encountered by military and law enforcement snipers, varmint hunters and other field shooters. These riflemen must be able to aim at varying targets at unknown (sometimes long) distances, so accurate compensation for bullet drop is required.|$|E
40|$|During liftoff {{a vehicle}} can <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> nozzle gimbaling, fly away maneuver, etc [...] . This drift {{can cause the}} exhaust plumes to impinge on the deck and cause the noise levels {{experienced}} by the vehicle to increase. A small increase in the plume impingement can have a dramatic effect on the noise levels when the vehicle {{is only a few}} nozzle diameters from the deck. As the vehicle lifts off the deck the increase in noise levels lessens as the plume impingement increases. Several scale model acoustic tests have been undertaken at Marshall Space Flight Center which had test cases that were used to define the relationship between drift and the noise levels experienced by the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} HAUSGARTEN {{long-term}} observatory, sediment trap deployments {{were carried}} out before, during, and after the anomalously warm Atlantic Water inflow observed from 2005 to 2007 in the eastern Fram Strait. Downward export of particulate organic carbon (POC), zooplankton fecal pellet carbon (FPC), and biogenic particulate silica (bPSi) were measured from August 2002 to June 2003 and from July 2004 to July 2008 to indirectly {{assess the impact of}} the warm anomaly on phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the region. Lower and less frequent bPSi fluxes were observed during most of the warm anomaly period, reflecting a shift in phytoplankton community composition towards dominance of small-sized phytoplankton under warmer conditions. Lower FPC fluxes observed concurrently with the lower bPSi fluxes may indicate a decrease in fecal pellet production due to changing feeding conditions. In addition, the export of smaller fecal pellets in fall 2005 and spring 2006 suggests a dominance of smaller zooplankton during the warm anomaly. Nonetheless, bPSi and FPC export always increased in the presence of ice cover in the area above the sediment trap, even during the warm anomaly period, suggesting that sea ice is a key factor influencing the frequency of export events in the eastern Fram Strait. The scarcity of ice over the sampling area in 2005 and 2006 may partly be due to the warm anomaly, although solar radiation and ice <b>drift</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> stress also govern ice cover extent in the region. Overall, the warm anomaly resulted in a shift in the composition of the export fluxes when associated with an absence of ice cover in the eastern Fram Strait...|$|E

50|$|A drift meter, also drift {{indicator}} and drift sight, is an optical device {{used to improve}} dead reckoning for aircraft navigation. It consists of a small telescope extended vertically through {{the bottom of the}} aircraft with the eyepiece inside the fuselage at the navigator's station. A reticle, normally consisting of spaced parallel lines, is rotated until objects on the ground are seen to be moving parallel to the lines. The angle of the reticle then indicates the aircraft's <b>drift</b> angle <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>winds</b> aloft, and can be used to calculate the ground speed.|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the island}} [...] "Niue" [...] is the local name for coconut. The coconut is not {{indigenous}} to the island {{or any of the}} Pacific Islands. It has been stated that it could be from Central America. It has been growing on the island since historical times. One view, by a local man, is that the plant drifted ashore and was picked up and planted at Mutalau. It could have <b>drifted</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> trade <b>winds.</b> Another view is that voyagers carried them in their canoes and planted them in the islands, which they visited during journey. According to local legend two men, Levei-matagi and Levei-fualoto, who travelled from Tutuila carrying gifts of coconuts given to them by the local chief, came to the island and called it the island Niue-fekai, after the {{name of the}} coconut niue.|$|R
