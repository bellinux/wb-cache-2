40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The {{mechanisms}} of substrate recognition by regulatory proteases {{are not well}} understood. Presently, two opposing models have arisen to describe E. coil Lon's ability to discriminate between substrates: one suggests the N-terminus involvement while the second suggests the C-terminus involvement. In this project, {{the role of the}} C-terminal domain {{as it relates to the}} recognition of Lon's normal physiological substrates RcsA, an activator of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide, and SulA, an inhibitor of cell division, was addressed. Using site-directed mutagenesis, five mutations in Lon (R 537 G, <b>E</b> <b>538</b> A, GS 40 W, R 542 G, R 542 P) were isolated. Their phenotypic impact was either similar in character to wildtype Lon (R 537 G, <b>E</b> <b>538</b> A) or Δlon cells (G 540 W, R 542 G, R 542 P). The stabilization of both RcsA and SulA based on phenotypic assays and immunological detection of lon* strains (G 540 W, R 542 G, R 542 P) suggests the C-terminal domain may be involved in substrate degradation as opposed to discriminator activity...|$|E
40|$|Bioaccumulation of microcystins (MC) in {{zooplankton}} {{has been}} shown in several studies, mainly in field samples. A few studies, however, have demonstrated MC bioaccumulation in laboratory experiments. Although ingestion of cell-bound MC is considered the main route of MC accumulation, another important source is the MC from the dissolved fraction (DMC). This study reports the accumulation of DMC from aqueous extracts of natural bloom samples in three cladoceran species: Moina micrura, Daphnia laevis and Daphnia similis. Animals were exposed for 96 h to aqueous extracts of lyophilized matter from two bloom samples from Colombian reservoirs in different concentrations (25 e 1000 mg DW L 1). Analysis by HPLC-MS detected MC-LR in these samples at concentrations of 434 <b>e</b> <b>538</b> mg g 1. For the analysis of MC in animal tissues the samples were homogenized and sonicated in methanol:water (75 %) and analyzed by ELISA. Results showed that the animals uptake of MC increased with increasing exposure concentrations of aqueous extracts, with M. micrura and D. laevis clones presenting the highest MC concentrations in their tissues (up to 1170 e 1260 mg g 1) while D. similis the lowest (184 mg g 1). This study shows, for the first time, that MC uptake from dissolved fraction by zooplankton is possible, not only from the ingestion of seston or cell-bound MC as previously demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|A facile {{method to}} prepare a {{biocompatible}} graphene oxide (GO) -based substrate for protein immobilization was developed to overcome the drawbacks of GO, such as the strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions which could potentially alter the conformation and biological activity of proteins. The GO was coated with hydrophilic branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI), while Concanavalin A (Con A) as a model lectin protein was employed to fabricate the functionalized composites to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy. The composites exhibit an extremely high binding capacity for glycoproteins (i. <b>e.</b> IgG <b>538.</b> 3 mg g(- 1)), which are superior to other immobilized materials. Moreover, they can work well in 500 -fold non-glycoprotein interference and even in complex biological samples.

40|$|Objective: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal {{myeloproliferative}} neoplasia {{associated with}} the activation of the Janus-activating kinase 2 (JAK 2) mutation. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify clonal expansion of exon 12 mutations. Methods: We performed DNA sequencing of the JAK 2 exon 12 after TA-cloning in JAK 2 -V 617 F-negative and JAK 2 -V 617 F-positive PV patients. Results and Conclusions: We found clonal mutations (i. <b>e.</b> H <b>538</b> -K 539 delinsL and D 544 G) in 3 of 7 JAK 2 -V 617 F-negative PV patients, however, unlike JAK 2 -V 617 F, allele burden of JAK 2 exon 12 mutation was low. Since allele-specific PCR is able to amplify only the limited region which contains known mutations with gain-of-function, we need to clarify the biological implications of unknown single nucleotide substitution of the JAK 2 exon 12 with low clonal burden in erythrocytosis patients.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin within its LIM 4 domain and {{the involvement of}} this phosphorylation in activation of LFA- 1 integrins of the Baf 3 pro-B lymphocytic cell line. Using phosphorylated-threonine-specific antibodies, phosphorylated amino acid analysis and paxillin phosphorylation mutants, we demonstrated that TPA, the pharmacological analog of the endogenous second messenger diacyl glycerol, stimulates paxillin phosphorylation at threonine 538 (T 538). The TPA-responsive PKC isoform PKCδ directly binds paxillin in a yeast two-hybrid assay and phosphorylates paxillin at T 538 in vitro and also co-immunoprecipitates with paxillin and mediates phosphorylation of this residue in vivo. Recombinant wild-type paxillin, its phospho-inhibitory T 538 A or phospho-mimetic T <b>538</b> <b>E</b> mutants were expressed in the cells simultaneously with siRNA silencing of the endogenous paxillin. These experiments suggest that phosphorylation of paxillin T 538 contributes to dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton, redistribution of LFA- 1 integrins {{and an increase in}} their affinity. We also show that phosphorylation of T 538 is involved in the activation of LFA- 1 integrins by TPA...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of drillhole ER- 12 - 1 {{was to determine}} the hydrogeology of paleozoic carbonate rocks and of the Eleana Formation, a regional aquitard, in an area potentially downgradient from underground nuclear testing conducted in nearby Rainier Mesa. This objective was addressed through the drilling of well ER- 12 - 1 at N 886, 640. 26 <b>E</b> 640, <b>538.</b> 85 Nevada Central Coordinates. Drilling of the 1094 m (3588 ft) well began on July 19, 1991 and was completed on October 17, 1991. Drilling problems included hole deviation and hole instability that prevented the timely completion of this borehole. Drilling methods used include rotary tri-cone and rotary hammer drilling with conventional and reverse circulation using air/water, air/foam (Davis mix), and bentonite mud. Geologic cuttings and geophysical logs were obtained from the well. The rocks penetrated by the ER- 12 - 1 drillhole are a complex assemblage of Silurian, Devonian, and Mississippian sedimentary rocks that are bounded by numerous faults that show substantial stratigraphic offset. The final 7. 3 m (24 ft) of this hole penetrated an unusual intrusive rock of Cretaceous age. The geology of this borehole was substantially different from that expected, with the Tongue Wash Fault encountered at a much shallower depth, paleozoic rocks shuffled out of stratigraphic sequence, and the presence of an altered biotite-rich microporphyritic igneous rock {{at the bottom of the}} borehole. Conodont CAI analyses and rock pyrolysis analyses indicate that the carbonate rocks in ER- 12 - 1, as well as the intervening sheets of Eleana siltstone, have been thermally overprinted following movement on the faults that separate them. The probable source of heat for this thermal disturbance is the microporphyritic intrusion encountered at the bottom of the hole, and its age establishes that the major fault activity must have occurred prior to 102. 3 + 0. 5 Ma (middle Cretaceous) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the status of}} the apolipoprotein <b>E</b> allele in <b>538</b> participants in the incidence phase of the ongoing Shanghai Survey of Dementia, including 103 demented subjects, 72 with mild cognitive impairment and 363 cognitively normal. The apo E epsilon 4 allele was present in 10. 2 % of control subjects and the allelic frequency did not change between ages 60 to 96 years. The apo E epsilon 4 allelic frequency was increased both in those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (25. 4 %) and those with vascular dementia (VaD) (22. 2 %), but not in those with other dementing illnesses or the cognitively impaired. All of the subjects homozygous for apo E epsilon 4 were demented, three were diagnosed as having AD, and three met NINDS/AIREN criteria for VaD. The increased apo E epsilon 4 allelic frequency in clinically diagnosed VaD patients suggests that some of the infarcts are secondary to congophilic angiopathy. The adjusted odds ratio of developing AD in this community-derived study for persons with at least one apo E epsilon 4 allele was 4. 1 (95 % CI: 2. 2, 7. 7). Thus, the apo E epsilon 4 risk of developing AD in this Chinese cohort is similar to that in western community studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInvestigation of the {{mechanistic}} {{bases and}} physiological importance of cAMP regulation of HCN channels has exploited an arginine to glutamate mutation in the nucleotide-binding fold, an approach critically {{dependent on the}} mutation selectively lowering the channel's nucleotide affinity. In apparent conflict with this, in intact Xenopus oocytes, HCN and HCN-RE channels exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively distinct responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein — the estrogenic isoflavonoid strongly depolarizes the activation mid-point of HCN 1 -R <b>538</b> <b>E,</b> but not HCN 1 channels (+ 9. 8  mV± 0. 9 versus + 2. 2  mV± 0. 6) and hyperpolarizes gating of HCN 2 (− 4. 8  mV± 1. 0) but depolarizes gating of HCN 2 -R 591 E (+ 13. 2  mV± 2. 1). However, excised patch recording, X-ray crystallography and modeling reveal {{that this is not}} due to either a fundamental effect of the mutation on channel gating per se or of genistein acting as a mutation-sensitive partial agonist at the cAMP site. Rather, we find that genistein equivalently moves both HCN and HCN-RE channels closer to the open state (rendering the channels inherently easier to open but at a cost of decreasing the coupling energy of cAMP) and that the anomaly reflects a balance of these energetic effects with the isoform-specific inhibition of activation by the nucleotide gating ring and relief of this by endogenous cAMP. These findings have specific implications with regard to findings based on HCN-RE channels and kinase antagonists and general implications with respect to interpretation of drug effects in mutant channel backgrounds...|$|R

40|$|Genes {{encoding}} streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferases [ANT(3 ") (9) ] {{have been}} reported to exist in gram-negative organisms and Staphylococcus aureus. During a study of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci, we encountered an isolate of Enterococcus faecalis that was streptomycin resistant but did not appear to contain the 6 ′-adenylyltransferase gene (aadE) when examined by PCR with specific primers. Phosphocellulose paper binding assays indicated the presence of an ANT(3 ") (9) enzyme. Streptomycin and spectinomycin MICs of 4, 000 and 8, 000 μg/ml, respectively, were observed for the isolate. PCR primers corresponding to a highly conserved region of the aadA gene were used to amplify a specific 284 -bp product. The product hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled PCR product from E. coli C 600 (pHP 45 Ω) known to contain the aadA gene. The aadA gene was transferred via filter matings from the E. faecalis donor to E. faecalis JH 2 - 2. PCR primers designed for analysis of integrons were used to amplify a 1 -kb product containing the aadA gene, which was cloned into the vector pCRII and transformed into Escherichia coli DH 5 -α competent cells. d-Rhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing was used to determine the gene sequence, which was compared to previously reported sequences of aadA genes. We found the aadA gene in E. faecalis to be identical to the aadA genes reported by Sundström et al. for E. coli plasmid R 6 - 5 (L. Sundström, P. Rådström, G. Swedberg, and O. Sköld, Mol. Gen. Genet. 213 : 191 – 201, 1988), by Fling et al. for the aadA within transposon Tn 7 (M. E. Fling, J. Kopf, and C.

40|$|Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) {{channels}} {{play a role}} in olfactory transduction. Olfactory CNG channels {{consist of}} three different subunits, 2 XCNGA 2, 1 XCNGA 4 and 1 XCNGB 1 b. Only the CNGA 2 subunits can form functional homotetrameric channels. It is still unclear how ligand binding is translated to channel gating in the homotetrameric CNGA 2 channels. Therefore, we characterized the work of only one CNGA 2 subunit in homotetrameric CNGA 2 channels. We used the concatenation technique in combination with the patch-clamp technique. Selected subunits were rendered almost insensitive to cGMP by a point mutation (R <b>538</b> <b>E)</b> in the binding domain. First, we show direct evidence indicating that the concatenation technique does not have any effect on channel function: 1) The concentration-response relationship of wt-wt-wt-wt concatemer was almost identical to that of channels formed by non-concatenated subunits (4 wt). 2) When coexpressing wt-wt-wt-wt concatemer with mut subunits, the concentration-response relationship was indistinguishable from that of wt-wt-wt-wt concatemer alone. 3) The amplitude of the single-channel current and the open probability of wt-wt-wt-wt channels were not significantly different from that of 4 wt channels in the presence of saturating cGMP concentrations. Then, the concentration-response relationships obtained from the concatemers containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 mutated subunits showed that an increase of the number of mut subunits in the concatemeric channels caused graded losses in cGMP sensitivity (EC 50) associated with a systematic decrease of the Hill coefficient (H). Moreover, we showed that the position of the functional subunit(s) in the concatemers is irrelevant for the channel function. We further characterized the CNGA 2 -channel activation induced by the first ligand binding step in mut-mut-mut-wt channels by means of the single-channel recordings and a global fit analysis with Markovian models. We found that the first binding step is sufficient to evoke significant channel opening to the full conductance level. The second binding step is the most important step because this step drives the channel from the closed to the maximal open state. Together, these results provide direct information about the functional role of individual subunits in homotetrameric CNGA 2 channels...|$|R
