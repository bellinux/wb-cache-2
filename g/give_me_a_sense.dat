[...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of awe.

6000|$|This {{morning as}} ever was, bright and early up came the whole gang of them, {{a lot of}} sturdy, common-looking lads {{they seemed to be}} for the most part, and fell to on my new road. [...] Old Poe was in the highest of good spirits, and looked better in health than he has done any time in two years, being {{positively}} rejuvenated by the success of his scheme. He jested as he served out the new tools, and I am sorry to say damned the Government up hill and down dale, probably with a view to show off his position as a friend of the family before his work-boys. Now, whether or not their impulse will last them through the road does not matter to me one hair. [...] It is {{the fact that they have}} attempted it, that they have volunteered and are now really trying to execute a thing that was never before heard of in Samoa. Think of it! It is road-making - the most fruitful cause (after taxes) of all rebellions in Samoa, a thing to which they could not be wiled with money nor driven by punishment. It does <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of having done something in Samoa after all.|$|E
6000|$|I {{thank you}} very kindly for your so humane and so {{interesting}} letter, even if I must thank you a little briefly--having but this afternoon got out of bed, to which the Doctor three days ago consigned me--for a menace of jaundice, which appears however to have been, thank heaven, averted! (I once had it, and basta così;) so that I am a little shaky and infirm. You <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of endless things that I yearn to know more of, and I clutch hard the {{hope that you will}} indeed come to England in June. I have had--to be frank--a bad and worried and depressed and inconvenient winter--with the serpent-trail of what seemed at the time--the time you kindly offered me a princely hospitality--a tolerably ominous cardiac crisis--as to which I have since, however, got considerable information and reassurance--from the man in London most completely master of the subject--that is of the whole mystery of heart-troubles. I am definitely better of that condition of December-January, and really believe I shall be better yet; only that particular brush of the dark wing leaves one never quite the same--and I have not, I confess (with amelioration, even,) been lately very famous; (which I shouldn't mention, none the less, were it not that I really believe myself, for definite reasons, and intelligent ones, {{on the way to a}} much more complete emergence--both from the above mentioned and from other worries.) So much mainly to explain to you my singularly unsympathetic silence during a period of anxiety and discomfort on your own part which I all the while feared to be not small--but which I now see, with all affectionate participation, to have been extreme.... Sit loose and live in the day--don't borrow trouble, and remember that nothing happens as we forecast it--but always with interesting and, as it were, refreshing differences. [...] "Tired" [...] you must be, even you, indeed; and Paris, as I look at it from here, figures to me a great blur of intense white light in which, attached to the hub of a revolving wheel, you are all whirled round by the finest silver strings. [...] "Mazes of heat and sound" [...] envelop you to my wincing vision--given over as I am to a craven worship (only henceforth) of peace at any price. This dusky village, all deadening grey and damp (muffling) green, meets more and more my supreme appreciation of stillness--and here, in June, you must come and find me--to let me emphasize that--appreciation!--still further. You'll rest with me here then, but don't wait for that to rest somehow--somewhere en attendant. I am afraid you won't rest much in a retreat on the Place de la Concorde. However, so does a poor old croaking barnyard fowl advise a golden eagle!...|$|E

5000|$|After {{a week or}} two of this, however, Springsteen {{decided it}} was not what he wanted. The musicians disappeared, and Springsteen would perform on the tour all by himself. As he told Rolling Stone before the tour began, [...] "Nils and some other folks came in for rehearsals to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of if I wanted to go with {{something}} bigger. But what tends to be dramatic is either the full band or you onstage by yourself. Playing alone creates a sort of drama and intimacy for the audience: They know it's just them and just you." [...] He would further explain his challenge to Esquire during the tour: [...] "I don't have a piano and a sax and drums behind me on this tour. So I had to re-approach the guitar as an instrument of solo accompaniment. It becomes a bit of a new land, and I'll play it in ways I've never played it before. I'm constantly asking myself, How can I wring as much music and meaning as possible out of those six strings? One thing I do know: With the correct playing style, you can summon up an orchestra." ...|$|E

40|$|In 2002, {{during a}} summer course in Lower Tanana Athabascan, I sang a dratakh ch’elik {{song for the}} first time. I heard these songs sung but never gave myself {{completely}} to them as I {{did not know the}} meaning or words in these songs. So when I sang this mourning song I knew that I could sing and it sparked something in me to pursue to learn and sing more dratakh ch’elik. I found some songs that had been transcribed. While reading the transcriptions, I would listen to the songs from cd’sthe recordings. I retained what I was reading and realized that I can learn these songs. Songs helped us heal. Songs helped us to remember our loved ones and their characteristics were memorialized in these dratakh ch’elik. Also important words like ch’eghwtsen (love), gholiyo (prosperity), udlataya udlataya (glad occasions) had deep meaning in the culture. These songs <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of peace, a sense of place, a sense of cultural belonging; a connection to our historic Athabaskan world view. This interest in learning these dratakh ch’elik songs gave me the incentive to learn to read and write the language as I wanted to learn my family’s songs to pass on to my sons. So I would ask elders to teach me the words with all their levels of meanings in the songs. I also sought linguistic support for my work with the songs. Minto elders have strongly urged the study of song lyrics and their use in language teaching. They were concerned that meaningful lyrics could be lost as fewer young people learned the songs. They believed that when people learn to sing in their language, they can learn to speak in the language too. Motivation to learn the language is one effect of exposure to songs in cultural context. Singing together can help shy students learn language sounds. Working from simpler lyrics to more complex ones develops understanding of important aspects of the language. In the case of dratakh ch'elik, layers of meaning are uncovered as a student gets better at language. Each word in the lyrics has literal meaning, contextual meaning, cultural meaning, and metaphorical meaning. This is why the elders treasure these lyrics as repositories of cultural and moral knowledge, and why they insist that they be used in education...|$|E
40|$|I {{realized}} {{the importance of}} kinship connection and family preservation the first time I met one of my birth family members at age twelve.
