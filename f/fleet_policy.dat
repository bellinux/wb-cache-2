5|$|SMS Erzherzog Albrecht was an ironclad warship {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the 1870s, {{the only member of}} her class. Her design was similar to the ironclad , but Erzherzog Albrecht was built to a smaller size; like Custoza, she was an iron-hulled casemate ship armed with a battery of eight heavy guns. The ship was laid down in June 1870, was {{launched}} in April 1872, and was commissioned in June 1874. The ship's service career was limited; tight naval budgets precluded an active <b>fleet</b> <b>policy</b> in the 1870s, which did not markedly improve in the 1880s. Her first period of active service came in 1881 and 1882, when she helped suppress a revolt in Cattaro Bay. In 1908, she was converted into a tender for the gunnery training school, having been renamed Feuerspeier. In 1915, she became a barracks ship, and after World War I ended in 1918, was ceded to Italy as a war prize. She was renamed Buttafuoco, served in the Italian Navy as a hulk through World War II before being scrapped in 1950.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships of}} the Camäleon class were {{frequently}} [...] during peacetime, as tight Prussian naval budgets in the 1860s prevented an active <b>fleet</b> <b>policy.</b> This was {{in large part}} due to liberal opposition to an expansion and modernization program for the Prussian Army under Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Ministry of War; the Prussian Landtag refused to pass a budget authorizing the expenses requested by Roon, leading to a constitutional crisis where the army and navy operated without legal budgets. The navy was thus unable to spare funding to operate smaller vessels like the Camäleon class. Indeed, the lack of funds delayed completion of Meteor and Drache considerably.
