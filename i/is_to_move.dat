5|$|The National Rail Administration {{has stated}} {{that they may have}} to close Innherred Sykehus Station. The station is located in a curve and within the {{signaling}} area of Levanger Station, and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate has required the station to be corrected by 2012. Because of the adjacent Levanger Hospital, the station is one of the busiest on the system, with 90,000 annual riders. One possible solution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the platforms of Levanger Station closer towards the hospital and thus serve both the town and the hospital from the same station.|$|E
50|$|When General Sherman {{decided not}} to pursue the Confederate forces {{commanded}} by General Hood on September 4, 1864, he issued special field order No. 64. The Army of the Cumberland commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Atlanta. The Army of the Tennessee commanded by Maj. Gen. Howard <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> East Point {{and the head of}} Camp Creek, while the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Schofield, <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Decatur.|$|R

5000|$|Week 3 - Ben and Sean - Ben and Sean had to {{pick one}} of two discs: one <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the double {{bracelet}} to another contestant, the other <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the nothing bracelet to another contestant. Ben and Sean chose the disc that required them <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the double bracelet to another contestant. As a result, Holly {{had to give up}} the bracelet to Tiffany.|$|R
5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E
5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although the striped plumage of its two species suggests a distant relationship with streaked African Hirundo species. The other member of the genus is the Brazza's martin P.brazzae, although in the past it has sometimes been suggested that Brazza's martin should be moved to its own genus, Phedinopsis, due to the significant differences in vocalisations and nest type from its relative. The nearest relation of the two Phedina martins is the banded martin, Riparia cincta, which appears not to be closely related to the other members of its current genus and resembles Brazza's martin in its nesting habits and calls. The current Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC)-recommended practice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the banded martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta, rather than to merge it into Phedina, since the banded martin's larger size, different bill and nostril shape and non-colonial nesting are differences from the current Phedina species.|$|E
5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although their striped plumage suggests a distant relationship with several streaked African Hirundo species.

5000|$|Although Jackson's mission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{defeat the}} Creek, his larger {{objective}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on Pensacola. Jackson's plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> south, build roads, destroy Upper Creek towns {{and then later}} proceed to Mobile to stage an attack on Spanish held Pensacola. He had two problems: logistics and short enlistments. When Jackson began his advance, the Tennessee River was low, making it difficult <b>to</b> <b>move</b> supplies, and there was little forage for his horses.|$|R
5000|$|Another idea <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Woodley Lane Bridge to the Q Street {{location}} {{rather than}} {{build a new}} bridge altogether. Engineers determined that the cost <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Woodley Lane bridge would be too great and the Woodley Lane Bridge would not <b>be</b> available <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> until its replacement, the Connecticut Avenue Bridge, was completed.|$|R

25|$|A {{special case}} of zugzwang is {{reciprocal}} zugzwang or mutual zugzwang, {{which is a}} position such that whoever <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> is in zugzwang. Studying positions of reciprocal zugzwang is {{in the analysis of}} endgames. A position of mutual zugzwang is closely related to a game with a Conway value of zero in game theory.|$|E
25|$|Jungians have {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of parent hunger, forcing one repeatedly to seek out unactualised parts of the father archetype in the outside world. One answer men have been offered <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into generativity; to find the lost father within themselves, the internal father, and hand him on to their successors, thereby shifting from demanding parental guidance to providing it.|$|E
60|$|The French army, 110,000 strong, <b>was</b> {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> Another 30,000 men <b>were</b> {{preparing}} <b>to</b> march, {{to join the}} army that had been got up by that mixed body, the German Federation.

25|$|The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> certain {{functions}} {{from local}} areas {{into the central}} departments – such as dealing with complex or serious crimes, along with finance, IT and administration tasks, so that the local policing units can concentrate on local policing issues. There is also the long-term aim of {{reducing the number of}} Contact Management Centres from ten (one each for each LPU) to one, covering the whole of the force.|$|E
25|$|The bounce pass is {{executed}} by getting {{low to the}} ground, holding the ball {{with one or two}} hands at hip height, and stepping forward while releasing the ball. The ball should be aimed low at the ground and released {{with a great deal of}} force. The purpose of the bounce pass <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball around an opponent. It is used when a player is in a confined space, with limited passing options.|$|E
25|$|An extreme type of {{reciprocal}} zugzwang, called trébuchet, {{is shown in}} the diagram. It is also called a full-point mutual zugzwang because it will result in a loss for the player in zugzwang, resulting a full point for his opponent. Whoever <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in this position must abandon his own pawn, thus allowing his opponent to capture it and proceed to promote the remaining pawn, resulting in an easily winnable position.|$|E
2500|$|The re-development of Kiruna is a {{reconstruction}} project, as the Kirunavaara mine, run by LKAB, undermines the current town center.

25|$|Linden Lab pursues {{the use of}} open {{standards}} technologies, {{and uses}} free and open source software such as Apache, MySQL, Squid and Linux. The plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> everything to open standards by standardizing the Second Life protocol. Cory Ondrejka, former CTO of Second Life, stated in 2006 that a while after everything has been standardized, both the client and the server will be released as free and open source software.|$|E
25|$|Future {{research}} is targeted at further understanding mutations {{and how they}} lead to MCAP and MPPH sydnromes. The majority of studies of megalencephaly have included mice who present brain abnormalities and overgrowth. The next step <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to clinical trials involving humans {{in order to determine}} the exact genetic mutation causing the sequences. Additionally, scientists and pharmaceutical companies have begun to show interest in mutation inhibition and designing preventative methods to eliminate the underlying cause of megalencephaly altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around the board by {{correctly}} answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges {{to fit into the}} playing pieces, and a die.|$|E

25|$|Nima’s poetry transgressed these limitations. It {{relied on}} the natural {{function}} inherent within poetry itself to portray the poet’s solidarity with life and the wide world surrounding him or her in specific and unambiguous details and scenes. Sepid poetry continues the poetic vision as Nima expressed it and avoids the contrived rules imposed on its creation. However, its most distinct difference with Nimai’ poetry <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the rhythms it employed. Nima Youshij paid attention to an overall harmonious rhyming and created many experimental examples to achieve this end.|$|E
25|$|Off-axis or offset feed– The {{reflector}} is an asymmetrical {{segment of}} a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, are located {{to one side}} of the dish. The purpose of this design <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the feed structure out of the beam path, so it does not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, below.|$|E
25|$|The fifty-move rule – {{if in the}} {{previous}} 50 moves by each side, no pawn has moved and no capture has been made, a draw may be claimed by either player. Here again, the draw is not automatic and must be claimed if the player wants the draw. If the player whose turn it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> has made only 49 such moves, he may write his next move on the scoresheet and claim a draw. As with the threefold repetition, the right to claim the draw is forfeited {{if it is not}} used on that move, but the opportunity may occur again.|$|E
