25|$|The Lazio {{region of}} Frascati {{is the source}} of the {{majority}} of plantings of Malvasia di Candia, a distinct sub-variety of Malvasia that is not part of the Malvasia bianca branch of the <b>grape</b> <b>family.</b> It is most often used for blending with the related Malvasia Puntinata and Malvasia di Lazio being more highly prized due to their higher acidity and tendency to produce less flabby wines.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{suggest that}} the <b>grape</b> <b>family</b> originated in the Arabian country of Oman and was named after the city of Muscat located {{on the coast of}} the Gulf of Oman.

5000|$|For home sacrifices, {{citizens}} {{would usually}} use foods instead of animals {{because they were}} less messy. [...] However, it was not unheard of. Many families would use small animals for their blood sacrifices. [...] Some foods that they would use were wine, cheese, fruits, milk, honey cakes, honeycombs, and <b>grapes.</b> <b>Families</b> would also use incense, fire, or wreaths if they wanted a sacrifice that was more permanent. [...] Romans would use sacrifices that represented life. [...] If their ancestors became angry, they would placate them with an offering of black beans and spring water at midnight.|$|R
25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the table, Grüner Veltliner is the {{dominant}} white grape in Austria, producing generally dry wines ranging from short-lived Heuriger wines to Spätleses capable of long life. The ancient Welschriesling variety is used in the noble rot dessert wines of the Neusiedlersee; it also makes undistinguished dry wines for drinking young, as does Müller-Thurgau (Rivaner). Neuburger was supposedly found as flotsam in the Danube in the 1850s, but is now known to be a cross between Silvaner and the ancient Roter Veltliner. Frühroter Veltliner is also known as Malvasier, suggesting a link to the Malvasia <b>grape</b> <b>family</b> of the Eastern Mediterranean. Muscat Ottonel is used in dessert wines from the Neusiedlersee, as is Bouvier, which is related to the muscat family and is a parent of the Orémus (Zéta) grape used in Tokaji. There were high hopes for Goldburger, a cross between Welschriesling and Orangetraube bred in Klosterneuburg, but after an initial wave of planting, enthusiasm has dimmed. Zierfandler (Spätrot) and Rotgipfler are local grapes of the Thermenregion, and are often blended together as Spätrot-Rotgipfler. It is worth noting that Pinot gris is known as Ruländer in Austria, and sometimes as Grauburgunder; Pinot blanc is known as Weißburgunder or Weissburgunder, and Sauvignon blanc is called Muskat Sylvaner. Riesling plays a much smaller role than in Germany, but the relatively small amount grown is used for some of Austria's most appreciated dry white wines.|$|E
