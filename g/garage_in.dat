5|$|The company {{changed its}} name to Tillingbourne Bus Company in 1972, {{changing}} its livery to blue and yellow, and moved to a <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Gomshall in the same year. A second <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Ewhurst was opened in 1974. An expansion of operations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, much of it through the award of county council contracted routes, took the company's vehicles into West Sussex and Hampshire as well as Surrey. Tillingbourne took over the services of London operator Orpington & District following that company's collapse in 1981. These were run separately from the main company as Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) which, in 1983, was sold to its management to form Metrobus, now part of the Go-Ahead Group. The company moved garages again in 1980, settling in Cranleigh. A new, larger <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> the same town was opened in February 2001. Deregulation of local bus services in 1986 led to further expansion, including the establishment in 1989 of a new brand, Hobbit, for Tillingbourne's minibus operations. A high-quality coaching subsidiary, Dorking Coaches, was also operated towards the end of Tillingbourne's life.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} one of the {{beneficiaries}} of the collapse of London Forest, gaining three routes in Walthamstow. The services of Golden Boy were also taken over, in September 1992, although this deal involved no vehicles and no <b>garage.</b> <b>In</b> July 1993, Lynton Travel purchased 41-vehicle independent Citibus Tours, based in Chadderton near Oldham. Other changes made in 1993 included the opening of a new <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Grays to replace the previous building, and a totally new garage at Ware which replaced that at Hoddesdon. Two more operators were taken over in 1994, namely coach operators Airport Coaches of Stansted Airport and Biss Bros of Bishops Stortford.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the management of vehicle repair <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> the Bolgatanga Municipality. A 67 item questionnaire was used to collect data from a randomly selected sample of 52 entrepreneurs of vehicle repair <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> the Bolgatanga Municipality. Frequency counts, percentages, and Pearson’s chi-square test for independence were used to analyze the data collected. The study found that majority of the entrepreneurs of vehicle repair <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> the Bolgatanga Municipality were predominantly young males (between 29 - 39 yrs), possessed no formal school certificate, and had between six and 11 years of working experience. Also, the study revealed that the factors contributing to the success of vehicle repair <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> the Bolgatanga Municipality were management skills, entrepreneurial characteristics, and human capital. Moreover, the study noted that the business challenges facing vehicle repair <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> the Bolgatanga Municipality were high cost of inputs, high cost of borrowing money, high utility charges, high rental charges, debts collection from business creditors, and unfavourable business laws. In addition, the study found that gender, age, level of education, and working experience of the entrepreneurs are independent of the performance of vehicle repair <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> the Bolgatanga Municipality...|$|R

In response, Barnes took a job with a <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Mosman but after finding that the necessary travel interfered too much with playing cricket, he found alternative employment, demonstrating motorbikes in the city.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978), the band {{separated from their}} manager Bernard Rhodes. This separation meant that the group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music.

5|$|By 2002, Sovereign's fleet {{amounted}} to just 45 vehicles. Stevenage depot {{was closed and}} a smaller <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> the same town acquired, with Arriva Shires & Essex taking over the old site. Finally, in January 2005, the remainder of Sovereign was sold to Arriva Shires & Essex. Having previously acquired the successors to the former London Country North West, London Country South West and London Country South East companies as well as County Bus & Coach, Arriva now owned all of the former London Country Bus Services apart from the St Albans operation.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the remains were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, the remains were in a city <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership of the remains and would like them returned to upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} as Tillingbourne Valley in 1924, {{and became a}} limited company in 1931, taking the name Tillingbourne Valley Services. It {{initially}} operated routes in the Guildford area from a <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Chilworth using small single-deck buses painted in a maroon livery. Coach hire and excursions began in 1931, but two years later these activities split into a separate company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently for a further 24 years. Until 1970 Tillingbourne was owned and managed by three generations of the Trice family, before being sold to Trevor Brown.|$|E
5|$|Les Jackson {{was born}} on 24 February 1917 in the Brisbane suburb of Newmarket, Queensland, the fourth son of {{businessman}} William Jackson and his wife Edith.

40|$|Blood carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO%) {{levels were}} {{measured}} in 61 workers <b>in</b> 35 <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> Leicester and Leicestershire. Of 26 workers <b>in</b> large <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> winter, 44 % of the non-smokers and 20 % of the smokers had increased CO absorption, the highest HbCO% being 26. 0 in a non-smoker. Of 35 workers in 24 smaller, randomly chosen garages visited {{throughout the year}} (two per month) the corresponding figures were 43 % and 14 %, the highest HbCO% being 21. 0. The possible relevance of these findings to coronary heart disease <b>in</b> <b>garage</b> workers is discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{company was}} placed in {{administration}} in March 2001, following two years of heavy losses, and closed down permanently a month later. This led {{to a series of}} service changes, which saw its operations covered by a range of different operators. Other effects causing Tillingbourne's collapse included a fall in the total number of passengers using buses in Hampshire and local criticism following {{an increase in the number}} of vehicles using the, later closed, Arriva West Sussex <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Warnham. The sites of both Tillingbourne garages in Cranleigh were converted for use by other industries.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{name was}} changed to Tillingbourne Bus Company in May 1972, {{following}} {{the introduction of a}} service between Horsham and Colgate, with a new livery of blue, yellow and grey introduced. A new Managing Director, Barry King, joined Tillingbourne from North Downs Coaches in the same year. In 1974, a small <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Ewhurst was acquired and maintenance work transferred there, although the majority of the fleet continued to be based in Gomshall.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} vehicle requirements at Arriva's Warnham (Horsham) garage, {{which took}} over three of Tillingbourne's former routes, led to criticism from {{residents in the}} area and the suggestion that the site should be closed and operations moved to another location. The depot, buses and operation were sold by Arriva to Metrobus in September 2009, who moved all operations to their <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Crawley and closed the site.|$|E

25|$|In 1922 {{there were}} bus <b>garages</b> <b>in</b> Shrubhill, which had {{capacity}} for 53 vehicles, and Henderson Row, which {{held up to}} 45. In 1926, the bus fleet moved into Central Depot on Annandale Street, a former Industrial Exhibition hall, which is still Lothian Buses' main depot today. Hoping for economies of scale, originally all of the Corporation's road transport fleet (including such vehicles as fire tenders and waste collection vehicles) were to be <b>garaged</b> <b>in</b> this depot.|$|R

5|$|Throughout his {{political}} career, Harpole {{has focused on}} improving downtown Amarillo.

As mayor, he has explored plans to build a baseball stadium and a parking <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> Amarillo. However, the development partners that the city worked with for three years suddenly went out of business in January 2015, causing a setback.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same <b>garage</b> <b>in</b> which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
