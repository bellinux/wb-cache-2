The executors chose Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be Lord Protector of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret– the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland– were thereby excluded from the succession.

Those provisions, among other things, restricted {{the independence of the}} Cuban government and gave the U.S. the right to oversee and at times interfere in Cuban affairs.

5000|$|Telstra {{submitted}} {{that this}} conclusion is not denied by the provisions of Section 152EB which deal expressly with the subject of just terms. If a Commonwealth law provides for the acquisition of property on unjust terms, then Section 51(xxxi) renders that law invalid, since it is beyond the legislative powers of the Commonwealth to create such a law, then Section 152EB, the <b>final</b> <b>provision</b> of Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, acts to save that law from invalidity, via reasonable compensation by the Commonwealth. Telstra argued that this provision did not save the impugned provisions from invalidity stating that relevant acquisitions [...] "occur by the imposition of the standard access obligations on carriers or providers pursuant to Section 152AR" [...] and not by any ACCC determination. Furthermore, any acquisition only comes into operation when a relevant request for the service is made by a provider, and not by any ACCC determination. Telstra stated that Section 152EB should be considered engaged only in respect to determinations that effect an acquisition, {{and that the only}} relevant determinations are those made by the ACCC. Thus, Telstra argued, this provision did not apply to any acquisition effected by Section 152AR since the relevant acquisition is effected by the provider’s request for access engaging the standard obligations under Section 152AR, and not by any determination made by the ACCC.|$|E
