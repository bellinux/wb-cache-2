40|$|Abstract The built {{environment}} {{is responsible for}} 40 % of the global energy demand (1). To reduce building energy consumption, regulations are enhancing the appeal of sustainable constructions. Nevertheless, the rate of construction is low in most of developed countries. Efforts are {{to be made in}} existing buildings, namely in office buildings, which are statistically more energy-consuming than residential buildings (3). To conduct an adapted energy retrofitting, an energy audit can be realized as a pre-study. The first step is to realize an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixture</b> <b>of</b> the building equipment. From that analysis, the building behavior and consumption are modeled with the help of dynamic simulation software. A comparison with the real life energy consumption guides the study to obtain a model close to reality. Energy retrofitting plans can then be created, based on this model and on the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixture</b> phase. If technically adapted, each retrofitting solution is evaluated in terms of investment cost and energy savings. Building energy audits and recommendation phases are not unique and normalized procedures. More advanced and complex calculations and measurements can improve the result accuracy. Nevertheless, the introduced approach gives a first understanding of a building, by analyzing its strengths and its weaknesses. As a result, the proposed retrofitting solutions are suited to each specific building. This renovation plan can then be used as a first-decision making tool for the various stakeholders included in the retrofitting project.

40|$|In December 2011, the Institute for Public Administration {{completed}} {{a project that}} examined pedestrian-lighting policies in unincorporated areas in Delaware. The purpose of the 2011 study was to better understand who shared in the responsibilities for providing pedestrian lighting in these areas. This current project builds on the 2011 pedestrian-lighting research by conducting a literature review to provide an update of new lighting technologies and trends, including fixture designs, lighting options, and operational costs. The {{most important part of}} this work, however, focuses on piloting a low-cost method to assess lighting in a few selected communities in Delaware. While working on another community planning project, IPA learned that many municipalities do not have a readily available <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> the lighting in their towns. Municipalities that provide electric service also provide the lighting in their towns and maintain lighting inventories. Most towns in Delaware, however, do not provide electric service, and lighting in those towns is provided by a private utility. Towns that do not have data or maps showing the locations <b>of</b> lighting <b>fixtures</b> have little information on how well the sidewalks and pathways are visible after dark. For this research, IPA proposed using a relatively inexpensive mobile phone application to develop lighting inventories for towns. The development <b>of</b> an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> lighting <b>fixtures</b> to show the location of installed lights is the first step to addressing the lighting needs of a town. IPA will use this information to develop maps of selected areas to demonstrate potential products.

40|$|Methods {{and tools}} of risk {{analysis}} {{are used to}} argue the decisions regarding the issuance of operating permits, the control of urbanization {{and the development of}} a contingency plan. Among these tools, we find mapping risk. Mapping is a method of representation and prioritization of an organization’s risks. It is an essential component of the risk management process, especially when enacted in an industrial area. Its objective is to have a global inventory of vulnerabilities for all activity fields. The mapping process is important because it raises the general risk evaluation, assessment and prioritization. It offers simple and didactic representations, giving an overview for decision-makers to guide their strategic choices of action especially in the case of an accident. Maps are then used to track the effectiveness of strategies implemented and finally form a very effective tool of communication on the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures.</b> The overall objective of this study to determine the map’s risks of a former industrial area “Palma ” in extension to help manage risks in situ. To carry out this study a Preliminary Hazard Analysis (APR) approach was used. The latter plays a āecisive role in risks management, meaning cost control, project deadlines related to the achievement of performance objectives for the product or service. In particular, the APR approach must: Identify and assess risks; Define and quantify the possible scenarios; Develop an action plan...|$|E
40|$|The {{inheritance}} is {{the legacy}} of the past from which we profit today and who we transmit to the generations to come. UNESCO adopted in 1972 a convention concerning heritage protection world, cultural and natural. The cultural heritage relates to the monuments, whole of constructions and goods with historical values, esthetics, archaeological, scientific, ethnological or anthropological. The natural heritage relates to the formations physical, biological and geological remarkable, the surfaces of an exceptional value of the point of the sight of science, conservation or natural beauty and the habitats of threatened animal species and vegetable. The wine landscapes are generally recognized among the most remarkable forms of landscapes resulting from the human activity, at the same time by the mark which they print with the territory and by the cultural traditions which theirs are associated, which leads to the classification of fifteen European wine sites. This approach is integrated in a vision of patrimonial governance of the wine terroir which associate the orientations of the international organization of the vine and the wine opposite in particular of the concept of terroir and Viticulture. The objective of the communication is to establish an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixtures</b> of the classified as wine sites “World heritage UNESCO” and to put in prospect the patrimonial approach for the world wine sector...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing and {{assembly}} processes often require objects {{to be held}} {{in such a way that}} they can resist all external wrenches. The problem of "fixture planning" is to compute, for a given object and a set <b>of</b> <b>fixturing</b> elements, the set of placements <b>of</b> the <b>fixturing</b> elements that constrain all finite and infinitesimal motions of the object (due to applied wrenches). As fixturing problems occur frequently in manufacturing {{and assembly}}, it becomes costly to build a dedicated fixturing solution for each different problem. Modular fixturing toolkits offer the advantage of reusability <b>of</b> the <b>fixturing</b> elements and have therefore gained considerable popularity. A modular <b>fixturing</b> toolkit consists <b>of</b> a <b>fixturing</b> table with a rectangular grid of holes, and a set <b>of</b> <b>fixturing</b> elements whose positions are restricted to the holes in the table. Several recent publications in the field <b>of</b> <b>fixture</b> planning aim at exploring the power <b>of</b> these modular <b>fixturing</b> toolkits. We give an overview of modul [...] ...|$|R

To that end, a new design method based on grey theory is proposed to determine the number <b>of</b> sheet metal <b>fixture</b> locating points in this paper. Firstly, the training sample set is generated by Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and finite element analysis (FEA). Secondly, the GM(1, 1) grey model is constructed based on the established training sample set to approximate the mapping relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>fixture</b> locating points and the concerned sheet metal maximum deformation. Thirdly, the final number <b>of</b> <b>fixture</b> locating points for sheet metal can be inversely calculated under the allowable maximum deformation. Finally, a sheet metal case is conducted and the results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in determining the number <b>of</b> <b>fixture</b> locating points for sheet metal...|$|R
