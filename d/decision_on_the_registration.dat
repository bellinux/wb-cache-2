As part of this Division’s research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> occurrence, movement, transformation, impact, and control of environmental contaminants, this Division develops management and engineering tools to help pollution control officials reach <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> and restriction of pesticides used for agricultural purposes. The pesticide and nutrient regulatory process requires that the potential risk to human health resulting from the introduction or continued use of these chemicals be evaluated. Recently, much of this attention has been focused on human and ecosystem exposure through the leaching of pesticides and nitrogen to groundwater and the subsequen...|$|R
40|$|The UK’s Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883, {{introduced}} {{provision for}} trade marks in colours. However, notwithstanding this statutory provision, {{there was an}} ongoing conservative approach to the approval of colour trade marks. In 1887, the Chancery Division considered an application for <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> of <b>the</b> colours blue, white and red {{in the form of}} a Tricolor, on a label for a well-known brand of French coffee. 1 In handing down his judgement, Kay J remarked:“ [...] . you cannot register a mark of which the only distinction is the use of a colour, because, practically under the terms of the act, that would give you a monopoly of all the colours of the rainbow". 2 The application was refused, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that the trade mark lacked distinctiveness independently of the colour, and that the colour should, in essence, be deemed an accident. This paper examines <b>the</b> recent judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> of colour trade marks in respect of two longstanding and contentious cases, namely BP Amoco plc (BP) in respect of the colour green and Cadbury Schweppes (Cadbury) in respect of the colour purple. With both possibly well nigh at the end of their respective litigation rainbows – with nary an oil strike or purple patch in sight, they have been the catalyst for the establishment of new parameters for the distinctiveness requirements of colour trade mark registration...|$|R
40|$|Background Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} (NNIs) {{have been}} routinely used in arable crop protection since their {{development in the}} early 1990 s. These insecticides {{have been subject to}} <b>the</b> same <b>registration</b> procedures as other groups of pesticides, thus meet the same environmental hazard standards as all crop protection products. However, during the last 10 years the debate regarding their possible detrimental impact on non-target organisms, particularly pollinators, has become increasingly contentious and widely debated. Against this background, legislators and politicians in some countries, have been faced with a need to make <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> future <b>registration</b> of some or all of this class of insecticides, based on published evidence that in some areas is incomplete or limited in extent. This has created much concern in agricultural communities that consider that the withdrawal of these insecticides is likely to have significant negative economic, socio-economic and environmental consequences. Methods The proposed systematic map aims to address the following primary question: What is the available evidence for the effects of neonicotinoids used in arable crop production on non-target organisms and concentrations of residues in relevant matrices? The primary question will be divided into two sub-questions to gather research literature for (1) the effect of NNIs on non-target organisms (2) the occurrence of concentrations of NNIs in matrices of relevance to non-target organisms (i. e. exposure routes). The systematic map will focus on NNIs used in arable crop production: imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, thiacloprid and dinotefuran. Separate inclusion criteria have been developed for each sub-question. Traditional academic and grey literature will be searched for in English language and a searchable databases containing extracted meta-data from relevant included studies will be developed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{prevention}} of occupationally related trauma and disease requires reliable measurement systems {{in order to}} target the relevant exposures and injury problems and prioritise resources. Social and workers' compensation insurance data, with exposure, coverage, accident process, medical severity and other outcome information, represents the most credible basis for <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> preventative action. <b>The</b> <b>registration</b> and measurement system for occupational trauma and disease, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ACC New Zealand paradigm, has been developed by the Swedish Labour Market Insurances, and is also {{the basis for the}} new EU occupational injury registration system Some different target areas for occupational injury prevention, and examples of successful intervention activities, are reported from Swedish and Australian systems. To support the industrial management of safety requires good and industry-relevant measurement systems for occupational risk and the consequences of occupational trauma and disease. The development of such specific recording and measurement systems in Swedish branches of industry is based on union-employer consensus about occupational risk and a joint approach to safety management. Aggregate statistical information is of limited use for applied prevention; the accident and injury data must be more specific and detailed in order to be turned into credible decision support systems (DSS). Some different examples of industry-based safety management and decision support systems from Sweden are presented. Results from a study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relation between best-of-sector industrial safety management and shareholder value <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ASX are also presented. 1 QC 2011081...|$|R
40|$|Before {{applying}} for accreditation as a RMet, you must ask yourself the following questions: Do I hold the basic academic requirements for RMet, or can I demonstrate the required knowledge at interview? Do I {{have the necessary}} professional experience to have developed all the competencies required of a RMet? Can I communicate in both oral and written English effectively by completing the Professional Review and Interview. Can I demonstrate these competencies by submitting a written record of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) as a meteorologist {{and be prepared to}} further evidence my competencies in an interview? Have I studied the Code of Conduct expected of RMets and am I prepared to abide by it? Am I committed to maintaining a CPD record for inspection by the RMetS in order to maintain my accreditation as a RMet? 2. Application for Registration consists of four steps: Complete the application form as fully as you possibly can and send it to the Society’s Accreditation Officer together with the relevant fee. Do not leave any section uncompleted or your application will be returned. The Society will check your submission and will seek references from your nominated referees. Subject to satisfactory references, the Society will arrange for you to be interviewed, usually at your place of work, by a panel of three or four interviewers, at least one of whom will, if possible, be one of your senior colleagues. The Chairman of the interview panel will submit a report to the Society and your application will then be considered by the Accreditation Board and a <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> award of <b>Registration</b> will be made. This will be communicated to you by post as quickly as possible after the adjudication. The aim will be to complete the entire process within four months of the receipt of your application. Note that the Society will not under any circumstances enter into correspondence over the outcome of an application other than through the formal appeal process...|$|R
