5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Quadrasonic Sound in New York {{in the summer}} of 1983 with Leanne Ungar engineering. A small core of musicians from a group called Slow Train backed Cohen on the album. Speaking with Judith Fitzgerald of The Globe and Mail in 2000, Cohen cited Various Positions as a breakthrough of sorts:It was the first time I could really see and intuitively feel what it was I was doing, making or creating in that enterprise. After a long period of barrenness, it all just seemed to click. Suddenly, I knew these weren't discrete songs I was writing...I could see - <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sense</b> a unity. Various Positions had its own life, its own narrative. It was all laid out {{and all of a sudden}} it all made sense. It was almost painfully joyful, if that makes some sense. The pulling and the putting of the pieces together coherently, the being inside of that process and knowing, once I'd done that, it would be finished and I would have to leave it and go back to the world. The album contains two songs that would become live standards for Cohen: [...] "Dance Me to the End of Love" [...] and [...] "Hallelujah". In 2010, producer John Lissauer revealed to Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds that the drum track on the former is actually from the Casio keyboard the song had been composed on: [...] "It didn't even have audio output so we had to mike it up. We tried to do that song with real drums and percussion but he liked the simplicity of the Casio and had become accustomed to it." [...] This explains the slight strain in Cohen's singing on the track; changing the key on the Casio would have meant altering the drum pattern that Cohen wanted to use (The song, which would become Cohen's perennial show opener, is performed in a lower key live). Although structured as a love song, [...] "Dance Me to the End Of Love" [...] was in fact inspired by the Holocaust. In an interview, Cohen said of the song: [...] "Dance Me to the End Of Love"...it's curious how songs begin because the origin of the song, every song, has a kind of grain or seed that somebody hands you or the world hands you and that's why the process is so mysterious about writing a song. But that came from just hearing or reading or knowing that in the death camps, beside the crematoria...a string quartet was pressed into performance while this horror was going on...they would be playing classical music while their fellow prisoners were being killed and burnt. So, that music, [...] "Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin", meaning the beauty there of being the consummation of life, the end of this existence and of the passionate element in that consummation. But, it is the same language that we use for surrender to the beloved, so that the song [...] - [...] it's not important that anybody knows the genesis of it, because if the language comes from that passionate resource, it will be able to embrace all passionate activity.|$|E

At that time there was little information about riot grrrl, especially in the UK, and I made it my doctoral mission to find its protagonists {{and see if they}} would be willing to share their stories with me. Riot grrrl seemed like a moment from which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make <b>sense</b> of what my friends and I were trying to create in the UK: a DIY queer feminist community of fanzines, music, art and culture. Discovering artefacts and experiences of riot grrrl across the UK was addictive. Simultaneously, making and researching contemporary DIY feminist culture enabled me to see the interconnections of the written word and music in riot grrrl and contemporary queer feminist culture. The written word, in many guises, as manifestos, lyrics, band names, fliers, posters, notebooks and fanzines, is an integral part of the musical moments of riot grrrl. Riot grrrl critiqued and used language in provocative ways to encourage viewers, readers and listeners to shift their subjectivity and take action. Music performances - fused with sound, affect, bodies, words - helped construct radical subjectivities and cultural acts. This connection between the written word and music in riot grrrl is the focus of this chapter, which addresses the following questions: What work did words do? What did music add to the written word?
