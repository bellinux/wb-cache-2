5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records.

5|$|Hampden {{hosted the}} 1960 European Cup Final; Real Madrid {{defeated}} 7–3 Eintracht Frankfurt with 130,000 people in attendance. Floodlights were installed at Hampden in 1961 and were inaugurated with a friendly match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers. The ground then also hosted the 1962 and 1966 finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup. The attendances {{for each of}} these finals was less than 50,000, and the SFA did not offer to host another European final until the 1976 European Cup Final, in which Bayern Munich defeated St Etienne. Until 1987, Hampden used square goalposts.

R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E

5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted {{to him as a}} reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be more reasonable to assume that he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E

At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they were not on the same level as The Last Story.

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant to look as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted {{over the top and}} one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of {{consciousness}} according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> efficacious. Karl Popper develops in the book The Self and Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E
