According to Kinberg, Berry had another scene in the film that was cut because of Berry's limited schedule.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs.

The {{original}} artist for the strip was Trevor Adams, who <b>was</b> with Least <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> for about six months.

The primary theme of the strip is sexuality, especially the promiscuity of the primary character, Rayne Summers, who is loosely based upon Sohmer himself.|$|R

500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to be myself. I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tismăneanu {{replied to}} some of Gallagher's accusations in a manner {{described}} by Cotidianuls Cristian Pătrășconiu as [...] "discreet". In an interview with Jurnalul Național, arguing that Marele șoc largely reflected Iliescu's own beliefs, which {{he had wanted to}} render accurately, and stating that [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to obtain the maximum of what can be obtained through dialog with [...] ". He depicted Gallagher's attitude as [...] "an outbreak of resentments", and indicated that [...] "the only praise I could offer [...] " [...] was in regard to the latter's respect for pluralism in front of authoritarianism. In later statements on the issue, he argued that Gallagher concerns about a supposed change in political views had been unfounded, while expressing regret over the fact that [...] "I had not highlighted [...] in those sections I authored, certain elements that would have made it clear for the reader where I stand". Elsewhere, he responded to claims made about his contacts with Becali by admitting that the visit was inappropriate. Cristian Vasile, who notes that concerns similar to those of Gallagher were expressed by historian Șerban Papacostea and by himself, argues that Tismăneanu effectively dissuaded fears of a [...] "moral resignation" [...] by not accepting any form of [...] "privilege or public post" [...] from the political sides he was alleged to favor.|$|E

2500|$|With Chappell again available, Hughes {{returned}} to the vice-captaincy for the 1981–82 Tests. Australia played Pakistan first in an ill-tempered three Test series; won by the Australians two Tests to one. Hughes started the series with a century (106) in the first Test in Perth and finished the series having scored 193 runs overall. The other touring side that summer were the West Indies, widely considered {{the best team in}} the world at that time and supported by a potent fast bowling attack. The first Test in the series was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both teams were critical of the pitch prepared at the MCG for the Test. [...] Australia were quickly reduced to 26/4 before Hughes started his effort to recover the Australian innings. Hughes decided to attack the West Indian bowling. In an interview later he said [...] "that to hang around and defend was going to be a waste of time...So I thought what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> try to play as many shots as possible." [...] When the ninth wicket fell, Hughes had made 71 and it appeared a century was out of reach. Hughes' remaining batting partner, Alderman, was a poor batsman; it had taken him nine matches to make his first first-class run. Alderman, despite telling Hughes that he didn't give himself much chance, managed to stay with Hughes long enough for Hughes to reach 100 runs. Hughes' innings was widely praised. West Indian Andy Roberts said [...] "He took up the challenge and it paid off for him. It was a great innings. You don't find one batsman playing that sort of innings on more than one occasion. That was just his day." [...] The Wisden 100, a ranking of the Top 100 Test Innings of all time, ranked that innings as number nine.|$|E
