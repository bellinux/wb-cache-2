5|$|Although {{they were}} pagan, the Hungarians {{demonstrated}} a tolerant attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church {{was the first}} to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince Géza (c.970–997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry. Géza also arranged the marriage of his son, Stephen, with Giselle of Bavaria, a princess <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of the Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E
5|$|Conrad of Abenberg came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of the Counts of Abenberg-Frensdorf, and {{had many}} {{distinguished}} relatives in Germany. He was born around 1075, son of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg. His mother {{was probably the}} daughter of Heinrich I, viscount of Regensburg. Conrad had two older brothers, Otto and Wolfram. He was raised for a clerical career at the court of the Emperor Henry IV, {{where he was a}} member of the court chapel. He became a canon in Hildesheim.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs {{five to seven years}} after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's lamba-wrapped remains <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E

William died after 1179 and was succeeded by his son, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who gained the favour of both King Richard I and King John and became a dominant force in the Welsh Marches during their reigns.|$|E

The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E

5|$|After {{realising}} {{that the}} Báthorys had little chance {{to seize the}} throne, Zamoyski decided to support another candidate, Sigismund Vasa. On Zamoyski's advice, the fourteen-year-old Sigismund Báthory was officially presented as the sole candidate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> (which demonstrated {{the existence of the}} Báthorys' claim to the throne), but Andrew cooperated with Zamoyski on behalf of Sigismund Vasa. Sigismund Vasa was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania on 19 August 1587. However, his opponents proclaimed Maximilian of Habsburg the ruler of the Commonwealth. Maximilian laid siege to Kraków and pillaged Miechów. Andrew persuaded Sigismund Báthory's advisors to send Transylvanian reinforcements to fight the invaders. Andrew was chosen to receive Sigismund Vasa in Kraków. He also attended the new king's coronation on 27 December 1587. The Sejm (or general assembly) granted citizenship to both Andrew and Balthasar Báthory.|$|E

When he was twelve years old, Aspinall gained a place at the Liverpool Institute in Mount Street, and was in the same class as Paul McCartney for English and Art lessons.|$|E
5|$|Cetotheriidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata). The first descriptions {{date back to the}} 1840s of bones and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the right whale, and was named Balaena marginata. In 1864, it was moved into the genus Caperea after a skull of another specimen was discovered. Six years later, the pygmy right whale was classified under the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the pygmy right whale is more genetically similar to rorquals and gray whales than to right whales. A study published in 2012, based on bone structure, moved the pygmy right whale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E
