We study the duration of crises by means of count data and hazard models while we study the intensity of the crisis by means of growth regressions. Our main finding suggest that fiscal expenditure has low power to shorten <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> but it might act as an effective instrument to smooth output-drops during crises. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to provide a {{detailed}} statistical overview of the time and regional distribution, relative timing occurrence of <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> and government changes in 51 economies over the 1990 – 2007 periods.

The result showed that the percentage of government changes is highest in transition economies (86 percent of observations) and lowest Latin American economies (39 percent of observations). The percentage of government changes are same in both developed and developing countries. However, average crises per year (frequency of crises) is higher (lower) in developing (developed) countries than developed (developing) countries. Also, the predictive power of <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> about the onset of a government change is highest in Transition economies (81 percent) and lowest in Latin American countries (30 percent).

40|$|Background: It is {{not well}} {{understood}} how <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> affect infectious disease incidence and prevalence, particularly among vulnerable groups. Using a susceptible-infected-recovered framework, we systematically reviewed literature {{on the impact of}} the <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> on infectious disease risks in migrants in Europe, focusing principally on HIV, TB, hepatitis and other STIs. Methods: We conducted two searches in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, websites of key organizations and grey literature to identify how economic changes affect migrant populations and infectious disease. We perform a narrative synthesis in order to map critical pathways and identify hypotheses for subsequent research. Results: The systematic review on links between <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> and migrant health identified 653 studies through database searching; only seven met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen items were identified through further searches. The systematic review on links between <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> and infectious disease identified 480 studies through database searching; 19 met the inclusion criteria. Eight items were identified through further searches. The reviews show that migrant populations in Europe appear disproportionately at risk of specific infectious diseases, and that <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> and subsequent responses have tended to exacerbate such risks. Recessions lead to unemployment, impoverishment and other risk factors that can be linked to the transmissibility of disease among migrants. Austerity measures that lead to cuts in prevention and treatment programmes further exacerbate infectious disease risks among migrants. Non-governmental health service providers occasionally stepped in to cater to specific populations that include migrants. Conclusions: There is evidence that migrants are especially vulnerable to infectious disease during <b>economic</b> <b>crises.</b> Ring-fenced funding of prevention programs, including screening and treatment, is important for addressing this vulnerability...|$|R

It discusses the temporary and permanent effects of <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> on the global market shares of tourism destinations through a series of potential transmission mechanisms based on the main economic competitiveness determinants identified in the literature. The proposed model explains the non-neutrality of economic shocks in tourism competitiveness. The model is tested on Spain's tourism industry, which is among the leaders of the global tourism sector, for the period 1970 – 2013 using non-linear econometric techniques. The empirical analysis confirms that the proposed model is appropriate for explaining the changes in the market positions caused by the <b>economic</b> <b>crises.</b> Financial support from project ECO 2011 – 29751 is acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the effect of <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> on {{democratic}} transition is contingent on economic structure. Specifically, a high level of state engagement in the economy makes social forces dependent on the ruling elites for patrimonial interests and, therefore, the authoritarian regime liable for economic failure. Moreover, when authoritarian elites own a high share of economic assets, this aggravates the economic loss of both the business class and the masses when <b>economic</b> <b>crises</b> occur, which in turn makes defection of the business class, the revolt of the masses and the alliance of the two social classes more likely.
