It was studied there by E. B. Ford, and later by P. M. Sheppard and their co-workers over many years. Data is available from 1939 to the present day, got by the usual field method of capture-mark-release-recapture and by genetic analysis from breeding in captivity. The records cover gene frequency and population size for much of the twentieth century. In this instance the genetics appears to be simple: two alleles at a single locus, producing the three phenotypes. Total captures over 26 years 1939-1964 came to 15,784 homozygous dominula (i.e. typica), 1,221 heterozygous medionigra and 28 homozygous bimacula.

Another example is the genetic polyrmorphism of larval developmental rates seen in the Phengaris rebeli, in which there exist slow-developing larvae (SDL) (75% of the total P. rebeli larval population) and fast-developing larvae (FDL) (25% of the total P. rebeli larvae population).

On the other hand, the FDL complete their growth the following spring after they are taken into the ant nest.|$|E
40|$|The {{mean and}} {{standard}} deviation of the first arrival time for a single mutant to reach a certain frequency and the mean age of a mutant persisting in a population have been studied using diffusion methods. These quantities are shown to be highly dependent on both the heterozygous effect and the population size. For partially recessive deleterious mutations, both the mean first arrival time and the mean age decrease with increasing selection coefficient against heterozygotes. For overdominant mutations, the mean age always increases very rapidly with increasing <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage,</b> while the mean first arrival time first increases rapidly with increasing <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> to a maximum and then decreases rapidly with increasing <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage.</b> The standard deviation of the first arrival time is small while that of the age is large.

40|$|The {{association}} of six quantitative traits related to fitness with heterozygosity at 12 allozyme loci has been examined in three populations of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris. Because of several characteristics of this organism and of this extensive data set, {{it appeared that}} this study would show a positive association between heterozygosity and these traits if indeed heterozygotes had higher values for these quantitative traits. Using several different statistical techniques including analysis of variance, regression with the scaling recommended from the adaptive distance model, and multiple regression, no evidence of an association was found. For example, only between 7 and 8 % of the regression tests were significant at the 5 % level and half of these showed a positive association and half showed a negative association. Further, the multiple regression analysis explained on average only 5. 8 % of the variation observed in the six different traits and only 1. 5 % of this variation was explained by a positive association. Power analysis was carried out (for {{the first time on}} these type of data), both for the single locus <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> and the {{association of}} individual multiple locus heterozygosity and the quantitative traits. For diameter and height, two traits often used in similar studies, the average power to detect a single locus <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> of 0. 10 was 0. 737 and the average power to detect a mean heterozygote advantage of 0. 05 per locus for multiple loci was 0. 797.

40|$|Background: The {{basidiomycete}} Pleurotus ostreatus is {{an efficient}} producer of laccases, {{a group of}} enzymes appreciated for their use in multiple industrial processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to reveal the molecular basis of the superiority of laccase production by dikaryotic strains compared to their parental monokaryons. Methodology/Principal Findings: We bred and studied a set of dikaryotic strains starting from a meiotic population of monokaryons. We then completely characterised the laccase allelic composition, the laccase gene expression and activity profiles in the dikaryotic strain N 001, in two of its meiotic full-sib monokaryons and in the dikaryon formed from their mating. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggested that the dikaryotic superiority observed in laccase activity was due to non-additive transcriptional increases in lacc 6 and lacc 10 genes. Furthermore, the expression of these genes was divergent in glucose- vs. lignocellulose-supplemented media and was highly correlated to the detected extracellular laccase activity. Moreover, the expression profile of lacc 2 in the dikaryotic strains was affected by its allelic composition, indicating a putative single locus <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cystic Fibrosis is a {{pleiotropic}} {{disease in}} humans with primary {{morbidity and mortality}} associated with a lung disease phenotype. However, knockout in the mouse of cftr, the gene whose mutant alleles are responsible for cystic fibrosis, has previously failed to produce a readily, quantifiable lung phenotype. Results Using measurements of pulmonary mechanics, a definitive lung phenotype was demonstrated in the cftr -/- mouse. Lungs showed decreased compliance and increased airway resistance in young animals as compared to cftr +/+ littermates. These changes were noted in animals less than 60 days old, prior to any long term inflammatory effects that might occur, and are consistent with structural differences in the cftr -/- lungs. Surprisingly, the cftr +/- animals exhibited a lung phenotype distinct from either the homozygous normal or knockout genotypes. The heterozygous mice showed increased lung compliance and decreased airway resistance when compared to either homozygous phenotype, suggesting a <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> that might explain the high frequency of this mutation in certain populations. Conclusions In the mouse the gene dosage of cftr results in distinct differences in pulmonary mechanics of the adult.

40|$|We {{have tested}} the {{importance}} of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIB in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for survival after challenge with a highly virulent bacterial pathogen. Forty juvenile full siblings from each of 120 families were infected with the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida, which causes high mortality in salmon due to furunculosis. Fishes from high-resistance (HR, 80 % mortality) families were screened for their MHC class IIB genotypes using the {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) technique. The exon 2 sequences, encoding the major part of the peptide-binding region, were established far each DGGE fragment. One allele, e, containing a missense single base substitution was significantly more prevalent in HR families than in LR families. An odds-ratio test showed that broods carrying this allele had a 12 -fold higher chance of being HR than broods without the e allele. A second allele, i, showed significantly higher frequencies in uninfected and surviving individuals than in infected dead individuals. A third allele, j, tended to be more prevalent both in LR families and in individuals that had died of the infection. There was no correlation between MHC heterozygosity and resistance to A. salmonicida.

In this context of rapid environmental changes, improving our knowledge on the interaction between ecology and evolution is critical. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of an immunocompetence gene, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIβ, on the pathogen infection levels in wild Atlantic salmon populations, Salmo salar, and identify selective agents involved in contemporary coevolution. MHC variability and bacterial infection rate were determined throughout the summer in juvenile salmon from six rivers belonging to different genetic and ecological regions in Québec, Canada. A total of 13 different pathogens were identified in kidney by DNA sequence analysis, including a predominant myxozoa, most probably recently introduced in North America. Infection rates were the highest in southern rivers at the beginning of the summer (average 47. 6 ± 6. 3 % infected fish). One MHC allele conferred a 2. 9 times greater chance of being resistant to myxozoa, while another allele increased susceptibility by 3. 4 times. The decrease in frequency of the susceptibility allele but not other MHC or microsatellite alleles during summer was suggestive of a mortality event from myxozoa infection. These results supported the hypothesis of pathogen-driven selection in the wild by means of frequency-dependent selection or change in selection through time and space rather than <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage,</b> and underline the importance of MHC standing genetic variation for facing pathogens in a changing environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} polymorphism among MHC class II promoters in man and mouse is here reviewed, mainly {{in terms of}} the hypothesis of differential expression. The hypothesis proposes that differences between antigen-presenting cells in MHC class II expression exert a co-dominant effect on the Th 1 -Th 2 cytokine balance, such that class II molecules of one type come to control to a greater extent the production of one group of cytokines, and those of another type the production of the alternative group. The survey deals with the influence of signal strength and antigen-presenting cell type on T-cell subset differentiation; functional differences between MHC class II molecules not obviously related to determinant selection; disease protection mediated by HLA alleles; mechanisms possibly responsible for allotypic and isotypic bias; overdominance (<b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage)</b> in selection for expression of class II alleles; MHC class II promoter structure and function; inter-locus and inter-allele variability within human MHC class II gene upstream regulatory regions; a comparison of these polymorphisms in mouse and man; read-out of class II promoter function; and a comparison with expression of MHC class I. We conclude that the evidence that this variation is functionally active (i. e. controls expression) is increasing, but is not yet compelling.

40|$|Heterozygote advantage, or overdominance, {{remains a}} popular and persuasive {{explanation}} {{for the maintenance of}} genetic variation in natural populations in the face of selection. However, despite being first proposed more than 80 years ago, there remain few examples that fit the criteria for heterozygote advantage, all of which are associated with disease resistance and are maintained only in the presence of disease or other gene-by-environment interaction. Here we report five new examples of heterozygote advantage, based around polymorphisms in the BMP 15 and GDF 9 genes that affect female fecundity in domesticated sheep and are not reliant on disease for their maintenance. Five separate mutations in these members of the transforming growth factor b (TGFb) superfamily give phenotypes with fitness differentials characteristic of <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage.</b> In each case, one copy of the mutant allele increases ovulation rate, and ultimately litter size per ewe lambing, relative to the wildtype. However, homozygous ewes inheriting mutant alleles from both parents have impaired oocyte development and maturation, which results in small undeveloped ovaries and infertility. Using data collected over many years on ovulation rates, litter size, and lambing rates, we have calculated the equilibrium solution for each of these polymorphisms using standard population genetic theory. The predicted equilibrium frequencies obtained for these mutant alleles range from 0. 11 to 0. 23, which are amongst the highest yet reported for a polymorphism maintained by heterozygote advantage. These are amongst the most frequent and compelling examples of heterozygote advantage yet described and the first documented examples of heterozygote advantage that are not reliant on a disease interaction for their maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Since recent {{assessments}} of genetic risks from radiation {{have concentrated on}} harmful dominant effects, a quantitative assessment of risks from recessives is needed. Presumably, harmful recessives can arise at all loci coding for essential proteins (perhaps 10 000), but mutation to dominant alleles {{is likely to be}} a property of relatively few loci. While many recessives doubtless remain to be discovered, those known at present tend to have earlier and more severe effects than dominants. Induced recessive mutations can cause harm by partnership with a defective allele already established in the population; partnership with another recessive mutation induced at the same locus; the formation of homozygous descendants, that is, identity by descent; and heterozygous effects. Calculations based on a combination of data from observations on human populations and from mouse experiments suggest that an extra genetically significant dose of 1 cGy (centiGray, equivalent to 1 rad) X or gamma irradiation received by each parent in a stable population with a million liveborn offspring would induce up to 1200 extra recessive mutations. From partnership effects, about one extra case of recessive disease would be expected in the following 10 generations. Homozygosity resulting from identity by descent could not normally occur until the fourth generation after exposure but, on certain assumptions, about ten extra cases of recessive disease would be expected from this cause by the tenth generation. In the same period, about 250 recessive alleles would be eliminated in heterozygotes (that is, Muller's 'genetic deaths') given 2. 5 % heterozygous disadvantage. These deleterious heterozygous effects should not be combined with those of dominants, as has been done in some previous risk estimates. It is considered unlikely that many radiation induced recessives would show <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage.</b> Certain dominants (combined frequently at least 10 (- 3)) should be excluded from calculations of mutational risk because they are unlikely to be maintained by mutation...|$|E
40|$|Congenital tooth {{agenesis}} is {{the most}} common developmental anomaly in man. More severe forms of tooth agenesis (> 5 missing teeth) demand lengthy and expensive treatment approaches such as bone augmentation surgeries and placement of multiple implants. Tooth agenesis is caused by mutations in genes responsible for early tooth development; and ever since it had been shown that timely injections of functional recombinant gene products can overcome the corresponding, mutation-based developmental disorder, such new therapeutic strategies for the prevention of tooth agenesis should be attempted. In this research project I have pursued two objectives: 1.) Basic research into the molecular genetics and therapeutics of the tooth agenesis gene PAX 9. Since PAX 9 is an intra-cellular transcription factor which cannot be replaced directly, suitable downstream targets for therapy have to be identified by comparing wild type and Pax 9 deficient tooth organs. 2.) Clinically oriented research into the molecular diagnostics of human tooth agenesis. We use candidate gene sequencing in large numbers of people with tooth agenesis to identify the majority of human tooth agenesis genes and to determine the molecular cause of tooth agenesis in individuals. In the first study I identify the genes and pathways that are affected by Pax 9 deficiency using microarray and q-PCR technology, and find that the Fgf, Shh and Wnt pathways are more affected than Bmp 4 which had previously been considered the main target of Pax 9 in tooth development. The next study shows {{that it is possible to}} apply therapeutic approaches to unravel the complexity of molecular signaling within the developing craniofacial complex. Using small molecule Wnt therapies we are able to rescue palatal clefting in Pax 9 -deficient mice. Our third study presents a clinical aspect of human molecular genetics where we establish that tooth agenesis does not predispose women to ovarian cancer, as had been previously suggested. The last study shows that mutations in WNT 10 A, but not in WNT 10 B or WNT 6, are highly prevalent in populations with tooth agenesis. We also suggest that there must be some kind of <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> to retaining mutations in Wnt 10 a. However, that advantage has not been identified...|$|E
40|$|UNLABELLED: THE BACKGROUND: Ribonuclease L (RNASEL), {{encoding}} the 2 '- 5 '-oligoadenylate (2 - 5 A) -dependent RNase L, is a {{key enzyme}} in the interferon induced antiviral and anti-proliferate pathway. Mutations in RNASEL segregate with the disease in prostate cancer families and specific genotypes are {{associated with an increased}} risk of prostate cancer. Infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major risk factor for uterine cervix cancer and for a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HPV, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and sequences from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) have been detected in breast tumors, and the presence of integrated SV 40 T/t antigen in breast carcinomas correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. A genetic predisposition could explain why some viral infections persist and induce cancer, while others disappear spontaneously. This points at RNASEL as a strong susceptibility gene. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate the implication of an abnormal activity of RNase L in the onset and development of viral induced cancers, the study was initiated by searching for germline mutations in patients diagnosed with uterine cervix cancer. The rationale behind is that close to 100 % of the cervix cancer patients have a persistent HPV infection, and if a defective RNase L were responsible for the lack of ability to clear the HPV infection, we would expect to find a wide spectrum of mutations in these patients, leading to a decreased RNase L activity. The HPV genotype was established in tumor DNA from 42 patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix and somatic tissue from these patients was analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of all coding and regulatory regions of RNASEL. Fifteen mutations, including still uncharacterized, were identified. The genotype frequencies of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) established in the cervix cancer patients were compared between 382 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), 199 patients with primary unilateral breast cancer and 502 healthy Danish control individuals. We found that the genotype frequencies of only one of the 15 mutations, the yet uncharacterized 5 'UTR mutation rs 3738579 differed significantly between cancer patients and control individuals (P-value: 4. 43 x 10 (- 5)). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, we have discovered an increased risk, a <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> and thereby a protective effect linked to the RNASEL SNP rs 3738579. This effect is found for patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix, HNSCC, and breast cancer thus pointing at RNASEL as a general marker for cancer risk and not restricted to familial prostate cancer...|$|E

Treatment with sorafenib is associated with high inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetic exposures, efficacy and toxicity.

In addition, we examined the impact of pharmacogenetic variation in VEGFR 2, an important mediator of the VEGF pathway, on risk of prostate cancer. To support these investigations, (mainly single-dose) pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic, efficacy and toxicity information were collected from patients with solid tumors, enrolled in five phase I / II clinical trials at National Cancer Institute. Non-compartmental analysis-general linear modeling (NCA-GLM), population pharmacokinetic analysis and several correlative studies were performed to characterize the sources of variability in pharmacokinetics and response. The role of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and ex-vivo anti-angiogenic activity as efficacy markers was evaluated, respectively, for patients with prostate cancer treated with sorafenib and patients with solid tumors treated with combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab. Sweat concentrations of sorafenib were measured to study its association with development of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR). Only body weight was a significant covariate for volume of distribution by population pharmacokinetic analysis, while BSA, albumin and UGT 1 A 9 * 3 appeared to be significant by NCA-GLM. However, the contribution of these covariates in overall exposure variability was very small; hence, these were considered clinically irrelevant. The association of sorafenib exposure with efficacy in patients with prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and combined solid tumors were not significant; exposure-efficacy relationship for lung cancer patients requires further evaluation. Sorafenib exposures appeared to be associated with incidences of rash in single agent trials and with HFSR in trials involving treatment with sorafenib and bevacizumab combination. In-vitro cell-line experiments determined that prostate specific antigen (PSA) is not a suitable marker of efficacy in patients with prostate cancer treated with sorafenib. The ex-vivo anti-angiogenic activity, measured by rat-aortic ring assay using patient serum samples, appeared to be not associated with clinical response. Sorafenib concentration in sweat, upto ≥ 5 ng/mL, apparently was not associated with HFSR. The VEGFR 2 H 472 Q polymorphism was associated with progression-free survival (PFS) (with an apparent <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> for survival) and toxicities in patients treated with drugs against the VEGF pathway. Patients who developed hypertension and HFSR on bevacizumab and sorafenib therapy, respectively, appeared to have longer PFS. Therefore, these side effects should be effectively managed to avoid/delay the treatment discontinuation. The VEGFR 2 H 472 Q and V 297 I genotype were not predictive of risk of prostate cancer in Caucasian subjects...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from NPG at [URL] association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This region encodes {{a large number of}} immunological candidates, including the antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules 1. Studies in IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the architecture of association and causal alleles 2, 3. To address this, we performed high-density SNP typing of the MHC in > 32, 000 individuals with IBD, implicating multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB 1 * 01 : 03 in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the pathogenesis of IBD.

40|$|The thistle Cirsium palustre exists {{over most}} of lowland Britain as a {{predominantly}} purple flowered species. However the populations of seacliffs and mountains exhibit a flower colour polymorphism, occurring as homozygous white morphs, homozygous and heterozygous intermediate morphs, and homozygous and heterozygous purple morphs. The degree of polymorphism of the seacliff populations of the Gower Peninsula is correlated with population size, the larger populations being less polymorphic. This might be interpreted as indicating chance fixation of the white alleles. Such an explanation would gain support from the very small size of the more polymorphic populations and from the drastic fluctuations in population size which have been demonstrated as having occurred in these populations {{over a period of}} four consecutive seasons. However other explanations based on selective effects are possible. On seacliffs the frequency of the white morphs is inversely related to exposure, and decreases in population size are accompanied by differential survival of the purple morphs. On mountains the distribution of the polymorphism is markedly correlated with altitude. For the mountains of southern Mid Wales, populations below 1000 ft. are strongly monomorphic purple. Above 1000 ft. the degree of polymorphism increases abruptly, with white frequencies reaching over 80 %. Morph frequencies among North Wales populations bear a similar relation to altitude but the increase in polymorphism occurs at about 1200 ft. In each case the general trend is that purple frequency declines with increase in white frequency, and that the frequency of intermediates shows a unimodal distribution with a quite precise peak. For both sets of populations this peak occurs at an altitude about 250 ft. higher than that at which the increase in white frequency occurs. It is possible that the occurrence of the polymorphism on seacliffs and mountains may be related to a limitation of cross pollination consequent upon the exposure of seacliffs and the combined climatic characteristics of mountains, which include increase in exposure, mist and rain and decrease in temperature. Evidence on the levels of outbreeding in these populations was inconclusive but evidence in other species suggested that pollination might indeed be limited in these conditions. An increase in homozygosity consequent upon inbreeding would promote the frequency of the white morphs. Moreover the white morphs were subject to preferential pollination and both this and certain forms of heterogeneity in morph distribution were likely to promote the frequency of inbreeding among white morphs. However in conditions of limited pollination the degree of general outbreeding of the white morphs will be increased by preferential pollination and this may be assumed to be a fitness advantage which may be of particular importance in the maintenance of the polymorphism. In addition {{it is likely that the}} presence of white morphs within a population may result in the attraction of higher numbers of pollinators or encourage foraging for longer periods in which case the polymorphism may be said to be adaptive in the sense of Fisher (1930). Other selective effects are also apparent. The occasional presence of highly polymorphic populations in valley bases and the regular occurrence of predominantly purple populations in mountain forests may both to some extent provide evidence for an effect of temperature other than upon pollination. Some evidence suggests that both exposure and moisture may also be of individual importance. Selection was apparent even by the arrangement of morph types within a population subject to no obvious environmental heterogeneity. It is possible that the polymorphism is maintained by a physiological <b>heterozygous</b> <b>advantage</b> and that this may be responsible for the maintenance of white and intermediate morphs in low frequency in the predominantly purple populations of inland lowland regions. The maintenance of the polymorphism imposed a significant selective mortality upon the species. This was indicated by the above instance of selection within a uniform community and also in several instances in which intrapopulational selection occurred between segments of population subject to differing exposure. However the growth in cultivation of seeds set in natural populations revealed that the complexity of the genetic system was sufficient to allow widely different morph frequencies to be maintained in different populations without the necessity of high selection in each generation. </p...|$|E
