40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> models of practice learning has been utilised within one Scottish university's undergraduate nursing programmes since 2011. Early {{findings suggest that}} generally, students exhibit a greater depth of understanding when the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> model is incorporated into practice learning (Roxburgh, Conlon <b>and</b> Banks, 2012). <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> models of practice learning can present {{in a variety of}} forms but overall the approach has become generally accepted in nurse education as a 'value added' model to learning as they provide the opportunity for deeper student learning experiences that also enhance a person centred approach to nursing care. However, the quality of the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> models can become easily distilled. Reasons can include organisational and capacity issues of the institution and the placement provider. In addition, restrictions of placement areas, regulatory requirements and curriculum demands can all result in a very much reduced version of the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> model. If this occurs, the practice learning experience can then become easily compressed into short, disjointed and disconnected learning experiences that prioritise the administrative and curricular demands of the programme over the quality of the student learning. Thus, the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> approach requires further exploration to supply robust evidence which ensures only quality interpretations of the model are available. This mixed method case study approach aims to explore the student experience of <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> learning by deconstructing the model to identify which characteristics best benefit the student's learning. This means specifically studying the component parts of the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> model that impacted on three distinct areas: 1. The students ability to connect with the person rather than the patient 2. Connection with the family of that person and in turn the wider community 3. Security in the students' own learning process The aim of this research is to identify and uncover the core characteristics of the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spoke</b> model that best enhances, supports and develops student learning in practice.

50|$|Victor Cha {{explains}} {{the reason for}} the US’s choice for a bilateral structure with the powerplay theory. The underlying idea came from the Domino Theory - that if one nation falls into communism others will follow. He defines powerplay as 'the construction of an asymmetric alliance designed to exert maximum control over the smaller allies in the region that might engage in aggressive behavior against adversaries that could entrap the United States into an unwanted war.' In other words, the <b>hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>spokes</b> system allowed the United States to not only contain the Soviet threat but also have exclusive power over the East Asia. With this system the US would be able to control of the rogue allies (rogue state) - anticommunist dictators who might start wars for reasons for domestic legitimacy (political) of their own regime. The US had a fear that it may be entrapped in an unwanted war, thus needed a way to contain these rogue allies. An example of a rogue ally is Syngman Rhee of South Korea. Due to his ambitions to unify the Korean peninsula, the treaty would contain his adventurism. Another is Chiang Kai-Shek. His ambition to overtake mainland China heightened the fear of entrapment to the US.|$|E
5000|$|Choosing {{multilateralism}} {{means there}} is a coordinated approach in foreign policies with several countries rather than a single one. To Choose bilateralism means that foreign policies of a country are not coordinated with other countries and/or that engage with another single country. Multilateralism, by contrast, involves both the coordination of policy among three or more states and coordination around a series of generalized principles of conduct. Victor Cha argues that: power asymmetries [...] "select" [...] {{for the type of}} structures, bilateral or multilateral, that offer the most control. If small powers try to control a larger one, then multilateralism is effective. But if great powers seek control over smaller ones, bilateral alliances are more effective.Thus, this decision to select bilateralism or multilateralism when enacting foreign policies would be greatly affected by its size of power {{and the power of the}} country which it seeks to have control over. Take the example of Foreign Policy of the United States, there are a large number of references discussing how the United States chose to interact with its alliances. Among them in particular, the United States chose multilateralism in Europe and decided form NATO, while it formed bilateral alliances, or the <b>Hub</b> <b>and</b> <b>spokes</b> architecture in East Asia. Although there are many arguments about the reason why the United States decided to do so, Victor Cha's [...] "powerplay" [...] theory provides a possible reason. Victor Cha argues that: ...postwar U.S planners had to contend with a region uniquely constituted of potential rogue allies, through their aggressive behavior, could potentially entrap the United States in an unwanted wider war in Asia. ... To avoid this outcome, the United States created a series of tight, deep bilateral alliances with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan through which it could exercise maximum control and prevent unilateral aggression. Furthermore, it did not seek to make these bilateral alliances multilateral, because it wanted to amplify U.S. control and minimize any collusion among its partners.|$|E
