Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album.

[...] Empty Clip Studios was brought onto the project in order to port {{the game to}} the RapidFire engine, so that the game could be release on the PlayStation 3, but the port was never finished. In order to publish the game on Xbox Live, Schatz partnered with video game publishing company Majesco Entertainment. As a result, the game had to be ported from Empty Clip to the RapidFire engine.

When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards <b>got</b> <b>the</b> mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order.

2500|$|Dorothy Fields had {{the idea}} for a musical about Annie Oakley, to star her friend, Ethel Merman. Producer Mike Todd turned the project down, so Fields {{approached}} a new producing team, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. After the success of their first musical collaboration, Oklahoma!, Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors. They agreed to produce the musical and asked Jerome Kern to compose the music; Fields would write the lyrics, and she and her brother Herbert would write the book. Kern, who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood, returned to New York on November 2, 1945 to begin work on the score to Annie Get Your Gun, but three days later, he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Kern was hospitalized, and he died on November 11, 1945. The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical's score; Fields agreed to step down as lyricist, knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs. Berlin initially declined to write the score, worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in [...] "a situation show." [...] Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it, and within days, Berlin returned with the songs [...] "Doin' What Comes Naturally", [...] "You Can't Get a Man With a Gun", and [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business". Berlin's songs suited the story and Ethel Merman's abilities, and he readily composed the rest of the score to Annie Get Your Gun. The show's eventual hit song, [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business," [...] was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Richard Rodgers did not like it.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis examines the alleged assurances made to Moscow during German unification discussions in 1989 - 1990. Specifically, Moscow alleges that Western governments offered assurances to the Soviet Union that NATO would not expand beyond its then current borders if Moscow {{agreed to allow}} a unified Germany to join NATO as a full member.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1979 I taped a number of fairy-tales and stories in the northeastern corner of Mansiland {{in the village of}} Sukerya. As I had no {{experience}} whatsoever of transcribing texts at that time, I asked a student of the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute, Klavdia Sainakhova, who was in her homevillage at that time, to transcribe some of the more interesting stories so I could later translate them. I gave the tapes to the Archive, but the story of a strange hand with a bell stayed in my mind. Who was that strange Hand With a Bell who troubled the sister while the brother was hunting? I know that in Mansi stories the hero is often depicted by some characteristic feature or sign that within a cultural group should be enough to indentify him. For example in that same year, 1979, I collected a story, the main characters of which were Lungs - khopsi. I was explained that they are to be taken as a thin person perspiring in the sun. But about the Hand with a bell nobody could or wanted to say anything. While translating <b>the</b> story I <b>got</b> at first <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> it depicts <b>the</b> relationship between two different groups. The sister, who belongs to the mos'- moiety, sits at home and sews good thing of sable, waiting for a suitor. Then comes a man who is symbolized by a hand with a bell and shows that the sister had timed to stop taking care of her brother. But the brother does not want to give up his sister, hides himself and chops off the suitor's hand. This is followed by revenge from the Hand with a bell or his relatives. The chain of actions is started by the brother that broke the unwritten law. In the folklore of {{the nations of the world}} it is common that the plot of a fairy-tale or legend is concentrated around marrying, often taking the hero either to faraway lands or the supernatural world. From these we can feel the world conception of small tribes of exogamously related hunter cultures where in the central position were all kinds of problems connected with taking a wife. Often the destiny of the whole tribe depended upon a successful betrothal. But often the hero looking for a spouse is not a mortal man but some supernatural being. In that case the story is taking place in the mythical creation times and in some way influences the future world order...|$|R
