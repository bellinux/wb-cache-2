5|$|Upon his {{accession}} Chamberlain considered {{calling a}} general election, but with {{three and a}} half years remaining of the then current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election, and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> position.|$|E
5|$|As a newly {{inducted}} {{member of}} the Scions, the player follows Thancred to Thanalan to investigate abductions and the theft of crystals along trade routes in the area. The culprits {{are members of the}} Amalj'aa beast tribe who capture the adventurer to be sacrificed to their primal god, Ifrit. The attempt fails as the Echo protects the player from Ifrit's brainwashing. The adventurer counters by defeating Ifrit and is hailed as a hero, with emissaries from all three Grand Companies <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> the privilege of recruiting said hero. While attending rallies at each of the three cities honoring the memory of those fallen at Carteneau, the player meets the twins Alphinaud and Alisaie who question the purpose of such nationalist displays. The adventurer's next mission is to forge relations with the Sylphs of the Black Shroud, a peaceful beast tribe whose radical sect once summoned Ramuh to defend the forest from Garlean incursion. While searching for the Sylph elder, the player encounters Lahabrea for the first time—an immortal Ascian bent on destroying the Mothercrystal. The Scions, Thancred in particular, resolve to investigate this new foe.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these player versus environment (PvE) challenges, two forms of player versus player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The first type, the Wolves' Den, is an arena featuring structured four-versus-four battles; players may queue into a battle with up to three teammates to challenge another four-person team. The second type, Frontlines, is a large battleground instance in which players form teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are delineated by players' allegiance {{to one of three}} Grand Companies and the team which reaches the target number of points first wins the match. Four modes are available with differing locations and rulesets, such as King of the Hill, capture the flag, and team deathmatch. Within the fiction, Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.|$|E

Columbus' discovery in 1492 upset the unstable relations between the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile, whose <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> possession of colonial territories along the African coast had for many years been regulated by the papal bulls of 1455, 1456, and 1479. Alexander VI responded with three bulls, dated May 3 and 4, which were highly favorable to Castile; the third Inter caetera (1493), awarded Spain the sole right to colonize most of the New World.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was time}} for him to choose an heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, Zhu Gaoxu. Zhu Gaoxu had an athletic-warrior {{personality}} which contrasted sharply with his elder brother's intellectual and humanitarian nature. Despite much counsel from his advisers, the Yongle Emperor chose his older son, Zhu Gaozhi (the future Hongxi Emperor), as his heir apparent mainly due to advice from Xie Jin. As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated and refused to give up <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> his father's favour and refusing to move to Yunnan Province, where his princedom was located.

500|$|Following the {{dominion}} government, {{in which}} Andros oversaw {{all of the}} colonies, {{there was a good}} bit of jealousy, border disputes, and <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> position between the new governors of the various colonies, and Phips seems to have done as much to inflame these jealousies as to work past them. Phips expressed outrage at the execution of Leisler and harbored enemies of Fletcher and the New York government that replaced Leisler. Phips' ongoing struggles with Usher in New Hampshire continued as before. (In 1695, following Phips' death, Bellomont was placed over Fletcher, Usher, and Stoughton, suggesting Whitehall was unimpressed by the bickering of the three provinces, and unswayed by the particular merits of any of their arguments. Bellomont ordered a posthumous pardon of Leisler.) ...|$|E
500|$|Alphinaud {{inquires}} {{about the}} cause of riots among Ala Mhigan refugees in Ul'dah and uncovers the agents of Teledji Adeledji, an influential member of Ul'dah's ruling Syndicate. Raubahn speculates that Adeledji is <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> control of Allagan artifacts discovered at the Carteneau ruins, including remnants of the Omega Weapon. In the Black Shroud, the Sylphs summon Ramuh who judges the Warrior of Light as a worthy savior of the realm, departing amicably. Meanwhile, Alphinaud establishes the Crystal Braves {{to act as a}} neutral police force for Eorzea. Their first task is to investigate the [...] "Ivy", a Garlean spy who has infiltrated the Immortal Flames' leadership. On another front, Ser Aymeric of the Temple Knights of Ishgard reaches out to the Scions and Braves in an unprecedented move to ask for their aid in monitoring the Keeper of the Lake—the wreckage of a Garlean airship intertwined with the corpse of Midgardsormr, the dragon king who repelled the first Garlean invasion twenty years previous. In exchange, the Temple Knights agree to safeguard supply shipments to Revenant's Toll which had been harried by heretics following Lady Iceheart, an Ishgardian deserter who plans to summon Saint Shiva in aid of the dragons. Iceheart evades capture within the tunnels of Snowcloak, a labyrinth of icy passages that block access to the Coerthas Western Highlands.|$|E
500|$|From {{the early}} days of the Muslim conquests, Arab armies were divided into regiments drawn from {{individual}} tribes or tribal confederations (butun or ‘asha‘ir). Despite the fact that many of these groupings were recent creations, created for reasons of military efficiency rather than any common ancestry, they soon developed a strong and distinct identity. Eventually, and certainly by the beginning of the Umayyad period, this system progressed to the formation of ever-larger super-groupings, culminating in the two super-groups: the northern Arab Mudaris or Qaysis, and the south Arabs or [...] "Yemenis" [...] (Yaman), dominated by the Azd and Rabi'ah tribes. By the 8th century, this division had become firmly established across the Caliphate and was a source of constant internal instability, as the two groups formed in essence two rival political parties, <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> power and separated by a fierce hatred for each other. During Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik's reign, the Umayyad government appointed Mudaris as governors in Khurasan, except for Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri's tenure in 735–738. Nasr's appointment came four months after Asad's death. In the interim, the sources report variously that the province was run either by the Syrian general Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani or by Asad's lieutenant Juday' al-Kirmani. At any rate, the sources agree that al-Kirmani stood at the time as the most prominent man in Khurasan and should have been the clear choice for governor. His Yemeni roots (he was the leader of the Azd in Khurasan), however, made him unpalatable to the Caliph.|$|E

500|$|By early 2014, {{the lack}} of a clear {{mainstream}} Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters, donors, and pollsters to suggest Romney stage a third run. Regarding such a possibility, Romney at first responded, [...] "Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no." [...] Nevertheless, speculation continued: the continuing unpopularity of Obama led to buyer's remorse among some voters; the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine made Romney's [...] "No. 1 geopolitical foe" [...] remark look prescient; and an August 2014 poll of Iowan Republicans showed Romney with a large lead there over other potential 2016 candidates. A poll conducted in July 2014 by CNN showed Romney with a 53 to 44 lead over Obama in a hypothetical election [...] "redo." [...] By early 2015, Romney was actively considering the idea and contacting his network of supporters. [...] In doing so he was positioning himself in the invisible primary – the preliminary <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> the backing of party leaders, donors, and political operatives – against former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who had already set a likely campaign in motion and would be a rival to Romney for establishment Republican support. Despite support in some quarters for a third bid for the presidency, there was a backlash against him from conservatives who wanted a fresher face without a history of presidential losses, and many of Romney's past donors were not willing to commit to him again. Romney announced on January 30, 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016, saying that while he thought he could win the nomination, [...] "one of our next generation of Republican leaders" [...] would be better positioned to win the general election.|$|E

Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making.

2500|$|By the 1570s, both Kotte and Kandy were <b>jockeying</b> <b>for</b> his support. King Dharmapala of Kotte {{was most}} active. He {{presented}} who {{he said was}} his daughter to Bayinnaung. The princess was received with great fanfare at Bassein (Pathein) on 24 September 1573. According to G.E. Harvey, however, the Kotte king's action was not voluntary: the Burmese king had demanded a princess to fulfill a prophecy given by his astrologers, and Dharmapala, who had no daughters, complied by sending {{the daughter of a}} chamberlain, whom he had treated as his own. At any rate, Dharmapala, who had converted to Catholicism, continued to curry favor by sending what he claimed was the real Tooth relic, ostensibly to be safeguarded under the protection of the great Buddhist king. The main purpose of his mission was to seek military help against a rebellion. The Tooth was received on 14 July 1576. While it is unclear whether Bayinnaung actually believed in the authenticity of the relic, the possession of a holy Tooth, which many millions of subjects believed in, was of the highest importance. In return, Bayinnaung sent 2500 of his best [...] "invulnerables" [...] {{from all parts of the}} empire in five ships to Columbo. The king's best troops easily defeated the rebellion, which was noticed by the other three rulers on the island. Chronicles say that the Burmese generals then received the rulers of the four kingdoms of Ceylon in Columbo, and instructed to safeguard the religion. King Karaliyadde Bandara of Kandy, offered a daughter and what he claimed was the real Tooth. But His Majesty, seeing no reason to reopen the case, would not enter into controversy with skeptics and dismissed them with thanks.|$|E
